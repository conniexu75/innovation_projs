https://openalex.org/W2120837197,"A novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family, designated TRANCE, was cloned during a search for apoptosis-regulatory genes using a somatic cell genetic approach in T cell hybridomas. The TRANCEgene encodes a type II membrane protein of 316 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35 kDa. Its extracellular domain is most closely related to TRAIL, FasL, and TNF. TRANCE is an immediate early gene up-regulated by TCR stimulation and is controlled by calcineurin-regulated transcription factors. TRANCE is most highly expressed in thymus and lymph nodes but not in nonlymphoid tissues and is abundantly expressed in T cells but not in B cells. Cross-hybridization of the mouse cDNA to a human thymus library yielded the human homolog, which encodes a protein 83% identical to the mouse ectodomain. HumanTRANCE was mapped to chromosome 13q14 while mouseTRANCE was located to the portion of mouse chromosome 14 syntenic with human chromosome 13q14. A recombinant soluble form of TRANCE composed of the entire ectodomain induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in T cells but not in splenic B cells or in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. These results suggest a role for this TNF-related ligand in the regulation of the T cell-dependent immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1969894269,"The 26 S proteasome is the central protease involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation and fulfills vital regulatory functions in eukaryotes. The proteolytic core of the complex is the 20 S proteasome, a cylindrical particle with two outer rings each made of 7 different α-type subunits and two inner rings made of 7 different β-type subunits. In the archaebacterial 20 S proteasome ancestor proteolytically active sites reside in the 14 uniform β-subunits. Their N-terminal threonine residues, released by precursor processing, perform the nucleophilic attack for peptide bond hydrolysis. By directed mutational analysis of 20 S proteasomal β-type proteins of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we identified three active site-carrying subunits responsible for different peptidolytic activities as follows: Pre3 for post-glutamyl hydrolyzing, Pup1 for trypsin-like, and Pre2 for chymotrypsin-like activity. Double mutants harboring only trypsin-like or chymotrypsin-like activity were viable. Mutation of two potentially active site threonine residues in the Pre4 subunit excluded its catalytic involvement in any of the three peptidase activities. The generation of different, incompletely processed forms of the Pre4 precursor in active site mutants suggested that maturation of non-active proteasomal β-type subunits is exerted by active subunits and occurs in the fully assembled particle. This<i>trans</i>-acting proteolytic activity might also account for processing intermediates of the active site mutated Pre2 subunit, which was unable to undergo autocatalytic maturation."

Despite its efficacy, the molecular mechanism underlying its action has not been elucidated. One recent study has proposed that lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 and thereby affects multiple cellular functions. Because glycogen synthase kinase-3 regulates the phosphorylation of tau (microtubule-binding protein that forms paired helical filaments in neurons of the Alzheimer's disease brain), we hypothesized that lithium could affect tau phosphorylation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3. Using cultured human NT2N neurons, we demonstrate that lithium reduces the phosphorylation of tau, enhances the binding of tau to microtubules, and promotes microtubule assembly through direct and reversible inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3. These results provide new insights into how lithium mediates its effects in the central nervous system, and these findings could be exploited to develop a novel intervention for Alzheimer's disease.

Paired helical filaments are the major building blocks of neurofibrillary lesions in Alzheimer's disease brains. Paired helical filaments are composed of hyperphosphorylated central nervous system tau protein (1Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otvos Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Predominantly expressed in axons, tau is a group of microtubule-associated proteins that normally promote and stabilize the assembly of microtubules (4Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 5Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Paired helical filament-tau differs from normal tau by its abnormal hyperphosphorylation, which results in the decreased tau binding to microtubules. It has been shown that paired helical filament-tau does not bind to microtubules unless it is enzymatically dephosphorylated (7Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 8Yoshida H. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1183-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This decreased affinity of paired helical filament-tau for microtubules, coupled with the reduced amount of normal tau, may lead to the destabilization of microtubules and result in impairment of axonal transport, neuronal degeneration, and the aggregation of paired helical filaments. Therefore the hyperphosphorylation of tau is believed to be a key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The phosphorylation of tau is regulated by kinases and phosphatases. We have shown previously that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; WT, wild type; DMEM-HG, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MAb, monoclonal antibody.1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; WT, wild type; DMEM-HG, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MAb, monoclonal antibody. a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays an important role in the regulation of tau phosphorylation (9Sperber B.R. Leight S. Goedert M. Lee V.M.-Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 197: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Hong M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in cultured human neurons, GSK-3 induces an Alzheimer's disease-like hyperphosphorylation of tau. When GSK-3 activity is down-regulated by insulin or insulin-like growth factor I, the phosphorylation state of tau is decreased (10Hong M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). GSK-3 was originally identified as a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase, which catalyzes a regulated step in insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis (11Woodgett J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Cohen P. Yellowlees D. Aitken A. Donella-Deana A. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Insulin induces a phosphorylation-dependent down-regulation of GSK-3, which leads to the activation of glycogen synthase and therefore increased glycogen synthesis. GSK-3 was later found to have many other cellular functions. For example, the homologs of GSK-3 play a central role in the development of diverse organisms including Drosophila,Dictyostelium, and Xenopus (13Siegfried E. Perkins L.A. Capaci T.M. Perrimon N.

A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). During dorso-ventral axis formation in Xenopus embryogenesis, inhibition of GSK-3 can lead to increased dorsal tissue (17He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Interestingly, lithium, a drug that has been widely used for the treatment of bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, induces similar effect on Xenopus development, i.e. causing an expansion of the dorsal mesoderm leading to duplication of the dorsal axis (19Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Sato S.M. Sargent T.D. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study showed that lithium directly inhibits GSK-3, suggesting that this may be a mechanism whereby lithium exerts its effect on cell fate determination as well as other cellular functions (21Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Additionally, lithium has been reported to activate glycogen synthase and stimulate glycogen synthesis in rat hepatocytes (22Bosch F. Gomez-Foix A.M. Arino J. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16927-16931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has also been proposed (21Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) to be a result of the inhibition of GSK-3 by lithium because the inhibition of GSK-3 abrogates the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of glycogen synthase, which in turn increases glycogen synthesis. Despite the remarkable efficacy of lithium in treating bipolar disorder, the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic actions have not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have shown that lithium inhibits the phosphorylation of the mid sized neurofilament subunit and alters cytoskeletal organization in growing chick sensory neurons (23Bennett G.S. Laskowska D. DiLullo C. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Hollander B.A. Bennett G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that lithium may exert its effect on the central nervous system by affecting the neuronal cytoskeleton. As a neuronal microtubule-associated protein, tau is a substrate of GSK-3, and the phosphorylation of tau by GSK-3 could be directly inhibited by lithium and microtubule assembly thereby affected. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation and microtubule assembly in cultured NT2N neurons, which are derived from a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NTera2/D1 or NT2) following retinoic acid treatment (25Lee V.M.-Y. Andrews P.W. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 514-521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that lithium reduces the phosphorylation state of tau by a direct and reversible inhibition of GSK-3 and that this results in an increase in the binding of tau to microtubules, as well as an augmentation of microtubule assembly in NT2N neurons. [γ-32P]ATP and125I-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) gene expression system from Life Technologies, Inc. Taxol was obtained from Dr. V. Narayanan of NCI. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. GSK-3β S9A cDNA and the cDNA construct to make human recombinant tau were obtained from Dr. M. Goedert. GSK-3β WT cDNA was from Drs. X. He and H. Varmus. To generate NT2N neurons, a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (NTera2/D1, or NT2) was grown and maintained as described (26Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NT2 cells were treated with retinoic acid for 5 weeks and then replated at reduced density. After 10 days, neuron-like NT2N cells were mechanically and enzymatically separated from the parent NT2 cells and replated at a density of 1.2 × 106/well on six-well plates previously coated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml) and Matrigel. The NT2N neurons were maintained for up to 4–6 weeks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (DMEM-HG), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and mitotic inhibitors (1 μm cytosine arabinoside, 10 μmfluorodeoxyuridine, and 10 μm uridine). 2–4-week-old NT2N neurons were used for experiments, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Two GSK-3β/SFV viral constructs were used. GSK-3β WT is the wild type GSK-3β; and GSK-3β S9A is a constitutively active form of GSK-3β, in which the serine 9 residue was mutated to alanine. A 10-amino acid c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was introduced at the COOH termini of both constructs. Another SFV construct expressing β-galactosidase (LacZ) was used as a control. To overexpress GSK-3β in NT2N neurons, cells were washed once with DMEM-HG without supplements, and viral stocks diluted in DMEM-HG (multiplicity of infection = 10) were applied to the cells. After 1 h, the medium containing viruses was replaced by DMEM-HG with 5% fetal bovine serum. The infected NT2N neurons were then incubated overnight (18 h) before they were harvested. For experiments on the effects of lithium or calyculin A in infected cells, cells were treated with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h or with 0–50 nmcalyculin A for 30 min after overnight infection. To determine the effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation, NT2N neurons were treated with 0–25 mm LiCl for 2 h before being harvested. To examine the phosphorylation sites in tau affected by GSK-3 and lithium, NT2N neurons were either infected with GSK-3β/SFV overnight or treated with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h. To test whether calyculin A blocks the effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation, cells were treated with or without 10 mm LiCl for 30 min in the presence of 0–50 nm calyculin A. To determine whether lithium reversibly decreases tau phosphorylation, NT2N neurons were treated with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h and subsequently washed three times with lithium-free medium and incubated for another 0.5 or 2 h. As controls, cells were treated with lithium for 2, 2.5, and 4 h without wash. NT2N neurons were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold high salt RAB buffer (0.1 m Mes, 0.5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.75 m NaCl, pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, sonicated, and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g, 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and protein concentrations determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). An equal amount of total protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with a panel of site and phosphorylation-sensitive anti-tau antibodies. The blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine method. Alternatively, for the quantitation of the relative levels of tau protein, 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody, and the blots were exposed to PhosphorImager plates. 10 μg of total protein was loaded for the detection of tau on immunoblots using the antibodies T14/46, 25 μg for the antibodies T1, PHF1, T3P, and PHF13, and 50 μg for the antibodies AT8, AT270, PHF6, and 12E8. To determine the kinase activities of overexpressed GSK-3β, infected NT2N neurons were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 μm microcystin) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors. Overexpressed GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc antiserum. The immunoprecipitants were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with GSK-3 kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 5 μm ATP). GSK-3 kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of GSK-3 kinase buffer supplemented with 4 μg of recombinant tau and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for each reaction. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 × sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The entire reaction was then resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate. GSK-3 kinase activity was represented by the level of 32P incorporation into tau. The amount of immunoprecipitated GSK-3 present in each reaction was determined subsequently by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal anti-GSK-3 antibody on the same nitrocellulose membrane and used to normalize the corresponding relative GSK-3 activity. To determine the effect of lithium on GSK-3 activity, the kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 0–10 mm LiCl. To determine the reversibility of the lithium effect, the immunoprecipitated GSK-3 was incubated in GSK-3 kinase buffer with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min, washed three times with lithium-free GSK-3 kinase buffer, and then used to perform kinase assay. As controls, GSK-3 kinase reactions were either performed in the presence of lithium without wash after 20 min of lithium incubation, or without lithium incubation or wash. NT2N neurons were treated with 10 mm LiCl overnight before they were washed once with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 37 °C RAB buffer (0.1 m Mes, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μm Taxol, 2 mm GTP, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g, 25 °C. The protein concentrations of the soluble fractions were adjusted to be the same, and the cytoskeletal fractions were resuspended in ice-cold RAB buffer of the same volume as the corresponding soluble fractions. To enrich tau, an equal fraction of the samples was boiled and clarified by centrifugation. An equal volume was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis with T14/46 for tau. For determining the distribution of α-tubulin subunits, an equal volume of the unboiled samples was used to perform immunoblot analysis with a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to α-tubulin, a rat MAb to Tyr-tubulin, and a rabbit polyclonal anti-Glu-tubulin antiserum. The blots were incubated with125I-labeled secondary antibodies and exposed to PhosphorImager plates. Quantitation was performed with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The ratio of microtubule-bound tau (in the cytoskeletal fraction) to soluble tau was determined by comparing the T14/46 immunoreactivities. The ratios of polymerized to soluble α-tubulin, Tyr-tubulin, or Glu-tubulin were determined and plotted in a similar manner. T3P is rabbit polyclonal anti-tau antiserum. All the other anti-tau antibodies are mouse MAbs. T14 and T46 are phosphorylation-independent (27Trojanowski J.Q. Schuck T. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Histochem.

Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation in neuronal cells, NT2N neurons, which endogenously express tau, were treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, or 25 mm LiCl. After 2 h of treatment, cells were lysed and an equal amount of total protein was resolved on SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis with a panel of anti-tau antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, with increasing concentrations of lithium, T1 immunoreactivity increased and PHF1 immunoreactivity decreased, indicating a reduction of tau phosphorylation. This was accompanied by an increase in electrophoretic mobility of tau, detected by T14/46. The quantitative data on T1 and PHF1 immunoreactivities were normalized to the levels of T14/46 immunoreactivity and are plotted in Fig. 1 B. These results demonstrate that lithium decreases the phosphorylation of tau in a dose-dependent manner in the NT2N neurons. To test whether the effect of lithium on tau phosphorylation is a result of the inhibition of GSK-3, we first demonstrated that lithium directly inhibits GSK-3 in NT2N neurons. We overexpressed WT and a constitutively active mutant (S9A) form of GSK-3β in NT2N neurons using the SFV gene expression system. Both GSK-3β/SFV constructs have a c-Myc tag at their COOH termini, and the overexpressed protein can be immunoprecipitated by a polyclonal anti-c-Myc antiserum. In Fig.2 A, overexpressed GSK-3β S9A was immunoprecipitated, and a GSK-3 kinase assay was performed in the presence of 0–10 mm LiCl. The GSK-3 activities were assayed by monitoring 32P incorporation into human recombinant tau. The amount of GSK-3 present in each reaction was determined by immunoblotting with a MAb to GSK-3 and used to normalize the relative GSK-3 activities. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lithium directly inhibited the activity of GSK-3β S9A with an IC50 of 3 mm. Similar results were obtained when GSK-3β WT was overexpressed in NT2N neurons (data not shown). Other monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Cs+, and NH4+) did not have a similar effect (data not shown). We also examined the in vivo effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation in NT2N neurons that overexpressed GSK-3β WT or GSK-3β S9A. As shown in Fig. 2 B, overexpression of both GSK-3 constructs increased tau phosphorylation because T1 (dephosphorylated) immunoreactivity decreased and PHF1 (phosphorylated) immunoreactivity increased compared with control (LacZ). When treated with LiCl, the increased tau phosphorylation induced by overexpression of both GSK-3β WT and GSK-3β S9A was abrogated (WT+Liand S9A+Li), as the changes in T1 and PHF1 immunoreactivities were reversed (Fig. 2 B). These experiments indicate that lithium reduces tau phosphorylation by direct inhibition of GSK-3. The serine 9 residue in GSK-3β is required for the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation, and mutating this residue to alanine in GSK-3β S9A abolishes the down-regulation of its activity by insulin and other growth factors (10Hong M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 39Sutherland C. Cohen P.

Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Because the effects of lithium on GSK-3 and tau phosphorylation are not affected by this mutation, the phosphorylation of serine 9 must not be involved in the inhibition of GSK-3 by lithium. To examine the phosphorylation sites affected by lithium and GSK-3, we treated NT2N neurons with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h or infected the cells with GSK-3β/SFV overnight. Control cells received no treatment. Cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot was performed with a panel of site-specific phosphorylation-sensitive anti-tau antibodies. The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig.3 A. The immunoreactivities of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tau were quantitated and normalized to the levels of T14/46 (total tau), as shown in Fig.3 B. With the overexpression of GSK-3, T1 (dephosphorylated residues 189–207) immunoreactivity decreased, whereas PHF1 (phosphorylated serine 396/404), T3P (phosphorylated serine 396), PHF13 (phosphorylated serine 396), AT8 (phosphorylated serine 202 and threonine 205), AT270 (phosphorylated threonine 181), and PHF6 (phosphorylated threonine 231) immunoreactivities increased. Lithium treatment had the opposite effect on the immunoreactivities of the same antibodies (Fig. 3, A and B). However, phosphorylation at the site recognized by 12E8 (phosphorylated serine 262) was not altered by GSK-3 or by lithium. These results demonstrate that lithium and GSK-3 affect the same sites of phosphorylation in tau. Thus it is likely that lithium exerts its effects on tau phosphorylation through the direct inhibition of GSK-3. The phosphorylation status of tau depends on a balance between kinase and phosphatase activities. A decrease in kinase activity or an increase in phosphatase activity, or both, could result in reduced tau phosphorylation. To test whether or not the effect of lithium on tau phosphorylation requires the activation of a known phosphatase, we treated NT2N neurons with lithium in the presence of 0–50 nm calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (42Yasumoto T. Ragelis E.P. Seafood Toxins. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984: 207Google Scholar, 43Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). By inhibiting these phosphatases, calyculin A induced a decrease in T1 immunoreactivity in a dose-dependent manner in cells not treated with lithium (Fig. 4 A). Despite this inhibition of phosphatases by calyculin A, 10 mm LiCl strongly increased T1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that the effect of lithium on tau phosphorylation is not dependent on the activation of protein phosphatase 1 or 2A. We also showed that the inhibition of phosphatases by calyculin A and the overexpression of GSK-3 had additive effects in inducing hyperphosphorylation of tau in NT2N neurons. As shown in Fig.4 B, calyculin A induced a dose-dependent decrease in T1 immunoreactivity in cells infected with LacZ/SFV. A stronger decrease in T1 was observed when cells infected with GSK-3β/SFV were treated with calyculin A. To study further the mechanism of the inhibition of GSK-3 by lithium, we determined whether the effects of lithium on tau phosphorylation and GSK-3 are reversible. NT2N neurons were treated with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h and subsequently washed and incubated with lithium-free medium for another 0.5 or 2 h. As controls, the cells were treated with lithium for 2, 2.5, or 4 h. Tau phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot analysis with T14/46 and T1. As shown earlier, lithium inhibits the phosphorylation of tau after 2–4 h of incubation as indicated by an increase in T1 immunoreactivity. This effect was reversed rapidly by the removal of lithium, since T1 immunoreactivity resumed to its control levels (Fig.5 A). We also demonstrated in an in vitro kinase assay that the inhibition of GSK-3 activity by lithium is reversible (Fig. 5 B). When the GSK-3 kinase assay was performed in the presence of lithium after the immunoprecipitated GSK-3 was incubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min (LiCl+, Wash−), GSK-3 activity (represented by 32P incorporation into tau) was strongly reduced compared with the control (no lithium incubation,LiCl−, Wash−). When cells were washed extensively after 20 min of lithium incubation, GSK-3 activity was recovered (LiCl+, Wash+) (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that lithium reduces tau phosphorylation in the NT2N neurons by direct and reversible inhibition of GSK-3 and are in agreement with a recent in vitro study showing that lithium reversibly inhibits GSK-3 (47Stambolic V.

https://openalex.org/W2158951763,"We have studied the phosphorylation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins by different mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. Purified Bcl-2 was found to be phosphorylated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) p54-SAPKβ, and this is specific insofar as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and p38/RK/CSBP (p38) catalyzed only weak modification.

Failure to control PCD appropriately can lead to diseases involving either inadequate or unwanted cell death (e.g.. cancers and neurodegeneration) (1Raff M.C.

Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several intracellular molecules controlling PCD have now been identified. These include Bcl-2, which is a homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans gene ced-9 and blocks apoptosis under a variety of conditions (3Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1992; 258: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 5Dubois-Dauphin M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, several Bcl-2 family members have now been identified and include both repressors (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, and A1) and promoters (e.g. Bax, Bcl-XS, Bak, and Bad) of PCD (3Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Farrow S.N. Brown R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These genes are characterized by their ability to form complex networks of homo- and heterodimers, and their relative abundance probably plays a major role in determining sensitivity to apoptotic signals (3Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L. Thompson C. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.-G. Reed J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

One major unanswered question in relation to control of apoptosis by Bcl-2 family members is of their regulation by extracellular signals or external environment and, importantly, whether receptor-linked transduction pathways target this gene family as a means of determining cell fate. Emerging data imply that the Bcl-2 gene family are targets for phosphorylation suggesting one potential mechanism of control. For instance, taxol is a chemotherapeutic agent known to promote death, and recent studies in leukemic, prostate, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells show that this is accompanied by Bcl-2 phosphorylation (11Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 12Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M.

Bcl-2 has also been reported to be phosphorylated in Jurkat cells (14Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2376-2379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,15Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1996; 11: 1487-1498Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bcl-2 has been reported to associate with Raf-1, which targets this kinase to mitochondrial membranes where the Bcl-2 homologue Bad appears to be a phosphorylation target (16Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Together, these observations support the notion that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members could be a pivotal mechanism for integrating pro- and anti-apoptotic signals. The molecular identity of protein kinases underlying such phosphorylation is a question of paramount importance to our understanding of PCD. MAP kinases comprise the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38/RK/CSBP (p38) as three structurally and functionally distinct enzyme classes. Multiple genes and splice variants for each MAP kinase class have also been identified (17Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 19Cohen, P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). The ability of different MAP kinases to phosphorylate Bcl-2 family members has not hitherto been reported. This is surprising given many reports of increased ERK activity by growth and survival factors and moreover, preferential activation of JNK/SAPK by several stimuli and cell stresses known to lead to PCD. In both Jurkat T cells and B104 lymphoma cells, for instance, sustained JNK/SAPK activation by some pro-apoptotic stimuli (γ radiation, UV-C, and anti-IgM) correlates with onset of PCD (21Chen Y.-R.

Consistent with this, overexpression of the kinase ASK-1 or the Fas-binding protein Daax leads to activation of JNK/SAPK as well as enhanced apoptosis in several cell lines (23Science 275, 90–94Ichijo, H., Nishida, E., Irie, K., Dijke, P.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Moreover, in PC12 cells, use of mutant kinases indicates that activation of JNK/SAPK together with inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis following nerve growth factor withdrawal (25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of dominant inhibitory mutant forms of the JNK/SAPK kinase SEK1 or of the Fas-interacting protein Daax blocks activation of JNK/SAPK and confers cellular resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of Fas, cell stresses as well as the DNA-damaging drug cis-platinum (24Yang X.

Somewhat surprisingly, although also consistent with a critical role for JNK/SAPK in processes controlling PCD, deletion of the SEK1 gene blocks activation of JNK/SAPK and protects thymocytes from Fas and CD3-mediated apoptosis (28Antonsson B.

Bcl-2 was cloned into theEcoRI site of pUC19 and PCR mutagenesis was used to delete nucleotides 118–273 corresponding to amino acids 39–90 of the Bcl-2 coding sequence. In addition, a single base pair change of C to G at position 113 created a unique ApaI restriction site at this position. PCR mutagenesis was performed in a two-step reaction using two oligonucleotide pairs, CGCGGGCCCGGGGGCGCGGCGCCACATC in combination with the −21M13 forward primer and CGCGGGCCCGTGGTCCACCTGGCCCTCCGC in combination with M13 reverse primer. The resulting products of 0.2 and 0.6 kilobases, respectively, were purified, cleaved with ApaI, ligated, and reamplified using original terminal primers −21M13 and M13 reverse. The predicted 0.8-kilobase PCR product was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC19. Sequence analysis revealed the expected deletion and creation of the unique ApaI site. Reconstitution of the deleted sequence in which codons for Thr56, Ser70, Thr74, and Ser87 were mutated to encode Ala residues was performed using four overlapping pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (CCCGGGGGCCGCCCCCGCACCGGGCATCTTCTCCTCCCAG and GAGGAGAAGATGCCCGGTGCGGGGGCGGCCCCCGGGGGCC; CCCGGGCACGCGCCCCATCCAGCCGCATC and CGGCTGGATGGGGCGCGTGCCCGGGCTGG; CCGCGACCCGGTCGCCAGGACCGCGCCGCTGCAGGCCCCGGCTGC and CCGGGGCCTGCAGCGGCGCGGTCCTGGCGACCGGGTCGCGGGATG; and CCCCGGCGCCGACGCGGGGCCTGCGCTCGCCCCGGTGGGGCC and CCACCGGGGCGAGCGCAGGCCCCGCGTCGGCGCCGGGGGCAG) designed to leaveApaI compatible sequences at each end when ligated together. The eight oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated, and the resulting 156-base pair fragment was isolated and cloned in the correct orientation into the ApaI site of the Bcl-2 deletion mutant described above. The resulting quadruple point mutant was verifed by sequence analysis and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pEE12. Human Bcl-2 lacking 34 amino acids at the C terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the soluble cell fraction by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q.

Soluble His-tagged Bcl-2 was purified on Ni-NTA-agarose columns followed by fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q. For both Bcl-2 and Bax the C-terminal truncations were necessary because solubility and yields of full-length recombinant proteins were unacceptably low. Mouse p54-SAPKβ subcloned into pGEX4T3 was expressed in E. coli, purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), and eluted using standard procedures.

Cells were grown in 6-well plates (35 mm diameter) to 80% confluence and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were performed using the following plasmid concentrations: 0.1 μg of pEE Bcl-2 or pEE Bcl-2 (T56A,S70A,T74A,S87A); 1.0 μg of pcDNA1-HA-p44 ERK1, pMT2T-HA-p54-SAPKβ, or pcDNA3-HA-p38; 1.0 μg of pXJ40-HA-Rac1 (G12V), pXJ40-HA-Rac1 (T17N), pEXV3-Myc-Ras (G12V), or pEXV3-Myc-Ras (T17N); and 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1.0 μg of pMT-SM-Myc-MKP3, pMT-SM-Myc-MKP3 (C293S), or pMT-SM-Myc-MKP4 in the combinations indicated in the text. Total plasmid concentrations were maintained constant by supplementing with appropriate empty vectors. Following 6 h of incubation with LipofectAMINE and plasmid DNA, cells were washed and grown for 40 h before lysis and extraction. For acute stimulation of MAP kinase activation, cells were starved by incubation in serum-free medium for 2 h followed by exposure to EGF (10 nm), anisomycin (10 μg/ml), or H2O2 (0.5 mm) at 37 °C for 10–30 min as indicated.

For immunoprecipitation, aliquots (200 μl) of the COS-7 cell lysates were mixed with 800 μl of buffer TPP and rotary mixed for 1 h at 4 °C, after which time they were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. For Bcl-2 immunoprecipitation, supernatant was then mixed by rotary mixing for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of a preformed Bcl-2 immunoprecipitating complex (50 μl of Bcl-2 monclonal antibody OM-11–925 preincubated with 300 μl of 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose and 300 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose beads in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 4 °C). Beads were then sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min and washed four times in 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer TPP followed by final resuspension in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged MAP kinases was performed with buffer TPP without deoxycholate or SDS using HA-epitope specific monoclonal HA.11 exactly as described (31Muda M. Boschert U.

For MAP kinase phosphorylation assays, final resuspension was in 50 μl of buffer K (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20 mmMgCl2, 200 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Immune complex assays were performed by mixing 10 μl of bead suspension with 10 μl of 6 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼300,000 dpm/pmol), 10 μl of substrate protein (10 μg of Bax, 10 μg of Bcl-2, 15 μg of MBP, 10 μg of GST-ATF-2, or 10 μg of GST-MAPKAP kinase 2 Δ3) and 30 μl of buffer K followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 15 μl of 10 × Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (31Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R.

Bcl-2 phosphorylation was performed using purified free GST-p54-SAPKβ pre-activated by incubation with GST-SEK1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described (29Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Immobilized SEK1 was subsequently removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 5 min. Purified Bcl-2 (100 μg) was phosphorylated by incubation with GST-p54-SAPKβ (10 μg) in a total volume of 240 μl of buffer K containing 100 μm [γ-33P]ATP (3000 dpm/pmol). Phosphorylated Bcl-2 was purified by HPLC, lyophilized, and digested by overnight incubation at 37 °C in 90 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.5 containing 1 m urea, 20 mm methylamine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg of trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade). Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Hewlett Packard HP1090) with a Brownlee C18 column (220 × 2.1 mm). Peptides were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (in 0.1% trifluroacetic acid) from 0 to 55% over 60 min, followed by 55–70% over 5 min. Elution fractions were collected, and radioactive 33P-labeled phosphopeptides identified by scintillation spectrometry were sequenced by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 494 pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer with a model 148C on-line phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. To test for in vitro phosphorylation by different MAP kinases we first employed Bcl-2 and Bax proteins purified following expression in E. coli. HA-tagged ERK1, p54-SAPKβ, and p38 were expressed in COS-7 cells and activated by exposure to EGF (10 nm, 10 min), anisomycin (10 μg/ml, 30 min) and hydrogen peroxide (500 μm, 30 min), respectively, as described previously (33Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27205-27208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation and incubation with their known substrates MBP, ATF-2, and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MK2), all three MAP kinases were confirmed to be enzymatically activated by these stimuli (Fig.1 A). Despite this, no phosphorylation of Bax was detectable using any MAP kinase (not shown). In contrast, Bcl-2 phosphorylation was increased by up to 6-fold by incubation with activated p54-SAPKβ (Fig. 1 B). Bcl-2 phosphorylation by either ERK1 or p38 MAP kinases was limited to approximately 2-fold under identical conditions (Fig. 1 B). Bcl-2 was also phosphorylated 4-fold by immunoprecipitates of activated p46 JNK1 (SAPKγ) (not shown), suggesting selective phosphorylation by the JNK/SAPK class of MAP kinases. We next tested whether Bcl-2 could be phosphorylated by p54-SAPKβ within the environment of an intact mammalian cell. Human Bcl-2 was expressed in COS-7 cells and found to be immunodetectable as a 26-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A). To test for phosphorylation, Bcl-2 was co-expressed with both p54-SAPKβ and the constitutive Rho family G-protein Rac1 (G12V). This GTPase defective mutant has been shown previously to result in moderate activation of JNK/SAPK family members (34Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 35Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), and this is confirmed here with p54-SAPKβ (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with in vitroobservations using purified protein, Bcl-2 becomes highly phosphorylated under these conditions. This can be readily detected using Western blot analysis as a band shift of immunodetectable Bcl-2 protein (Fig. 2 A). Decreased gel mobility of phosphorylated Bcl-2 is consistent with previous reports of a Bcl-2 band shift upon phosphorylation by an unidentified kinase (11Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 12Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar). Up to five distinct bands are clearly visible using this technique. The same bands can also be seen, although with poorer resolution, upon autoradiographic analysis of Bcl-2 immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cells prelabeled with [32P]H3PO4 (not shown). This phosphorylation appears dependent on enzymatic activation of p54-SAPKβ because no band shifts are visible when Bcl-2 is expressed either alone with p54-SAPKβ or with p54-SAPKβ together with the dominant inhibitory mutant Rac1 (T17N) (Fig. 2, A andB). Limited Bcl-2 phosphorylation observed upon co-expression with Rac G12V alone probably reflects activation of endogenous JNK/SAPK. Because purified Bcl-2 is phosphorylated most effectively in vitro by JNK/SAPK family members (see above), we set out to test whether similar MAP kinase specificity can be demonstrated within cells. Bcl-2 was coexpressed with combinations of HA-tagged ERK1 as well as constitutively activated Ras (G12V) or dominant inhibitory Ras (T17N) (Fig. 2 C). Under conditions leading to ERK1 activation by Ras (G12V) (Fig. 2 D), Bcl-2 phosphorylation was barely detectable as indicated by the appearance of only two weak immunodetectable Bcl-2 bands displaying slowed gel mobility (Fig.2 C). This effect was not seen when Bcl-2 was expressed alone with either Ras (G12V) or ERK1, or in combination with ERK1 and inactive Ras (T17N) (Fig. 2 C). We have also performed similar experiments where Bcl-2 is coexpressed with p38 MAP kinase alone or together with Rac1 (G12V) or Rac1 (T17N). In these experiments (not shown), despite p38 MAP kinase activation, no phosphorylation was seen over and above that noted when Bcl-2 was expressed alone with Rac1 (G12V) (not shown). To confirm that Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the presence of p54-SAPKβ and Rac1 (G12V) is a reflection of intracellular MAP kinase activation, we assessed Bcl-2 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells coexpressing the MAP kinase phosphatases MKP3/PYST1 and MKP4 (31Muda M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition to Bcl-2, p54-SAPKβ, and Rac1 (G12V), cells were also transfected with increasing quantities of plasmid encoding MKP3/PYST1 or MKP4 (0.05–1.0 μg of plasmid/well). This resulted in a dose-dependent increase in levels of immunodetectable MKP3/PYST and MKP4 protein (see Ref. 32Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B. Gillieron C. Chabert C. Camps M. Martinou I. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5141-5151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and this was accompanied by both a graded inhibition of p54-SAPKβ enzymatic activity and a complete disappearance of four of the five additional Bcl-2 bands detected by Western analysis (not shown). The fifth Bcl-2 band showing reduced gel mobility was also weakened considerably by the highest level of MKP3 (not shown). The three-dimensional structure of the Bcl-2 homologue Bcl-XL reveals an unstructured 60-residue flexible loop connecting two α-helices localized immediately N-terminal of the conserved BH3 homology domain (37Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Structural modeling of Bcl-2 predicts a similar unstructured loop, and within this region we identified two serines (residues 70 and 87) and two threonines (residues 56 and 74), each preceding prolines that we reasoned represent potential sites for phosphorylation by p54-SAPKβ. In support of this, expression of the Bcl-2 mutant T56A,S70A,T74A,S87A in COS-7 cells abolished four of the five additional Bcl-2 bands normally observed upon coexpression with p54-SAPKβ and Rac1 (G12V) (Fig.3). This experiment indicates that one or more of these residues represent essential target sites for phosphorylation following activation of p54-SAPKβ within COS-7 cells. The site of the modification underlying the single remaining low mobility band is unknown. To test whether p54-SAPKβ is able to modify these sites directly, we next phosphorylated Bcl-2 in vitroin the presence of [33P]ATP using purified active GST-p54-SAPKβ. Following trypsin digestion of phosphorylated Bcl-2, HPLC separation resolved 13 peptides (Fig.4 A), although only two peaks of 33P-radioactivity were detected in the entire elution profile (Fig. 4 B). These peaks correspond to peptides 6 and 10, which were sequenced by Edman degradation and found to be amino acids 27–68 and 69–98 of Bcl-2, respectively (Fig. 4 C). Together, these two peptides include all four residues undergoing phosphorylation following p54-SAPKβ activation in intact cells.Figure 4Bcl-2 phosphopeptide analysis. Bcl-2 was phosphorylated in vitro by purified preactivated GST-p54-SAPKβ in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP. Phosphorylated Bcl-2 was then purified and subjected to trypsin digestion.

Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In these cells full-length Bcl-2 was ineffective at suppressing cell death and strikingly also undergoes extensive phosphorylation visible as multiple bands with retarded gel mobility. A Bcl-2 deletion mutant lacking the predicted flexible loop region was not phosphorylated and remarkably was able to block apoptosis in these cells. Although the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Bcl-2 was not identified in this report (46), our results suggest that JNK/SAPK family members may be responsible. Indeed, in another B cell line (B104) cross-linking mIgM triggers sustained activation of JNK/SAPK, and this is accompanied by cellular apoptosis (32Muda M. Boschert U. Smith A. Antonsson B.

Together with our data, these observations are consistent with a model whereby pro-apoptotic signals such as mIgM cross-linking activate members of the JNK/SAPK MAP kinase family, which then disable Bcl-2 through phosphorylation within its flexible loop region. Such Bcl-2 inactivation would be expected to reinforce pro-apoptotic processes such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, and activation of cysteine proteases of the caspase family.

NO⋅-mediated inactivation of theEscherichia coli aconitase and the porcine mitochondrial aconitase was investigated. In E. coli, aconitase activity decreased by ∼70% during a 2-h exposure to an atmosphere containing 120 ppm NO⋅ in N2. The NO⋅-inactivated aconitase reactivated poorly in E. coli under anaerobic or aerobic conditions.

AnS-nitrosation of the aconitase [4Fe-4S] center catalyzed by the solvent-exposed electron withdrawing iron atom (Fea) is proposed. Nitric oxide (NO⋅) is released as an intermediate of dissimilatory and assimilatory pathways of nitrite reduction in bacteria and fungi (1Goretski J. Zafiriou O.C. Hollocher T.C. J. Biol.

It is also produced by macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells to combat invading microorganisms and neoplastic tissue (3Nathan C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Curr. Opin.

Mechanisms of NO⋅ toxicity are complex and may include its direct reaction with heme, non-heme iron, and copper proteins (8Henry Y. Lepoivre M. Drapier J.-C. Ducrocq C. Boucher J.-L. Guissani A.

The avid reactivity of NO⋅ with superoxide radical (O·̄2) to form the less discriminant oxidant ONOO− provides a potent mechanism for the deleterious actions of NO⋅ (10Pryor W.A. Squadrito G.L. Am.

Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of NO⋅ toxicity continues to demand a greater knowledge of the NO⋅-sensitive targets and the NO⋅-derived species involved. The mammalian [4Fe-4S] cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aconitases are particularly sensitive to inactivation by NO⋅ produced during various pathological conditions (12Drapier J.-C. Hibbs Jr, J.B.

In mammals, the cytoplasmic aconitase serves as an mRNA-binding regulator of iron homeostasis and may also participate with the mitochondrial aconitase as a catalyst of the energy-yielding reactions of the citric acid cycle (19Klausner R.D.

Porcine heart isocitrate dehydrogenase, barium (±)-fluorocitrate, MnCl2, sodium cis-aconitate, sodium citrate, sodium trans-aconitate, sodium tricarballylate, NADP+, horse heart cytochrome c 3+, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, phenazine methosulfate, porcine heart mitochondrial aconitase, chloramphenicol, bovine erythrocyte Cu,Zn-SOD (3500 units/mg), succinic acid, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), dithiothreitol, ferrous ammonium sulfate, Sephadex G25, reactive blue 2-Sepharose, Mes, Tris, Hepes, and KCl were from Sigma. Bacto-tryptone and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. The minimal salts medium was made up with tap water and contained 60 mm K2HPO4, 33 mmKH2PO4, 7.6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.7 mmsodium citrate, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 μmMnCl2, 10 μg/ml thiamine-Cl, 40 μg/mll-arginine-Cl, and 10 mm sodium succinate. The 20 common l-amino acids were supplied at 40 μg/ml as indicated with cystine instead of cysteine. The phosphate-buffered LB medium (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) contained 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl per liter of 66 mmK2HPO4, 33 mmKH2PO4 plus 10 μmMnCl2. The pH of the LB and minimal salts media was adjusted to 7.0 with HCl or NaOH. Cultures were routinely grown aerobically in a rotary water bath at 37 °C with a medium:flask volume ratio of at most 1:5, and growth was monitored turbidometrically at 550 nm. To avoid disturbing the equilibration of gases, 1-ml samples were removed with a tuberculin syringe inserted through a rubber stopper-sealed 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask and connected via small tubing to the culture. Culture aliquots were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes and were quickly centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 25 s, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was frozen on dry ice. Bacteria were resuspended and lysed by sonicating the cell pellet in 0.1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm MnCl2, and 20 μm (±)-fluorocitrate, and the lysate was frozen on dry-ice. The barium salt of fluorocitrate was solubilized by titrating a suspension with HCl. Fluorocitrate was included to stabilize aconitase in extracts (29Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carry-over of fluorocitrate (<1 μm) did not measurably affect subsequent measurements of aconitase activity in extracts. Cell pellets and lysates were stored at −70 °C for up to 2 weeks without loss of aconitase activity. Cell lysates were quickly thawed by incubating in a 25 °C water bath and clarified by centrifugation for 25 s at 20,000 ×gimmediately prior to the assay of aconitase activity. For the preparation of batch extracts, a 1-liter culture of DH5α, initiated with a 30% inoculum from an overnight culture grown in minimal salts medium, was grown to an absorbance at 550 nm of ∼0.5 in minimal salts medium. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in approximately 5 volumes of ice-cold 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, by sonicating with a microtip probe. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and aliquots were stored at −70 °C. Aconitase activity was routinely assayed in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 30 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+ and 1 unit/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase by following the absorbance increase at 340 nm at 25 °C for 5 min (30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rose I.A. O'Connell E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1870-1879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One milliunit of aconitase activity corresponds to 1 nmol of NADPH formed per min. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) using Coomassie Brilliant Blue protein staining reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. SOD activity was measured by the competitive inhibition of cytochrome c 3+ reduction (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 0.2-ml assay volume incubated at 25 °C, and SOD units were determined from a standard curve prepared with bovine Cu,Zn-SOD (3500 units/mg). A Molecular Devices SpectraMax 250 thermostatted microplate UV-visible spectrophotometer was routinely applied to the microassay of aconitase, SOD, and protein. A Beckman DU 640 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted oscillating multicuvette holder was used for some measurements. A three-way gas proportioner (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.) was used to achieve mixing and a constant flow rate of 30 ml/min for various mixtures of O2, N2, and NO⋅, and gas mixtures were passed through a trap containing sodium hydroxide pellets to remove NO⋅2 and higher oxides of nitrogen formed prior to entering reaction vessels. The proportioner was calibrated for flow rates by measuring the displacement of a saturated solution of NaCl at constant pressure and room temperature. Saturated NO⋅ solutions (2 mm) were prepared by equilibrating water with 98.5% NO⋅ that was first passed through 1n NaOH. Aqueous NO⋅ was diluted into N2-equilibrated buffer containing aconitase in a double septum-sealed tuberculin syringe, which allowed for variation in volume while maintaining zero gas head space. It was important to maintain zero gas head space to keep added NO⋅ in the aqueous phase. Porcine mitochondrial aconitase was produced and isolated from E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysSpA with minor modifications to published procedures (27Zheng L. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7895-7903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified recombinant aconitase had specific activities of 6–8 units/mg protein following reactivation and constituted >85% of the protein as judged from Coomassie-stained denaturing gels. Aconitase was reactivated in a reaction containing 0.5 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate and 5 mm dithiothreitol buffered with 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, incubated under N2 at 0 °C for 30 min (34Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactivated aconitase was rapidly separated on Sephadex G-25 pre-equilibrated with N2-saturated 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. For the investigations of the commercial aconitase buffered at pH 6.5, active aconitase was prepared in 100 mm K-Mes, pH 6.5. Aliquots of aconitase were stored under N2 at −70 °C in vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickinson, 47 × 10.25 mm). Results are representative of two or more independent experiments. The sensitivity of the aconitase activity inE. coli to NO⋅ was measured by exposing vigorously shaking cell cultures to a constantly replenished atmosphere containing NO⋅ balanced with N2. Aconitase activity loss was progressive during exposure of cell cultures to 120 ppm NO⋅ gas (Fig. 1, line 1), while aconitase activity was stable during incubation under N2(line 2). Exposures were performed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol to preclude possible adaptation to NO⋅. The results clearly demonstrate a sensitivity of the E. coli aconitase to relatively low exposures of NO⋅ and indicate that O2-dependent NO⋅-derived species, such as ONOO−, are not necessary for aconitase inactivation. The aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ center is in a dynamic state of cyclical inactivation-reactivation in E. coli and mammals (14Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 174-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Gardner P.R. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In this cycle, the solvent-exposed catalytic Feais oxidized and released by ambient O·̄2 resulting in aconitase activity loss. Activity is constantly regained by reduction of the [3Fe-4S]1+ center and Fe2+ insertion. InE. coli, reactivation of the O·̄2-inactivated aconitase occurs with a t½ of 3 min (30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the reversibility of NO⋅-inactivated aconitase inE. coli. Exposure of cultures to an atmosphere containing 480 ppm NO⋅ in N2 for 60 min caused ∼90% loss of aconitase activity (Fig. 2, line 1). Removal of NO⋅ and replacement with nitrogen after the 60-min exposure allowed a very slow recovery of activity (line 1). Approximately 20% of the activity recovered after 90 min. Interestingly, the presence of 21% O2 stimulated the reactivation of the NO⋅-inactivated aconitase (line 2); however, only ∼50% of the activity was recoverable. Thet½ for the reactivation of the recoverable activity was ∼15 min. By comparison, aconitase activity in E. coli was completely stable under N2 (line 3) or during the transition from N2 to 21% O2 (line 4). It should be noted that nearly complete recovery of aconitase activity was observed when aconitase was oxidatively inactivated by O·̄2 (30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The slow and incomplete reactivation of the NO⋅-inactivated aconitase suggests a mechanism of inactivation involving a less reversible modification by NO⋅ than that observed with O·̄2. Aconitases are rapidly inactivated by ONOO− and GSNO in vitro (23Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and roles for ONOO− or GSNO have been proposed to explain the NO⋅-mediated loss of aconitase activity in vivo. We investigated the effects of O·̄2 and GSH on the NO⋅-mediated inactivation of aconitase in E. coli to discern the possible participation of O·̄2-derived ONOO− and GSH-derived GSNO in aconitase inactivation. E. coli strain DH5αpD11c overproducing the Mn-SOD ∼15-fold (619 ± 62 units/mg SOD) was compared with its parental strain DH5α (39.8 ± 0.9 units/mg SOD) for its sensitivity to NO⋅-mediated aconitase inactivation (Fig.3 A). Aconitase inactivation during NO⋅ exposure was remarkably similar in DH5α and DH5αpD11c (compare lines 1 and 2), while aconitase activity was stable during control exposures to 21% O2 in DH5αpD11c (line 4) and in DH5α (line 3). Aconitase activity was more resistant to the O·̄2-generating agent phenazine methosulfate in DH5αpD11c (Fig. 3 B, line 2) than in DH5α (line 1) as expected for a 15-fold elevation of SOD activity (30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate a limited role of O·̄2 and ONOO− in the mechanism of NO⋅-mediated aconitase inactivation. The E. coli mutant JTG10, lacking glutathione, and its parental strain AB1157 (25Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to measure the effects of cellular GSH on NO⋅-mediated aconitase inactivation. The absence of glutathione did not affect the NO⋅-mediated loss of aconitase activity in strain JTG10 relative to AB1157 under aerobic conditions (Fig. 4 A, compare lines 1 and 2) or anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4 B,lines 1 and 2). It should be noted that JTG10 contained a larger fraction of inactive aconitase and grew more slowly than AB1157 under aerobic growth conditions as previously reported (36Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); nevertheless, the relative loss of activity during NO⋅exposures was comparable in both strains. The failure of GSH to protect aconitase suggests a mechanism of inactivation independent of ONOO−, since the high concentrations of GSH (3.5–6.6 mm) in E. coli (37Apontoweil P. Berends W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 399: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) would be expected to scavenge thiol oxidizing species such as ONOO− (38Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results do not support a buffering function of GSH against NO⋅ (39Hausladen H. Privalle C.T. Keng T. DeAngelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) or the participation of GSNO in the mechanism of aconitase inactivation. We explored the reaction of NO⋅with the aconitases in vitro. Aconitase was inactivated in extracts exposed to 1200 ppm NO⋅ in N2 (Fig.5, line 2), and the virtual substrates fluorocitrate, trans-aconitate, and tricarballylate (29Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Werst M.M. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10526-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Telser J. Emptage M.H. Merkle H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4840-4846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) completely blocked this inactivation (Fig.5, compare lines 3–5 with lines 1 and2). In addition, aconitase activity was slightly decreased by NO⋅ exposure during catalysis with the substrate citrate (K m = 30 μm) (29Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.6, line 1). Increasing the ionic strength with 200 mm KCl increased the inhibitory effect of NO⋅ (line 2), and lowering the pH of the reaction mixture from 7.7 to 6.8 increased the inactivation observed with citrate (compare lines 2 and 3). Further, the E. coli aconitase was more potently inhibited by NO⋅ during catalysis with the substrate cis-aconitate than with citrate (compare lines 3 and 4). The results support a mechanism involving the reaction of NO⋅ or an NO⋅-derived species, with the catalytic [4Fe-4S] center and suggest that the NO⋅-mediated inactivation observed in vivo occurs with the aconitase-substrate complex. Inactivation is favored by acidic conditions, and NO⋅ appears to more favorably attack the cis-aconitate-aconitase intermediate.Figure 6Inactivation of E. coli aconitase by NO⋅ during catalysis. Extracts of E. coliwere added to a 5-ml reaction mixture pre-equilibrated under N2 at 37 °C and containing either 30 mmcitrate (lines 1–3) or 1.0 mm cis-aconitate (line 4), 0.4 mmNADP+, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 1 unit/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures were buffered with either 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.7 (lines 1 and 2) or 50 mm Hepes, pH 6.8 (lines 3 and 4) and were exposed under a 30 ml/min stream of 1200 ppm NO⋅ plus N2, or N2only, in 50-ml stoppered flasks, and flasks were shaken at >200 rpm to facilitate gas equilibration. Reactions (lines 2–4) were performed in the presence of 200 mm KCl. At intervals, 0.5-ml aliquots were removed with a syringe and measured for absorbance at 340 nm. The percentage of aconitase activity was calculated from the rate of increase of absorbance at 340 nm under NO⋅ relative to that measured for reactions incubated under N2. Reactions were initiated with 40 μg (lines 1 and 2), 600 μg (line 3), and 100 μg (line 4) of extract protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results did not exclude the possible involvement of a yet uncharacterized dioxygen-independent NO⋅-derived species in the mechanism of aconitase inactivation, since we were using extracts ofE. coli. However, the effects of pH, salt, and substrates on the inactivation of the E. coli aconitase provided a valuable clue for understanding the previous failure of high concentrations of NO⋅ to directly inactivate aconitases in vitro (23Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we supposed that acid pH or catalysis withcis-aconitate may facilitate the direct inactivation of aconitases by NO⋅ and that the NO⋅ sensitivity of the porcine heart mitochondrial aconitase may also be more readily observed under these conditions. Consistent with previous reports, incubation of the commercial porcine mitochondrial aconitase preparation with NO⋅ at pH 7.5 failed to inactivate aconitase during a 60-min exposure (Fig. 7 A, comparelines 1 and 2) (24Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, NO⋅caused an apparent stimulation of aconitase activity at pH 7.5 either in the presence (compare lines 1 and 2) or absence (compare lines 3 and 4) of 200 mm KCl. However, at pH 6.5, exposure of the aconitase to an atmosphere of 1200 ppm NO⋅ caused a loss of aconitase activity relative to the N2 control (Fig. 7 B, comparelines 1 and 2). Moreover, the activity loss was completely prevented by the virtual substrate fluorocitrate (20 μm) (Fig. 7 B, line 5). A similar NO⋅ resistance was observed with the purified recombinant porcine mitochondrial aconitase at pH 7.5 (Fig. 7 C,line 1), and NO⋅-mediated inactivation was observed at pH 6.5 (line 2) during exposure of the enzyme to 100 μm NO⋅. Like the E. coli aconitase, both the relatively impure commercial preparation of porcine mitochondrial aconitase and the isolated recombinant enzyme were potently inhibited/inactivated by NO⋅ during catalysis with saturating concentrations of cis-aconitate (1 mm) at pH 6.8 (Fig. 8,A and C, respectively; compare lines 1and 2). The inhibitory effect was not alleviated by flushing the reaction with N2 to remove NO⋅ (as indicated by the arrow, panel A). A lesser degree of inhibition/inactivation was observed with both preparations at pH 7.8 (Fig. 8, B and D; compare lines 1 and2), and the absence of KCl further increased the resistance of the mitochondrial aconitase to NO⋅ (Fig. 8 B, compare lines 3 and 4 with lines 1 and2). We conclude that NO⋅ reacts directly and irreversibly with the aconitases and that inactivation occurs with the catalytically active aconitases.Figure 8Inactivation of porcine mitochondrial aconitase by NO⋅ during catalysis. Porcine mitochondrial aconitase in a reaction mixture buffered with 50 mmNa-Hepes at pH 6.8 (panels A and C) or pH 7.8 (panels B and D) and containing 1.0 mm cis-aconitate, 0.4 mmNADP+, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 1 unit/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was exposed to N2 (lines 1 and 3) or 1200 ppm NO⋅ in N2 (lines 2 and 4) either in the presence (lines 1 and 2) or absence (lines 3 and 4) of 200 mm KCl at 37 °C. Commercial porcine heart aconitase (panels A andB) or purified recombinant porcine mitochondrial aconitase (panels C and D) were added at 4.8 and 0.125 μg/ml, respectively. Reaction mixtures (10 ml) were exposed under a gas stream (30 ml/min) in 50-ml stoppered flasks, and flasks were shaken on a rotary water bath at >200 rpm to facilitate gas equilibration. At intervals, aliquots were removed with a syringe and measured for absorbance at 340 nm. The arrow indicates the replacement of NO⋅ in N2 with N2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Low levels of NO⋅ gas exposure effectively inactivated the aconitase in E. coli. We can estimate the concentration of NO⋅ required for aconitase inactivation to be <240 nm at an NO⋅ gas concentration of 120 ppm if we simply assume a partitioning of NO⋅ in the bacteria similar to that in aqueous solutions and apply the NO⋅ saturation value for water of 2 mm at 1 atmosphere and 20 °C. A poor reactivatability of the NO⋅-inactivated aconitase (Fig. 2) appears to contribute to the observed NO⋅ sensitivity of the aconitase in vivo. Thus, a relatively slow inactivation of the aconitase by NO⋅ coupled with a slow reactivation may have effects comparable with those of the fast inactivation and fast reactivation observed with O·̄2, since the steady-state balance of active and inactive aconitase in vivo would be determined by the balance of inactivation and reactivation (21Gardner P.R. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ONOO−, GSNO, or other more oxidizing O2-dependent NO⋅-derived species do not appear to be involved in the mechanism of aconitase inactivation inE. coli as evidenced by the failure of SOD (Fig.3 A) or GSH (Fig. 4) to affect the NO⋅-mediated inactivation and by the dioxygen-independence of inactivation. Moreover, ambient O2 and O·̄2 may protect aconitase by decreasing the steady-state levels of NO⋅ through the formation of ONOO− and NO2⋅. Interestingly, ONOO− would be expected to form at a high rate in E. coli under aerobic conditions and to inactivate the aconitase if we were simply to consider the high rate of metabolic O·̄2 production of 5 μm/s by E. coli(42Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the high rate of reaction between NO⋅ and O·̄2 of 6.7 × 109m−1s−1 (43Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), and the relatively high second order rate constant for the reaction of ONOO− with aconitase of ∼105m−1 s−1 (24Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the scavenging of ONOO− by various oxidizable biomolecules or the binding of substrates to aconitase may adequately prevent the ONOO−-mediated oxidation of the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ center in vivo. In contrast, NO⋅ may have a selective affinity and reactivity with the substrate-bound solvent-exposed Fea of the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+ center similar to that of O·̄2. It should be mentioned in this regard that authentic NO⋅ (18Drapier J.-C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kühn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and NO⋅ donors (13Bouton C. Raveau M. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2300-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were reported to inactivate the mammalian cytoplasmic aconitase in extracts independently of O2/ O·̄2 and thus ONOO− formation. However, in the case of NO⋅ donors, the inactivation of aconitase via a transnitrosation was not excluded. Catalytically active substrate-saturated aconitase was inhibited by NO⋅ in vitro. The citrate-saturated aconitase was relatively more resistant than the cis-aconitate-saturated aconitase (Fig. 6), suggesting an effect of substrate ligands on the reactivity of NO⋅ with the solvent-exposed Fea. Citrate 3-OH oxygen binding to Fea may decrease the NO⋅ reactivity, or alternatively, cis-aconitate may increase the reactivity by altering the ligand field of Fea. The citrate hydroxyl oxygen does alter the Fea in the mitochondrial aconitase as indicated by ENDOR (electron nuclear double resonance), EPR, and Mössbauer spectroscopy (40Werst M.M. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10526-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 41Telser J. Emptage M.H. Merkle H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. J. Biol.

A. 1983; 80: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the ability of the hydroxyllesstrans-aconitate and tricarballylate to protect aconitase equally with that of the hydroxyl-containing inhibitor fluorocitrate (Fig. 5) suggests that an intermediate in the catalytic turnover of aconitase or a conformational state of the aconitase active site affects the reactivity of NO⋅ rather than solely hydroxyl oxygen liganding to Fea. Interestingly, the resting isolated mitochondrial aconitase was relatively resistant to inactivation by NO⋅ at pH 7.5 (Fig. 7). This result corroborates those of others in which the isolated mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and E. coli aconitases were shown to be resistant to NO⋅ at the high nonphysiological concentrations of 100–200 μm at pH 7.6 or 8.0 (23Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Castro L. Rodriguez M. Radi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29409-29415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the resting mitochondrial aconitase is inactivated at a more acidic pH during the exposure to near physiological concentrations of 1200 ppm NO⋅ (∼2 μm) (Fig. 7 B) or even faster with 50-fold higher concentrations of NO⋅ (Fig. 7 C). Differences in the reactivity of NO⋅ may be explained by the effects of pH on hydroxide liganding to the solvent-exposed Fea of the substrate-free aconitase (40Werst M.M. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10526-10532Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Bennett B. Gruer M.J. Guest J.R. Thomson A.J. Eur. J.

NO⋅ has an affinity for heme and non-heme iron, and it appears likely that NO⋅ binds to Fea of the aconitase [4Fe-4S]2+center. 2Since the submission of this manuscript, we have learned of EPR studies demonstrating interactions of NO⋅ with the Fe-S center of the beef mitochondrial aconitase that correlate with the loss of activity (50Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further, the Lewis acid character of Fea would be expected to withdraw electrons from NO⋅ to produce an intermediate with nitrosonium (NO+)-like reactivity. NO+ or NOδ+ would then be able to attack nucleophilic sulfur in the Fe-S center. In this respect, the reaction of NO⋅ at the active site of aconitase may be similar to the nitrosation of albumin catalyzed by dinitrosyl-iron complexes (47Boese M. Mordvintcev P.I. Vanin A.F. Busse R. Mülsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29244-29249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) with the exception that the reaction would be site-specific and autocatalytic. Factors affecting the electron withdrawing capacity of Fea, such as Fea ligands and substrates, may influence NO+or NOδ+ formation and reactivity. A nitrosation of the Fe-S center may also explain the relatively poor reactivatability of the aconitase in vivo (Fig. 2). It will be interesting to determine whether the NO⋅ sensitivity of aconitase generally applies to members of the [4Fe-4S] (de)hydratase family or to other iron-sulfur enzymes. Also, it will be important to elucidate the NO⋅-mediated modification to the aconitase(s) that impedes its reactivation. Finally, it is hoped that the NO⋅-sensitive aconitases may provide insights into the mechanisms of NO⋅ toxicity and the adaptive defenses against this toxicity. For example, the pH-dependent NO⋅sensitivity of the aconitases may increase the susceptibility of energy-dependent cell functions to the NO⋅- and acid-producing conditions of the intestine during endotoxic shock (48Salzman A.L.

Stathmin has recently been shown to destabilize microtubules, but the molecular mechanisms of this function remained unclear. We show here that stathmin directly interacts with tubulin. We assessed the conditions of this interaction and determined some its quantitative parameters using plasmon resonance, gel filtration chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The stathmin/tubulin interaction leads to the formation of a 7.7 S complex with a 60-Å Stokes radius, associating one stathmin with two tubulin heterodimer molecules as determined by direct quantification by Western blotting. This interaction is sensitive to pH and ionic environment. Its equilibrium dissociation constant, determined by plasmon resonance measurement of kinetic constants, has an optimum value of 0.5 μm at pH 6.5. The affinity was lowered with a fully “pseudophosphorylated” 4-Glu mutant form of stathmin, suggesting that it is modulated in vivo by stathmin phosphorylation. Finally, analysis of microtubule dynamics by video microscopy shows that, in our conditions, stathmin reduces the growth rate of microtubules with no effect on the catastrophe frequency. Overall, our results suggest that the stathmin destabilizing activity on microtubules is related to tubulin sequestration by stathmin.

Expression and phosphorylation of stathmin are modulated in various situations related to the control of cellular activities, and it has been proposed that it may act as a relay integrating various intracellular signaling pathways (1Sobel A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 301-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Expression of stathmin was shown to be regulated in vivo during development (7Koppel J.

Prostate. 1995; 27: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of stathmin is observed in response to hormones (20Beretta L. Boutterin M.-C. Sobel A. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cytokines (21le Gouvello S. Chneiweiss H. Tarantino M. Debré P. Sobel A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11650-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, progression through the cell cycle appears to require multisite phosphorylation of stathmin (24Larsson N. Melander H. Marklund U. Osterman O. Gullberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14175-14183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Actually, overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable mutant of stathmin resulted in a large population of cells blocked in G2/M with a high DNA content (24Larsson N. Melander H. Marklund U. Osterman O.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30626-30635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, stathmin is the generic element of a protein family whose other members most probably play distinct roles related to the control of neuronal differentiation or to the expression of neuron-specific traits (8Maucuer A. Moreau J. Mechali M. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16420-16429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Ozon, S., Maucuer, A., and Sobel, A. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem., 248, in pressGoogle Scholar). The molecular mechanism(s) by which stathmin acts in these processes remain largely unknown. Two domains can be distinguished in the primary structure of stathmin, an N-terminal “regulatory” domain that contains the four phosphorylation sites that account for all of the electrophoretic forms of stathmin observed in vivo (27Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a C-terminal “interaction” domain that includes a predicted coiled-coil forming α-helical structure thought to interact with other proteins (28Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Various stathmin protein partners have been identified in our laboratory (28Maucuer A. Camonis J.H. Sobel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3100-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) including a novel type of protein kinase, KIS (29Maucuer A. Ozon S. Manceau V. Gavet O. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 455712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, stathmin has been identified as a major microtubule (MT) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Fc, flow cell; f cat, catastrophe frequency; R S, Stokes radius; RU, resonance unit; Vg, growth rate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; WT, recombinant wild type; bWT, boiled recombinant wild type; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Fc, flow cell; f cat, catastrophe frequency; R S, Stokes radius; RU, resonance unit; Vg, growth rate; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; WT, recombinant wild type; bWT, boiled recombinant wild type; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography.-destabilizing factor inXenopus egg extracts (30Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It was proposed that stathmin binds to unpolymerized tubulin subunits and regulates the dynamic instability of MTs by increasing the frequency of catastrophes. Stathmin also inhibited spontaneous polymerization of tubulin in a substoichiometric fashion. Stathmin is thus the second factor identified that acts as a negative regulator of tubulin polymerization (31Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Desai A. Cell. 1996; 84: 37-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild type stathmin or of a CDK target site mutant both elicited rapid depolymerization of MTs in vivo(32Marklund U. Larsson N. Melander Gradin H. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Horwitz et al. (33Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that, in vivo, microinjection of recombinant stathmin induced a loss of MTs in COS-7 cells and, in vitro, that stoichiometric amounts of stathmin were able to either prevent assembly or promote disassembly of MTs. Interestingly, this latter result was also noted with the stathmin domain of SCG10, a neuron-specific member of the stathmin family (34Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B. Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lütjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which stathmin destabilizes MTs still remain unclear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the conditions of the stathmin/tubulin interaction and determined some of the binding parameters of the interaction, using gel filtration chromatography, plasmon resonance, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, we examined the influence of stathmin on the polymerization kinetics of tubulin using video-enhanced contrast, differential interference contrast microscopy. We demonstrate that stathmin interacts directly with tubulin, with a maximum affinity of 0.5 μm around pH 6.5. This interaction leads to formation of a 217-kDa complex consisting of the association of one stathmin with two tubulin heterodimer molecules. Furthermore, we observed that the sole effect of stathmin on MT dynamics in our conditions, as analyzed by video microscopy, was a reduction of the MT growth rate, independently of any effect on the catastrophe frequency. Tubulin was prepared from calf brain by two cycles of polymerization and depolymerization followed by chromatography on phosphocellulose and an additional cycle of polymerization and depolymerization (35Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). The product was stored at −80 °C at a concentration of 8.2 mg/ml in 20 mmK-Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.25 mm EGTA, 0.25 mmMgCl2, until use. Recombinant wild type (WT) stathmin, E mutants (16E, 25E, 38E, 25/38E, or 4E in which Ser-16, Ser-25, Ser-38, Ser-25/38, or Ser-16/25/38/63 were, respectively, substituted for Glu) and 4A mutant (Ser-16/25/38/63 substituted for Ala) were prepared as described previously (36Curmi P. Maucuer A. Asselin S. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Boiled recombinant wild type (bWT) stathmin was prepared as follows. After sonication of WT stathmin expressing bacteria in extraction buffer, a low speed supernatant was complemented with 100 mm NaCl and heated at 100 °C for 3 min and then ultracentrifuged, and the supernatant was recovered. It was used to purify stathmin to homogeneity in a two-step procedure: anion exchange chromatography and FPLC gel filtration on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Pure stathmin was concentrated to about 20 mg/ml in water on Centriprep-10 (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were achieved by amino acid determination. To estimate the Stokes radius (R S) of tubulin, stathmin, and the stathmin-tubulin complex, proteins were subjected to gel filtration on an FPLC Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. Samples (100 μl) were run on the column after equilibration in AB buffer (80 mm K-Pipes, pH 6.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2) at 0.5 ml/min. Standard proteins used to calibrate the column were ribonuclease A (R S = 16.4 Å), ovalbumin (R S = 30.5 Å), bovine serum albumin (R S = 35.5 Å), aldolase (R S = 48.1 Å), and ferritin (R S = 61 Å) (gel filtration calibration kit (Pharmacia)). Gel filtration data are presented either as elution volumes or as the molecular sieve coefficient,K av, a parameter calculated as (V e −V 0)/(V t −V 0), where V e represents the elution volume corresponding to the peak concentration of a protein,V 0 is void volume of the column, andV t is total volume of the gel bed. The void volume was determined by measuring the elution volume with blue dextran. The Stokes radius of the stathmin-tubulin complex was determined graphically on a (−log K av)½ versus Stokes radius plot, according to Siegel and Monty (37Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), constructed with the above mentioned standard proteins. Spectrophotometer recordings were performed at 280 nm to detect tubulin and the stathmin-tubulin complex, because at this wavelength stathmin is not absorbing (36Curmi P. Maucuer A. Asselin S. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). BIAcore™ 2000 system, sensor chip CM5, HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant p20), and an amine-coupling kit containingN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide, and 1 m ethanolamine-hydrochloride, pH 8.5, were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Flow cells (Fc) were prepared with the various stathmin forms: WT, bWT, 16E, 25E, 38E, 25/38E, 4E, and 4A. Immobilization of the different forms of stathmin to the CM5 sensor chip was performed in the BIAcore system as follows. A continuous flow of HBS buffer over the sensor surface at 10 μl/min was maintained. The carboxylated dextran matrix was activated by the injection of 70 μl of a solution containing 0.2m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Next, 40–80 μl of stathmin (30 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5) were injected, followed by 70 μl of ethanolamine to block remainingN-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups. The immobilization levels were 1000 resonance units (RU) and 2000 RU for WT, 1000 RU for bWT, 570 RU for 4E, and 1000 RU for 4A. Control flow cells consisted either of an activated-deactivated flow cell or of a flow cell coupled with bovine serum albumin (1000 RU). To follow the interaction of tubulin with sensor chip-coupled stathmin, an analytical cycle consisted in the injection of 14 μl of tubulin at increasing concentrations (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 20 μm) in AB buffer at the indicated pH (pH 6–7.5, with 0.25 pH unit steps) and at a flow rate of 7 μl/min at 25 °C. Analytical cycles were preprogrammed, and the entire analysis was completely automated. Interaction curves were obtained, and data were evaluated as shown in Fig. 3. We used the rate equation,dR/dt=ka′C(Rmax−Rt)−kd′RtEquation 1 assuming a single site interaction between stathmin and tubulin, where dR/dt is the rate of formation of surface complexes (i.e. the derivative of the observed response curve), C is the concentration of tubulin (constant),R max is the total amount of immobilized ligand expressed as surface plasmon resonance response,R t is the response observed at timet, and R max −R t is the amount of remaining free binding sites at time t. (Please note that all the rate and derived equilibrium constants calculated here are reported with a prime to indicate that they are not solution constants). To calculate the dissociation rate constant, k′d, data obtained with a high flow of buffer passing over the flow cell (assuming no rebinding) were fitted to the equation,R=R0·e−kd′(t−t0)Equation 2 where R is the observed response,R 0 is the response at the start of the dissociation, t is time in seconds, andt 0 is the start time for the dissociation. The association rate constant, ka′, was then calculated by fitting data to the equation,R=Req(1−e−(ka′Cn+kd′)(t−t0))Equation 3 where R eq is the steady state response level, C is the molar concentration of tubulin, nis the steric interference factor (default 1, assuming a homogeneous single-site interaction between stathmin and tubulin),t 0 is the start time of association, andk′d is the dissociation rate constant. The fit was assessed by comparing constants obtained at different tubulin concentrations and by examining the χ2 and the residual plots for the fitting. A good fit was considered when χ2 was <1. We used video-enhanced contrast, differential interference contrast microscopy (38Allen R.D. Allen N.S. Travis J.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1981; 1: 291-302Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) to follow MT dynamics as described below. Chambers with a volume of 3 μl were used. Two strips of double-sided tape were fixed on a microscope slide (Select Micro Slide, 76 × 22 mm, 0.8 mm thick, Chance Propper Ltd, United Kingdom; catalog number BS3836–1975) approximately 3 mm apart and perpendicular to the long axis of the slide. A 22 × 22-mm coverslip (Gold Seal cover glass, Clay Adams, United Kingdom; catalog number 3306) was then placed on top of the two tape strips and firmly pressed to attach it well. Slide and coverslip were ethanol- and water-washed prior to use. The channel formed by the tape strips, the slide, and the coverslip made up the chamber. Prior to use, centrosomes (3 × 103/μl) with a working concentration of tubulin in BRB80 (80 mm K-Pipes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) were injected into the chamber and left for 5 min on ice. The sample (always 30-μl total volume) was mixed on ice and consisted of BRB80, 1 mm GTP, tubulin, and stathmin or control buffer (the sample contained 1 μl of control buffer or 1 μl of concentrated stathmin (30-fold dilution)). Using a paper towel and capillary forces, the 30-μl sample was flowed through the chamber, which was then sealed at both ends with grease, and placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axioskop (Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany), equipped with a Zeiss × 100 Achrostigmat × 100/1.25 oil objective and a Hamamatsu Phototonics (Japan) C3077 CCD camera. Objective and condenser were heated to 37 °C, and the temperature inside the chamber was 37 °C (measured with a thermocouple). Measurements of MT dynamics were performed as described previously (39Andersen S.S.L. Buendia B. Dominguez J.E. Sawyer A. Karsenti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1289-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using NIH 1.617b and Microsoft Excel 5 programs. No sample was observed for more than 40 min. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge equipped with a Ti60 titanium four-hole rotor with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Sample volumes of 400 μl were centrifuged at 45,000 rpm, and radial scans were taken at 280 nm at 5-min intervals. At this wavelength, tubulin is the only species detected, since the extinction coefficient of stathmin is very low due to its lack of aromatic residues. Data analysis was performed using the program dc/dt (40Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume of the complex was estimated to be 0.73 ml/g, the solvent density taken as 1.005 g/cm3, and its viscosity as 1.002 centipoise. One-dimensional electrophoresis was performed on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (41Sobel A. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10312-10324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were either silver-stained on fixed gels as described previously (2Sobel A. Boutterin M.-C. Beretta L. Chneiweiss H. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3765-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or immunoblotted as follows. Proteins were transferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany) in a semidry electroblotting apparatus (transfer buffer: 48 mmTris, 39 mm glycine, 20% isopropyl alcohol). The membrane was saturated with 5% nonfat dry milk in immunoblot solution (12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Membranes were probed with the stathmin antiserum directed against its C-terminal peptide (7Koppel J. Boutterin M.-C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:5000 dilution and a mouse monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin (N356, Amersham, UK) at 1:3000 dilution. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham, UK) with the appropriate secondary antibodies and the membranes were exposed to XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For the determination of the stoichiometry of the stathmin-tubulin complex, samples of unknown concentration were compared with stathmin and tubulin standards whose concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The blots were probed with rabbit stathmin antiserum at 1:5000 dilution mixed, respectively, with either mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin or β-tubulin at 1:3000 dilution (N356 and N357, respectively, Amersham, UK). Appropriate secondary antibodies used were 35S-labeled whole antibody to rabbit Ig (SJ434, Amersham, UK) and 35S-labeled whole antibody to mouse Ig (SJ431, Amersham, UK). Quantification of stathmin, α-tubulin, or β-tubulin was achieved by direct counting of the radioactivity in each relevant 35S-labeled band with an Instant Imager apparatus (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). The stathmin/tubulin interaction was revealed by using the plasmon resonance technology. This method allows a real time observation of binding of molecules to surface immobilized ligands with no need to label either of the two (42Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Mass variations in the vicinity of the surface are detected. Upon the addition of a molecule in solution to a surface bound ligand, the signal measured, which is proportional to the mass detected, provides a sensorgram, which allows to monitor the interaction. Fig. 1 A shows the net binding of pure tubulin to immobilized WT stathmin. 3 μm tubulin in AB buffer, pH 7.5, was injected at point A, and the injection was terminated at point B when the buffer was allowed to flow over the sensor surface. We then varied the pH of the buffer to screen for the best conditions of this interaction. Fig. 1 B shows an overlay plot of net interaction curves obtained with 3 μmtubulin injected in AB buffer at pH varying between 7.5 and 6.5, with 0.25 pH unit steps. Comparison of the binding curves allowed us to evaluate the effect of pH on the affinity of the stathmin/tubulin interaction; the higher the steady state level, the higher the affinity (42Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). It was of the same order at pH 7.5 or 7.25 and rose sharply at pH 7 or below, being maximal at pH 6.5. The affinity dramatically fell at lower pH (not shown). All the following experiments were therefore performed in buffer AB at pH 6.5. The specificity of the interaction was ascertained by the absence of tubulin binding to flow cells coupled with BSA (Fig.2 A) or simply activated-deactivated (not shown), the reduction of binding in buffer without Mg2+ (Fig. 2 B), and the possibility of competing for tubulin binding to the surface immobilized stathmin by adding soluble stathmin to the tubulin solution prior to injection (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, this competition assay showed that tubulin binding to immobilized stathmin was abolished when 2 μm stathmin was added to a 4 μm tubulin flowing solution. This latter result suggested that at these stathmin and tubulin concentrations, more than 90% of the tubulin was complexed with stathmin in the solution, indicating that the solutionK D is at least 1 order of magnitude below this concentration range. Buffer AB, pH 6.5, was used throughout this study. Interaction of tubulin with immobilized stathmin was studied over a tubulin concentration range of 1–20 μm. Fig. 3 shows representative net sensorgrams of association, steady state binding, and dissociation using various tubulin concentrations. For the determination of the dissociation rate constant,k′d, rebinding of any released tubulin to the immobilized stathmin was prevented by raising the flow rate to 100 μl/min at the end of injection (point B). The dissociation phase was fitted according to the model AB= A + B, assuming a single site interaction between stathmin and tubulin. k′d was equal to 5 ± 0.15 × 10−3 s−1 as calculated by fitting the data to Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). An association constantk′a was then obtained by fitting the association phase with Equation 3 and was equal to 8.9 ± 1 × 103m−1 s−1. The equilibrium dissociation constant k′Dwas then calculated ask′d/k′aand was found to be 0.56 ± 0.05 × 10−6m. A k′D in the micromolar range reflects a relatively low affinity for the stathmin/tubulin interaction. This low affinity is in agreement with our earlier attempts in solution where we failed to retain tubulin by affinity onto a stathmin-Sepharose column or to co-immunoprecipitate tubulin with stathmin-antistathmin-protein A-Sepharose beads. 2P. Curmi and V. Manceau, unpublished data. Furthermore, this relatively low affinity is in agreement with the intracellular concentration of tubulin in the cell also found in the micromolar range and gives weight to the idea that this stathmin/tubulin interaction is of physiological relevance (43Northrup S.H. Erickson H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Rate constants were found similar to those measured with WT stathmin when the sensor chip was coupled with bWT, with an unphosphorylatable form of stathmin (4A), or with a series of “pseudophosphorylated” stathmin mutants aimed to mimic stathmin phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II or IV on serine 16 (16E), by mitogen-activated protein kinase on serine 25 (25E), by Cdc2 kinase on serine 38 (38E), or by mitogen-activated protein kinase and Cdc2 on serines 25 and 38 (25/38E). On the other hand, when the sensor chip was coupled with the fully pseudophosphorylated 4E mutated stathmin (where all four phosphorylation sites of stathmin were replaced by Glu),k′d andk′a were 8 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1 and 5 ± 0.1 × 103m−1 s−1, respectively, leading to a calculatedk′D of 1.6 ± 0.2 × 10−6m. This result corresponds to about a 3-fold lowered affinity of 4E stathmin as compared with WT stathmin. Horwitz et al. (33Horwitz S.B. Shen H.-J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) observed no difference between WT and a 4D mutant of stathmin (where the four serines were replaced by Asp) in their ability to inhibit polymerization or elicit depolymerization of MTs in vitro. This may be due to the relatively modest difference in k′D between WT and 4E (and probably 4D mutants). However, it is likely that differences ink′D may be more important at other working pH levels or different ionic conditions from those existing in the cell, since we observed in our preliminary attempts that at pH 7.5 no binding of tubulin was o"

Both VEGF-C genes comprise over 40 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and consist of seven exons, all containing coding sequences. The VEGF homology domain of VEGF-C is encoded by exons 3 and 4. Exons 5 and 7 encode cysteine-rich motifs of the type C6C10CRC, and exon 6 encodes additional C10CXCXC motifs typical of a silk protein. A putative alternatively spliced rare RNA form lacking exon 4 was identified in human fibrosarcoma cells, and a major transcription start site was located in the human VEGF-C gene 523 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation codon. The upstream promoter sequences contain conserved putative binding sites for Sp-1, AP-2, and NF-κB transcription factors but no TATA box, and they show promoter activity when transfected into cells. The VEGF-C gene structure is thus assembled from exons encoding propeptides and distinct cysteine-rich domains in addition to the VEGF homology domain, and it shows both similarities and distinct differences in comparison with other members of the VEGF/PDGF gene family.

The process of growth and development of new blood vessels from preexisting ones is termed angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in providing growing tissues with oxygen and nutrients and also occurs in some pathological conditions, including tumor growth and metastasis, inflammatory lesions, wound healing, and endocrine diseases (1Folkman J. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7176) Google Scholar).

Certain other angiogenic growth factors may also act indirectly on endothelial cells via the induction of VEGF secretion in adjacent cells (4Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pertovaara L. Kaipainen A. Mustonen T. Orpana A. Ferrara N. Saksela O. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6271-6274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides angiogenesis, VEGF is implicated in vasculogenesis or formation of blood vessels de novo by in situ differentiation from mesodermal precursor cells (7Risau W. Sariola H. Zerwes H.-G. Sasse J. Ekblom P. Kemler R. Doetschman T. Development. 1988; 102: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar). Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis appear to be further regulated by inhibitory signals from cells and pericellular matrices (8Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6016) Google Scholar).In situ hybridization studies have revealed that the three VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR), and VEGFR-3 (Flt4) have specific, although partly overlapping, expression patterns in developing fetal tissues (10Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Persico M.G. Terman B.I. Alitalo K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). VEGFR-3 expression has been localized in early embryonic blood vessels, especially in regions where the sprouting of developing lymphatic vessels takes place during the embryonic period (11Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Mustonen T. van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Fang G.-H. Dumont D. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Its continued expression primarily in the lymphatic endothelium of adult tissues suggests that it functions as a regulator of these vessels. Notably, the expression of VEGF-C is often found in mesenchymal tissues surrounding the developing lymphatic vessels (12Kukk E. Lymboussaki A. Taira S. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Joukov V. Alitalo K. Development. 1996; 122: 3829-3837PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of VEGF-C induces lymphatic hyperplasia in transgenic mice (13Jeltsch M. Kaipainen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. Swartz M.D.F. Jain R. Alitalo K. Science. 1997; 276: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar).Amino acid sequences of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family are distinguished by eight conserved cysteine residues. In the case of PDGF, the cysteine residues have been shown to be essential for the correct folding and dimerization of the protein (14Andersson M. Östman A. Bäckström G. Hellman U.

The VEGF-C dimers consist of polypeptides of 29- and 31-kDa, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the precursor between residues 227 and 228, and 21 kDa, produced via further N-terminal cleavages (17Hu J.-S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In its C terminus, the VEGF-C precursor contains a unique domain of cysteine rich sequences resembling those of a silk protein. Other VEGF/PDGF family members typically have short C-terminal stretches of basic amino acid residues, which are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs and mediate VEGF binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (20Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol.

The human promoter was shown to contain multiple binding sites for Sp-1, AP-1, and AP-2 transcription factors and hypoxia-regulated elements (21Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 22Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This promoter is TATA-less and responds to various effectors, including hypoxia, tumor necrosis factor-α, and basic fibroblast growth factor (24Ryuto M. Ono M. Izumi H. Yoshida S. Weich H.A. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28220-28228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kb 5′-flanking region of the mouse VEGF gene contains basal promoter activity (21Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

However, although the promoter also has a hypoxia-regulated element, VEGF gene induction by hypoxia is also effected via mRNA stabilization (25Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25492-25497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).We report here the cloning and characterization of the human and mouse VEGF-C genes. The genomic structure of the VEGF-C gene has been analyzed, and one alternatively spliced human mRNA isoform is described. We show that human genomic fragments containing the transcription initiation site are sufficient for basal promoter activity in transfected cells.DISCUSSIONVEGF-C is the fourth member of the VEGF subfamily of PDGF-related growth factors and the largest VEGF gene described so far. The genomic structures of the previously described members, VEGF, VEGF-B, and PlGF show a high degree of similarity between each other in exon-intron junctions and some similarities of alternative splicing. In the case of VEGF-C, the exon structure resembles that of the other VEGF family members, particularly in exons 3 and 4 encoding the core growth factor domain, which contains the eight cysteine residues and the signature sequence PXCVXXXRCXGCC conserved in all PDGF/VEGF family members. The most variable parts of these genes are the regions encoded by the sixth and seventh exons, which are alternatively spliced in all other members except VEGF-C. A short fifth exon is present in all splicing variants of the other genes, but VEGF-C appears to lack such an exon. Instead, there is a C-terminal extension in the sequences encoded by exon 4. Also, sequence corresponding to exon 6, which encodes part of a heparin binding domain present in VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and PlGF152 is missing in VEGF-C (22Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T.

In the case of VEGF-C, the cysteine-rich domain is extended in a repeated motif and divided into three exons. Exons 5–7 show no significant homology with VEGF, although the C6C10CRC cysteine motifs, which are encoded by exons 5 and 7 of VEGF-C may be related to the CXCXC6C11CRC pattern distributed in exons 7 and 8 of VEGF (22Tischer E.

Larsson C. Grimmond S. Fredriksson M. Weber G. Piehl F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,35Olofsson B. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Euler G.

The distribution of functional domains in the VEGF-C gene resembles to some extent that of the PDGF-B gene, where the N- and C-terminal propeptides are also cleaved off after polypeptide biosynthesis (36Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 108-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).The most striking differences between VEGF-C and the other VEGFs concern the potential alternative splicing variants. We have previously shown hybridization of mRNA species of 2.4 and 2.0–2.2 kb with the VEGF-C probe. Lee et al. (37Lee J. Gray A. Yuan J. Luoh S.-M. Avraham H. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) reported two VEGF-C cDNA clones containing deletions of 152 or 557 nucleotides corresponding to exon 4 or exons 2–4, respectively. These variant cDNAs were considered to be the result of alternative splicing. We report here a similar, alternatively spliced version of VEGF-C lacking exon 4. Deletion of exon 4 would result in a premature stop codon caused by a frameshift after the alternative splice acceptor of exon 5. This protein would not contain the C-terminal cleavage site (amino acids 227 and 228) of the precursor and would lack 2 of the 8 conserved Cys residues of the VEGF homology domain (18Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtien I. Kukk E. Saksela O. Kalkkinen N. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recombinant protein of the expected size was produced from a baculovirus vector containing the variant cDNA, but in preliminary experiments, we have been unable to show that this protein is capable of stimulating the autophosphorylation of VEGFR-3. 2D. Chilov, E. Kukk, S. Taira, M. Jeltsch, J. Kaukonen, A. Palotie, V. Joukov, and Kari Alitalo, unpublished data. Studies of VEGF crystal structure have shown that the corresponding region contains the receptor binding sites and essential cysteine residues involved in inter- and intrachain disulfide bonding (38Muller Y. Li B. Christinger H. Wels J. Cunningham B. Devos A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). All isoforms of the VEGFs described earlier contain this part of the protein. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis suggested that the PC-3 and HT-1080 cells as well as several tissues express only one major form of VEGF-C. Therefore, the alternatively spliced mRNA detected in the HT-1080 cell library may represent a rare transcript that is unlikely to have significant biological relevance in the cells and tissues analyzed. A similar conclusion was made from RT-PCR analysis of the mouse VEGF-C coding region.The transcription of the human VEGF-C gene starts 523 bp before the first coding base; thus, the mRNA has a long untranslated 5′-leader. As for the VEGF gene (22Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the VEGF-C gene promoter lacks consensus TATA and CCAAT sequences. Instead, it has putative binding sites for Sp-1, a ubiquitous nuclear protein that can initiate transcription from TATA-less genes (39Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) and a long GC-rich 5′-untranslated region, which is typical for several growth factor genes and is postulated to have a role in translational regulation (22Tischer E.

Sci. 1986; 83: 2392-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, sequences upstream of the VEGF-C translation start site were found to contain consensus binding sites for the AP-2 transcription factor. This suggests that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and TGF-α as activators of the AP-2 transcription factor can regulate VEGF-C transcription (41Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar, 42Gille J. Swerlick R. Caughman S.

Besides, we have shown here that the VEGF-C promoter activity is approximately 2-fold induced by serum stimulation. The corresponding mRNA increase was 2–5-fold in different cells, although some of this increase could be attributed to mRNA stabilization (32Enholm B. Paavonen K. Ristimaki A. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Klefstrom J. Kivinen L. Laiho M. Olofsson B. Joukov V. Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2475-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, important serum-responsive elements may be located outside of the promoter fragments used in the present work, for example in the first intron of this large gene.Potential binding site for the NF-κB transcription factor important for the lymphoid and immune systems was also found. NF-κB is associated with rapid response activation mechanisms and is known to be induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli, being a mediator of tissue-specific gene expression (44Baeuerle P.A.

The presence of NF-κB sites suggests that NF-κB may be implicated in the induction of the VEGF-C mRNA by interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α. 3A. Ristimaki, D. Chilov, E. Kukk, S. Taira, M. Jeltsch, J. Kaukonen, A. Palotie, V. Joukov, and Kari Alitalo, unpublished data.Unlike the VEGF gene, the VEGF-C gene promoter does not contain putative binding sites for hypoxia-regulated factors. Numerous studies have shown that another major control point for the hypoxic induction of the VEGF gene is the regulation of the steady-state level of mRNA (21Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The VEGF mRNA stability is considered to be determined by the presence of protein-binding sequence motifs in its 3′-untranslated region (5Klagsburn M. D'Amore P.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 25Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25492-25497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of the VEGF-C gene also contains a motif of this type, but at least our preliminary analyses indicate that the mRNA steady-state levels are not increased by hypoxia. Thus, besides the significant differences in its exon structure and encoded protein domains, the VEGF-C gene also has interesting differences in its regulation and function in comparison with the VEGF prototype of this gene family (13Jeltsch M.

Interestingly, if gaps introduced into the amino acid sequences for the purposes of alignment are ignored for calculations, the newly cloned FIGF/VEGF-D is about 48% identical with human VEGF-C and about 31% identical with human VEGF (48Orlandini M.

Aprelikova O. Alitalo K. Vecchio S.D. Lie K.-J. Chou J.Y. Persico G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of their multiple amino acid sequence alignments, VEGF-C and VEGF-D are likely to have similar structural and functional properties and gene structures. Perhaps the PDGF-A/PDGF-B and VEGF-C/VEGF-D genes have diverged from VEGF/VEGF-B and from PlGF earlier than from each other during evolution. The process of growth and development of new blood vessels from preexisting ones is termed angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in providing growing tissues with oxygen and nutrients and also occurs in some pathological conditions, including tumor growth and metastasis, inflammatory lesions, wound healing, and endocrine diseases (1Folkman J. Nature Medicine. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7176) Google Scholar). Specific growth factors for the vascular endothelium, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PlGF, placenta growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PlGF, placenta growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and placenta growth factor (PlGF) form a subfamily of the platelet-derived growth factor family (2Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr.

Certain other angiogenic growth factors may also act indirectly on endothelial cells via the induction of VEGF secretion in adjacent cells (4Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pertovaara L. Kaipainen A. Mustonen T. Orpana A. Ferrara N. Saksela O. Alitalo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6271-6274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides angiogenesis, VEGF is implicated in vasculogenesis or formation of blood vessels de novo by in situ differentiation from mesodermal precursor cells (7Risau W. Sariola H. Zerwes H.-G. Sasse J. Ekblom P. Kemler R. Doetschman T. Development. 1988; 102: 471-478PubMed Google Scholar). Both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis appear to be further regulated by inhibitory signals from cells and pericellular matrices (8Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6016) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization studies have revealed that the three VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (Flk-1/KDR), and VEGFR-3 (Flt4) have specific, although partly overlapping, expression patterns in developing fetal tissues (10Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Persico M.G. Terman B.I. Alitalo K. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). VEGFR-3 expression has been localized in early embryonic blood vessels, especially in regions where the sprouting of developing lymphatic vessels takes place during the embryonic period (11Kaipainen A. Korhonen J. Mustonen T. van Hinsbergh V.W.M. Fang G.-H. Dumont D. Breitman M. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3566-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Its continued expression primarily in the lymphatic endothelium of adult tissues suggests that it functions as a regulator of these vessels. Notably, the expression of VEGF-C is often found in mesenchymal tissues surrounding the developing lymphatic vessels (12Kukk E. Lymboussaki A. Taira S. Kaipainen A. Jeltsch M. Joukov V. Alitalo K. Development. 1996; 122: 3829-3837PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of VEGF-C induces lymphatic hyperplasia in transgenic mice (13Jeltsch M. Kaipainen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. Swartz M.D.F. Jain R. Alitalo K. Science. 1997; 276: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family are distinguished by eight conserved cysteine residues. In the case of PDGF, the cysteine residues have been shown to be essential for the correct folding and dimerization of the protein (14Andersson M. Östman A. Bäckström G. Hellman U.

The VEGF-C dimers consist of polypeptides of 29- and 31-kDa, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the precursor between residues 227 and 228, and 21 kDa, produced via further N-terminal cleavages (17Hu J.-S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3898-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In its C terminus, the VEGF-C precursor contains a unique domain of cysteine rich sequences resembling those of a silk protein. Other VEGF/PDGF family members typically have short C-terminal stretches of basic amino acid residues, which are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs and mediate VEGF binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (20Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).

Even though H. pylori shows a great genetic variability, strains isolated from human biopsies can be classified into two groups (7Xiang Z. Censini S. Bayeli P.F. Telford J.L. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 94-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Type I strains are associated with the more serious pathologies and are characterized by the common production of a toxin, termed VacA, 1The abbreviations used are: VacA, vacuolating toxin; BHK, baby hamster kidney; CI-M6PR, cation independent mannose 6-P receptor; LE, late endosome(s); Lgp, lysosomal membrane glycoprotein(s); PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and of a toxin-associated antigen (CagA). Type II strains produce neither of these two antigens and lack a 40-kilobase pathogenicity island found in the genome of type I strains (8Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). VacA is synthesized as a 140-kDa precursor, which is processed to the mature 95-kDa protein during export from the bacteria (9Telford J.L. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Nuti S.

Papini E. Schiavo G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Intoxication of cells with VacA perturbs the endocytic traffic at a late stage, and large acidic vacuoles with elements of late endosomal compartments are formed (14Papini E. Bugnoli M. de Bernard M.

The analysis of the early events of cellular intoxication and an accurate mapping of the main vacuolar components will help in determining the intracellular target(s) of VacA and in understanding the mechanism of cellular intoxication by this novel bacterial toxin. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) is a cell line often used in studies of the endocytic path of higher eucaryotes. The route leading endocytosed material from the plasma membrane of BHK cells, through the early endosomal compartment (Rab5+/transferrin receptor+) to the late endosomal compartment (Rab7+/cation independent mannose 6-P receptor (CI-M6PR)+), has been characterized in detail using electron microscope markers and a range of Rab mutants and/or endocytosis inhibitors (18Aniento F.

However, the distal part of the endocytic path, connecting late endosomal compartments to lysosomes, is less characterized (22Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J.

Here, BHK cells exposed to VacA were fractionated with a novel, isopycnic density ultracentrifugation method, optimized for the purification of late endosomes and lysosomes from BHK cells. Together with parallel immunofluorescence staining, this procedure allowed us to obtain evidence that vacuoles are enriched in lysosomal membrane markers such as Lgp110, contain low levels of lysosomal hydrolytic activities, are characterized by the presence of the late endocytic marker Rab7, but are devoid of another late endosomal marker, the CI-M6PR. These results indicate that VacA induces the formation and pathological accumulation of a mixed endo-lysosomal compartment. Rabbit polyclonal anti-rat CI-M6PR was a kind gift of Dr. B. Hoflack (Institut Pasteur de Lille, France); rabbit polyclonal anti-VacA was produced and characterized as described previously (24Manetti R. Massari P. Burroni D. DeBernard M. Marchini A.

Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Rabbit anti-human cathepsin D and cathepsin B were purchased from Calbiochem, Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit was from Amersham Corp. (Little Chalfont, UK). β-Glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase activities were determined usingp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide and p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (Sigma) as substrates. OptiprepTM was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Milan, Italy). Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum in an incubator with 5% CO2, at 37 °C. Twelve to 24 h before the beginning of the experiments, cells were seeded in Petri dishes with a density of 65–130,000 BHK/cm2. Highly purified VacA was prepared and activated by short acid exposure as described (24Manetti R. Massari P. Burroni D. DeBernard M. Marchini A. Olivieri R. Papini E. Montecucco C. Rappuoli R.

Incubation time was 4 h for all the experiments, the concentration of VacA used is specified in the description of every experiment. Cell vacuolation as presented in Fig. 4 was quantified by determining the total neutral red uptake (26Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation of organelles of BHK cells (treated with 5 nm VacA and mock-treated) by sucrose step gradient was performed essentially as described (27Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), in a cold room. Briefly, cells were carefully washed with ice-cold isotonic phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PBS), scraped with a rubber policeman, and pelleted by centrifugation in a table centrifuge (750 rpm, 5 min). They were then resuspended in 3 ml of homogenization buffer (HB-EDTA, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose (8%), 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), pelleted (1,500 rpm, 10 min), resuspended in 0.6 ml HB-EDTA, and homogenized by 10–13 passages through a 22-gauge 1[1/4] needle. After centrifugation (2,500 rpm, 15 min) the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was collected, and its sucrose concentration increased under stirring to 40.6% by slow addition of 62% sucrose in HB-EDTA. PNS was then carefully overloaded with 1.5 ml of 35% and 1 ml of 25% sucrose in HB-EDTA. The tube was filled with HB, and the centrifugation was performed in an SW55Ti rotor (50,000 rpm, 66 min). The late endosome-enriched fraction was collected among 25% sucrose and HB (upper interface), the early endosome-enriched fraction (LE) among 35 and 25% sucrose (middle interface). The lower interface (40.6/35% sucrose) contained plasma membrane and other cellular compartments. Endocytic compartments were characterized by measuring enzymatic activities, by immunofluorescence, and by migration of the purified compartments in density gradients. Separation of LE and vacuoles from lysosomes and other cellular compartments was accomplished by self-generated linear gradients of OptiprepTM. PNS was prepared essentially as described above, in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. PNS was mixed with OptiprepTM to a 12.5% working solution and centrifuged to equilibrium in a NTV90 rotor (76,000 rpm, 130 min). 0.3-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube with a peristaltic pump; aliquots were assayed for β-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase activities, and the remaining material was processed for immunoblotting. In control experiments, LE derived from a flotation sucrose gradient (Fig. 1, lane 2) were subjected to isopycnic density centrifugation under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that LE collected in fractions 7–11, corresponding to the Rab7+/CI-M6PR+ fractions derived from isopycnic centrifugation of whole PNS. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were saturated in 5% dry milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 133 mmNaCl) and exposed overnight to primary antibody and for 1 h to peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted in TBS). After washings with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, and with TBS, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system and a high performance chemiluminescence film (Amersham Corp., UK). The latter was scanned with a dual-wavelength Shimadzu CS930 densitometer. Twenty-four hours before experiments, BHK cells were seeded with a density of 15,000/cm2 in 75-cm2 Petri dishes containing glass coverslips and were then treated with 0, 5, and 50 nmVacA as described above. Coverslips were rinsed with PBS, and cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. After 2 short washings with PBS, 0.38% glycine, 0.27% NH4Cl, and 2 additional washings with PBS, the antigen accessibility was improved by a 30-min incubation with PBS, 0.2% saponin, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. All antibodies (anti-VacA, anti-cathepsin D, anti-CI-M6PR, anti-Rab7, anti-Lgp110, and Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit) were diluted in the latter solution. Vacuoles that form in HeLa cells exposed to VacA have components such as Rab7 and the vacuolar H+-ATPase, characteristic of the late endosomal (LE) compartment (14Papini E. Bugnoli M. de Bernard M.

Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These vacuolar structures could arise and grow either by a homotypic LE fusion or by a heterotypic fusion of LE with lysosomal or pre-lysosomal vesicles, as recently found for wortmannin-induced vacuoles (29Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the former case, vacuoles isolated from VacA-exposed cells should have a protein profile matching that of LE isolated from control cells, whereas in the case of heterotypic fusion, the two profiles should be different. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we compared by SDS-PAGE the protein profiles of endocytic compartments of BHK cells (exposed to VacA or mock-treated) isolated by sucrose step gradients. Fig.1 shows the subtle but reproducible differences found in the electrophoretic pattern of the fractions collected from the three interfaces of the flotation gradient. Such differences (arrows) are restricted to the LE-enriched fractions, collected from the higher interface of the gradient and presented in lane 1 (VacA-treated) and lane 2(control cells). Early endosome-enriched fractions collected from the middle (lane 3 and 4) and fractions collected from the lower interfaces (lanes 5 and 6) do not show appreciable variations. Although VacA treatment of the cells does not lead to significant changes in the distribution of Rab5, transferrin receptor, Rab7, and CI-M6PR as determined by endocytic compartments fractionation with this technique (not shown), these preliminary results represent the first evidence that the toxin produced by H. pylori induces changes in the protein content of the LE compartments. Changes could be ascribed to the recruitment of protein components from other compartments, resulting from heterotypic fusion events. These results and the finding that VacA interferes with Rab7+ endosomal compartments (16Papini E. de Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9720-9724Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Papini E. de Bernard M. Satin B. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Frandsen F.

Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) prompted us to carefully investigate the distribution of a number of late endocytic and lysosomal markers in control and in VacA-intoxicated cells. For this purpose, the step gradient described in the previous section is insufficient because electron microscopy (27Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (not shown) reveal that at least part of the cellular population of lysosomes colocalizes with LE in the upper interface of the flotation gradient. Therefore, we optimized a self-generating, isopycnic OptiprepTM gradient, for the clear-cut separation of the late endocytic from the lysosomal compartment of BHK cells. PNS was subjected to isopycnic ultracentrifugation and fractions were collected, denser first, and characterized by immunoblot and enzymatic activity analysis. Fig. 2 presents the position in a 12.5% OptiprepTM gradient of some of the markers tested; acid phosphatase and cathepsin B as lysosomal markers, Rab7 as LE marker, and β-glucosaminidase as a marker for both lysosomes and LE (see Ref. 23Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar for this choice of markers). As expected, lysosomes, whose density is the highest among cell organelles (23Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), are collected from the bottom of the tube together with plasma membrane (alkaline phosphatase as marker, not shown) and trans-Golgi network (see below). Fig. 2 shows that the mature form of cathepsin B and the major peaks of the lysosomal enzymatic activities are detected in fractions 1–5 (lysosomes). A minor peak of β-glucosaminidase activity is also found in lighter fractions, afterward identified as LE due to the presence of late endosomal markers. In the right panels of Fig. 2, the peak of Rab7 immunoreactivity colocalizes (fractions 7–11) with the minor peak of β-glucosaminidase activity. These fractions are therefore enriched in LE and are clearly separated from the lysosome-containing fractions. The same analysis was then performed on cells exposed for 4 h to 5 nm VacA, but neither the lysosomal enzymatic activities nor the markers detected by immunoblot changed significantly their position in the gradient. To compare cellular vacuoles induced by VacA with those induced by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and described in a previous study (29Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the position of the CI-M6PR, a trans-Golgi network and LE marker, and of Lgp110, a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, in the fractions of the isopycnic gradient. In control cells, the CI-M6PR is immunodetected in two regions of the gradient (Fig.3 A) as follows: the denser one (fractions 2–5) corresponds to membranes derived from the trans-Golgi network, whereas the lighter, overlapping the distribution of Rab7 (Fig. 3 B) and of the minor peak of β-glucosaminidase (Fig.2), corresponds to LE compartments. The distribution of Lgp110 in the same gradient (Fig. 3 C) is similar to the distribution of β-glucosaminidase, with a major peak corresponding to lysosomal fractions and a minor one overlapping the distribution of LE. Although there is little variation in the distribution of CI-M6PR and of Rab7 in VacA-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B), a consistent portion of Lgp110 shifts from lysosomal fractions (1-5 in Fig. 3 C) to lighter fractions with a density corresponding to that of Rab7+/CI-M6PR+ LE of control cells (7-11 in the same figure). This redistribution of the lysosome membrane glycoprotein Lgp110 is not accompanied by a comparable redistribution of lysosomal enzymatic activities (see below) and is evident in cells exposed to VacA at such low concentrations (5 nm) that neither macroscopic vacuoles are visible nor can an increased uptake of neutral red be measured (26Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Hence, such redistribution of a lysosomal membrane protein is an early event in cellular intoxication by VacA and cannot be attributed to the gross alteration of cell structure and organization induced by filling the cytosol with large vacuoles. Attempts to separate LE from the Lgp110-enriched compartment by changing the percentage of the OptiprepTM working solution or the modality of centrifugation were unsuccessful. Hence, it remains to be established whether VacA-intoxicated cells contain “normal” LE (Rab7+/CI-M6PR+) together with a distinct population of Lgp110+ vacuoles with the same density, or whether VacA induces the formation and accumulation of a distinct hybrid compartment endowed with both LE and lysosomal components and having a density comparable with that of LE. The second possibility is supported by the results presented in the following section. Figs. 5, 6, and7 show phase contrast (left) and the corresponding immunofluorescence images (right) of control and of VacA-treated BHK cells. Immunostaining is specific for Lgp110 (Fig. 5, B, D, and F), for Rab7 (Fig. 6, B, D, and F), and for CI-M6PR (Fig. 7, B and D). The phase contrast images of Fig. 5 show control BHK cells (A), cells exposed to 5 nm VacA (C), and to 50 nm VacA (E). Low nm concentration of VacA does not induce formation of vacuoles of a size detectable by phase contrast microscopy nor increases neutral red uptake (Fig. 4). However, immunofluorescence staining with a Lgp110-specific polyclonal antibody shows a labeling condensed in enlarged structures that probably represent vacuoles at an early stage of development. Moreover, as reported in the previous section, the redistribution of part of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein from heavy to lighter fractions can already be detected by isopycnic gradient centrifugation.Figure 6Immunofluorescence localization of Rab7 in control BHK cells and in cells intoxicated with 50 nm VacA.

C andD cells were treated with 50 nm VacA; immunofluorescence was with CI-M6PR-specific polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cells treated with 50 nm VacA, vacuoles are clearly visible in phase contrast (E) and Lgp110 is clearly localized on their membrane (F). These cells were also immunostained for cathepsin D, a protein of the lumen of lysosomes, but it was not found inside vacuoles (not shown). This could be ascribed to technical problems, such as its dilution in the vacuolar lumen, which is larger than that of lysosomes, or to cathepsin loss during cell fixation. However, this result parallels that obtained with isopycnic gradients, where redistribution of lysosomal membrane proteins to lighter fractions is not accompanied by an increase in hydrolytic activities. Fig. 6 (D and F) shows that, as for Lgp110, Rab7 is clustered in enlarged structures in cells treated with 5 nm VacA and decorates the membrane of most of the vacuoles that form upon treatment with 50 nm toxin. On the contrary, also in highly vacuolated cells, the cellular distribution of the CI-M6PR does not change (compare B and D of Fig.7), and interestingly, vacuoles are not labeled. The presence of the lysosomal marker Lgp110, of the late endosomal marker Rab7, and the absence of another late endosomal marker (CI-M6PR) clearly indicate the post-late endosomal origin of VacA-induced vacuoles. Cell vacuolation is the major detectable activity of VacA, which determines its name of vacuolating cytotoxin. Previous experiments aimed at the characterization of vacuoles and at the study of the mechanism of vacuolation employed toxin-enriched bacterial extracts or high concentrations of purified toxin to emphasize the phenomenon by inducing a rapid and massive cell vacuolation. In vivo, type I H. pylori strains release VacA, as clearly deduced from the presence of anti-VacA antibodies in the serum of infected people or animal models (30Marchetti M. Aricò B. Burroni D. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Ghiara P. Science. 1995; 267: 1655-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Although the quantity of the toxin releasedin vivo has not yet been determined, vacuoles in number and dimension comparable with those induced in cultured cells are rarely detected in human gastric biopsies (31Fiocca R. Villani L. Luinetti O. Gianatti A. Perego M. Alvisi C. Turpini F. Solcia E. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. 1992; 420: 489-498Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here, cells were exposed to amounts of VacA closer to those experiencedin vivo, which are not sufficient to cause alterations detectable by phase contrast microscopy or by measuring the uptake of membrane-permeant weak bases such as neutral red. Under these conditions, VacA causes pathological changes in compartments of the endocytic pathway before vacuoles become apparent. With the aid of isopycnic density gradient centrifugation, we could follow the redistribution of Lgp110, a lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, to a compartment lighter than lysosomes, which also contains Rab7 but not CI-M6PR nor detectable amounts of cathepsin D. This novel compartment is acidic and therefore swells when osmotically active weak bases are present, thus giving rise to the large vacuoles previously associated to VacA activity. The absence of the CI-M6PR antigen and the presence of a lysosomal membrane marker identifies vacuoles as post-LE compartments. Such features are reminiscent of those of the compartment of antigen presenting cells where antigens are processed and loaded on MHC-II molecules (32Fernandez-Borja M. Verwoerd D. Sanderson F. Aerts H. Trowsdale J. Tulp A. Neefjes J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 8: 625-640Google Scholar). This raises the interesting possibility that VacA interferes in the antigen processing and presentation by antigen presenting cells, thus preventing T cell proliferation, an effect that would lower the immune response at the level of the stomach mucosa allowing its colonization by pathogenic strains of H.pylori. Remarkably, there appears to be a non-parallel delivery of lumenal and membrane components of the lysosomes in VacA-induced vacuoles because they have a low content of hydrolytic enzymes. Such a phenomenon has already been described in the biogenesis of phagosomes in macrophages (33Desjardins M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 183-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The precise sequence of events in the terminal part of the endocytic pathway, which involves LE and lysosomal compartments, is not as well characterized as that of early endocytic events (23Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). LE and lysosomes share several markers, but LE appear to be morphologically more complex than lysosomes, lighter and endowed with mannose-6-P receptors and Rab7 (34Ludwig T. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The presence of a heterogeneous vesicle population linking CI-M6PR+/Lgp− LE to CI-M6PR−/Lgp+ lysosomes is known (36Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Strous G.J. Slot J.W. Bleekemolen J.E. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A recent study postulated the existence of Rab7+/CI-M6PR− intermediate vesicles, which bud from perinuclear, CI-M6PR+ LE and fuse with lysosomes (22Méresse S. Gorvel J.-P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that lysosomes store mature lysosomal enzymes that are injected, when needed, in late endosomal compartments (23Griffiths G. Protoplasma. 1996; 195: 37-58Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a redistribution of lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (Lgp110 and Lgp120), similar to the one obtained by VacA, was recently described as a consequence of the treatment of NRK cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, (29Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which causes the appearance of two swollen late endocytic compartments, one Lgp+/CI-M6PR− with characteristics similar to the VacA-induced vacuoles, and one positive for M6PR that was not found in VacA-treated cells. Reaves et al. (29Reaves B.J. Bright N.A. Mullock B.M. Luzio J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 749-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have postulated that the former compartment arises in response to the wortmannin-induced inhibition of the re-formation of electron dense lysosomes from a LE/lysosome-hybrid compartment. Similarly, it is conceivable that treatment with VacA inhibits the retrieval of membrane to lysosomes, leaving a hybrid compartment that can still fuse with more lysosomes and therefore swell, particularly in the presence of membrane-permeant amines. These analogies, first shown in the present study, suggest the possibility that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, is implicated in the mechanism of VacA intoxication. We thank M. de Bernard, E. Papini, and B. Satin for stimulating discussions and Licia Bridda for collaboration in some of the experiments."

The binding of G-CSF to its receptor specifically activates JAK1 and JAK2 kinases, as well as STAT3, a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). To examine the role of STAT3 in G-CSF receptor-mediated signal transduction, two different forms of the dominant negative STAT3 were introduced into a mouse myeloid cell line that exogenously expresses the mouse G-CSF receptor. In response to G-CSF, the parental myeloid cells grew for about 4 days, and then they stopped dividing and differentiated into cells with lobulated nuclei. During this period, the expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene was induced, while c-myc gene expression was down-regulated. In contrast, in the cells expressing the dominant negative STAT3, G-CSF could induce neither growth arrest nor morphological change. However, the induction of the MPO gene by G-CSF was not affected by the dominant negative STAT3. These results indicate that STAT3 activation is responsible for part of the G-CSF-induced differentiation of neutrophils but that another pathway, involving the expression of the MPO gene, that does not utilize the activated STAT3, is also required to fully differentiate the cells.

Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal half of the G-CSFR cytoplasmic region is sufficient for transducing the proliferation signal, whereas its membrane-distal half of the cytoplasmic region is essential for the differentiation signal (8Fukunaga R.

Studies on the signal transduction mediated by cytokine receptors have recently revealed that various cytokines specifically activate the Janus family kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family proteins (11Ihle J.N.

The activated JAKs phosphorylate STATs on a conserved tyrosine residue (13Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which induces STAT dimerization. The dimerized STATs then translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene expression (14Shuai K. Horvath C.M.

Several groups have constructed dominant negative forms of STAT proteins, and by expressing them in various cells, it was shown that STAT5 is, at least in part, involved in the interleukin (IL)-3-induced proliferation signal (16Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), while STAT3 is involved in the IL-6-induced differentiation of mouse M1 cells (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H.

Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3963-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) . G-CSF also activates JAKs, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, and STAT3 (19Nicholson S.E. Novak U.

The membrane-proximal half of the G-CSFR cytoplasmic region (up to 76 amino acids) is sufficient to activate JAK1 and JAK2 (19Nicholson S.E. Novak U. Ziegler S.F. Layton J.E.

However, four additional amino acids including Tyr-703 are required to activate STAT3 (22de Koning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Löwenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the extra region works as a docking site for STAT3, as found for gp130, the signal transducer of the IL-6 receptor system (23Stahl N.

Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic region of G-CSFR carries four tyrosine residues, all of which are in the distal region of the receptor (7Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Previously, we mutated each tyrosine residue to phenylalanine and reported that the tyrosine residues at 703 and 728 and/or their surrounding regions are essential to transduce the differentiation signals (10Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since the region around Tyr-703 is essential to activate STAT3 as described above, we proposed that STAT3 mediates the differentiation signals from G-CSFR. In this report, we introduced dominant negative STAT3 into a mouse myeloid cell line that responds to G-CSF by proliferation and differentiation, and showed that STAT3 plays an essential role in G-CSF-induced growth arrest and neutrophilic morphological change but that it is not required for the G-CSF-induced MPO gene expression. The production of mouse recombinant IL-3 has been described (25Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14008-14015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human recombinant G-CSF was provided from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. The biological activities of G-CSF and IL-3 were determined by measuring their ability to stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation into mouse IL-3-dependent FDC-P1 cells expressing G-CSFR (7Fukunaga R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 45 units/ml of mouse IL-3. The expression plasmids, pCAGGS-HA-STAT3F and pCAGGS-HA-STAT3D, for the dominant negative mouse STAT3 were described previously (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Iguchi M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The dominant negative STAT3 are tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin A (HA)-epitope at the N terminus. Mouse GM-I62M cells were transfected with pCAGGS-HA-STAT3F or pCAGGS-HA-STAT3D together with p-PUR (CLONTECH), which carries the puromycin-resistant gene, by electroporation, essentially as described (7Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 30 μg of SalI-digested pCAGGS-HA-STAT3F or pCAGGS-HA-STAT3D, and 1 μg of p-PUR were exposed to a 280-V pulse with a capacitance of 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). Cells were cultured in 15 ml of growth medium in 96-well microtiter plates (0.1 ml/well) for 14 days, and the puromycin-resistant clones were selected in a medium containing 0.75 μg/ml puromycin. The expression of the dominant negative STAT3 proteins in individual clones was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Western blotting with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Twelve independent clones expressing the dominant negative STAT3 were obtained. Three clones were randomly picked and used in this study. Cells were washed with factor-free medium and grown in medium lacking IL-3 for 5 h. After stimulation for 10 min at 37 °C with either 150 units/ml G-CSF or 45 units/ml IL-3, the cells (1 × 107 cells) were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) (26Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation with the anti-STAT3 antibody, 0.1 μg of rabbit anti-STAT3 antibody was added to 1 ml of lysate and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose (30 μl, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) by incubating at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with the washing buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100), suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatant was resolved by electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Daiichi chemical). Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) at 35 V overnight. After blocking with Block Ace (Dainippon Seiyaku), the filters were incubated with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, 10% Block Ace, and either 1 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology), 2 μl of anti-STAT3 antibodies or 3 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins recognized by the antibodies were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products). The whole-cell extracts were prepared according to Nakajima et al. (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Iguchi M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin), and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was recovered as whole-cell extracts. A set of complementary oligonucleotides, hSIE (5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTC-3′) that carry the GAS binding site (27Tweardy D.J. Wright T.M. Ziegler S.F. Baumann H. Chakraborty A. White S.M. Dyer K.F. Rubin K.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4409-4416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was custom-synthesized in Vector Research. After annealing, the oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase. The reaction mixture for the gel shift assay contained 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 μg poly(dI-dC), 40 μg of the whole-cell extracts, and 62.5 fmol of probe DNA (43,000 cpm) in a total volume of 17 μl. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the products were resolved by electrophoresis on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE buffer as described (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K.

To determine their long term growth potential, cells were incubated at an initial density of 1 × 105cells/ml in medium containing either 30 units/ml of human G-CSF or 45 units/ml of mouse IL-3. The medium was replenished every 2 days to reduce the cell density to 1 × 105 cells/ml. Viable cells were counted after staining with trypan blue. To analyze the morphological changes, cells were cytospun onto glass slides and stained with Wright-Giemsa. Cells grown in the presence of IL-3 were washed with factor-free medium, transferred to medium containing 30 units/ml G-CSF, and cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h. Total RNA was extracted using guanidine isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and fractionated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels. Northern hybridization was conducted under high stringency conditions as described previously (8Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For probes, mouse MPO (29Venturelli D. Shirsat N. Gemperlein I. Bittenbender S. Hudson S. Rovera G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), mouse c-Myc (30Watt R. Stanton L.W. Marcu K.B. Gallo R.C. Croce C.M. Rovera G. Nature. 1983; 303: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and human EF-1α cDNA (31Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5791-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were labeled with 32P using a random primer labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Mouse myeloid LGM-1 cell transformants (GM-I62M) expressing G-CSFR respond to G-CSF by showing growth arrest, morphological differentiation, and the induction of myeloid-specific genes such as MPO (10Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To examine the role of STAT3, which is activated by G-CSF in various myeloid cells, two different dominant negative forms of mouse STAT3 (STAT3F or STAT3D) tagged with the influenza HA (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Iguchi M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) were introduced into GM-I62M cells. STAT3F carries a replacement of the tyrosine residue at 705 with phenylalanine and should not be phosphorylated, whereas two glutamic acids at the residues of 434 and 435 were mutated to alanines in STAT3D, which should prevent the binding of STAT3 to the target DNA. Either form of STAT3 inhibits the IL-6-induced activation of the endogenous STAT3 (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Iguchi M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Several independent transformant clones expressing STAT3F or STAT3D were obtained and named GM-S3F or GM-S3D, respectively. Analyses by immunoprecipitation with anti-STAT3 antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody, indicated that all the clones expressed a similar amount of STAT3F or STAT3D. The expression level of the dominant negative STAT3 was comparable or slightly higher than that of the endogenous STAT3 (Fig.1 A). The parental GM-I62M cells are factor-dependent, requiring IL-3 for their growth. This property did not change when cells expressed the dominant negative STAT3; i.e. when IL-3 was removed from the medium, GM-S3F and GM-S3D cells died within 4 days, whereas the transformants continued to grow in the presence of IL-3 (see below), confirming that STAT3 is not involved in the IL-3-induced proliferation signal (32Azam M. Erdjument B.H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To examine whether the dominant negative STAT3 could inhibit the G-CSF-induced activation of STAT3, GM-I62M, GM-S3F, and GM-S3D cells were starved for 5 h and then stimulated with either IL-3 or G-CSF. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the stimulation of GM-I62M cells with G-CSF but not IL-3 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. A similar level of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was observed in GM-S3D cells upon G-CSF stimulation, whereas the G-CSF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was greatly diminished in GM-S3F cells. When STAT is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, it translocates into the nucleus and binds to the DNA element (11Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 14Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H.T. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). To confirm the inhibition of the G-CSF-induced STAT3 activation in the cells expressing the dominant negative STAT3, a DNA fragment containing the STAT3 binding site (GAS) was prepared, and the cell extracts were analyzed using a gel shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the cell extracts from GM-I62M cells stimulated by G-CSF produced a shifted band(s) that could be supershifted by the anti-STAT3 antibody (data not shown). However, no shifted band was observed with the extracts from IL-3-activated cells. These results agree with previous observations that G-CSF specifically activates STAT3 (33de Koning J.P. Schelen A.M. Dong F. van Buitenen C. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Löwenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 132-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tian S.-S. Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while IL-3 does not activate STAT3 (32Azam M. Erdjument B.H. Kreider B.L. Xia M. Quelle F. Basu R. Saris C. Tempst P. Ihle J.N. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1402-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the cell extracts from G-CSF-stimulated GM-S3F or GM-S3D cells were analyzed, the intensity of the shifted band was greatly diminished. These results indicate that the G-CSF-induced binding of the endogenous STAT3 to the target DNA element was inhibited by the dominant negative STAT3. To examine the effect of the dominant negative STAT3 on G-CSF-induced growth arrest and terminal differentiation, GM-I62M, GM-S3F, and GM-S3D cells were cultured in medium containing either IL-3 or G-CSF, and their growth properties were monitored. As shown in Fig.2 A, parental GM-I62M cells and their transformants of the dominant negative STAT3 grew in the presence of IL-3 with a similar doubling time (14 h), but all cells died within 4 days in the absence of IL-3. When GM-I62M cells were grown in the G-CSF-containing medium, they started to proliferate with a doubling time of 19 h, which is slightly lower than that observed with these cells in IL-3. Four days after the shift to the G-CSF-containing medium, the cells stopped growing, and at day 10, the cell number in the culture became one-tenth of the maximum (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, both GM-S3F and GM-S3D cells kept growing in the presence of G-CSF, and the cell number at day 10 was more than 100 times higher than that observed with GM-I62M cells (Fig.2 B). We then examined the morphological changes of these cells. As shown in Fig. 3, when GM-I62M, GM-S3F, and GM-S3D cells were cultured with IL-3, they exhibited immature myeloblastic features with a large nucleus. However, when GM-I62M cells were cultured in the medium containing G-CSF, the nuclei became lobulated after 10–12 days. At day 12, about 65% of the GM-I62M cells had lobulated nuclei, which is typical for neutrophilic granulocytes. In contrast, both GM-S3F and GM-S3D cells maintained myeloblastic morphology in the medium containing G-CSF, and the percentage of cells carrying the lobulated nuclei was similar to that observed in the medium containing IL-3 (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that STAT3 activation is crucial for the G-CSF-induced growth arrest and morphological change to neutrophilic granulocytes. During the G-CSF-induced differentiation of neutrophils, the expression of many genes is modulated (8Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 35Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Carraci D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altman S. Santoli D. Rovela G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the expression of MPO and neutrophilic elastase is up-regulated, while the expression of the c-myc oncogene is repressed (8Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 36Fegan C.D. White D. Sweeney M. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 90: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine whether the expression of these genes is regulated by STAT3, GM-I62M, GM-S3F, and GM-S3D cells were cultured in the presence of G-CSF, and the expression levels of MPO and c-myc were followed by Northern hybridization. As shown in Fig. 4, G-CSF gradually induced the MPO gene expression in GM-I62M cells, while the expression of the c-myc gene was down-regulated. However, in both GM-S3F and GM-S3D cells, G-CSF could stimulate the MPO gene expression but did not down-regulate the c-myc expression. These results indicate that G-CSF-induced repression of the c-myc gene expression is mediated by activated STAT3, but the MPO gene induction by G-CSF does not require the activation of STAT3. Cytokines stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs and activate the STAT proteins. For example, IL-3 activates JAK2 and STAT5 (16Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 37Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), while IL-6 and G-CSF activate JAK1 and JAK2, and STAT3 (21Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M.

Using dominant negative forms of STAT proteins, Mui et al. (16Mui A.L. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have reported that STAT5 is, at least in part, involved in the IL-3-induced proliferation signal, whereas STAT3 seems to be involved in the IL-6 or LIF-induced differentiation of mouse M1 cells (17Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Iguchi M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 18Minami M. Inoue M. Wei S. Takeda K.

Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that dominant negative STAT3 inhibits the G-CSF-induced morphological changes of mouse LGM-1 cells. However, there was no effect on the G-CSF-induced growth: the cells expressing the dominant negative STAT3 continued to grow in response to G-CSF. These results indicate that STAT3 activation is not necessary for the G-CSF-induced proliferation of the myeloid cell precursor. Two models have been proposed for the cytokine-induced differentiation of hemopoietic cells. In the stochastic model (42Till J.E. McCulloch E.A. Siminovitch L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 43Korn A.P. Henkelman R.M. Ottensmeyer F.P. Till J.E. Exp. Hematol. 1973; 1: 362-375PubMed Google Scholar, 44Nakahata T. Gross A.J.

Cell. 1993; 74: 823-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), cytokines provide proliferative and survival signals to the differentiating hematopoietic cells, but they do not provide specific lineage commitment signals. In the instructive model (46Curry J.L. Trentin J.J. Science. 1987; 236: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), cytokines transmit specific signals to multipotent hemopoietic cells, thereby directing lineage commitment. We showed here that the differentiation-competent LGM-1 cell transformants expressing the dominant negative STAT3 grow without differentiation in response to G-CSF. These results indicate that the G-CSF-induced proliferation signal alone is not sufficient to induce the terminal differentiation and that G-CSF actively transmits the differentiation signal (9Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Löwenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), supporting the instructive model for the G-CSF-induced terminal differentiation into neutrophils, at least in LGM-1 cells. We showed that the differentiation signals evoked by G-CSF include growth arrest and the down-regulation of c-myc, both of which are mediated by activated STAT3. G-CSF induces the c-myc expression, and it is observed in cells expressing the truncated G-CSFR that cannot activate STAT3 (22de Koning J.P. Dong F. Smith L. Schelen A.M. Barge R.M. van der Plas D.C. Hoefsloot L.H. Löwenberg B. Touw I.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the induction and repression of the c-myc gene is regulated by different mechanisms. Thus, the intact G-CSFR should transduce both the proliferation signal (activation of the c-myc gene), and the signal causing growth arrest (the repression of the c-mycexpression). LGM-1 cells eventually cease growing and terminally differentiate in response to G-CSF (10Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that the signal for growth arrest predominates over the signal to stimulate proliferation. On the other hand, G-CSF stimulates the proliferation of FDC-P1 and BAF cells without inducing growth arrest (7Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.-X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since G-CSF activates STAT3 in these cell lines, 2A. Yoshikawa and S. Nagata, unpublished observations.these results suggest that the downstream signaling machinery that induces growth arrest is in LGM-1 cells, which are committed to the neutrophilic granulocyte lineage, but not in the early myeloid precursor FDC-P1 or proB BAF cells. This assumption probably holds for the IL-6 and LIF systems, because IL-6 and LIF induce the differentiation of mouse myeloid M1 cells but stimulate proliferation of myeloma or embryonic stem cells (39Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms behind G-CSF-induced growth arrest, it will be necessary to identify the protein that can be specifically activated by STAT3 in LGM-1 cells but not in FDC-P1 or BAF cells. Unlike the growth arrest that was inhibited by the dominant negative STAT3, the G-CSF-induced MPO gene expression was not affected by the dominant negative STAT3, suggesting that the differentiation signals from the G-CSFR can be separated into two pathways. This scheme agrees with the recent report that the 32D myeloid cells overexpressing Bcl-2 undergo the morphological change into neutrophilic granulocytes without G-CSF but do not express the MPO gene (47Rodel J.E. Link D.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 858-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we mutated one of the tyrosine residues of the G-CSFR (Tyr-703) to phenylalanine. The mutated receptor could transduce neither the signal for the G-CSF-induced morphological change nor the induction of the MPO gene, suggesting that a protein(s) that can associate with this region is responsible for these differentiation signals (10Yoshikawa A. Murakami H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified several proteins that can bind to the phosphorylated peptide carrying Tyr-703. 3A. Fujii, H. Murakami, and S. Nagata, unpublished observation. One of these was STAT3, but several other proteins specifically bound to this peptide. It is possible that some of them are responsible for activating the MPO gene. In any case, our results suggest that the G-CSF-induced differentiation into neutrophilic granulocytes is not mediated by a single pathway, rather it is mediated by the concerted action of multiple signaling pathways. We thank Dr. H. Murakami for helpful discussion, and S. Kumagai for secretarial assistance."

In vitro, Rho-kinase, which is activated by Rho, phosphorylates not only myosin light chain (MLC) (thereby activating myosin ATPase) but also myosin phosphatase, thus inactivating myosin phosphatase. Rho-kinase is involved in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in fibroblasts. Here we show that the expression of constitutively active Rho-kinase increased the level of MLC phosphorylation. The activity of Rho-kinase was necessary for maintaining the vinculin-containing focal adhesions, whereas organized actin stress fibers were not necessary for this. The microinjection of constitutively active Rho-kinase into fibroblasts induced the formation of focal adhesions to some extent under the conditions where organized actin stress fibers were disrupted. The expression of constitutively active Rho-kinase also stimulated the transcriptional activity of c-fos serum response element. These results suggest that Rho-kinase has distinct roles in divergent pathways downstream of Rho, which include MLC phosphorylation leading to stress fiber formation, focal adhesion formation, and gene expression.

Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They have GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms, which are interconvertible by GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase reactions. Members of the Rho family including RhoA, B, and C, Rac1 and 2, and Cdc42 share more than 50% sequence identity with each other (1Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Rho regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in response to extracellular signals such as lysophosphatidic acid and certain growth factors (2Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Specific targets of Rho are thought to mediate signals from Rho and to exert their biological functions. We have identified three target proteins of Rho: protein kinase N (17Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y.

Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). p160 Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase is an isoform of Rho-kinase (22Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K.

Rho-kinase phosphorylates MBS and consequently inactivates myosin phosphatase (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Rho-kinase also phosphorylates MLC and thereby activates myosin ATPase (23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

Constitutively active Rho-kinase can induce the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions when injected into intact cells (24Leung T. Chen X.Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Other targets of Rho with unknown functions include rhophilin, rhotekin, and citron (18Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To explore further the functions of Rho-kinase among these targets of Rho, we examined the effects of constitutively active Rho-kinase on cytoskeletal rearrangements and gene expression. We found that the expression of constitutively active Rho-kinase induced MLC phosphorylation, regulated the organization of myosin, and stimulated the transcriptional activity of c-fos SRE. GST-CAT and GST-CAT-KD were produced in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9 cells) with a baculovirus system and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column as described (23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K.

For microinjection, GST-C3 and GST-RhoAI41 were cleaved with thrombin, purified to remove the GST, and concentrated (33Bar-Sagi D.

Anti-vinculin antibody, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, and anti-MLC antibody were purchased from Sigma. Anti-MLC-pS19 monoclonal antibody was prepared, and the method will be described elsewhere. 2Yano, T., Shibata, M., Tokui, T., Ichikawa, H., Ikebe, R., and Ikebe, M., unpublished data. Calyculin A and cytochalasin D were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Corp. All materials used in the nucleic acid study were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. The cDNA fragment of RhoAI41 was generated by the site-directed mutagenesis of Asn-41 to Ile-41 and subcloned into pGEX-2T to yield pGEX-RhoAI41. pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 was constructed as described (17Amano M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). pEF-BOS-myc-CAT, pEF-BOS-myc-CAT-KD, and pEF-BOS-myc-COIL were constructed as described (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment of MLC was subcloned into the BamHI site of pEF-BOS-myc to yield pEF-BOS-myc-MLC. For gene expression analysis, two copies of SRE.L (5′-GGTACCTCGAGCATGTACTGTATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTATGTACTGTATGTCCATATTAGGACATCTGGATCC-3′) were inserted into the KpnI and BamHI sites of pGVB-tk-luciferase to yield SRE.L-luciferase. pGVB-tk-luciferase contains thymidine kinase promoter. The cDNA fragment encodingE. coli β-galactosidase was inserted into theNotI site of pME18S which contains SRα promoter to yield pME18S-lacZ. COS7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Transfection of plasmids into COS7 cells was carried out by the standard DEAE-dextran method (36Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on a 60-mm dish at a cell density of 5 × 105cells/dish in DMEM with 10% FBS and cultured overnight. The medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS 2 h before transfection. The DEAE-dextran/DNA mixture was prepared and added to the dish with gentle agitation. After 2 h, the cells were treated with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide and phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS for 1 day and then in DMEM for 1 day. In some experiments, cells were treated with calyculin A (0.1 μm) for 10 min. The cells were treated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. REF52 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were seeded at a density of 1–3 × 103 cells onto 12-mm glass coverslips and cultured for 1–2 days. Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were seeded at a density of 8–10 × 103cells onto 12-mm glass coverslips. After culturing for 4 days, the cells were serum starved for 24 h in DMEM. Recombinant proteins were microinjected along with a marker protein (rabbit IgG at 1 mg/ml) into the cytoplasm of cells. Cells were pretreated with 0.1 μm cytochalasin D for 30 min before the microinjection. After injection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Actin, vinculin, MLC, and phosphorylated MLC were visualized by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin and antibodies to vinculin, to MLC, and to phosphorylated MLC, respectively, as described (2Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% calf serum. Transfection of plasmids into NIH 3T3 cells was carried out by the standard calcium phosphate method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on a 35-mm dish at a cell density of 6 × 104 cells/dish in DMEM with 10% calf serum and cultured overnight. The medium was replaced by DMEM with 10% calf serum and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5, 2 h before transfection. A calcium phosphate/DNA mixture was prepared and added to the dish with gentle agitation. After 16 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min twice and grown in DMEM for 36 h. After transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/PO4 at pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for enzyme assays. For the luciferase assay, the supernatant was incubated in 440 μl of the reaction mixture (20 mmTricine/NaOH at pH 7.8, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33 mmdithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μm5′-ATP·2Na, 477 μmd-luciferin potassium salt) at room temperature. The luciferase activity was measured by lumiphotometer (model TD-4000, Labo Science, Tokyo, Japan) and is presented as the level normalized with β-galactosidase activity. For the β-galactosidase assay, the supernatant was incubated in 150 μl of reaction buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4·12H2O, 40 mmNaH2PO4·2H2O, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 48 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 330 μg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside) at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 mNa2CO3, and the absorbance at 415 nm was measured. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (39Harlow E. Lame D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-504Google Scholar). We showed previously that the catalytic domain of Rho-kinase (CAT) serves as the constitutively active form (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). To express the various forms of Rho-kinase in mammalian cells, the cDNAs encoding myc-tagged full-length Rho-kinase, CAT and catalytic domain mutated at the ATP binding site (CAT-KD) were cloned into the pEF-BOS-myc expression plasmid. Plasmids encoding the full-length Rho-kinase, CAT, and CAT-KD were transfected into COS7 cells. The various forms of Rho-kinase were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody (9E10) from lysate of the cells transfected with these plasmids. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The various forms of Rho-kinase were all expressed in COS7 cells (data not shown). We demonstrated previously that Rho-kinase phosphorylates the MBS of myosin phosphatase, thereby inhibiting myosin phosphatase activity, and that Rho-kinase also phosphorylates MLC at Ser-19 directly in vitro (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Rho-kinase elevates the level of MLC phosphorylation, resulting in an enhancement of the actin-myosin interaction for stress fiber formation in intact cells. The microinjection of CAT into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells induces stress fiber formation (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rho-kinase could elevate the level of MLC phosphorylation in vivo, monoclonal antibody against MLC phosphorylated at Ser-19 (anti-MLC-pS19 antibody) was used. The specificity of this antibody was examined by immunoblot analysis. Equal amounts of MLC with various ratios between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms were loaded on the gel. MLC phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro was specifically detected by the anti-MLC-pS19 antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Because the amount of endogenous MLC expressed in COS7 cells was insufficient to analyze the effect of Rho-kinase on the level of MLC phosphorylation, pEF-BOS-myc-MLC was cotransfected with plasmids carrying the RhoAV14 or Rho-kinase cDNAs into COS7 cells. The level of MLC phosphorylation was low in serum-starved COS7 cells expressing myc-MLC alone. When the cells were treated with calyculin A, which is a phosphatase inhibitor, the level of MLC phosphorylation was increased (Fig. 2), indicating that the activity of phosphatases was involved in the regulation of the level of MLC phosphorylation in the resting COS7 cells. The expression of RhoAV14 or CAT, but not CAT-KD, increased the MLC phosphorylation. Full-length Rho-kinase had no effect on the MLC phosphorylation. These results indicate that constitutively active Rho-kinase elevates the level of MLC phosphorylation in intact cells. Because Rho-kinase can regulate the level of MLC phosphorylation in vitro (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) and in vivo, we then examined the distribution of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated myosin by immunostaining in REF52 cells that were microinjected with C3, GTPγS·RhoAI41 (containing the substitution of Asn for Ile), or CAT. C3 ADP-ribosylates Rho at Asn-41 and inactivates it, whereas RhoI41 fails to be ADP-ribosylated by C3 (4Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). REF52 cells grown in 10% FBS had many actin stress fibers and vinculin-containing focal adhesions and showed a filamentous periodical pattern of myosin on stress fibers (Fig.3). Phosphorylated myosin showed a pattern similar to that of myosin, suggesting that most of the myosin was on stress fibers and phosphorylated under these conditions. The microinjection of C3 into REF52 cells disrupted the stress fibers and focal adhesions to some degree, perturbed the filamentous pattern of myosin, and decreased the phosphorylated myosin staining. Under these conditions, most of the myosin was scattered in the cytoplasm, whereas the phosphorylated myosin was clustered over the nucleus to some extent, although the meaning of this staining is not known. The coinjection of GTPγS·RhoAI41 or CAT with C3 reversed the effects of C3. Therefore, Rho-kinase is thought to mediate signals from Rho and to maintain cytoskeletal organization. In the case of cells injected with CAT, the stress fibers sometimes attached to each other at a certain point in the presence or absence of C3. Nobes and Hall (40Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar) proposed that Rho induces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in independent pathways. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge (41Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) proposed that the contractility of actin stress fibers triggered by myosin phosphorylation drives focal adhesion formation. We found that Rho-kinase elevates the level of MLC phosphorylation in vitro (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 23Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) and in vivo and that constitutively active Rho-kinase enhances the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in Swiss 3T3 cells (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions diverges downstream of Rho-kinase, we examined stress fiber and focal adhesion formation by CAT in the presence of cytochalasin D, which specifically inhibits actin polymerization. The treatment of REF52 cells with cytochalasin D disrupted stress fibers but not focal adhesions (Fig.4). The microinjection of C3 into REF52 cells resulted in the loss of both stress fibers and focal adhesions (Figs. 3 and 4). These results suggest that actin stress fibers are not necessary for maintaining focal adhesions, whereas Rho is required for maintaining them. The microinjection of CAT or CAT with C3 in the presence of cytochalasin D conferred actin aggregates with a few short actin stress fibers and apparently normal focal adhesions (Fig. 4). This indicates that Rho-kinase prevents the effects of C3 and may be involved in maintaining focal adhesions. It may be noted that the microinjection of CAT induced the stellate actin clusters in the cytochalasin D-treated cells, whereas it induced the actin clusters connected to the striated actin fibers in the nontreated cells. The active Rho-kinase may induce the aggregation of short fragments of the actin fibers and subsequently the formation of the stellate actin clusters free from the striated actin fibers that are disrupted by cytochalasin D. We further examined whether Rho-kinase could induce the new synthesis of focal adhesions in a manner independent of actin stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells. Serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells had very few stress fibers and focal adhesions, and the microinjection of CAT into the cells induced both (Fig. 5) as described previously (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). In the presence of cytochalasin D, the microinjection of CAT failed to induce stress fiber formation but induced focal adhesion formation, although the focal adhesions were smaller than those in the absence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 5). Rho has been reported to induce the transcriptional activation of the c-fos SRE mediated by SRF (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rho-kinase mediates the Rho-induced transcriptional activation, we examined the regulation of c-fos SRE by Rho-kinase. A fusion gene (SRE.L-luciferase) containing SRE.L (which is linked to the coding sequence of the firefly luciferase gene) was used as a reporter. SRE.L is a derivative of c-fos SRE and contains an intact binding site for SRF but lacks the ternary complex factor binding site (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

The cotransfection of SRE.L-luciferase and pME18S-lacZ with pEF-BOS-myc-CAT into NIH 3T3 cells increased the luciferase activity to an extent similar to that observed when the cells were cotransfected with pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 (Fig.6). pEF-BOS-myc-Rho-kinase had a weaker stimulatory effect. pEF-BOS-myc-CAT-KD was inactive in this capacity. Neither pEF-BOS-myc-CAT nor pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 had a stimulatory effect when the cells were transfected with pGVB-tk-luciferase, which lacks the SRE.L elements. pEF-BOS-myc-CAT-KD but not pEF-BOS-myc-COIL (which encodes the coiled-coil domain of Rho-kinase lacking the Rho binding domain) inhibited the SRE.L-luciferase expression induced by RhoAV14 or CAT (Fig.7). The inhibitory effect of CAT-KD was weaker on CAT than on RhoAV14. These results suggest that Rho-kinase is implicated in the SRE activation regulated by Rho.Figure 7Effect of Rho and Rho-kinase on SRE-linked transcriptional activation. NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with SRE.L-luciferase (1 μg), pME18S-lacZ (3 μg), and pEF-BOS-HA-RhoAV14 (0.6 μg) or pEF-BOS-myc-CAT (0.6 μg), together with either pEF-BOS-myc (3.4 μg), pEF-BOS-myc-COIL (3.4 μg), or pEF-BOS-myc-CAT-KD (3.4 μg). The luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here, we demonstrated that constitutively active Rho-kinase (CAT) increases the level of MLC phosphorylation in COS7 cells to an extent similar to that obtained by activated Rho. Full-length Rho-kinase had no effect under the same conditions, indicating that full-length Rho-kinase is almost inactive in intact cells. The kinase-negative CAT (CAT-KD) had no effect. CAT-KD is thought to serve as the dominant negative form for the Rho-induced stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). CAT-KD did not inhibit the Rho-induced MLC phosphorylation in COS7 cells (data not shown). CAT-KD is thought to titrate out substrates for Rho-kinase, thereby inhibiting Rho-kinase. CAT-KD may not efficiently tie up MLC because MLC was overexpressed in the COS7 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Rho-kinase induces MLC phosphorylation in vivo downstream of Rho. We showed previously that Rho-kinase elevates the level of MLC phosphorylation in vitro via the direct phosphorylation of MLC and the inhibition of myosin phosphatase (21Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M.

It remains to be clarified which pathway mainly contributes to the elevation of the levels of MLC phosphorylation in intact cells. REF52 cells grown in the presence of serum had many stress fibers and focal adhesions. The MLC staining in these cells is the discrete fibrous pattern as described (41Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated MLC showed a similar pattern. Thus, some MLC is thought to be phosphorylated and to exist on stress fibers. The microinjection of C3 disrupted both stress fibers and focal adhesions to some degree. C3 also perturbed the fibrous pattern of MLC and reduced the phosphorylated MLC content. The coinjection of GTPγS· RhoAI41 or CAT with C3 reversed the inhibitory effect of C3, suggesting that Rho increases the level of MLC phosphorylation to incorporate myosin into stress fibers, most likely through Rho-kinase. This observation is consistent with the notion that the state of MLC phosphorylation regulates the organization of stress fibers (42Kolega J. Nederlof M.A. Taylor D.L. Bioimaging. 1993; 1: 136-150Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The microinjection of CAT appears to cause cross-linking between stress fibers. The reason why such a pattern is observed when the cells were injected with CAT is unclear. Other signals from Rho or the proper localization of Rho-kinase may be necessary to organize stress fibers normally as discussed (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The microinjection of Rho-kinase in Swiss 3T3 cells induces the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (25Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MLC induced by Rho-kinase stimulates the actin-myosin interaction, which may be one of the final steps of stress fiber formation. We further investigated whether MLC phosphorylation is sufficient for focal adhesion formation. For this purpose, we examined the effects of Rho-kinase in the presence of cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin polymerization and thereby inhibits the contractility of actin stress fibers induced by actin-myosin interaction. In the REF52 cells, actin stress fibers became thinner or disappeared by the treatment with cytochalasin D, whereas there was no remarkable change in vinculin-containing focal adhesions under the same conditions. As shown above, C3 disrupted the focal adhesions, whereas the C3 effect was blocked by coinjection with CAT regardless of the presence of cytochalasin D. These results suggest that the maintenance of mature focal adhesion does not require highly organized actin stress fibers but does require the activity of Rho or Rho-kinase. To examine whether organized actin stress fibers are necessary for triggering focal adhesion formation, we injected CAT into serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells in the presence of cytochalasin D. Consequently, the focal adhesions were newly synthesized, but they were smaller than those induced by CAT in the absence of cytochalasin D. Thus, it seems likely that CAT can stimulate focal adhesion formation, although it may be insufficient to complete it. Focal adhesion formation appears to be partly linked to actin stress fiber formation. Organized actin stress fibers and their contractility induced by actin-myosin interaction may be necessary to form mature focal adhesions, as described (41Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely that Rho-kinase phosphorylates certain proteins that trigger focal adhesion formation. It was shown that Rho regulates the transcriptional activation by SRF (16Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). PRK2 shows strong sequence homology with protein kinase N (43Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is identified as a Rho target (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K.

PRK2 weakly potentiates the transcriptional activation of SRE by activated Rho (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28772-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Consistently, the constitutively active form of protein kinase N weakly activates SRE (up to 2-fold) (data not shown). We showed in this study that CAT strongly activates SRE and that CAT-KD inhibits the activation of SRE by CAT or RhoAV14. The inhibitory effect of CAT-KD is weaker on the CAT-induced SRE activation than on that induced by RhoAV14. CAT-KD may not efficiently inhibit the activity of CAT which is exogenously overexpressed. Taken together, these results indicate that Rho-kinase can serve as a mediator of the signaling pathway for the transcriptional activation of SRE by RhoAV14. It remains to be determined whether the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions controls the SRE-linked transcriptional activation. We showed here that Rho-kinase regulates both cytoskeletal organization, including stress fiber and focal adhesion formation and enhancement of MLC phosphorylation, and gene expression downstream of Rho. Thus, Rho-kinase may mediate plural pathways from Rho and function in cooperation with other Rho targets. The identification of physiological substrates for Rho-kinase is necessary to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the phenomena induced by Rho-kinase. To date, the MBS of myosin phosphatase and MLC have been identified as physiological substrates for Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase phosphorylates several proteins such as GFAP stoichiometrically (45Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the case of GFAP, the phosphorylation of the head domain by Rho-kinase induces the disassembly of GFAP (45Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition to MBS, MLC, and GFAP, we speculate that Rho-kinase phosphorylates at least two classes of proteins; 1) protein(s) that can stimulate focal adhesion formation, and 2) protein(s) implicated in gene expression via SRF. Further studies are necessary to identify these substrates for Rho-kinase. We thank M. Ito (Mie University School of Medicine) for providing chicken MLC, A.

The major component of the amyloid deposit is a 4.2-kDa polypeptide termed amyloid β-protein of 39–43 residues, which is derived from processing of a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). It is hypothesized that a chymotrypsin-like enzyme is involved in the processing of APP.We have discovered a new serine protease from the AD brain by polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA sequences representing active site homologous regions of chymotrypsin-like enzymes. A cDNA clone was identified as one out of one million that encodes Zyme, a serine protease. Messenger RNA encoding Zyme can be detected in some mammalian species but not in mice, rats, or hamster. Zyme is expressed predominantly in brain, kidney, and salivary gland. Zyme mRNA cannot be detected in fetal brain but is seen in adult brain.

After the deduced amino acid sequence of APP was revealed, a number of laboratories initiated studies to purify and characterize the N-terminal cleaving enzyme of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), termed β-secretase (1Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the Met596-Asp597 bond of the full-length APP generates the N-terminal amino acid of Aβ, which was first shown by Glenner and Wong (2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar) to be aspartic acid. β-Secretase is yet an unidentified protease. Several themes and strategies influenced the direction of investigation of β-secretase. The first strategy was to follow a traditional biochemical purification. Assays were utilized in which short peptide substrates were substituted for the large transmembrane precursor protein (1Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Any enzyme capable of making a methionine (M)/aspartic acid (D) cleavage could be designated a potential β-secretase. The second theme, since the amino acid that surrounded the N terminus of Aβ was found to be a methionine, was some laboratories have rationalized that a search for an enzyme with chymotrypsin-like specificity (a specificity for cleavage of subtrates containing a neutral hydrophobic residue at the S1 subsite) was necessary (3Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 80: 561-565Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Nelson R.B. Siman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3836-3843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Abraham C.R. Driscoll J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16699-16705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the second approach, we have developed a method to identify chymotrypsin-like enzymes. The amino acid sequences of several chymotrypsin-like enzymes were compared, and regions of at least four amino acids of homology were identified. Specifically, the deduced amino acid sequences of rat and mouse mast cell proteases, human cathepsin G, granzymes, and chymotrypsin were compared, and consensus sequences were identified. The motifs TAAHC, DIMLL, and GDSGGPL contain the active histidine (H), aspartic acid (D), and serine (S), which are part of the active site/charge-relay system of serine proteases. Oligonucleotides directed toward these active site regions were used as primers for the polymerase chain reaction amplication of relevant cDNAs. A novel serine protease, given the name Zyme, has been identified using this technology from Alzheimer's disease brain. The Zyme cDNA sequence is highly homologous to human trypsinogens I-IV and human kallikreins (like prostate-specific antigen) and is tissue-specific for brain, kidney, and salivary gland. Zyme sequence is conserved in many mammalian species but is not detected in rats, mice, and hamsters. It is expressed predominantly in normal and AD adult brain and is not detected in human fetal brain. The Zyme gene maps to chromosome 19q13.3. When Zyme cDNA was co-expressed with the APP 695 cDNA in 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells), amyloidogenic fragments were detected by Western blot analysis using antibody to the C terminus of APP. The co-transfected cells release an altered pattern of Aβ products. Zyme can be immunolocalized to perivascular cells in primate and AD brain tissue. Since perivascular cells are thought to be the progenitor cells to microglial cells, the potential role for Zyme in AD pathology may evolve from its activity in activated microglial cells known to surround neuritic plaques.

All radioisotopes were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Tricine gels and buffers for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from ISS Inc. and Novex. Reagents for the ECL-Western blot analysis were purchased from Amersham Corp. Reagents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Human poly(A)+ messenger RNA was purchased from CLONTECH. Brain tissue (AD and normal) and APP C-terminal rabbit antisera (BX6) were the kind gifts of Athena Neurosciences. Brain tissue was obtained from normal adult female rhesus monkeys. Library screening, 32P-labeling, ligations, restriction digests, the kinase reaction, and all other molecular biology techniques were performed as described in Sambrooket al. (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. LINEUP and PRETTY algorithms of the Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group Program Package (9Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version September, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar) were used to identify consensus sequences of some chymotrypsin-like enzymes. Human cathepsin G, granzymes, chymotrypsin, and mouse and human mast cell protease amino acid sequences were aligned, and the following consensus sequences were revealed: IIGG, PHSRPYMA, CGGFL, TAAHC, DIMLL, TLREV, GDSGGPL, and VAHGI. Only TAAHC, DIMLL, and GDSCGGPL (active site homologous regions) were used for PCR primer design. The sequence of the PCR primers for molecular enzymology experiments were essentially based on Lathe's rule (10Lathe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). TAAHC = GTG (A/C)TG ACA GCT GCC CAC TG, DIMLL (forward) = GAC ATC ATG CTG (A/C)AG CTG and (reverse) CAG CT(G/T) CAG CAG CAT GAT GTC, and GDSGGPL = CAG GGG GCC GCC GGA GTC GCC. Additional bases were added to increase the length of the PCR primer. Total RNA was extracted from human brain superior frontal gyrus using RNAgent's Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega), and complementary DNA was generated using random hexamers essentially as described by Gerard et al. (11Gerard G.F. D'Alessio J.M. Kotewicz M.L. Focus. 1989; 11: 66-69Google Scholar). PCRs were performed at 94 °C for 1 min, at 52–55 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles using the TAAHC and GDSGGPL primers. PCR products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization to an internal probe (DIMLL primer). PCR products bands that were 450–500 bp and hybridized to the internal probe were excised, and a second round of PCR amplification was conducted using the TAAHC probe and the DIMLL (reverse) probe. PCR products that were 160–180-bp in size were subcloned into pUC18 and pGEM3Z, transformed into DH5α, and then sequenced. Clone 56Z contained an open reading frame containing active site homologous regions consistent with a serine protease and will hereby be referred to as Zyme. DNA sequence from clone 56Z was used as template for subsequent hybridization experiments. A cDNA library was constructed using AD brain mRNA with the Superscript Lambda System for cDNA Synthesis and Lambda Cloning (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR primers representing the unique DNA sequence of clone 56Z (ZYME 3, 5′-AACCGAATCTTCAGGTCTTCCTGGG-3′, and ZYME 4, 5′-ATGGCTGGCGGCATCATAGTCAGGG-3′) were used to create an α-32P-labeled probe for library screening essentially as described by Schowalter and Sommer (12Schowalter D.B. Sommer S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This probe will be subsequently referred to as Zyme 3–4. Out of 1 × 106phage plated, one clone of 1451 bp was isolated. DNA sequence was determined by Lark Sequencing Technologies, Inc. A human chromosome 19 genomic library was purchased from ATCC (No. 57711) with the Escherichia coli host strain LE392 (No. 33572). The Zyme 3–4 radiolabeled probe was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A genomic clone was isolated by conventional screening of Charon 21A phage libraries (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA from a positive phage, 66zyme, containing an insert of 4.2 kb was digested from Charon 21A using HindIII and subsequently subcloned into pUC-18. The 4.2-kb fragment was then random primed for synthesis of a probe used for chromosome localization by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis by BIOS Laboratories (New Haven, CT). A Zyme cDNA fragment spanning nucleotides 169–336 was subcloned into the SmaI site of pGEM-3Z. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) template for in vitro transcription was purchased from Ambion Inc. For in vitro transcription of suitable antisense cRNA, pGEM-3Z was linearized with HindIII. Template cDNA was gel purified after separation on a 1% Tris borate/EDTA-agarose gel using the Prep-a-gene (Bio-Rad). In vitro transcription was performed according to the manufacturer protocol (Promega) except that 50 μCi of [32P]UTP at 400 Ci/mmol were used in the absense of cold UTP. Transcription reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then the cDNA template was removed by the addition of 1 unit of RNase-free DNase. Unincorporated [32P]UTP was removed by size fractionation over a Sephadex G-50 RNA column, and the in vitro transcribed probe was quantitated using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. RNase protection assays were performed according to the manufacturer instructions (Ambion Inc.) with minor modifications. Twenty μg of total RNA were incubated with the radiolabeled cRNA probes in hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, and 1 mm EDTA), heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Single-stranded RNA and free probe were digested by adding 5 units/ml RNase A and 200 units/ml RNase T1 for 30 min at 37 °C. The RNase was inactivated with the addition of 300 μl of inactivation/precipitation buffer. The samples were precipitated by incubating at −20 °C for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protected fragments were resuspended in loading buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, electrophoresed on Tris borate/EDTA-polyacrylamide/urea gels, dried, and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C. The 1.4-kb Zyme cDNA was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). The expression vectors containing APP 695 and APP 751 have been previously described (13Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Cultured 293 cells (ATCC No. CRL 1573) were transfected in 6-well dishes using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (14Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in medium containing Ham's F-12:DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Life Technologies, Inc.), 3:1, with 5% fetal calf serum. After transfection, medium was changed, and cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide, 95% air atmosphere. Cell pellets and culture media were harvested in Tricine sample buffer in preparation for Western blot analysis. Human 293 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the 1.4-kb Zyme cDNA were subjected to selection by growth in G418 (400 μg/ml) for 3 weeks, after which time stable transformants were isolated. Clone 5 generated identifiable amounts of Zyme protein in the culture medium. Zyme has a putative activation peptide, EEQNK, analogous to the activation peptide of other serine proteases. Auto-activation of the enzyme was accomplished by concentrating the cell culture supernatants approximately 10-fold and then leaving the concentrate at 4 °C for approximately 1 week before purification. Purification of Zyme from the concentrated cell culture supernatants was achieved by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (C-8, Aquapore RP-300, 0.45 × 25 cm, Applied Biosystems) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Generally, the gradient increased at a rate of 1% acetonitrile/min. Fractions containing Zyme were located by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, collected, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C (15Little S.P. Johnstone E. Dixon E. Norris F. Buckly W. Beckner G.

Western blot analysis was conducted essentially as described by Johnstone et al. (16Johnstone E.M. Oltersdorf T. Bales K.R. Chaney M.O. Santerre R.F. Little S.P. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 180: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Zyme antibody (No. 274) was prepared by immunization with a peptide representing residues 72–88 of the deduced amino acid sequence of Zyme (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were incubated for 2 h in methionine-free, serum-free DMEM and labeled overnight with 300 μCi/ml [35S]Met (NEN Life Science Products) in serum-free DMEM. Cell culture medium was subjected to immune precipitation with the monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Senetek) essentially as described by Weidemann et al. (17Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuter K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Monoclonal 4G8 is reactive to amino acid residues 17–24 of β amyloid peptide. Immune complexes were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 12.5% Tris-Tricine gel (Daiichi) and subjected to autofluorography. Rhesus monkey brain (n = 3) was perfusion fixed and frozen. Human AD brain was immersion fixed, cryoprotected, and frozen. Four separate cortical regions were analyzed using anti-Zyme antibody 274 and an immunoperoxidate stain (ABC kit). For double immunostaining, sections of AD cortex were first labeled with Zyme antiserum (1:500) using an avidin-biotin detection system. Subsequently, sections were incubated with monoclonal antibody to von Willebrand's factor VIII (1:10; Boehringer Mannheim) or to HLADR (prediluted; Biogenex Labs, San Ramon, CA). The monoclonal was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-fast red detection system. Sections were mounted in 70% glycerol and examined using a Nikon Microphot microscope equipped with Nomarsky optics. We have designed PCR primers to the active site amino acid sequence of those enzymes that are thought to be chymotrypsin-like and have identified serine proteases. Our primers reflected codon usage (Lathe's rules (10Lathe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar)) rather than degeneracy. The first subcloned PCR product was identical in sequence to human tissue plasminogen activator, serine protease (data not shown). The second PCR product represented the unique Zyme sequence. Only 1 phage in 106 was identified in our human brain cDNA library. The Zyme transcript consists of 1451 bp, and the open reading frame encodes a protein of 244 amino acids (Fig.1 A). Residues surrounding the presumed initiation codon at +1 (CGGCCAUGA) are consistent with the Kozak consensus sequence (CC(G/A)GCCAUGG) (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 8: 5233-5262Crossref Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 19Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). One polyadenylation site is seen at +1245 bases. The active site homologous sequences are shown as TAAHC, DIMLL, and GDSGGPL. The chymotrypsin-like consenses sequences, IIGG and PHSRPYMA, which were not a part of the active site, were not conserved. Amino acid residue 136 is a possible site for Asn-linked glycosylation. A hydropathic analysis of Zyme in Fig. 1 B shows an extremely hydrophobic region representing the first 20 residues, a presumed signal peptide. When the amino acid sequence was analyzed using the alogorithm FASTA,Xenopus laevis trypsinogen was found to have the highest identity with Zyme (45%). To predict the phylogenetic relatedness of Zyme with other human serine proteases, enzymes identified by FASTA were used in the PILEUP program of the Genetic Computer Group Package software (Fig. 2). The Zyme amino acid sequence was aligned with a group of proteases that does include chymotrypsin, human trypsinogens I-IV, the glandular kallikreins 1 and 2, and prostate-specific antigen. Enzymes like cathepsin G and granzyme A showed less similarity to Zyme. To better characterize the predicted structural motifs of Zyme, enzymes found to be similar to Zyme were aligned using the ALIGNMENT software of GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics, Inc.). Fig.3 shows the output alignment. Zyme appears to show homology with several regions of the kallikreins as well as the trypsinogens. In the region shown by a solid bar, residues VPFDDDK of trypsin IV represents the activation peptide domain, whereas PLILSR represents the activation peptide of prostate-specific antigen (20Henttu P. Vihko P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Zyme-predicted activation peptide shows little similarity to either pro-peptide. 10 of the 12 cysteine residues align well with cysteine residues in the kallikreins and trypsinogens. Two cysteine residues, as noted with stars, are not in alignment and may represent other regions of Zyme-specific interaction. The amino acid sequence surrounding the active site cysteine suggests that Zyme is more closely related to the kallikreins than the trypsinogens. The stippled region indicates an 11 amino acid loop characteristic of the kallikreins not noted in the Zyme primary sequence. The adjacent aspartic acid active site (residues 59–63) shows conservation and similarity to both the kallikreins and the trypsinogens. The serine active site (residues 195–205) shows remarkable similarity as well. The above discussion is meant to simply show predictive properties of Zyme based on homology with other proteases. To determine the evolutionary relatedness of Zyme DNA sequence, a blot containing genomic DNA of multiple species was hybridized under stringent conditions (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the Zyme 3–4 probe (Fig.4). The degree of relatedness is shown by the presence of comparable hybridization signals. It appears that bands of human and marmoset DNA gave signals of similar intensity, whereas the bands of cat and dog DNA share weak homology and gave less intense signals. Hybridization with cat and dog may indicate the presence of other related sequences. Note that some species showed no homology with Zyme. The fact that the human probe did not hybridize with several mammalian genomic DNAs may show that Zyme shows species specificity. When the complete Zyme cDNA is used as a probe, some bands are visible in all species under reduced stringency (data not shown). RNase protection analysis, using a probe consisting of nucleotides 169–336, was conducted to determine the tissue distribution of Zyme transcripts. A survey of several tissues (liver, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, spleen, and testes) shows that more Zyme transcript is present in brain than other organs (Fig.5). It is interesting to note that Zyme RNA is not detectable in human fetal brain but is present in the adult brain tissue. Transcripts from AD and normal brain were compared by RNase protection analysis to a “housekeeping gene,” GAPDH (Fig.6). The overall ratio of Zyme transcript to GAPDH transcript is higher in AD than in normal cortex. This suggests that Zyme transcripts may be elevated in AD over the level of a major glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH. Later in our discussion of Zyme immunolocalization, we will show that Zyme is present in perivascular and microglia; therefore, perhaps the elevation of Zyme transcription may reflect the changes toward the active state of microglia known to exist in AD pathology (1Schenk D.B. Rydel R.E. May P. Little S. Panetta J. Lieberburg I. Sinha S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4141-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Chromosomal Localization and FISH–The chromosomal localization of Zyme was determined by Southern analysis of DNA from a somatic hamster/mouse cell hybrid panel (BIOS Laboratories). The Zyme 3–4 probe, described under “Experimental Procedures,” hybridized only to human specific bands. Discordance analysis (Table I) allows localization of Zyme to chromosome 19 (the lowest percent discordance is 0.4). FISH further confirmed localization to chromosome 19q13.3 (BIOS Laboratories) (Fig. 7). A total of 85 metaphase cells were analyzed using the 4.2-kb Zyme genomic clone 66zyme as probe. Another marker, E2A (21Mellentin J.D. Murre C. Donlon T.A. McCaw P.S. Smith S.D. Carroll A.J. McDonald M.E. Baltimore D. Cleary M.L. Science. 1989; 246: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was used to co-localize the Zyme gene to the long arm of chromosome 19. The region 19q13.1–19q13.3 is thought to be a locus for familial Alzheimer's disease (22Pericak-Vance M.A. Bebout J.L. Gaskell Jr., P.C. Yamaoka L.A Hung W.-Y. Alberts M.J. Walker A.P. et al.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 1034-1050PubMed Google Scholar). The apolipoprotein E gene map location is 19q13.2. Although the apoE ε 4 is strongly associated with AD in late onset familial AD families, Yu et al. (23Yu C.E. Payami H. Olson J.M. Boehnke M. Wijsman E.M. Orr H.T. KuKull W.A. Goddard K.A. B Nemens E. White J.A. et al.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 631-642PubMed Google Scholar) have used linkage analysis to demonstrate that the apoE region did not cosegregate with AD in a collection of late onset AD cases, suggesting that apoE is not the major locus. It is likely that Zyme is part of the locus of tissue-specific kallikreins (19q13.3), such as prostate-specific antigen (24Richards R.I. Holman K. Shen Y. Kozman H. Harley H. Brrok D. Shaw D. Genomics. 1991; 11: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and yet its role in familial AD cannot be ruled out until tested.Table IDiscordanceChromosomePercent discordance1282363364325566287248449441032112412321316142815401640174018401904203221202228X44Y40Percent discordance is determined by dividing the sum of the corresponding positive and false positive events by 20 (the number of cell lines analyzed) and then multiplying the resulting fraction by 100.

C-terminal APP fragments were examined as potential amyloidogenic fragments during Zyme co-transfection experiments. For clarity of discussion of our results, we have operationally defined the amyloidogenic fragments by size, encompassing a region large enough to contain Aβ or portions of Aβ and the contiguous C terminus of APP. The resolution of C-terminal fragments using 12.5% Tricine-polyacrylamide gels presents the α-secretase fragment (25Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar) as 10 kDa. A fragment representing the Cys100 residues has an apparent molecular mass of 14 kDa. APP C-terminal fragments greater than 14 kDa are thought to contain additional N-terminal residues as well. Western blot analysis was conducted using a well characterized C-terminal antibody, BX6 (13Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments were performed using APP 695 and APP 751 cDNA and Zyme cDNA in 293 cells. The duration of the transient assay was 48 h, at which time cells and culture media were harvested and analyzed by Western blots using antibody to the C terminus of APP (BX6) or to the Zyme primary sequence (No. 274). The Western blot in Fig. 8 shows that the α-secretase fragment is detected in cells transfected with either APP 695 or APP 751 cDNA (lanes c and e). When cells are co-transfected with Zyme cDNA and APP 695 cDNA (lane d), a plethora of APP C-terminal fragments are detected at 22, 16, and 12 kDa. A less intense band is seen at 45 kDa. One of the fragments appears to migrate slightly faster than a Cys100 fragment in apparent molecular mass. In cells transfected with Zyme cDNA and APP 751 cDNA, there are less apparent changes in the C-terminal amyloidogenic fragments (lane f). The APP 751 form of APP contains the KUNITZ protease inhibitor domain, and we think that it has either inhibited Zyme activity or interfered in steps leading to the activation of Zyme (processing from zymogen to mature enzyme). The 10-kDa non-amyloidogenic fragment increases in both the APP 695 and APP 751 co-transfected cells. This observation suggests that the α-se"

In the heart, sorcin localizes to the dyadic junctions of transverse tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum and coimmunoprecipitates with the Ca2+ release channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR) (Meyers, M. B., Pickel, V. M., Sheu, S.-S., Sharma, V. K., Scotto, K. W., and Fishman, G. I. (1995)J. Biol. Chem.270, 26411–26418). We have investigated a possible functional interaction between sorcin and cardiac RyR using purified recombinant sorcin in [3H]ryanodine binding experiments and single channel recordings of RyR. The open probability of single RyR was decreased significantly by the addition of sorcin to the cytoplasmic side of the channel (IC50 ∼ 480 nm). In addition, sorcin completely inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding with an IC50 ∼ 700 nm. Inhibition occurred over a wide range of [Ca2+], and sorcin-modulated RyR remained Ca2+-dependent. Furthermore, caffeine-activated RyRs were also inhibited by sorcin at low [Ca2+] (pCa 7), suggesting that Ca2+ is not an obligatory factor for sorcin inhibition of RyR. Comparisons of these inhibitory effects with those of calmodulin and calpain, proteins structurally related to sorcin, suggested that the interaction of sorcin with cardiac RyR was distinct from and independent of either of these modulatory proteins. Phosphorylation of sorcin with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A significantly decreased the ability of sorcin to modulate RyR. These results suggest that sorcin may modulate RyR function in a normal cell environment and that the level of modulation is in turn influenced by signaling pathways that increase protein kinase A activity.

Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: C1-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stern M.D. Lakatta E.G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein responsible for Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac muscle is the Ca2+ release channel, a ∼2 million-Da protein that binds ryanodine with high affinity and specificity, hence the name ryanodine receptor (RyR) (3Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Imagawa T. Smith J.S. Coronado R. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A variety of endogenous substances regulate the activity of RyR, including Ca2+ (which is the primary signal for Ca2+release), Mg2+, ATP, H+, calmodulin, and several protein kinases (6Annu. Rev. Physiol. 56, 484–508Meissner, G. Annu. Rev. Physiol., 56, 484–508Google Scholar, 7Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Exogenous substances such as ryanodine (8Meissner G. El-Hashem A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), caffeine (9Rousseau E. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H328-H333PubMed Google Scholar), and scorpion peptides (10El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arévalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although without a role in CICR, also regulate RyRs and have contributed to define their pharmacological profile. Recently it has become evident that a functional Ca2+release channel includes not only the tetrameric RyR, but also the immunophilin FK506-binding protein (11Timerman A. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brillantes A.-M. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasová E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Removal of FK506-binding protein from RyRs induces the appearance of subconducting states and causes the channel to become “leaky.” In neurons the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, is associated with the RyR·FK506-binding protein receptor complex and regulates channel activity (13Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P. Roskams A.J. Ali S.M. Ronnet G.V. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, accessory proteins are also important regulators of RyR activity. Sorcin is a 22-kDa protein originally isolated from multidrug-resistant cells in which it was overexpressed as a result of amplification of the sorcin gene (14Meyers M.B. Heizman C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins: Fundamentals and Clinical Implications. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1991: 385-399Crossref Google Scholar). Although a role for sorcin in multidrug resistance has not been elucidated, the protein may have a normal function as an accessory protein of RyR/Ca2+ release channels. Within the heart, sorcin localizes to the dyadic junctions of transverse tubules and to the SR (15Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.-S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of cardiac lysates with antisera to either sorcin or cardiac RyR recovers both proteins. Moreover, forced expression of sorcin in fibroblasts results in caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ release, suggesting a functional association of sorcin with the RyR (15Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.-S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although sorcin is expressed widely in most tissues, and its complementary DNA predicts an amino acid sequence with some homology to the Ca2+-binding proteins calpain and calmodulin (16Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), its precise functional role in the heart and other tissues is unknown. To explore the potential functional consequences of a RyR-sorcin interaction and its implications for CICR in the heart, we conducted [3H]ryanodine binding experiments and single channel recordings of cardiac RyR and tested the effect of recombinant sorcin. We found that sorcin inhibits RyR activity in a dose-dependent manner via a mechanism different from that exerted by calmodulin or calpain. Furthermore, phosphorylation of sorcin by protein kinase A (PKA) greatly decreases its capacity to inhibit RyRs. These results suggest that sorcin may regulate Ca2+ release in the heart by modulating RyR function. Part of these results have been published in an abstract form (17Lokuta A.J. Sander P.R. Fishman G.I. Meyers M.B. Valdivia H.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 333Google Scholar). Radiolabeled chemicals, [3H]ryanodine (60–80 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), were from NEN Life Science Products. Bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Bovine brain calmodulin, AMP-PCP, caffeine, and the catalytic subunit of PKA were from Sigma. Monoclonal cardiac RyR antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was from Calbiochem. The chemiluminescence detection kit was from Boehringer Mannheim. Precast linear gradient polyacrylamide gels were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were high purity reagent grade. Preparation of the sorcin bacterial expression vector and purification of recombinant sorcin have been described (18Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the studies reported here, bacteria were lysed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EGTA, and supernatants were applied to DEAE ion exchange columns equilibrated with that buffer. Columns were eluted with buffers containing 0–0.5m NaCl, and fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot with sorcin antibody. Sorcin, as a single 22-kDa band, was found in fractions containing 0.14–0.18 m NaCl. Aliquots of the buffer solutions used for sorcin elution were used as control buffers. All binding and planar bilayer solutions contained millimolar EGTA to attenuate any changes in [Ca2+] which micromolar additions of sorcin could otherwise induce. Cardiac SR-enriched microsomes were isolated from combined left and right ventricles of adult pigs by differential centrifugation as described previously (19Lokuta A. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 487: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle SR-enriched microsomes were also isolated by this technique from the hind leg muscles of adult Yorkshire pigs. Briefly, tissues were excised rapidly, placed in a solution containing 0.9% NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 μm leupeptin, and 0.8 μm benzamidine at 4 °C, and homogenized in a Waring blender at high speed for 2 min. Unlysed tissue remaining in the homogenate was further treated with a Brinkmann Polytron (20-μm probe, three times for 15 s each at low speed). The Polytron homogenate was spun at 4,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and spun further at 8,000 × g for 20 min. The 8,000 ×g pellet was kept on ice and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The 8,000 × gand the 40,000 × g pellets were resuspended in a solution containing 0.9% NaCl, 0.3 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors to a final protein concentration of 20–30 mg/ml. The 40,000 × g pellet invariably yielded higherB max (maximal receptor density) in [3H]ryanodine binding assays than the 8,000 ×g pellet and was used for all subsequent experiments. High affinity [3H]ryanodine binding (K d 5–10 nm) to pig cardiac and skeletal muscle microsomes was measured as described previously (10El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arévalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Lokuta A. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 487: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Aliquots of 60 μg of microsomal protein were added to an incubation medium containing 7 nm [3H]ryanodine in 0.2m KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mmEGTA, and different amounts of CaCl2 to set [free Ca2+] in the range of 0.08–100 μm. The stability constants for Ca2+-EGTA were taken from Fabiato (20Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The incubation took place in a volume of 0.1 ml at 36 °C for 90 min. Modulators, including sorcin, calmodulin, and caffeine, were added to reaction mixtures from 10 × stocks. After incubation, bound and free [3H]ryanodine were separated by rapid filtration onto Whatman GF/B or GF/C glass fiber filters, and the filters were washed twice with cold distilled water using a Brandel M-24R harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). The filters were placed in liquid scintillation mixture and counted in a Beckman LS6500 β-counter. Nonspecific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine and has been subtracted from all reported values. Unless otherwise indicated data represent the mean ± S.E. with n = 4. Mathematical fitting of data was accomplished with the computer program Origin (version 4, Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). Cardiac RyRs were reconstituted into Muller-Rudin planar lipid bilayers as described previously (19Lokuta A. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 487: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Bilayers were composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine (1:1) dissolved in decane at a concentration of 30 mg/ml. SR microsomes (100–200 μg) were added to a 900-μl chamber (cis side), which was the voltage command side and which corresponded to the cytosolic face of the channel. The transchamber was held at virtual ground and corresponded to the SR lumenal face of the channel. The recording solution in the cischamber was 300 mm cesium methanesulfonate and 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). The trans solution was the same except that cesium methanesulfonate was 50 mm before fusion and 300 mm after fusion. In this configuration, Cs+ flows from the lumenal (trans) to the cytoplasmic (cis) side at negative holding potentials. Cs+, instead of Ca2+, was chosen as the charge carrier to control precisely [Ca2+] around the channel, to increase the channel conductanceg Cs+/g Ca2+= 2 and to avoid interference from K+ channels present in the SR membrane. Cl− channels were blocked by replacing chloride with the impermeant anion methanesulfonate. Channel activity in the presence or absence of modulators was recorded at a sampling rate of 5 kHz using a 16-bit VCR-based acquisition and storage system. To analyze the data, the records were played and filtered through an 8-pol low pass Bessel filter set at 1.5 kHz and finally digitized at 4 kHz using a Digidata 1200 AD/DA interface. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out with Axon Instruments (Burlingame, CA) hardware and software (pClamp versus 6.0) . Sorcin and the activated PKA catalytic subunit (2:1, w/w) were incubated at 30 °C for 5–10 min in 140 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA in a total volume of 100 μl. After completion of the phosphorylation reaction, the mixture was diluted 2-fold into the [3H]ryanodine binding reactions for analysis of the effect of sorcin phosphorylation on [3H]ryanodine binding. To monitor sorcin phosphorylation, an aliquot of [γ-32P]ATP was added to some reaction mixtures. After 10 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of a 4 × Laemmli buffer (0.25 m Tris (pH 6.8), 0.4 mdithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on linear gradient acrylamide gels (4–15%) followed by Coomassie Blue staining and exposure of the dried gels to x-ray film for 2 days. To examine whether sorcin was acting as a Ca2+-dependent protease and thus degrading cardiac RyR, 30 μg of cardiac SR microsomes was incubated with several concentrations of sorcin for 15 min at 36 °C in buffer containing 10 μm free Ca2+, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). The incubation was terminated by thee addition of 4 × Laemmli buffer (for composition, see above). Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on two identical gels. Proteins contained in one gel were silver-stained, and proteins in the other gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Blots were probed first with a mouse monoclonal RyR antibody (dilution 1:3,000, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO) and then with an anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection and quantification of proteins were done by autoradiography and gel scanning as described in the figure legends. For Western blots of sorcin, a mouse monoclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of sorcin was used as described (15Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.-S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sorcin is a 22-kDa protein normally expressed in cardiac myocytes, where it localizes preferentially to the SR (15Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.-S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, sorcin may translocate from membrane to soluble compartments in a Ca2+-dependent manner (18Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To investigate if sorcin remained associated with the SR-enriched microsomes used in these experiments, we carried out Western blot analysis of total cardiac homogenate and of SR microsomes. Fig.1 shows that a monoclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of sorcin recognized recombinant sorcin (lane 1) and a 22-kDa protein in total cardiac homogenate (lane 2), but this protein was absent in SR microsomes (lane 3). Conversely, RyRs were weakly detected in the total homogenate but enriched in SR microsomes (lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Thus, little endogenous sorcin remained associated with the SR microsomes in the last step of isolation, and a systematic study of the effect of sorcin on RyRs was possible by adding exogenous sorcin to sorcin-depleted functional RyR. To determine if sorcin was capable of modifying RyR activity, we reconstituted swine cardiac RyRs in planar bilayers as described (19Lokuta A. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 487: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows traces of steady-state activity from a single RyR recorded at −30-mV holding potential in the absence (Control) and the presence of the indicated concentrations of sorcin. Channel activity was monitored for more than 60 s in each condition, and histograms of open and closed events were constructed from the binned events. The most significant kinetic effects of sorcin were a decrease in the bursting frequency and an increase in the mean closed time. In the absence of sorcin, closing events could be fitted with two exponentials with mean closed time (τ), τclose1 = 0.37 ms (74%) and τclose2= 2.65 ms (26%). In the presence of 800 nm sorcin, τclose1 and τclose2 values remained essentially unchanged, but the majority of events were fitted with a third, longer τ (τclose3 = 55.3 ms, 52%). The appearance of longer periods of silence contributed significantly to lower the mean open probability (P o). For the particular channel shown in Fig. 2, P o was 0.284 in control and 0.310, 0.102, and 0.017 at 200, 600, and 800 nm sorcin, respectively. No significant change in unitary conductance was detected. The bottom panel of Fig. 2 shows the cumulated dose-response relation of this sorcin effect from four independent experiments. The concentration of sorcin necessary for half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of RyR activity was 480 nm. Thus, sorcin at submicromolar concentrations interacts with RyRs or a closely associated regulatory protein to depress channel activity. Sorcin cDNA predicts a structure with two EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains, homologous to those of calmodulin (16Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which bind Ca2+ with high affinity (apparent K d for the sorcin·Ca2+ complex = ∼1 μm(18Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)). We thus compared the effect of sorcin with that of calmodulin (Fig. 3). In this and subsequent experiments, we used the [3H]ryanodine binding assay to assess the effect of modulators in a large population of receptors. [3H]Ryanodine binds with high affinity to a conformationally sensitive domain on the RyR (8Meissner G. El-Hashem A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, experimental conditions that decrease or increase channel activity also modify [3H]ryanodine binding in the same manner (6Annu. Rev. Physiol. 56, 484–508Meissner, G. Annu. Rev. Physiol., 56, 484–508Google Scholar, 7Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 8Meissner G. El-Hashem A. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows the effect of sorcin and calmodulin oncardiac RyRs. Experiments were conducted at a [free Ca2+] = 10 μm, a concentration at which the Ca2+ binding domains of sorcin are essentially saturated. Sorcin was capable of inhibiting [3H]ryanodine binding completely, with an IC50 = 760 nm. This value was reasonably close to that calculated from bilayer experiments (Fig.2). In contrast, the interaction of calmodulin with cardiac RyR, albeit of higher affinity (IC50 = ∼200 nm), resulted in a maximum of 20% inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding. When 1 μm sorcin and 10 μm calmodulin were added in tandem, the level of binding was reduced to 31 ± 11% of control (Fig. 3 A, filled diamond). This percent of inhibition was the sum of each inhibitor acting separately. Both the relatively modest effect of calmodulin and the inhibitory effect of sorcin were dramatically changed when skeletalRyR, instead of cardiac RyR, was used in [3H]ryanodine binding assays (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with previous results (21Fuentes O. Valdivia C. Vaughan D. Coronado R. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), calmodulin inhibited ≥ 70% [3H]ryanodine binding with an IC50 = ∼200 nm. Surprisingly, ≥ 1 μm sorcinincreased [3H]ryanodine binding more than 200% with respect to control, although the percent of increase varied widely among different SR preparations. These results are consistent with sorcin and calmodulin exerting a different mechanism of action for modulation of RyRs. Digestion of skeletal RyR by calpain, a Ca2+-dependent protease with an amino acid sequence homologous to that of sorcin (14Meyers M.B. Heizman C.W. Novel Calcium-binding Proteins: Fundamentals and Clinical Implications. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1991: 385-399Crossref Google Scholar, 16Van der Bliek A.M. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Hes E. Borst P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3201-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), has been demonstrated by several groups (23Gilchrist J.S.C. Wang K.K.W. Katz S. Belcastro A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20857-20865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Shoshan-Barmatz V. Weil S. Meyer H. Varsanyi M. Heilmeyer L.M.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To examine whether sorcin inhibition of RyR activity was caused by sorcin acting as a Ca2+-dependent protease, we compared sorcin-treated and untreated RyR by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4). Cardiac SR microsomes were incubated with several concentrations of sorcin, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a cardiac RyR antibody. Quantification of the Western blot (Fig. 4 A) by densitometric analysis revealed that the presence of sorcin did not decrease the amount of protein recognized by the RyR antibody (Fig.4 B). These results are incompatible with the possibility that the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding and channel activity caused by sorcin was the result of RyR protein degradation. We next investigated the effect of Ca2+ on sorcin-induced inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding. Ca2+ is essential for [3H]ryanodine binding (6Annu. Rev. Physiol. 56, 484–508Meissner, G. Annu. Rev. Physiol., 56, 484–508Google Scholar, 7Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 8Meissner G. El-Hashem A. Mol. Cell.

Physiol. 1989; 256: H328-H333PubMed Google Scholar), and an increase of [Ca2+] from pCa 8 to pCa 6 decreases the intrinsic fluorescence of sorcin (18Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), indicative of a Ca2+-dependent conformational change. Fig. 5 Ashows the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to cardiac RyRs (open circles). Binding was minimal at low [Ca2+] (pCa 7) and increased proportionally with [Ca2+]. In the presence of 1 μm sorcin (filled circles), binding decreased at all pCa values tested. For the experiment shown in Fig.5 A, specific binding in the absence and the presence of sorcin was (in pmol/mg) 0.012 and 0.004 (pCa 7), 0.05 and 0.031 (pCa 6), 0.10 and 0.06 (pCa 5), and 0.091 and 0.04 (pCa 4), respectively. Thus, sorcin inhibition occurred over a wide range of [Ca2+]. The normalized depression of binding induced by sorcin in four independent determinations was 63.8 ± 11.6 (pCa 7), 37.6 ± 17.2% (pCa 6), 40.0 ± 7.6% (pCa 5), and 55.2 ± 5.4% (pCa 4). Fig. 5 B shows the effect of sorcin on caffeine-activated RyR. At pCa 7, a [Ca2+] insufficient to open RyR (10El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arévalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or to saturate the Ca2+ binding domains of sorcin (18Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), binding of [3H]ryanodine to SR-enriched cardiac microsomes was low, but it increased with caffeine concentration (open circles). This stimulating effect reflects binding of caffeine to a specific receptor site in the channel protein that “sensitizes” RyR to Ca2+ (9Rousseau E. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H328-H333PubMed Google Scholar, 10El-Hayek R. Lokuta A.J. Arévalo C. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28696-28704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the presence of sorcin (filled circles), binding decreased at caffeine concentrations ≥ 1 mm, with p < 0.05 at [caffeine] ≥ 3 mm (asterisks). These results, along with those of Fig. 5 A, suggest that Ca2+ was not a necessary cofactor for sorcin inhibition of RyR. The complementary DNA for sorcin predicts two PKA recognition sites near the COOH terminus. Furthermore, sorcin has been demonstrated to be a substrate for PKA both in vitro and in intact drug-resistant cells (25Meyers M.B. Smith V.L. Dedman J.R. Stimulus-Response Coupling: The Role of Intracellular Calcium-binding Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 159-171Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of sorcin phosphorylation has yet to be defined. We therefore investigated whether phosphorylation of sorcin influenced its capacity to modulate RyR. In prior experiments, sorcin was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA in the absence and presence of SR microsomes. The proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fig. 6 A shows a Coomassie-stained gel containing in lanes 1–4, recombinant sorcin (1.5 μg, asterisks) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm); in lanes 2–4, the catalytic subunit of PKA (0.75 μg); and in lane 4, SR microsomes (30 μg). The autoradiogram of this gel (Fig. 6 B) shows that a 10-min incubation of sorcin with PKA results in phosphorylation of sorcin (lane 2). Omission of PKA yields no labeled protein bands (lane 1), suggesting a specific kinase-driven incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP. After 90 min at 36 °C (the time and temperature of our standard [3H]ryanodine binding reaction), phosphorylation of sorcin increases (lane 3) with little phosphorylation of the RyR (lane 4,arrow). Thus, under our experimental conditions, sorcin is more readily phosphorylated by PKA than RyR. Fig. 6 C shows that phosphorylated sorcin inhibits only marginally the binding of [3H]ryanodine to cardiac RyRs. In the presence of 800 nm nonphosphorylated sorcin (sorcin incubated with phosphorylation buffer without PKA), binding decreased to 54 ± 11% of control, consistent with the potency observed for the native sorcin (Fig. 3 A).

To identify unique IRS-1-binding proteins, we screened a human heart cDNA library with32P-labeled recombinant IRS-1 and obtained two isoforms (ε and ζ) of the 14-3-3 protein family. 14-3-3 protein has been shown to associate with IRS-1 in L6 myotubes, HepG2 hepatoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and bovine brain tissue. IRS-2, a protein structurally similar to IRS-1, was also shown to form a complex with 14-3-3 protein using a baculovirus expression system. The amount of 14-3-3 protein associated with IRS-1 was not affected by insulin stimulation but was increased significantly by treatment with okadaic acid, a potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor. Peptide inhibition experiments using phosphoserine-containing peptides of IRS-1 revealed that IRS-1 contains three putative binding sites for 14-3-3 protein (Ser-270, Ser-374, and Ser-641). Among these three, the motif around Ser-270 is located in the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1, which is responsible for the interaction with the insulin receptor. Indeed, a truncated mutant of IRS-1 consisting of only the phosphotyrosine binding domain retained the capacity to bind to 14-3-3 protein in vivo. Finally, the effect of 14-3-3 protein binding on the insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 was investigated. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IRS-1 coimmunoprecipitated with anti-14-3-3 antibody to be weakly phosphorylated after insulin stimulation, on tyrosine as well as serine residues, compared with IRS-1 immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Thus, the association with 14-3-3 protein may play a role in the regulation of insulin sensitivity by interrupting the association between the insulin receptor and IRS-1.

Protein tyrosine kinases play key roles in transmitting extracellular signals that induce specific cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, gene expression, and metabolism. These signals are propagated by sequential protein-protein interactions and the resulting protein phosphorylation cascade. Thus, to identify the molecule(s) associated with the some key molecules mediating these events constitutes a strategy for elucidating the signal transduction network. The CORT (cloning ofreceptor target) method is a modification of the expression cloning method, using tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptor as a probe, which was originally established by Skolniket al.

A number of reports have demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 affects its tyrosine phosphorylation (27Tanti J.-F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). When the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is augmented by tumor necrosis factor-α, which has been suggested to be a mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is impaired (32Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α was also shown to induce serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and to convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (33Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 protein association with the serine-phosphorylated IRS-1, and possibly IRS-2, may contribute to the regulation of insulin sensitivity.In this study, we have not determined whether IRS-1 is actually phosphorylated on the serine residues in the 14-3-3 protein binding motifs. However, if it is assumed that phosphorylation of these motifs is required for the observed association, then the amount of 14-3-3 protein associated with IRS-1 would be determined by the activity of an as yet unknown serine kinase(s) that phosphorylates the serine residue in the 14-3-3 binding motif of the target protein, rather by the level of 14-3-3 protein expression, because these proteins are extremely abundant (reportedly approximately 1% of total brain tissue-soluble proteins (34Boston P.F. Jackson P. Kynoch P.A.M. Thompson R.J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1466-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), probably more than 0.1% of cytosolic protein in most cells). Thus, to identify the serine kinase involved in the 14-3-3 protein association is essential for clarifying the regulatory mechanism of the 14-3-3 protein association with IRS-1. In the case of tyrosine/tryptophan hydroxylase, it has been demonstrated that calmodulin kinase II phosphorylates the 14-3-3 binding motif of hydroxylase (10Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okumura T.

In the case of BAD, heart muscle kinase (a form of protein kinase A) was shown to phosphorylate the serine residue in the 14-3-3 binding motif of BADin vitro, but the kinase acting in vivo remains unknown (20Zha J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar).We investigated whether PTB domains found in other proteins share a 14-3-3 protein binding motif similar to that of IRS-1 and IRS-2. Sequential alignments of PTB domains identified in various proteins are shown in Fig. 6. The α-helices and β-sheet strands based on a structural study (36Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T.

Based on crystallographic study, β5, β6, β7, and α2 of IRS-1 are important for recognizing phosphotyrosine in the insulin receptor NPXY motif (36Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trüb T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because the putative 14-3-3 binding motif is next to the α2-helix, 14-3-3 protein binding to IRS-1 would presumably influence the binding of its PTB domain to the insulin receptor. Another interesting point is that IRS-1 and IRS-2 contain the insertion in the corresponding regions of other proteins and that the putative 14-3-3 binding motif is in this insertion sequence. Thus, the binding of 14-3-3 protein to the PTB domain may be specific to IRS-1 and IRS-2.Further study is necessary to elucidate the physiological role of the 14-3-3 protein association with IRS-1 and IRS-2 in insulin signaling and the regulation of insulin sensitivity, as well as its possible involvement in the insulin resistance observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Protein tyrosine kinases play key roles in transmitting extracellular signals that induce specific cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, gene expression, and metabolism. These signals are propagated by sequential protein-protein interactions and the resulting protein phosphorylation cascade. Thus, to identify the molecule(s) associated with the some key molecules mediating these events constitutes a strategy for elucidating the signal transduction network. The CORT (cloning ofreceptor target) method is a modification of the expression cloning method, using tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptor as a probe, which was originally established by Skolniket al. (1Skolnik E.Y. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Lowenstein E. Fischer R. Drepps A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) for the purpose of isolating cDNAs coding for proteins bound to the tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor. In the case of insulin signaling, the first action exerted by insulin is activation of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, which leads to the phosphorylation of several cytosolic substrates including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1The abbreviations used are; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PH, pleckstrin homology; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH2, Src-homology 2.1The abbreviations used are; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PH, pleckstrin homology; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SH2, Src-homology 2.-1 (2Sun X.J.

DISCUSSIONRecently, extensive studies have been done to clarify the mechanism of insulin resistance, which is involved in the pathogenesis of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as well as the factors determining insulin sensitivity. A number of reports have demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 affects its tyrosine phosphorylation (27Tanti J.-F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). When the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is augmented by tumor necrosis factor-α, which has been suggested to be a mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is impaired (32Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α was also shown to induce serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and to convert IRS-1 into an inhibitor of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vitro (33Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 protein association with the serine-phosphorylated IRS-1, and possibly IRS-2, may contribute to the regulation of insulin sensitivity.In this study, we have not determined whether IRS-1 is actually phosphorylated on the serine residues in the 14-3-3 protein binding motifs. However, if it is assumed that phosphorylation of these motifs is required for the observed association, then the amount of 14-3-3 protein associated with IRS-1 would be determined by the activity of an as yet unknown serine kinase(s) that phosphorylates the serine residue in the 14-3-3 binding motif of the target protein, rather by the level of 14-3-3 protein expression, because these proteins are extremely abundant (reportedly approximately 1% of total brain tissue-soluble proteins (34Boston P.F. Jackson P. Kynoch P.A.M. Thompson R.J. J. Neurochem. 1982; 38: 1466-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), probably more than 0.1% of cytosolic protein in most cells). Thus, to identify the serine kinase involved in the 14-3-3 protein association is essential for clarifying the regulatory mechanism of the 14-3-3 protein association with IRS-1. In the case of tyrosine/tryptophan hydroxylase, it has been demonstrated that calmodulin kinase II phosphorylates the 14-3-3 binding motif of hydroxylase (10Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okumura T.

Lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled fibroblasts from the patient contained the 155- and 45-kDa H polypeptides, but secretion of the 155-kDa protein was blocked; the 45-kDa protein was secreted with normal kinetics.

Immunoflourescent staining and confocal microscopic imaging of the patient's fibroblasts indicated that factor H was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Sequence analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products (the entire coding region) and genomic DNA revealed a T1679C substitution on one allele and a G2949A substitution on the other (C518R mutation in SCR 9 and C991Y mutation in SCR 16, respectively). Both mutations affect conserved cysteine residues characteristic of SCR modules and therefore predict profound changes in the higher order structure of the 155-kDa factor H protein.

Proteins of the complement system are powerful effectors of innate host defense against infection and of immunopathological responses (reviewed in Colten and Gitlin (1Colten H.R. Gitlin J.D. Handin R.I. Stossel T.P. Lux S.E. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1995: 477-511Google Scholar)). The biological effects of the complement cascade are under the control of membrane-bound and fluid phase proteins (e.g. complement receptor 1, decay accelerating factor, C4 binding protein, and factor H) that limit complement activation and/or activities. Complement protein factor H (2Nilsson U.R. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 122: 277-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 3Vik D.P. Munoz-Canoves P. Chaplin D.D. Tack B.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. 1989; 153: 147-160Google Scholar) inhibits the formation and accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway enzyme of complement activation (C3bBb), an enzyme that cleaves the third component of complement, C3. Factor H also serves as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of one of the biologically active forms of C3, C3b. These activities depend on interaction with the C3b molecule via at least one of three binding sites in the factor H protein (4Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Other less well defined functions of factor H have been suggested by the presence in factor H protein of at least two heparin binding sites (4Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,5Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Immunol.

Primary sequence analysis of factor H revealed a tandem array of 20 homologous units, called short consensus repeats (SCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: SCR, short consensus repeat; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IFN, interferon; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; kb, kilobase pair(s). each about 60-amino acid residues long (6Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These structures have been recognized in 12 complement proteins and a growing number of non-complement proteins including blood clotting factor XIIIb, the α chain of human interleukin-2 receptor, and cell adhesion molecules such as ELAM-1 and MEL-14. These SCR motifs define a protein superfamily (7Reid K.B.M. Day A.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Conserved amino acid residues in the SCR unit include four cysteines that form disulfide bonds in a Cys1–Cys3 and Cys2–Cys4 linkage. These disulfide bridges are important in maintaining the characteristic structure of the SCR module (8Barlow P.N. Steinkasserer A. Norman D.G. Kieffer B. Wiles A.P. Sim R.B. Campbell I.D. J. Mol.

The SCR modules are joined by short (3–8-amino acid) linkers yielding the elongated shape of the intact H protein which has been visualized as a string of beads (10DiScipio R.G. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2592-2599PubMed Google Scholar). The approximately 100-kb factor H gene is located in the RCA gene cluster relatively near (∼7 megabases) genes coding for other regulators of complement activation (membrane cofactor protein, complement receptor 1 and 2, decay accelerating factor, and C4 binding protein) on chromosome 1q (11Rodriguez de Cordoba S.

Med. 1985; 161: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and is most closely linked to factor XIIIb of the coagulation cascade (12Rey-Campos J. Baeza-Sanz D. Rodriguez de Cordoba S. Genomics. 1990; 7: 644-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the factor H-related gene 2 (13Skerka C. Moulds J.M. Taillon-Miller P. Hourcade D. Zipfel P.F. Immunogenetics. 1995; 42: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two mRNAs are generated from the factor H gene, a 4.3-kb species that includes all 20 SCRs from which the 155-kDa protein H is derived and a 1.8-kb mRNA species that includes the first 7 SCRs plus an alternate 3′-untranslated region (5Zipfel P.F.

Immunol. 1991; 21: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The latter gives rise to a 45-kDa factor H protein. Both mRNA species are present in the liver, the major site of factor H expression, and in several extrahepatic tissues (15Schwaeble W. Schwaiger H. Brooimans R.A. Barbieri A.,.

Both isoforms of factor H mRNA and protein are expressed in primary cultures of human monocytes, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (16Whaley K. J. Exp.

Genetic deficiencies of the approximately 30 proteins that constitute the effector and control proteins of the complement system have been described in humans and other species. Some, such as C9 deficiency, have no significant clinical consequences, whereas most of the others either have profound effects on susceptibility to infection or are associated with manifestations of “autoimmune” disorders including systemic lupus erythematosis and chronic glomerulonephritis (19Colten H.R. Rosen F.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 809-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Genetic deficiency of factor H has been described in domesticated animals (20Hogasen K. Jansen J.H. Mollnes T.E. Hovdenes J. Harboe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and in a relatively small number of human kindred (21Thompson R.A. Winterborn M.H.

Nephrol. 1995; 9: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In general, patients with homozygous factor H deficiency suffer recurrent bacterial infections (including Neisseriasp.), vasculitis, and/or glomerulonephritis (29Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In none of these cases has the molecular basis for factor H deficiency been determined. The availability of skin fibroblasts from a patient with factor H deficiency and hypocomplementemic glomerulonephritis (28Vogt B.A. Wyatt R.W. Burke B.A. Simonton S.C. Kashtan C.E. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1995; 9: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) made it possible to investigate the molecular and cellular biology of H deficiency in this kindred. In studies of this patient we demonstrated a compound heterozygous deficiency with mutations of conserved cysteine residues in SCR 9 and 16. These mutations disrupt intrachain disulfide bridges, thereby perturbing the higher order structure of factor H. This leads in turn to a profound selective block in secretion of the 155-kDa factor H protein. Because both mutations are downstream of the codons for the short form of factor H, the 45-kDa form is secreted with normal kinetics. 1-μl plasma samples and 1 μg of recombinant human factor H (Sigma) were run on 8.5% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C Extra, Amersham Corp.). The membrane was blocked and developed with goat anti-human factor H IgG (Incstar, Stillwater, MN) and rabbit anti-goat IgG-peroxidase (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine/urea peroxide substrate (Sigma). The blots were digitized and processed by Adobe Photoshop software (version 4.0, Adobe, San Jose, CA). A punch skin biopsy was obtained under local anesthesia after obtaining informed consent according to the institutional review board guidelines at the University of Minnesota. Primary cultures of skin fibroblasts were established from either collagenase dispersed cells or from an explant. Normal primary adult human fibroblasts (GM8399) were obtained from the human genetic repository (National Institute of General Medical Science, Camden, NJ). All cell cultures were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with HEPES, l-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.)) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Fibroblasts at passage 10 or lower were used for all experiments. Cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated overnight in medium containing HEPES, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (cell culture tested, Sigma) alone or with 20 ng/ml TNF-α (Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) and/or 1000 units/ml IFN-γ (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After 24 h cell monolayers were washed twice with HBSS, and RNA was harvested, or the cells were incubated in medium containing radiolabeled methionine for biosynthetic labeling. Total RNA was prepared from the patient's fibroblasts by cesium chloride centrifugation of guanidium thiocyanate (Fluka Chemical Corporation, Ronkonkoma, NY) lysates (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter R.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel with modifications as described by Garnier et al. (31Garnier G. Ault B. Kramer M. Colten H.R. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following transfer to a nitrocellulose sheet (Bio-Rad), hybridization was performed using a 1.4-kb cDNA probe (H-19, gift from Dr. Dennis Hourcade, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), which spans the nucleotide sequence from the first half of SCR 1 to the end of SCR 7 (33Schulz T.F. Schwaeble W. Stanley K.K. Weil E. Dierich M.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The probe was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) using the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The filter was washed and dried, and autoradiography was developed on Kodak XAR-3 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Fibroblasts were grown to near confluence in 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY), then washed twice with warm HBSS and incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine (Life Technologies, Inc.) containingl-glutamine, HEPES, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (specific activity, 1199 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemical, Irvine, CA). At the end of the pulse period, the labeling medium was removed, and cells were washed once with warm HBSS and incubated for 0–12 h in growth medium. At timed intervals the medium was removed and the cell monolayer washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by one freeze-thaw cycle in PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Fisher), 1% w/v Triton X-100 (Sigma), 10 mm EDTA (Sigma), 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim). Cell lysates and media were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min). Total protein synthesis was measured by trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) precipitation. SDS (Bio-Rad) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 1%. Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (34Kulics J. Circolo A. Strunk R.C. Colten H.R. Immunology. 1994; 82: 509-515PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were precleared with heat-killed protein A-containingStaphylococcus aureus (Immunoprecipitin, Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated overnight with excess goat antibody to human factor H (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with an excess of protein A, washed as described in Kulicset al. (34Kulics J. Circolo A. Strunk R.C. Colten H.R. Immunology. 1994; 82: 509-515PubMed Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in a 7.5% acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gel under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed, stained and destained, equilibrated with water, and treated with Fluoro-Hance (RPI, Mount Prospect, IL), then dried. Following autoradiography on Kodak XAR-3 film (Kodak), gel slices corresponding to the radiolabeled bands were cut out, digested in 15% hydrogen peroxide, and measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cells were plated on coverslips in 100-mm culture dishes in growth medium, incubated overnight, then rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS and 100% methanol, blocked with 10 mm glycine in PBS, and then washed with antibody diluting solution (PBS with 3% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3% bovine serum albumin (ICN, Irvine, CA), and 3% skim milk powder). The monolayers were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-calnexin (DP-23, IgG fraction, kind gift of Dr. David Perlmutter) and/or goat anti-human factor H (Incstar, Stillwater, MN) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, then washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Texas Red conjugate for 2 h. Following four washes, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, incubated with 10 mm glycine, washed with PBS, and mounted with 100 mm propyl gallate in 90% glycerol. Slides were examined in a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC laser confocal microscope adaptor using a 63× immersion oil objective. The collected confocal images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (version 4.0, Adobe, San Jose, CA). IgG controls (primary and secondary antibody) were also run and were found to be not significantly different from the unstained background. The fluorochromes (fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red) were also negative for emittance at the filter setting used for the other. The factor H staining could be completely blocked by recombinant factor H (Sigma). RNA isolated from the patient's fibroblasts served as template for synthesizing the RT-PCR fragments shown in Fig.1. The Invitrogen cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, CA) was used for generating the RT-PCR fragments 1–6 (Fig. 1) using the following oligonucleotides as primers for the reverse transcription at 68 °C annealing temperature: 5′-CAT ACT CGA GCC ACC GGT CTC AGC TTA-3′ (3903–3929, antisense) and 5′-TCT GAC TCG AGG TGT GCA CTT TAT GAT TGA-3′ (3772–3801, antisense; engineered XhoI restriction sites are underlined). Annealing temperature was 68 °C. Segment 7 (Fig. 1) was synthesized using a SUPERCRIPT II RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the kit's oligo(dT) primer for reverse transcription. Annealing temperature was 70 °C. The PCR reactions were performed using AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin- Elmer) for segment 1–6 and the KlenTaq LA (Wayne Barnes, St. Louis, MO) for segment 7 using the oligonucleotides listed in TableI with a 65 °C annealing temperature.Table IThe oligonucleotides listed were used to generate the PCR fragments shown in Fig. 15′ primerProduct size (bp)3′ primerSegment 15′-GCT ATC TAG AGG AGA ACT GGA CGT TGT GAA-3′ (4–33)8665′-ATC TCT CGA GAC ATG AAG GCA ACG GAC GCCA-3′ (839–869)Segment 25′-GCG CTC TAG ATC TCC TAT ATC TCA GAA GAT-3′ (718–747)10085′-CTG ACT CGA GTG GTG CTT CCA GTA TTG CTT-3′ (1696–1725)Segment 35′-GGC CTC TAG ATG GTG AAA CAT CAG GAT CAA-3′ (1518–1547)10105′-GGA ATC TCG AGT GGA GGT GGG CAT AAT TGT-3′ (2497–2527)Segment 45′-AAT CAT GTG GTC CAC CTC CT-3′ (1956–1975)8395′-TAT CCT GAA ACC ACC CTC AC-3′ (2775–2794)Segment 55′-CTC AGA TAG AAC ACG GAA CC-3′ (2694–2713)8935′-TCG GGA TAT TAC ACA CGG AT-3′ (3567–3586)Segment 65′-GAT GTC TAG AAG GCG GGT GAG CAA GTG ACT TAC A-3′ (3089–3122)8415′-CAT ACT CGA GCC ACC GGT CTC AGC TTA-3′ (3903–3929)Segment 7 first amplification5′-GCG CAG ACC ACA GTT ACA TGT ATG-3′ (1346–1369)25825′-GAA GAG AGC CAC CGG TCT CAG CTT-3′ (3904–3927)Segment 7 reamplification5′-CCA CTC GAG CAT GTA TGG AGA ATG GCT GG-3′ (1353–1381)25795′-TTA TCT AGA GAG CCA CCG GTC TCA GCT TAT AAT-3′ (3899–3931)SCR 9 genomic5′-GCG GCG TCT AGA TAT CCC AGT ATT TAT GAA TGC C-3′ (1590–1624)1735′-GAC GGG TAC TCG AGA CCA ACC ATT GTA ACC-3′ (1733–1762)SCR 16 genomic5′-ACC TGA GAT TTC TCA TGG TGT TG-3′ (2875–2897)1375′-GAG ACC ATT TTT CTC CTA AGC AT-3′ (2989–3011)Position of each oligonucleotide in the factor H gene is given in parentheses.

Segment 1–3 and 6–7 were gel-purified either by trough elution or by electrophoresis onto DEAE paper (Whatman), then ligated into Bluescript SK (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) using XbaI andXhoI restriction sites and transformed into SURE cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid preparations were made either using the Qiagen plasmid preparation kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) or modified alkaline lysis (36Feliciello I. Chinali G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 304-401Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or by CsCl centrifugation. Segment 4 and 5 were sequenced directly. DNA sequencing was performed using a model 373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the standard protocol for the TaqDyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems. For PCR fragments cloned into Bluescript, M13 and M13 reverse primers were used, in addition to paired internal 20-mer oligonucleotides designed on the basis of the published factor H sequence (6Ripoche J. Day A.J. Harris T.J.R. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized on a model 391 PCR-MATE EP DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using Cruachem (Glasgow, Scotland) reagents. Purified PCR fragments for direct sequencing were primed with internal paired oligonucleotides. Sequencing was performed on both strands. To confirm the mutations found in the cDNA clones, high molecular weight DNA was isolated (37Litz C.E. Taylor K.A. Qui J.S. Pescovitz O.H. de Martinville B. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1988; 30: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from the peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient and his parents. 800 ng of genomic DNA were amplified by oligonucleotides within SCR 9 (Table I) to confirm the mutation found at position 1679. The resulting PCR product was gel-purified by elution onto DEAE paper and directly sequenced using internal sequencing oligonucleotides (5′-CCC AGT ATT TAT GAA TGC CAG-3′ (1606–1626, sense), 5′-CCA ACC ATT GTA ACC ACA CAC-3′ (1727–1747, antisense)). 100-microliter PCR reactions were performed using 100 ng of genomic DNA as template with the oligonucleotides as shown in Table I for confirming the mutation at 2949 in SCR 16. The resulting PCR products were purified by trough elution on agarose gels and subjected to DNA sequencing in the manner described above, utilizing the oligonucleotides used for the PCR as primers. Both strands were sequenced. A detailed report of the presentation, clinical course, and renal pathology in the patient with factor H deficiency has previously been published (28Vogt B.A. Wyatt R.W. Burke B.A. Simonton S.C. Kashtan C.E. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1995; 9: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 13-month-old Native American (Sioux) boy presented with hypocomplementemic hypertensive renal disease. Renal biopsy showed changes consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, deposition of type III collagen, and segmental complement C3 deposition in capillary loops. A serum complement profile revealed decreased levels of C3 and factor B but normal levels of C4 and factor I; factor H was undetectable by radial immunodiffusion analysis. Slightly depressed levels of factor H were present in both parents. The child underwent renal transplantation in February 1996. Serum C3 concentrations have remained low, as have factor H levels. Western blot analysis of the patient's plasma before and after renal transplantation (Fig. 2) revealed slightly increased concentration of the 45-kDa factor H and no detectable 150-kDa factor H when compared with seven normal plasma samples. There was no significant difference between the pre- and post-transplantation samples. RNA blot analysis of skin fibroblasts from the factor H-deficient patient revealed 4.4- and 1.8-kb factor H transcripts in cells incubated in medium alone. As in normal cells (17Katz Y. Strunk R.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 559-563PubMed Google Scholar), both transcripts were up-regulated by TNF-α or the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ (Fig. 3). The two-factor H mRNA species from the H-deficient cells were similar in size and amount to the corresponding H transcripts in wild type cells. A preliminary experiment showed that the 155-kDa factor H was synthesized but not secreted in fibroblasts from the homozygous H-deficient patient. During a prolonged pulse, a small quantity of 155-kDa factor H (apparent size of the intracellular polypeptide) was detected in medium from the patient's cells. Accordingly, a pulse-chase experiment was performed. The patient's fibroblasts synthesized 155- and 45-kDa forms of factor H in quantities and sizes similar to normal fibroblasts (Fig.4). The 45-kDa protein was secreted with similar kinetics in the patient's and in normal fibroblasts (t½ ∼ 45 min). Factor H (molecular mass, 155 kDa) disappeared from the intracellular compartment accompanied by the appearance of the 160-kDa H protein in the extracellular medium from normal fibroblast cultures with a half-time of 40–60 min. In contrast, for H-deficient cells the 155-kDa factor H protein was retained within cell lysates. Although a small quantity of the 155-kDa H protein was detected in the medium at the 12-h chase time point, little or no secreted 160-kDa protein was detected. Moreover, as estimated from direct scintillation spectrometry of the radiolabeled bands, less than 10% of cell-associated 155-kDa factor H was lost at 12-h chase;i.e. little or no degradation of retained factor H was apparent in the deficient cells. When investigated with a standard epifluorescent microscope, factor H showed perinuclear staining similar to staining obtained with antibody to calnexin. Therefore confocal images were taken of fibroblasts stained for both factor H and calnexin in several focal planes. Perinuclear distribution of H staining (green fluorescence, Fig. 5 A) also showed a similar pattern using antibody to calnexin (red fluorescence, Fig. 5 B), a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum compartment (32Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Overlaying the two patterns revealed colocalization of the signals (Fig. 5 C). Nucleotide sequencing of the factor H-deficient patient's entire cDNA revealed 6 base substitutions which deviated from the published normal H sequence (6,GenBankTM HSH.GB_PR, accession no. Y00716). Only changes found on both strands in two or more clones are reported to exclude RT-PCR artifacts. Two mutations affecting the codons for conserved cysteine residues, one in SCR 9 and the other in SCR 16 were noted, one on each allele (Fig.6). That is, in the patient's cDNA a T to C mutation at position 1679 changes cysteine 2 in SCR 9 to arginine (Cys518 → Arg) and a G to A substitution at base 2949 converts cysteine 2 in SCR 16 to tyrosine (Cys941 → Tyr). Each of these affect conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges (9Janatova J. Reid K.B.M. Willis A.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) critical for maintenance of higher order structure of the SCR module. In addition four other substitutions were detected: (a) G to A change at nucleotide 257 causes a valine to isoleucine change in SCR 1 (Val44 → Ile), (b) T to C at nucleotide 1277 changes a tyrosine to histidine in SCR 7 (Tyr384 → His), (c) G to A at position 1492 causes no change in amino acid sequence (both GCG and GCA encode for Ala455 in SCR 8), and (d) G to C at position 1551 changes an arginine to a threonine in SCR 8 (Arg475 → Thr).

However, we report here that in the absence of extracellular calcium, phenylephrine induces a contraction of freshly isolated ferret aorta cells in the absence of increases in intracellular ionized calcium or light chain phosphorylation levels but in the presence of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. A protein at 36 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase and was identified as the actin-binding protein, calponin, by immunoblot. An overlay assay further confirmed an interaction between the kinase and calponin, even though the kinase did not phosphorylate calponin in vitro. Calponin also co-immunoprecipitated from smooth muscle cells with protein kinase C-ε. High resolution digital confocal studies indicated that calponin redistributes to the cell membrane during phenylephrine stimulation at a time when mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C-ε are targeted to the plasmalemma. These results suggest a role for calponin as a signaling molecule, possibly an adapter protein, linking the targeting of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C-ε to the surface membrane.

Although the importance of [Ca2+]i and LC20 1The abbreviations used are: LC20, 20-kDa myosin light chains; PKC, protein kinase C; PSS, physiological saline solution; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; PE, phenylephrine; CaP, calponin. phosphorylation in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction is recognized, certain incongruous observations have indicated that additional factors may also regulate, particularly, sustained contractions of smooth muscle. During the initiation of smooth muscle contraction, a transient rise in [Ca2+]i generally occurs that in turn activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase, causing phosphorylation of LC20 and a consequent increase in myosin ATPase activity and cross-bridge cycling velocity. The increase in intracellular calcium as well as LC20 phosphorylation is usually observed to decline with time during sustained agonist-induced contractions (1Dillon P.F. Aksoy M.O. Driska S.P. Murphy R.A. Science. 1981; 211: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 2Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Physiol. 1989; 413: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An hypothesis has been put forward to explain this dissociation of [Ca2+]i and LC20 phosphorylation from force, which suggests that noncycling or slowly cycling cross-bridges termed “latch bridges” are responsible for maintaining force (5Hai C.-M. Murphy R.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); however, it has been difficult to reconcile all reported data with this hypothesis, and the precise mechanism of regulation of latch bridges has been difficult to define. Others have suggested that the maintenance may be regulated by the actin-binding proteins, calponin and caldesmon (reviewed in Ref. 6Horowitz A. Menice C.B. Laporte R. Morgan K.G. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 967-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). A considerable and growing body of evidence has suggested that factors in addition to the level of LC20 phosphorylation are responsible for regulating sustained contraction in smooth muscle. The involvement of a second kinase, PKC, was first suggested by the observation that phorbol esters, known to activate PKC, induce slow sustained contractions in several types of vascular smooth muscle (4Jiang M.J.

Commun. 1984; 125: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 8Chatterjee M. Tejada M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C356-C361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rasmussen H. Forder J. Kojima I. Scriabine A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Am. J.

In some cases the phorbol ester-induced contractions were observed in the absence of changes in [Ca2+]i or phosphorylation of the myosin light chain kinase sites on LC20 (4Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: H1365-H1371PubMed Google Scholar, 11Singer H.A. Baker K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 243: 814-821PubMed Google Scholar). α-Agonist-induced PKC-dependent contractions have also been shown to be, in part, Ca2+-independent in permeabilized ferret aorta cells (12Collins E. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H754-H762PubMed Google Scholar). Studies reported by Khalilet al. (13Khalil R.A. Lajoie C. Resnick M.S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C714-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have documented a cytosol-to-plasmalemmal translocation of the Ca2+-independent isoform PKC-ε during α-agonist-induced cell shortening in these cells. Ferret aorta cells contain both PKC-ε and PKC-ζ, another Ca2+-independent PKC isoform, but only the addition of exogenous PKC-ε and not PKC-ζ induced contraction in these cells (14Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the Ca2+-independent contraction is associated with activation of PKC-ε. Nonetheless, the signaling pathway by which PKC-ε translocation to the plasma membrane activates the contractile filaments remains unclear. The actin-binding proteins calponin and caldesmon can both be phosphorylated in vitro by PKC, but their direct involvement in the signaling cascade has not been demonstrated (reviewed in Ref.6Horowitz A. Menice C.B. Laporte R. Morgan K.G. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 967-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Khalil et al. found MAPK to transiently co-distribute with membrane-associated PKC but then subsequently to be targeted to the contractile apparatus; thus, they suggested that MAPK links PKC activation to the measured contractile activity (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Reports that caldesmon is phosphorylated during contraction (16Adam L.P. Haeberle J.R. Hathaway D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that a caldesmon peptide antagonist contracted permeabilized cells (17Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that caldesmon may play a role in this pathway. Furthermore, the identification of the phosphorylation sites on caldesmon as MAPK sites (18Adam L.P. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 3222: 56-60Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) support a role for MAPK in this signaling cascade. The late targeting of MAPK to the contractile filaments was found to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK, but the early targeting of MAPK to the plasmalemma occurred independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and its mechanism is unknown. In the studies presented herein we provide evidence that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, a sustained α-agonist-induced contraction is associated with phosphorylation of a p46 MAPK, but occurs in the absence of a detectable increase in the level of LC20 phosphorylation. Additionally, we present evidence supporting a role for calponin as a signaling molecule linking the targeting of PKC and MAPK to the plasmalemma. Ferrets were anesthetized with chloroform in a ventilation hood, and the aorta were quickly removed to an oxygenated physiological saline solution (PSS) (4Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The endothelium was removed by gentle abrasion with a rubber policeman. Circular muscle strips were prepared as described previously (4Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and attached to a force transducer. Muscle strips were incubated in PSS for at least 1 h and then challenged with 24 mm KCl PSS (made by replacing NaCl for KCl mole for mole) to test for viability. Muscles were frozen with Freon, precooled in liquid N2 at the desired time points following agonist stimulation, and then stored at −80 °C until used. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the 20,000-Da myosin light chain were determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Jianget al. (4Jiang M.J. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After homogenization, samples were transferred to an isoelectric focusing gel in which an 80%:20% mixture of pH 4.4–5.4 and pH 3–10 ampholytes were used. After SDS gel electrophoresis, all gels were processed for silver staining. Gels were scanned using a laserjet scanner. The area of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated spots were determined using ImageQuant software for image analysis. Myosin phosphorylation levels were calculated by dividing the area of the phosphorylated spot by the area of the phosphorylated plus unphosphorylated spots. Muscle strips were loaded with the bioluminescent protein aequorin by a chemical loading procedure as described previously (2Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1982; 395: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to measure [Ca2+]i. Previously frozen tissue samples were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin (5.5 μm), aprotinin 20 kallikrein-inactivating unit, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 100 μmZnCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonylflouride. Protein matched samples (modified Lowry protein assay, DC Protein Assay kit, Bio-Rad) were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For each secondary antibody, control lanes were run that are incubated in the absence of primary antibody. Primary antibodies used and dilutions were as follows: ERK-1 1:500 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), ERK2 1:500 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Pan ERK-1 1:250 (Transduction Laboratories), JNK1 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), GRB-2 1:500 (Santa Cruz), human calponin 1:1000 (Sigma), and Actin 1:1000 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). The blots were visualized with Super Signal CL-HRP Substrate System (Pierce). Bands on film corresponding to proteins of interest were analyzed using densitometric methods to obtain relative numerical values. Samples were prepared as described for Western blot. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were incubated with a protein A-agarose slurry to preclear the sample of nonspecific binding to protein A. Additionally, after the pre-clear, antibody-free beads were run in parallel as a negative control for nonspecific binding. The MAPK antibody (ERK-1, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and the GRB-2 antibody (Santa Cruz) covalently bound to protein A-agarose beads were added to each sample. This mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C in a cold room. For PKC-ε immunoprecipitation, following the preclear, 2 μg of PKC-ε antibody (Santa Cruz) was added to the sample and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 50 μl of 10% protein A-agarose was added and allowed to incubate overnight in the cold room. For both protocols the beads were washed five or six times with 200 μl of fresh homogenization buffer and resuspended in a final volume of 60 μl. To this, 60 μl of 2 × Lamelli sample buffer was added. The samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were incubated with 10 μg/ml ERK-1K67R expressed in Sf9 cells (19Wu J. Rossomando A.J. Her J.-H. Vecchio R.D. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9508-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) for 1 h in a solution containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin in Tris-buffered saline consisting of 50 mm Tris pH 7.4 and 0.5 m NaCl. Blots were then washed twice in Tris-buffered saline and fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde. Blots were neutralized in 2% glycine, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and processed in antibodies as for Western blots. Porcine stomach caldesmon was purified according to Bretscher (20Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and chicken gizzard calponin was a generous gift from Dr. J. Haeberle (University of Vermont). Caldesmon and calponin were phosphorylated under similar conditions with purified recombinant MAPK (ERK-1) that was activated by a constitutively active GST-MEK (21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Calponin was used at a 3-fold molar excessversus caldesmon to enhance the probability of observing the incorporation of phosphate. Smooth muscle cells were enzymatically isolated using a previously described procedure, developed specifically to retain pharmacological responsiveness and contractility of the cells (17Katsuyama H. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14555-14558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contractile ability and responsiveness to the α-agonist phenylephrine was confirmed in all experiments. At appropriate time points cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% goat serum, and reacted with a mouse anti-human calponin (Sigma) (1:1000) followed by Texas Red secondary antibody (Calbiochem) and mounted with Fluorosave (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) before analysis. Images were obtained using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon ×100 oil immersion objective (NA 1.3). Filters used were 560 ± 20 nm (excitation), 595 nm (dichroic), and 630 ± 30 nm (emission) for Texas Red. Images were recorded with a liquid cooled CCD camera (Photometrics CH250) via Photometrics Microsoft-compatible Image-processing Software (PMIS™) attached to a MS-DOS-based microcomputer. The digitized images were then processed and analyzed on a SPARC station 5 computer using deconvolution and analysis algorithms written in the Khoros image processing environment and based on Bayesian Maximal Entropy theory, using a priori information as described previously (22Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tao T. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This method gives a resolution of less than 140 nm in thex-y axis. A modified version of a previously described ratio analysis (22Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tao T. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of fluorescence intensities was performed to determine the relative distribution of various labeled proteins within each cell and to normalize for possible differences in staining between cells. A ratio (R) for a central optical section was calculated (after deconvolution) by determining the mean pixel intensity (total intensity, divided by the number of pixels) of the outer 20% of the cell (surface cortex) and dividing this value by the mean pixel intensity of the remaining area (cell core). The part of the section containing the nuclear area was avoided when calculating Rvalues. As has been reported previously from this laboratory, in the presence of PSS containing 2.5 mm [Ca2+]e, force, [Ca2+]i, and LC20 phosphorylation levels increase in ferret aortic strips at 37 °C (Fig.1 A) upon addition of 10−5m of the α-agonist phenylephrine. A sustained increase in isometric force was observed, whereas the increase in intracellular [Ca2+]i and LC20 phosphorylation were observed to be largely transient during this time period. Isometric force reached a maximum level by 4 min and remained at this level throughout the period of activation. The resting level of LC20 phosphorylation was 8.2 ± 1.7 mol Pi/mol protein (n = 5). The level of LC20 phosphorylation reached a maximum of 44 ± 4.9 mol Pi/mol protein (n = 4) after 1 min of stimulation with 10−5m phenylephrine and declined toward basal levels reaching 16 ± 2.2 mol Pi/mol protein (n = 6) at 10 min. Following stimulation with 10−5m phenylephrine, the concentration of intracellular ionized calcium rose sharply from a basal level of 179 ± 18.5 nm to 502 ± 42.5 (n = 3) at 30 s, decreased to 225 ± 37.1 nm(n = 3) by 2 min, and decreased to 200 ± 34.6 nm (n = 3) by 10 min. In contrast to the above results, when force, [Ca2+]i, and LC20 phosphorylation were measured during activation with 10−5m phenylephrine in the absence of [Ca2+]e (2 mm EGTA) (Fig. 1 B), a smaller, yet sustained increase in force was observed; however, no increase in either [Ca2+]ior LC20 phosphorylation was observed at any time point. These observations suggest that sustained force induced by phenylephrine in the absence of [Ca2+]e is regulated by factors other than changes in [Ca2+]i and LC20 phosphorylation. The concentration dependence of ferret aorta for phenylephrine was determined in the presence and the absence of [Ca2+]e (2 mm EGTA). As previously published (23Ruzycky A.L. Morgan K.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 97: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 10−5m phenylephrine is a maximally effective concentration in the presence of [Ca2+]e. This concentration (10−5m) was also found to be maximal for responses measured in the absence of [Ca2+]e. The maximal contractile response in the absence of [Ca2+]e was 23 ± 4% of the maximal contractile response in the presence of [Ca2+]e. The mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) for phenylephrine in the presence of [Ca2+]e was determined to be 3.1 ± 1.5 × 10−8m (n = 4). However, the mean EC50 for phenylephrine in the absence of [Ca2+]e was determined to be 2.7 ± 1.6 × 10−7m (n = 4). This difference in EC50 values is consistent with there being two different mechanisms involved in contraction in the presence and the absence of Ca2+. Subcellular redistributions of PKC-ε and MAPK have been shown to occur during phenylephrine-induced calcium-independent contractions in this tissue (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Khalil R.A. Lajoie C. Resnick M.S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C714-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether all members of the MAPK family or a specific MAPK are involved has not yet been determined. Fig.2 A shows Western blots of MAPKs in whole cell ferret aorta homogenates. Four different antibodies were tested here to determine which isoforms of MAPK are present in this tissue. Three anti-ERK antibodies were used, a polyclonal ERK-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), a monoclonal ERK-2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories), and a monoclonal Pan ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories), reported to recognize MAPKs in the 54- and 90-kDa ranges in addition to ERK-1 and -2. The polyclonal “ERK-1” antibody was the same antibody previously used by Khalil et al. (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C406-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to demonstrate the biphasic translocation of MAPK in ferret aorta cells. All anti-ERK antibodies detected a p42 and a p44 ERK and possibly a p38 isoform in ferret aorta homogenates. The Pan ERK antibody also detected proteins at 54 and ∼87 kDa. Because members of the JNK family of MAPKs are found in the 50-kDa range as well as 46- and 87-kDa ranges, it is possible that some of the bands recognized by the Pan ERK antibody in Fig. 2 are part of the JNK family. Gerthofferet al. (25Gerthoffer W.T. Yamboliev I.A. Shearer M. Pohl J. Haynes R. Sang S. Sato K Sellers J.R. J. Physiol. 1996; 495.3: 597-609Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have also reported the presence of 38-, 50-, and 57-kDa proteins in tracheal smooth muscle recognized by a MAPK antibody that are capable of phosphorylating myelin basic protein. If a p46 JNK were present in ferret aorta, it would possibly be obscured by the presence of ERK-1, thus a p46 specific JNK-1 antibody (Santa Cruz) was also used (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that p46 JNK is present in ferret aorta. Additionally, we found that the ERK-1 antibody previously used to image the targeting of MAPK in the ferret aorta also reacts with expressed JNK-1 protein (Santa Cruz) (Fig. 2 B). Thus, a number of members of the MAP kinase family are present in this vascular smooth muscle. Exactly what role(s) or specificities can be assigned to each type of MAP kinase remains to be determined. MAPK activation was monitored by probing Western blots with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Interestingly, in these freshly isolated tissues, in the absence of serum or agonist stimulation, only a single major band at 45–46 kDa was detected (Fig. 2 C). This band increased in intensity after addition of phenylephrine. On over-exposed blots, a second band could also be detected at p38. Stimulation with a phorbol ester produced no greater signal at p46 but an increased signal at 38 kDa (Fig. 2 C), and bands at higher molecular masses appeared. These data clearly show, however, that the major band tyrosine phosphorylated in response to the α-agonist is at 46 kDa, presumably either ERK-1 or JNK-1 MAPK. Immunoprecipitation of MAPK was performed using the polyclonal ERK-1 antibody that was previously used to demonstrate the transient plasmalemmal translocation followed by contractile filament targeting of MAPK in these cells (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). MAPK was identified as immunoprecipitating at 46 kDa by Western blot of the immunoprecipitate using the same ERK-1 antibody (Fig.2 D). The major protein occurring at 36 kDa was identified by Western blot as calponin, an actin-binding protein (Fig.2 D). As a negative control, an antibody to GRB-2 was also used in immunoprecipitation experiments on ferret aorta whole cell homogenate. The antibody recognizes and immunoprecipitates GRB-2 from these samples, but no co-immunoprecipitating calponin is detectable, supporting the specificity of the interaction between calponin and MAPK. No detectable increase in calponin co-immunoprecipitating with MAPK was seen during agonist stimulation, but at 10 min after the addition of PE, the amount of calponin in the immunoprecipitatesdecreased to an average of 24% of the control level (n = 4). Actin was also identified in the MAPK immunoprecipitates; raising the question of whether calponin was directly binding to MAPK or indirectly, by binding to actin in the immunoprecipitates. Even though PKC-ε and MAPK appear to co-localize on high resolution fluorescence micrographs after 4 min of stimulation of tissue with PE (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we were unsuccessful in detecting PKC-ε in the MAPK immunoprecipitates, which suggests that they do not directly interact. Therefore, immunoprecipitation with an anti-PKC-ε antibody after 4 min of stimulation with phenylephrine was performed on ferret aorta homogenates to further investigate whether PKC-ε associates with MAPK. MAPK was not observed in the immunoprecipitate, but again calponin was determined to be present by Western blot (data not shown), and the amount of calponin in the immunoprecipitate increased by 2 min to an average of 456% of the unstimulated levels (n = 3). To confirm that calponin binds directly to MAP kinase rather than simply being associated with actin in the immunoprecipitates, we performed an overlay assay using ERK-1K67R kinase. As shown in Fig.2 E, MAPK binds directly to isolated purified calponin, actin, caldesmon, and, as a positive control, myelin basic protein. Additionally, a band at the molecular mass of CaP in whole cell homogenates (Fig. 2 E, arrow) also bound MAPK. As a negative control, MAPK did not bind to calmodulin (data not shown). These data indicate that the calponin can directly bind MAPK and argue against its being simply a contaminant in the immunoprecipitate. Additionally, the binding of MAPK to actin directly in the overlay assay is consistent with the targeting of MAPK to contractile filamentsin situ. Calponin has previously been reported to be a substrate of PKC-ε (14Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C589-C594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, an interaction between CaP and MAPK has not been previously reported. Therefore, we tested whether CaP could be used as a substrate by MAPK and found that it was not significantly phosphorylated (Fig. 2 F). In contrast, under identical conditions, using one-third the concentration of caldesmon, phosphorylation by MAPK was readily detectable (Fig. 2F). These findings are consistent with there being no (S/T)P sequences in CaP. Calponin has previously been reported to undergo a dynamic subcellular redistribution during contraction/relaxation cycles in ferret portal vein cells (22Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tao T. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not known if this occurs in other cell types. To determine if calponin is in the appropriate spatio-temporal location to interact with MAPK and PKC-ε in the intact ferret aorta cell, high resolution digital imaging studies were performed using a monoclonal antibody to calponin. In resting cells (Fig. 3 A, top) calponin was distributed on filamentous bundles in the core of the cell. Following 2 min of stimulation with an α-agonist, calponin began to redistribute toward the subplasmalemmal cell cortex. After 4 min (Fig. 3 A, middle) of stimulation with phenylephrine, calponin redistributed to the submembranous cortex where it remained through 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 3 A,bottom). These results were quantitated (Fig. 3 B) by the measurement of a surface-to-cytosolic ratio for the distribution of fluorescently labeled CaP, as described previously (22Parker C.A. Takahashi K. Tao T. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig.3 C, the time course of the redistribution CaP is compared with that of MAPK and PKC-ε and cell shortening as previously determined for this cell type (26Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C406-C411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data show that through 4 min of stimulation, calponin, MAPK, and PKC-ε follow an indistinguishable time course for targeting to the plasmalemma. In the present study we have demonstrated that in the absence of a change in [Ca2+]i or LC20 phosphorylation, phenylephrine can cause a contractile response in ferret aorta smooth muscle. Others have suggested that inhibition of LC20 phosphatase can allow agonist-induced contraction of smooth muscle to occur in the absence of changes in [Ca2+]i (27Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of the phosphatase would result in sustained increases of LC20 phosphorylation, and if this were the mechanism of the contraction, contractile force should parallel LC20 phosphorylation levels. Clearly, the results reported here are not consistent with such a mechanism. The fact that the EC50 for phenylephrine in the presence of [Ca2+]e was determined to be significantly different from the EC50 for phenylephrine in the absence of [Ca2+]e is consistent with there being two different mechanisms involved in the presence and absence of [Ca2+]e. In the presence of Ca2+, activation of myosin light chain kinase is expected to contribute to the generation of tone, but in the absence of Ca2+, other mechanisms must be involved. Past studies have implicated PKC-ε and MAPK in this alternative pathway (6Horowitz A. Menice C.B. Laporte R. Morgan K.G. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 967-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with the detection of MAPK activation under these Ca2+-free conditions (Fig. 2 C). The signaling pathways involving MAP kinase in differentiated nonproliferating cells, such as contractile smooth muscle, are less well understood than those in proliferating cells. This laboratory (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) has previously reported that phenylephrine-induced Ca2+-independent contraction of ferret aorta cells is completely abolished by PKC inhibitors and significantly inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggesting that PKC activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK are involved in a signaling cascade leading to Ca2+-independent smooth muscle contraction. The signals that link PKC activation to MAP kinase activation in differentiated smooth muscle remain unclear. Khalil et al. (15Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L.A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) described an initial translocation of MAPK to the membrane after 4 min of phenylephrine stimulation. This translocation was totally inhibited by PKC antagonists and was previously shown to coincide with translocation of PKC-ε to the plasma membrane. Tyrosine phosphorylation had been thought to act as a targeting mechanism for translocation of kinases to the surface membrane. However, in this same study, Khalil et al. showed that tyrosine kinase antagonists did not block and actually enhanced translocation of MAPK to the plasmalemma. Additionally, on imaging with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies, tyrosine phosphorylation was only detectable after MAPK had translocated to the membrane. In contrast, tyrosine kinase inhibition blocked the later targeting to the contractile filaments, suggesting a possible mechanism for the second phase of MAPK targeting in these cells, but the mechanism by which MAPK localization to the plasmalemma occurs was unknown. We were surprised to find that calponin co-immunoprecipitates with MAPK in these cells and furthermore to find that CaP directly binds MAPK as demonstrated by overlay assay. Interestingly, MAPK was found not to phosphorylate CaP as a result of this interaction. The fact that the amount of CaP in the MAPK immunoprecipitates decreased 4-fold below control levels at a late (by 10 min) time point of agonist-activation but that the amount of calponin in the PKC-ε immunoprecipitates increased at early time points is consistent with a model where calponin is associated with MAPK in the resting cells, but upon PE-induced activation of PKC-ε, calponin also associates with PKC-ε and acts as an adapter protein that may facilitate the translocation of MAPK to the membrane with PKC-ε. Calponin was originally suggested, based on its in vitroactin binding and myosin ATPase-inhibiting properties, to play a role in directly inhibiting the interaction of actin and myosin (reviewed in Ref. 6Horowitz A. Menice C.B. Laporte R. Morgan K.G. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 967-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Some results reported in permeabilized cells from this and other laboratories are consistent with this interpretation (28Horowitz A. Clement-Chomienne O. Walsh M.P. Tao T. Katsuyama H. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1858-H1863PubMed Google Scholar, 29Itoh T. Suzuki A. Watanabe Y. Mino T. Naka M. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The imaging studies reported here indicate that CaP leaves the actin filaments before detectable shortening occurs, and it is unclear how to reconcile these findings with a mechanism involving direct modulation of myosin ATPase activity at the myofilament level. In contrast, the fact that the redistribution of calponin coincides with that of PKC-ε and MAPK in these cells suggests a signaling role for CaP and provides a possible mechanism for the targeting of MAPK to the surface membrane."

To determine the functional significance of covalent pFN-fibrin interactions, we have developed anin vitro model which allows the incorporation of recombinant FN (recFN) molecules into a covalently cross-linked recFN-fibrin matrix. Using the baculovirus expression system, we have expressed recFN monomers composed of the amino-terminal 70-kDa region and the first 11 type III repeats (WT) with mutations in the glutamines at positions 3 and 4 (Q2) or at 3, 4, and 16 (Q3). Examination of the covalent incorporation of these recFNs into fibrin clots confirms that glutamines 3 and 4 are major participants in FN-fibrin cross-linking as the mutation of these sites reduces cross-linking efficiency by 65%.

When the Q3 recFN-fibrin clots were used as substrates for cell adhesion, there was a decrease in both cell attachment and spreading when compared with the WT recFN-fibrin clots.

These data demonstrate that for maximal cell attachment to a FN-fibrin clot, FN must be cross-linked to fibrin by factor XIIIa. Following tissue injury, formation of a blood clot serves both to restore vascular integrity and to provide a provisional matrix for the initiation of wound repair (1Clark R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Mosesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar, 3Clark R.A. Lanigan J.M. Della Pelle P. Manseau E.

The clot's major protein components, fibrin and plasma fibronectin (pFN), 1The abbreviations used are: pFN, plasma fibronectin; FN, fibronectin; factor XIIIa, activated factor XIII; recFN, recombinant fibronectin; WT, 70kDIII1–11; Q2, 70kDIII1–11(Q3,4L); Q3, 70kDIII1–11(Q3,4,16A); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: pFN, plasma fibronectin; FN, fibronectin; factor XIIIa, activated factor XIII; recFN, recombinant fibronectin; WT, 70kDIII1–11; Q2, 70kDIII1–11(Q3,4L); Q3, 70kDIII1–11(Q3,4,16A); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. are essential to these functions. Clot polymerization begins when soluble fibrinogen is converted by thrombin to fibrin (4Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). This proteolytic event is followed by spontaneous assembly of fibrin monomers into polymers (2Mosesson M.W. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 177-188PubMed Google Scholar, 4Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Concurrently, soluble pFN is incorporated with fibrin into the clot. As the clot matures, intermolecular cross-linking between fibrin molecules and between pFN and fibrin proceeds, dependent on activated coagulation factor XIII (factor XIIIa, plasma transglutaminase) (5Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1639-1645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Keski-Oja J. Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Cell. 1976; 9: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). While covalent cross-linking between fibrin molecules is essential for the clot's structural stability, the presence of pFN with its multiple adhesive domains is important to the cell adhesion and migration events required for the wound healing process. For example, FN is an absolute requirement for migration of fibroblasts into plasma clots in vitro, where it must be present prior to initiation of the clotting reaction (7Knox P. Crooks S. Rimmer C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cross-linking of FN to soluble fibrin-coated dishes promotes fibroblast attachment and spreading (8Grinnell F. Feld M. Minter D. Cell. 1980; 19: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) while fibroblast adherence to a cross-linked FN-fibrin clot matrix results in unique cytoskeletal organization (9Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, the association with FN improves the adhesive character of fibrin substrates and factor XIIIa-mediated covalent cross-linking appears to play a key role in this process.Fibronectin, a multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein, plays an important role not only in hemostasis and tissue repair, but also in embryogenesis and oncogenic transformation (10Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc., New York1990Crossref Google Scholar, 11Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Each FN subunit contains two major fibrin-binding sites which mediate noncovalent interaction with fibrin (12Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Sekiguchi K. Hakomori S-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3967-3973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuka Y.V.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These have been localized to the amino-terminal type I repeats 1–5 and the carboxyl-terminal type I repeats 10–12 (12Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Matsuka Y.V. Medved L.V. Brew S.A. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9539-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Covalent FN-fibrin binding involves glutamine residues localized to a 27-kDa amino-terminal FN fragment containing repeats I1–5. Cross-linking at these sites is mediated by thrombin-activated factor XIII (factor XIIIa) which catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between a glutamine (Gln) in FN and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue in the α-chain of fibrin (16Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar,17Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Only a small subset of proteins are able to act as effective glutamine acceptors for factor XIIIa. The enzyme's stringent specificity is determined by the amino acid sequence surrounding the reactive glutamine residue (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9007-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2712-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of pFN with factor XIIIa and labeled lysine analogs has identified the primary factor XIIIa-reactive site as the glutamine in the third position from the amino terminus, but Gln-4 has also been shown to be factor XIIIa-reactive (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Dell A. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).We have developed an in vitro model that allows the incorporation of recombinant FN (recFN) molecules into a cross-linked recFN-fibrin matrix. The cross-linked products can then be quantified or alternatively, the recFN-fibrin clots can be used to form substrates for cell attachment. In this study, we sought to determine the role of covalent cross-linking in promoting cell interaction with a FN-fibrin clot. FN molecules composed of the amino-terminal 70-kDa region and the first 11 type III repeats (WT) with mutations in the glutamines at positions 3 and 4 (Q2) or at positions 3, 4, and 16 (Q3) were used to form recFN-fibrin matrices. RecFN-fibrin cross-linking was analyzed and cell adhesion assays were performed. These experiments have confirmed that Gln-3 and Gln-4 are the major participants in factor XIIIa-mediated FN-fibrin cross-linking, but suggest that Gln-16 may also be factor XIIIa-reactive. When Q3 recFN-fibrin clots were used to measure cell adhesion, a decrease in both cell attachment and cell spreading were observed. Thus, these data provide strong evidence that factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of FN to fibrin is required for effective cell adhesion to a FN-fibrin matrix.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureMouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). For cell attachment and spreading assays, cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM for biologic assays as described (9Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were labeled overnight with 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in DMEM-methionine supplemented with 10% calf serum and 1.5 μg/ml cold methionine. BTI-TN-5B1–4 (High Five) insect cell line (Invitrogen Co.) was maintained in TMN-FH (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). For purification of recombinant protein, High Five cells were grown in Express Five (Life Technologies, Inc.) serum-free medium supplemented with 18 mml-glutamine.Preparation of Mutants and Construction of FN cDNAs70kDIII1–11Construction of the 5′ end of 70kDIII1–11 has been previously described (22Aguirre K.M. McCormick R.J. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27863-27868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A termination codon at position 5150 was generated by adding anXbaI linker to a blunted PstI site located at the end of type III repeat 11. This fragment of the rat FN cDNA (from position −20 to 5150 relative to the ATG) was inserted between theBamHI and XbaI sites in the baculovirus vector pVL1393.70kDIII1–11(Q3,4L) (Q2)A 420-base pair fragment containing the factor XIIIa recognition site was cloned into pGEM-3Zf(−) (Promega Biotec). A single-stranded DNA template was prepared and annealed to a 21-base pair oligonucleotide, 5′-CTGCACGATTAGCAGAGCCTG-3′ (Synthesis and Sequencing Facility, Princeton University) complementary to the desired mutant sequence (5′-CAGGCT CTGCTAATCGTGCAG-3′). Substitution of T's (underlined) for A's in the native sequence changes amino acid residues 3 and 4 from <QAQQIVQ> to <QALLIVQ> and also results in the loss of a DdeI restriction site (in bold). The mutant oligonucleotide was incorporated into the cDNA using Version 2 of the Oligonucleotide-directed In VitroSystem (Amersham Corp.) as directed by the manufacturer. AnNheI-HaeII fragment containing the mutation was used to generate 70kDIII1–11(Q3,4L).70kDIII1–11(Q3,4,16A) (Q3)Mutations of the glutamine residues at positions 3, 4, and 16 were generated using the following approach: two separate 5′ primers, FNQQ34AA and FNQ16A (Synthesis and Sequencing Facility, Princeton University), were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the amino-terminal region. The primer FNQQ34AA (nucleotides 77–123) (5′-AAACCGGGAAGAGCAAGAGGCAGGCTGCAGCAATCGTGCAGCCTCCG-3′) introduced base pair changes as underlined. This results in a change in the codons from glutamines to alanines at both positions 3 and 4 and creates a new PstI site (in italics). PCR amplification was performed using FNQQ34AA and a 3′ primer which included bases 1022 to 1043 (primer I6A). An EarI to AvrII fragment from the PCR product was then used to insert the Q3,4A mutation into the FN cDNA. The primer FNQ16A (nucleotides 99–145) (5′-GGCTGCAGCAATCGTGCAGCCTCCGGTGGCTGTCAGCGCTAGCAAGCCT-3′) changes the codon for residue 16 from Q to A and introduces a newEco47III site (in bold). FNQ16A overlaps FNQQ34A and includes the new PstI site (in italics). PCR amplification using a Q3,4A template was performed using FNQ16A and I6A primers. APstI-PvuII fragment of the PCR product was isolated and cloned into pSP73 (pSP73-Q16A). This plasmid was then used to generate a PstI-AvrII fragment that was cloned into the Q3,4A cDNA yielding Q3,4,16A. The Q3 construction was created by inserting the cDNA fragment containing all three mutations into the 70kDIII1–11 cDNA in pVL1393. All of the mutations were confirmed following construction by restriction digests and sequence analysis.Recombinant Protein Production and PurificationRecombinant protein production was performed as described previously (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 134: 573-583Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant baculoviruses were generated by cotransfection of High Five cells with FN constructions in baculovirus vector pVL1393 and Baculogold DNA (Pharmingen). Single viral clones were obtained by limiting dilution cloning of transfection supernatants. High titer stocks were then amplified as described by Summers and Smith (24Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Texas Agricultural and Experimental Station Bulletin. 1987; 1555: 1-55Google Scholar). High Five cells grown in serum-free Express Five medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 175-cm2 flasks were infected with high-titer viral stock. The culture medium was collected 3 days post-infection at which time protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) and EDTA (10 mm) were added. Recombinant FN (recFN) and rat plasma FN (pFN) were purified by gelatin-agarose chromatography (25Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and stored at −80° C in CAPS-buffered saline (0.01 m CAPS, 0.15m NaCl, pH 11.0). Purity of the preparations was confirmed by silver stain analysis after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar, 27Merril C.R. Goldman D. VanKeuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 1004: 441-447Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar).Formation and Analysis of FN-Fibrin ClotsLyophilized human fibrinogen (98.8% clottable, American Diagnostica) and bovine thrombin were reconstituted as described previously (9Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous human plasma FN contaminating the fibrinogen was removed by batch incubation with gelatin-agarose. To assess the cross-linking efficiency of the recFNs versus pFN, the clotting reactions were composed of the following components mixed in a 10:1 physiologic ratio of fibrinogen to FN: fibrinogen (600 μg/ml), pFN/recFN (60 μg/ml), thrombin (2 units/ml), 0.02 mCaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Human coagulation factor XIII (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) was added at 6 μg/ml (28Tran H. Tanaka A. Litvinovich S.V. Medved L.V. Haudenschild C.C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19458-19464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The clots were formed in a volume of 0.05 ml in microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for various time periods as indicated. To prepare ligand-coated dishes, the clotting components were mixed in a volume of 0.06 to 0.25 ml to give concentrations of fibrinogen and FN of 2.4 and 0.12 mg/ml, respectively. The remainder of the clotting components were at the concentrations as described above. After the addition of thrombin, the clotting reaction was rapidly pipetted into nontissue culture dishes and allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C. Care was taken to ensure that the mixture completely covered the bottom of the dish.To solubilize the clots, an equal volume of S buffer (8 murea, 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.16 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) was added to each reaction. Separation and identification of cross-linked products was performed as described in Wilson and Schwarzbauer (29Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E . J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linked products were separated on 5% polyacrylamide minigels and, after transfer to nitrocellulose, FN was detected using hybridoma culture supernatant containing a rat-specific monoclonal antibody, 5G4, at a dilution of 1:100. Immunoblots were then developed using biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by peroxide and 4-chloro-1-naphthol substrate.Quantitation of cross-linking was performed according to Sechleret al. (23Sechler J.L. Takada Y. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 134: 573-583Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of cross-linked products were blocked overnight at room temperature with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl) and then incubated with 5G4 monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100 in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h. After three washes in TBS, the filter was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) diluted to 1 mg/ml in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times in TBS. Approximately 3 μCi of 125I-Protein A (NEN Life Science Products) was then added to the filter in 10 ml of 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS. The125I-Protein A was incubated with the blot for 1 h at room temperature and then washed four times with Buffer A until the background signal was minimal. Washed blots were exposed to a phosphor storage screen and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Uncross-linked monomer was calculated for each of four time points using Image Quant software and the percent of recFN monomer incorporated into high molecular weight multimers over time was determined. After exposure to the phosphor storage screen, immunoblots were exposed to film (X-Omat; Eastman Kodak).Cell Attachment and Spreading AssayTo quantitate cell attachment to clots containing different FNs, 96-well non-tissue culture dishes were coated with FN-fibrin clots as detailed above. After the overnight incubation, the clots were washed with serum-free DMEM. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine as described above. A total of 4 × 104 cells in serum-free DMEM were added per well and then allowed to attach for 30 min. Wells were gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The wells were allowed to dry at 37 °C for 2 h and then exposed for 20 min to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) as described by Daltonet al. (30Dalton B.A. Dziegielewski M. Johnson G. Underwood P.A. Steele J.G. Biotechniques. 1996; 21: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Total counts per well were determined using Image Quant Software. For each experiment, clots containing either pFN or recFN were formed in quadruplicate. The results are representative of one of three experiments.To determine cell area, 4 × 104 cells were applied to clots formed in 48-well non-tissue culture dishes. Attached and spread cells were examined using inverted phase-contrast optics. Photographic images were captured using an NEC video camera (NEC Corp.) connected to a Macintosh 7100/80 computer equipped with a Scion LG3 image capture board (Scion Corp). Cell area was measured using NIH Image Software. Experiments were repeated in duplicate with 50–80 measurements each. The area for each cell was recorded and allotted to a specific range as indicated. The resulting histogram is representative of the area distributions of the cells adherent to the substrate as indicated.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described an in vitro model that allows the incorporation of recFN molecules into a cross-linked fibrin matrix. In the presence of activated factor XIII, these recFNs are covalently bound to fibrin in a reaction that mimics in vivo clotting events. The resulting matrix can then be analyzed to quantify FN-fibrin cross-linking or used as a substrate for cell attachment. We have used this model to determine the functional significance of covalent FN-fibrin interactions. FN molecules composed of the 70-kDa region and the first 11 type III repeats (WT) with mutations in the glutamines at positions 3 and 4 (Q2) or at positions 3, 4, and 16 (Q3) were used to form recFN-fibrin clots. These experiments demonstrate a 65% decrease in the cross-linking efficiency of the Q2 recFN confirming that Gln-3 and -4 are major factor XIIIa-reactive sites in the amino terminus of FN as has been previously described (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Dell A. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Greater than 99% of cross-linking was then eliminated by the additional mutation of Gln-16. When the Q3-fibrin clots were formed as substrates for cell adhesion, there was a significant decrease in both cell attachment and spreading when compared with the WT-fibrin clot. This provides strong evidence that factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of FN to fibrin is required for efficient cell-FN interactions.Site-specific labeling of the factor XIIIa-reactive glutamines in FN has been performed using lysine analogs such as putrescine or monodansylcadaverine and has shown that Gln-3 near the amino terminus of FN is a major factor XIIIa-reactive residue (21McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Magnusson S. Dell A. Morris H.R. FEBS Lett. 1981; 127: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Factor XIIIa displays a preference for the first glutamine in an X-Q-Q sequence, not only in FN, but also in the γ-chains of fibrin (31Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4487-4491Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), in α2-plasmin inhibitor (32Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in α2-macroglobulin (33Mortensen S.B. Sottrup-Jensen L. Hansen H.F. Rider D. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second glutamine can also be labeled but to a much lesser degree (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results confirm that Gln-3 and Gln-4 are primary sites for FN-fibrin cross-linking, but in their absence cross-linking still occurs, indicating that another glutamine residue is susceptible to factor XIIIa. To determine a possible candidate residue, the structural features of transglutaminase specificity were considered.Transglutaminases are a highly conserved family of enzymes with widespread tissue distribution (16Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 17Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). They catalyze the formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds either within or between polypeptide chains creating cross-linked multimeric structures (6Keski-Oja J. Mosher D.F. Vaheri A. Cell. 1976; 9: 29-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb.

In general, these enzymes have a broad specificity for donor amines. However, only a small subset of proteins are able to act as effective glutamine acceptors and this depends on their capacity to form acyl-enzyme intermediates with the enzyme's active site. Activated factor XIII (plasma transglutaminase) has particularly stringent structural requirements for glutamine residues (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9007-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2712-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Gorman and Folk (18Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found β-casein to be an excellent substrate for factor XIIIa but a poor substrate for liver transglutaminase. Furthermore, they noted that the determinants for enzyme recognition of β-casein were contained in the linear sequence surrounding the glutamine at position 167 (19Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9007-9010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2712-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues 10 through 18 in FN have significant homology to this sequence with Gln-16 corresponding to the reactive glutamine in the β-casein sequence. Mutation of this residue in conjunction with Gln-3 and Gln-4 eliminated >99% of cross-linking. These data suggest that Gln-16 may function as an additional acceptor site which seems likely given its homology to the β-casein sequence. However, it does not rule out that the mutation may disrupt the tertiary structure of the amino terminus so that factor XIIIa recognition of an alternate site is affected.The major finding of this work is that the factor XIIIa-mediated formation of covalent bonds between FN and fibrin is required for maximal cell adhesion to a FN-fibrin matrix. The presence of pFN in the fibrin clot is essential to its function as a provisional matrix as it provides important adhesive sites for cell attachment and migration into the wound (1Clark R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Clark R.A. Lanigan J.M. Della Pelle P. Manseau E. Dvorak H.F. Colvin R.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1982; 79: 264-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Our results now demonstrate that the mere presence of FN is not sufficient for efficient cell attachment and spreading. Rather, FN must be covalently cross-linked to fibrin to provide an effective adhesive substrate. These data support the suggestion by others that FN-fibrin cross-linking can influence cell adhesion. Grinnell et al. (7Knox P. Crooks S. Rimmer C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FN cross-linked by factor XIIIa to soluble fibrin-coated dishes was required for fibroblast attachment and spreading. Other work determined that fibroblast migration into plasma clots required pFN-fibrin interaction during clot formation (8Grinnell F. Feld M. Minter D. Cell. 1980; 19: 517-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When FN was adsorbed to FN-depleted plasma clots, cell migration was not observed, supporting a role for factor XIIIa-mediated FN-fibrin cross-linking in these events. Thus, it is apparent that covalent interaction between FN and fibrin can modulate FN's adhesive properties in some fashion.One possible explanation for the cross-linking requirement may be that cross-linking of FN to fibrin induces a conformational change in the molecule that influences cell recognition of its adhesive domains. Soluble FN is a poor ligand for cell surface receptors as it adopts a compact conformation which is maintained by hydrophobic interactions (34Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 648-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). When FN is immobilized onto a surface, however, it appears as though the molecule unfolds (35Odermatt E. Engel J. Mosher D.F.

Using recombinant glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, we show that the C-terminal domains of both proteins bind paxillin in vitro. The C-terminal domain of CAKβ was engineered to be autonomously expressed in chicken embryo cells and, like pp125FAK and p41/43FRNK (the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of pp125FAK), was found to localize to cellular focal adhesions. In contrast, full-length CAKβ was generally found diffusely distributed throughout the cell, although a fraction of the cells exhibited focal adhesion localization. Vanadate treatment of pp125FAK- and CAKβ-overexpressing CE cells induced a dramatic increase in the phosphotyrosine content of a common set of proteins including tensin, paxillin, and p130Cas, but some of these substrates, particularly p130Cas, appeared to be differentially phosphorylated by pp125FAK and CAKβ. Levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were higher in CAKβ-overexpressing cells, and additional phosphotyrosine-containing species were specifically immunoprecipitated. In addition, vanadate treatment of CE cells overexpressing CAKβ, but not pp125FAKoverexpressors, induced a profound morphological change, which could be a consequence of the observed differences in substrate phosphorylation. pp125FAK and CAKβ/Pyk2/CadTK/RAFTK are related protein-tyrosine kinases.

Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 2Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Thus, pp125FAK colocalizes with the integrins, which are heterodimeric, transmembrane receptors that bind to proteins in the extracellular matrix, e.g. fibronectin and collagen (3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar, 4Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). The integrins function in cell adhesion cytoskeleton anchorage and in the transduction of extracellular stimuli into cytoplasmic signals, including the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 6Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). pp125FAK is one of the major substrates for integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, and concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation, it becomes enzymatically active (2Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 7Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T.

Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is therefore anticipated that pp125FAK will prove a fundamental element in an integrin-regulated signaling pathway. In addition, a number of other stimuli, including neuropeptides and growth factors, have been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK (5Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The function of pp125FAK has been explored by disrupting endogenous pp125FAK signaling. Overexpression of the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of pp125FAK, which contains the focal adhesion targeting sequence, blocks pp125FAK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates and impairs the spreading of chicken embryo cells on fibronectin (11Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Microinjection of a similar fragment of pp125FAK into human umbilical vein endothelial cells had little effect upon the structure of focal adhesions but abolished focal adhesion-associated phosphotyrosine and inhibited cell migration (12Gilmore A. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). pp125FAKexpression has also been obliterated by gene knockout, which results in embryonic lethality (13Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Cell lines derived fromfak −/− embryos exhibit a more rounded morphology, a distribution of focal adhesions that differs from wild type cells, and a retarded rate of cell migration (13Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). However, normal phosphorylation of pp125FAK substrates was reported. These results support the contention that pp125FAK may regulate cell spreading and motility; however, the mechanism of regulation has yet to be established. Recently, a pp125FAK-related PTK, called CAKβ/Pyk2/RAFTK/CadTK, was isolated (14Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

CAKβ is absent from focal adhesions when expressed exogenously in COS cells, and its phosphotyrosine content is independent of cell adhesion (14Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, in a megakaryocytic cell line, CAKβ colocalizes with vinculin and exhibits cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (18Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cross-linking β1integrins on the surface of B cells using mAbs induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKβ (19Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKβ in PC12 cells occurs in response to a number of stimuli including bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, carbachol, and membrane depolarization (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Since calcium ionophores stimulate CAKβ tyrosine phosphorylation and chelation of extracellular Ca2+ abrogates tyrosine phosphorylation of CAKβ in response to various stimuli, this kinase is believed to be a Ca2+-regulated PTK (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). pp125FAK and CAKβ exhibit the same overall topology with large N and C termini approximately 400 residues in length flanking a central catalytic domain. The C-terminal 150 residues of pp125FAK represent the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence, which directs pp125FAK to its location in the cell and contains binding sites for two focal adhesion-associated proteins, paxillin and talin (21Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 22Hildebrand J.D.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The most highly conserved region between these two kinases is the C-terminal FAT sequence, which exhibits 61% identity between CAKβ and pp125FAK (the catalytic domains are only 60% identical). There are four sites of tyrosine phosphorylation within pp125FAK (24Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 25Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are conserved in CAKβ. Autophosphorylation of pp125FAK (at tyrosine 397) and CAKβ (at tyrosine 402) create binding sites for the SH2 domain of the Src-like PTKs (20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 24Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of an additional site in pp125FAK, tyrosine 925, creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein GRB2 (26Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), suggesting a function for pp125FAK in regulating the Ras signaling pathway and ultimately mitogen-activated protein kinase. There is evidence, however, that mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to integrin stimulation and other stimuli, like bombesin, is pp125FAK-independent (27Lin T.H. Aplin A.E.

Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). There is convincing evidence that CAKβ regulates the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) and some evidence that Jun kinase may be regulated by CAKβ (17Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L.

Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). There are also several proline-rich regions in the C-terminal domain that are conserved between these PTKs. In pp125FAK, these serve as binding sites for the Src homology 3 domains of other signaling molecules including p130Cas (31Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10685Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 32Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), phosphatidyl-inositol 3′-kinase (33Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and a GTPase-activating protein called GRAF (34Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Very recently, CAKβ was reported to associate at low stoichiometry with p130Cas (19Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Given the relatedness of these sequences, it seemed likely that the C-terminal domains of CAKβ and pp125FAK might serve similar functions. We report here a comparative analysis of pp125FAK and CAKβ and demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of CAKβ can bind the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin in vitro and targets to focal adhesions when expressed in chicken embryo (CE) cells. We show that full-length CAKβ is predominantly found diffusely distributed when exogenously expressed in CE cells, although a fraction of the cells display prominent focal adhesion localization. Comparison of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates suggests that both pp125FAK and CAKβ can phosphorylate similar proteins, although the regulation of phosphorylation and sites targeted are likely to differ. Finally we report that unique morphological changes are induced in CAKβ-expressing CE cells upon vanadate treatment, indicating differential consequences of CAKβ- and pp125FAK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These observations suggest that pp125FAK and CAKβ may have partially redundant functions but also exhibit very distinct functions, particularly in substrate recognition, when expressed in CE cells. CE cells were prepared as described (36Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Exogenous proteins were expressed using the RCAS A replication-competent, avian retroviral vector (37Hughes H.S. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was transfected into CE cells as described (36Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and the cells were passaged for 7–10 days, allowing spread of the virus throughout the culture. In experiments to study adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were trypsinized, and the trypsin was neutralized with soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and then plated onto Petri dishes coated either with a solution of 0.1 mg/ml of poly-l-lysine or fibronectin (2.5 μg/cm2) (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were treated with 50 μm sodium orthovanadate for 16 h at 37 °C (38Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Cells were visualized using a Nikon TMS inverted microscope and photographed using a polaroid camera (NPC Photo Division; Newton, MA) and Type 107 film. RCAS A constructs containing epitope-tagged derivatives of full-length FAK and the autonomously expressed C-terminal noncatalytic domain, called FRNK, have been described (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). An epitope-tagged derivative of the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of CAKβ was engineered using polymerase chain reaction. Two primers (5′-TGACGGATCCAAGATGGAGAGGGACATTGC and 3′-CCCTAAGCTTCTCTGCAGGAGGGTGGGCCA) were used on the rat CAKβ cDNA as a template to amplify the sequences between nucleotides 2050 and 3027. The 5′-primer created a BamHI site and a point mutation creating a more optimal consensus translation initiation site at methionine 685 (nucleotides 2053–2055) (39Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The 3′-primer removed the CAKβ termination codon and created a HindIII site. Approximately 10 ng of template was amplified using 1 μmprimers, a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 2 units of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) in the manufacturer's reaction buffer for 30 cycles. The product was inserted between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pctag, an epitope tagging vector (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The resulting construct contains the CAKβ sequences from methionine 685 to the penultimate codon (glutamic acid 1009) fused in frame with sequences encoding the KT3 epitope tag (40MacArthur H. Walter G. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 483-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing of the entire amplified fragment verified that no mutations were introduced during the procedure. An epitope-tagged full-length CAKβ construct was created by cleaving the original CAKβ cDNA with EcoRI and XbaI to liberate the fragment from the 5′-end of the cDNA to theXbaI site at nucleotide 2803. This fragment was used to replace nucleotides 2050–2803 of the epitope-tagged C-terminal domain construct in pctag. Both the tagged C-terminal and full-length constructs were then rescued into RCAS A. CE cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (41Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated, or lysates were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 mg of cell lysate was incubated on ice with 2–5 μg of mAb for 1–2 h, and then the immune complexes were captured with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) by incubation for 1–2 h at 4 °C. For denaturation experiments, SDS (1% final concentration) was added to the lysates, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. The SDS was diluted to 0.1% final concentration with RIPA, and immunoprecipitations were performed. Immune complexes were boiled in sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitations and blotting, commercially available mAbs recognizing paxillin and p130Cas were used (Transduction Laboratories; Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the tag (KT3) and tensin (5B9) were a gift of Dr. J. T. Parsons. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Phosphotyrosine was detected using the recombinant antibody RC20 (Transduction Laboratories) and ECL. The C-terminal noncatalytic domains of pp125FAK (residues 687–1054) (22Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and CAKβ (residues 670–1009) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins inEscherichia coli DH5. Expression was induced at 37 °C with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were lysed by sonication in NETN buffer (44Kaelin Jr W.G. Pallas D.S. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), the lysates were clarified, and GST proteins were purified by binding to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) (45Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The concentration of GST protein bound to beads was estimated by comparison with a bovine serum albumin standard following SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Approximately 200 μg of total CE cell lysate was precleared by incubation with 24 μg of GST immobilized to glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. The cleared supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads bound to 2 μg of GST-Cterm (pp125FAK fusion protein), GST-cDom (CAKβ fusion protein), or GST as a negative binding control. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with constant rocking, the beads were collected, washed twice with lysis buffer, washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, and boiled in sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and 24 h later fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100 as described (36Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 46Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were incubated with mAb KT3 (5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) (Affinipure, min X; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; West Grove, PA). The cells were visualized using a Leitz Orthoplan microscope with a Leitz × 63 (1.4 N.A.) objective, and images were collected with a Hamamatsu CCD camera and MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.; West Chester, PA). Given the degree of sequence identity between the C termini of pp125FAK and CAKβ, it seemed likely that the two might have conserved C-terminal functions. To determine if the C-terminal sequences within CAKβ were capable of binding paxillin, an in vitro binding assay was utilized. The C-terminal domains of pp125FAK and CAKβ were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins and purified (45Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins, immobilized on glutathione beads, were incubated with RIPA lysates prepared from CE cells for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the paxillin bound to the beads was visualized by Western blotting. As previously reported, paxillin bound to the GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of pp125FAK (22Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and a similar amount of paxillin bound to beads containing the C terminus of CAKβ (Fig.1). There was no detectable paxillin bound to GST alone immobilized on glutathione beads, indicating that the pp125FAK and CAKβ sequences mediated binding to paxillin. This result suggests that sequences common to pp125FAK and CAKβ compose the paxillin binding site. Two previous analyses using different cell types report differences in the subcellular localization of CAKβ (14Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 18Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further address this issue, we sought to directly compare the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the C-terminal domains of pp125FAK and CAKβ in CE cells. The C-terminal domain of CAKβ was engineered to be expressed autonomously using an internal methionine codon (685 in full-length CAKβ) for translation initiation. This is the CAKβ equivalent of p41/43FRNK, the C-terminal domain of pp125FAK, which is expressed autonomously in CE cells and targets to focal adhesions (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This construct, called CRNK, was epitope-tagged and expressed in CE cells using RCAS A. Approximately 10 days post-transfection, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 25 μg of protein was analyzed by Western blotting using KT3, the mAb directed against the tag. CE cell lysates contained no KT3-immunoreactive bands. Lysate from cells expressing tagged p41/43FRNK exhibited a single KT3-reactive band ofM r 43,000 (Fig.2 A). A 42-kDa band in lysates from cells expressing CRNK was recognized by KT3 (Fig. 2 A). This band could sometimes be resolved into a doublet (Fig.2 A). Although not obvious from this experiment, p41/43FRNK is frequently resolved into a doublet, the slower form representing a phosphorylated isoform of the faster species (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 47Richardson A. Shannon J.D. Adams R.B. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that KT3 could immunoprecipitate both p41/43FRNK and CRNK and that polyclonal antiserum and a mAb directed against the C-terminal domain of pp125FAKrecognized p41/43FRNK but not CRNK (data not shown). These results demonstrate the successful expression of the C-terminal CAKβ construct and show that KT3 recognizes the tag at its C terminus in both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays. The subcellular localization of tagged CRNK was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using mAb KT3. Uninfected CE cells exhibited a faint, diffuse background staining with KT3 (Fig.3 A), whereas cells expressing epitope-tagged FRNK exhibited a characteristic focal adhesion staining as reported previously (Fig. 3 B) (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Virtually every CE cell expressing the tagged CRNK construct exhibited a focal adhesion staining pattern that was indistinguishable from the pattern seen with tagged FRNK (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, at least when autonomously expressed in CE cells, the C-terminal domain of CAKβ is effectively localized to cellular focal adhesions. Having established that the C terminus of CAKβ contains sequences that target it to focal adhesions in CE cells, the subcellular localization of the full-length protein was reevaluated. An epitope-tagged full-length CAKβ construct was engineered and expressed in CE cells using RCAS A. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 25 μg of total cellular protein was analyzed by Western blotting with KT3. In lysate from CE cells expressing epitope-tagged pp125FAK (10Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), a 125-kDa protein was recognized (Fig. 2 B). KT3 recognized a slightly smaller protein in cells expressing-tagged CAKβ (Fig.2 B). Both the epitope-tagged pp125FAK and tagged CAKβ could be immunoprecipitated with KT3 and subsequently detected with KT3 on a Western blot (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, immunoprecipitated tagged pp125FAK was recognized by mAb 2A7 on a Western blot, whereas tagged CAKβ was not (data not shown). Conversely, immunoprecipitated, tagged CAKβ was recognized with a specific polyclonal antiserum raised against CAKβ/CadTK (a gift of X. Li and Dr. S. Earp) (17Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

These results verify the expression of the tagged CAKβ"

VacA inhibited the conversion of procathepsin D (53 kDa) into both the intermediate (47 kDa) and the mature (31 kDa) form. Nonprocessed cathepsin D was partly retained inside cells and partly secreted in the extracellular medium via the constitutive secretion pathway. Intracellular degradation of EGF was also inhibited by VacA with a similar dose-response curve. VacA did not alter endocytosis, cell surface recycling, and retrograde transport from plasma membrane totrans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum, as estimated by using transferrin, diphtheria toxin, and ricin as tracers. Subcellular fractionation of intoxicated cells showed that procathepsin D and nondegraded EGF accumulate in lysosomes. Measurements of intracellular acidification with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran revealed a partial neutralization of the lumen of endosomes and lysosomes, sufficient to account for both mistargeting of procathepsin D outside the cell and the decreased activity of lysosomal proteases.

Accordingly, experimental infection of animals proved that only VacA-producing H. pylori strains elicit gastric inflammation (12Marchetti M. Aricò B. Burroni D. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Ghiara P. Science. 1995; 2674: 1655-1658Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and oral administration of purified VacA to mice induces epithelial degeneration of the stomach epithelium (13Ghiara P.

VacA is released as a 95-kDa protein that has a strong tendency to oligomerize in heptamers (14Lupetti P. Heuser J.E. Manetti R. Lanzavecchia S. Bellon P.L. Dallai R. Rappuoli R. Telford J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similar to bacterial protein toxins with intracellular targets, VacA is split by limited proteolysis at a specific site into two fragments, 37 and 58 kDa, which remain associated by noncovalent forces (15Telford J.L. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Tecce M.F. Censini S. Covacci A. Xiang Z. Papini E. Montecucco C. Parente L. Rappuoli R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recombinant 58-kDa fragment renders liposomes permeable to potassium at acidic pH (16Moll G. Papini E. Colonna R. Burroni D. Telford J. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). VacA induces in cultured cells the formation of perinuclear vacuoles that grow in size and gradually fill all the cytosol (6Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leunk R.D. Johnson P.T. David B.C. Kraft W.G. Morgan D.R. J. Med.

Exposure of VacA to low pH induces the transition to a stable acidic form endowed with a higher vacuolating activity (19de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R.

Previous studies have shown that vacuoles induced by VacA originate from membrane-bound compartments of the endocytic pathway, characterized by the presence of the V-ATPase and the small GTP-binding protein rab7 (20Papini E.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 113: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and suppression of rab7 functions by overexpressing homologous dominant negative mutants (25Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.T. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) demonstrated that these two molecules are essential to vacuole biogenesis. The V-ATPase may drive the accumulation of osmotically active, membrane permeant, weak bases into the vacuolar lumen (21Papini E. Gottardi E. Satin B. de Bernard M. Telford J. Massari P. Rappuoli R. Sato S.B. Montecucco C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 44: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), while Rab7 may be implicated in membrane fusion events, similarly to rab5 in the case of swollen early endosomal compartments (26Murphy C. Sarrich R. Grummt M. Gournier H. Rybin V. Rubino M. Auvinen P. Lutcke A. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Nature. 1996; 384: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we suggested that VacA may interfere with normal membrane traffic at the level or in the close vicinity of late endosomes (25Papini E. Satin B. Bucci C. de Bernard M. Telford J.T. Manetti R. Rappuoli R. Zerial M. Montecucco C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Such compartments, also referred to as prelysosomal compartments, are crucial crossroads in the complex network of intracellular membrane traffic inside eukariotic cells (27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). In fact, they sort proteins and lipids derived from the biosynthetic or the endocytic pathways and directed to lysosomes. Typically, acidic hydrolases synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum reach the TGN where they are transported by clathrin-coated vesicles to endosomes and then to lysosomes (27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 28Von Figura K. Hasilik A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Extracellular ligands to be degraded are endocytosed into early endosomes, move into late endosomes, and eventually reach lysosomes. After entering endosomes, newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases and molecules doomed to degradation are believed to share the same pathway en route to lysosomes (29Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 9: 129-162Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Such a picture is complicated by the presence of well demonstrated or putative recycling pathways, which are also supposed to determine the rate of protein transport to lysosomes (27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). In the present study, to unmask possible functional alterations induced by VacA on late endosomes, we investigated the membrane traffic of newly synthesized cathepsin D and of epidermal growth factor, two well characterized proteins which are sorted to lysosomes from TGN and the cell surface, respectively. Cathepsin D, the major aspartyl protease in mammalians, is carried to lysosomes via a mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-dependent mechanism (27Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). After synthesis as a proenzyme of 53 kDa in the endoplasmic reticulum, and addition of M6P to N-linked oligosaccarides (30Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), procathepsin D is transported to TGN and then to endosomes bound to M6P receptors. Here, acidic pH induces dissociation from its receptor, and after proteolysis, which generates a 47-kDa intermediate form, cathepsin D reaches the lysosomes, where it is further proteolysed to the mature form consisting of 31- and 14-kDa polypeptydes (31Delbrueck R.

Thus, cathepsin D is a sensitive indicator of defects of the late stages of the endocytic pathway. The rate of generation of radiolabeled degradation products of125I-EGF is a reliable parameter of delivery to lysosomes (42Renfrew C.A. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol.

In fact, after binding to specific receptors on the cell surface, EGF molecules are endocytosed, segregated from the recycling pathway in early endosomes, and eventually carried to lysosomes (29Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 9: 129-162Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar), where they are rapidly digested by acidic proteases into small peptides, which are released in the extracellular medium.

Purified ricin was a kind gift from Dr. Marco Colombatti (University of Verona, Italy). Human holotransferrin (Tfn) and recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Sigma) were labeled with IODO-GEN (Sigma) as reported elsewhere (47Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). Specific activity was 0.5–0.8 μCi/μg. TPCK-treated trypsin (61 units/mg) was from Serva. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from Flow (UK). Monensin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, aprotinin (24 trypsin inhibitory units/ml), TPCK, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, FITC-dextran, and protein A-Sepharose were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to the cytosolic domain of human transferrin receptor and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to rat rab7 were provided by Dr. C. R. Hopkins (University College London, London, UK) and by Dr. M. Zerial (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Polyclonal rabbit antibody to human cathepsin D was from DAKO. HeLa cells were cultured as monolayer in plastic flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were suspended by trypsin-EDTA treatment and seeded in standard 24- or 6-well titer plates at the density of 40,000/cm2 in growth medium 14–18 h before experiments. Cells were washed with DMEM, 2% FCS and further incubated at 37 °C with 5–200 nm purified VacA, preactivated or not by low pH treatment as described previously, in the same medium in 5% CO2 for 4 h. In some experiments, after VacA intoxication as above, cells were washed with DMEM, 2% FCS and further incubated with 10−8m DT or 10−7m ricin, and after different times, the rate of protein synthesis inhibition was determined. Control or VacA-treated HeLa cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.1 μg/ml 125I-Tfn in DMEM without carbonate, plus 10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA. After extensive washes at 4 °C, to remove unbound Tfn, cells were incubated with the same medium plus 2% FCS at 37 °C. After different times, extracellular, membrane-bound, and intracellular radioactivity was determined as described previously (48Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were pulsed for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.05 μg/ml 125I-EGF in DMEM without carbonate, plus 10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA, rapidly washed, and chased with the same medium plus 2% FCS at 37 °C. After different times, trichloroacetic acid (10%)-soluble and -insoluble radioactivity was determined in the extracellular medium with a Multi-Prias γ-counter (Packard). In some experiments, nondegraded EGF was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid from fractions obtained from a 2 to 22% w/v Ficoll gradient. Cells were rapidly washed with leucine-free Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium without NaHCO3 and containing 10 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.4, and further incubated with the same medium supplemented with 200 nCi/ml [14C]leucine. After 4 min, trichloroacetic acid was added to each well (final concentration, 6%), and the precipitated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. The rate of protein synthesis of DT and ricin-treated cells was calculated as the percentage of control cells (49Papini E. Rappuoli R. Murgia M. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1567-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VacA-intoxicated or control cells were washed, sulfur-starved in sulfur-free medium for 30 min, pulsed with the same medium containing 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label for 30 min, washed with DMEM containing 2% FCS, 10 mm cysteine, and 5 mm M6P and further incubated in the same medium at 37 °C. At the desired time, extracellular medium was recovered, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture, and put in ice, while cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), supplemented with protease inhibitors. Extracellular medium and cell lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-human cathepsin D rabbit antiserum (DAKO) (0.25% v/v) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose, previously equilibrated in lysis buffer, was added to samples, and after a further 18-h incubation with tumbling at 4 °C, immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed five times with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNaEDTA, pH 7.4, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, once with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, and then dissolved in 62 mmTris acetate, pH 6.8, 4% SDS. Samples were boiled for 2 min and run on 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films, and the amount of the different forms of cathepsin D was determined after developing by densitometry. Data are expressed as percent of total signal. In some experiments, cells were homogenized after pulse and chase as above and fractionated on a 2 to 22% (w/v) Ficoll gradient, and cathepsin D was immunoisolated from fractions diluted with an equal volume of double-concentrated lysis buffer plus protease inhibitors. Control and VacA-treated cells, either pulse-chased with Tran35S-label or treated with125I-EGF and further incubated for 40 min, were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mmHepes-Na, pH 7.4. Homogenization was obtained by passing the cell suspension 10 times up and down through a 1-ml blue tip on a pipette (Gilson Co. Inc., Worthington, OH) and 10 times through a 22G1 1/4 needle fitted on a 1-ml plastic syringe. Cell homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm, and supernatants (1 ml) were loaded on top of 2 to 22% w/v Ficoll-400 linear gradients (13 ml) made in UltraClear Beckmann centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation for 65 min at 35000 rpm in a SW40 Ti rotors, fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top and put in ice for further analysis. Cells were seeded on glass coverslips, and after treatment with 200 nm VacA as specified above, they were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2% BSA containing 10 mg/ml FITC-dextran, washed, and further incubated for 15 min in the same medium with no FITC-dextran. Coverslips were mounted in a thermostatted chamber (37 °C), overlaid with 0.5 ml of PBS, 5.6 mmglucose and placed in the stage of an inverted microscope. Single cell fluorescence values were determined with excitation wavelengths of 494 and 450 nm and a fluorescein emission filter, with the aid of a computerized image analysis system. pH values were obtained by comparing the ratio of the two wavelengths fluorescence values, corrected for cell intrinsic fluorescence, with those of FITC-dextran dissolved in internalization media of different pH values (50Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Total cell or aliquots of cytosolic fractions were dissolved in 60 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, plus bromphenol blue, containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, boiled for 2 min, and run on 4–15% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose for 2 h at 0.4 A in Tris/Cl 25 mm, glycine 192 mm, 5% methanol, pH 8.2. Rab7 and transferrin receptor were revealed, after saturation of nitrocellulose overnight with 3% BSA, by incubating for 2 h with specific primary antibodies and, after washes, with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity was measured as described in Beafay et al. (52Beafay H. Amar-Corstesec H.A. Feytmans E. Thinès-Sempoux A. Wibo M. Robbi M. Berthet J. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). To test the effect of VacA on procathepsin D maturation, HeLa cells were incubated with purified toxin, activated by preincubation at pH 2.0 as described previously (19de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. After a few hours, cells were washed, sulfur-starved, pulsed for 30 min with 35S, and chased for different time periods in the presence of 5 mm M6P. Metabolically labeled cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and extracellular media with specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The relative amounts of procathepsin D (53 kDa) and intermediate (47 kDa) and mature (31 kDa) forms of cathepsin D were determined by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography on x-ray films, and densitometry. VacA inhibited the formation of both intermediate (47 kDa) and mature (31 kDa) cathepsin D. After a 2-h chase, the amount of mature cathepsin D was reduced to 40% of control untreated cells, whereas the generation of the intermediate 47-kDa form dropped to about 60% (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that the reduced formation of mature cathepsin D is associated with an increased extracellular secretion of procathepsin D. Dose-response analysis, reported in Fig.2, indicates that extracellular secretion and intracellular accumulation of procathepsin D account almost equally for the decrease of cathepsin D maturation. In addition, it is shown that VacA acts at relatively low doses with an IC50 of about 40 nm, and that preactivation by low pH is required for optimal inhibition of cathepsin D maturation.Figure 2Dose response of VacA action on cathepsin D maturation in HeLa cells. Panel A, cells were intoxicated for 4 h with indicated concentrations of either activated (• inB) or inactive (○ in B) VacA, pulsed with35S, and further chased for 2 h. Cathepsin D was then isolated by immunoprecipitation from cellular lysates (C) and extracellular media (M), run on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. Doses of VacA are shown at the top, while procathepsin D (53 kDa) and intermediate (47 kDa) and mature cathepsin D (31 KDa), indiated by molecular mass, are shown on theleft.

Pearse A. Hewlett L.J. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1011-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). After exposure to 200 nm VacA for 4 h, cells were incubated for 10 min with125I-EGF, and its degradation was followed over time. The amount of ligand taken up in the first 10 min was the same in control and VacA-treated cells (not shown). Fig.3 (panel A) shows that the kinetics of 125I-EGF degradation was largely decreased upon VacA treatment and that this was accompanied by the intracellular accumulation of nondegraded EGF, since the extent of recycling of intact EGF into the extracellular medium was undiminished (Fig. 3,panel B). This latter fact is consistent with an effect of VacA on a step along the endocytic pathway after the early endosomes stage. Inhibition of EGF degradation and of procathepsin D maturation by VacA takes place in the same range of toxin concentrations, and both effects require activation of VacA by low pH treatment (Fig. 3,panel C). VacA does not affect the rate of endocytosis and recycling of 125I-Tfn, which enters cells through a clathrin-dependent mechanism and is recycled to the plasma membrane, after discharge of bound iron in early endosomal compartments (48Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, neither the initial rate of 125I-Tfn endocytosis nor its ensuing release into the extracellular medium was significantly inhibited by VacA.Figure 4Endocytosis and recycling of transferrin in HeLa cells intoxicated with VacA. Cells, treated as described in the legend of Fig. 3 with (•) or without toxin (▪), were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 50 ng/ml125I-Tfn, washed, and further incubated in DMEM at 37 °C. At indicated times, membrane-bound (A), intracellular (B), and extracellular (C) Tfn were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are the mean of three independent experiments run in duplicate, andbars represent ±S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The specificity of VacA action on procathepsin D maturation and EGF degradation was further tested by using DT and ricin as markers of intracellular uptake. Such experiments are based on the fact that DT and ricin follow specific and distinct pathways inside eukariotic cells and can therefore be used as tools to probe alterations in membrane traffic. After endocytosis via a clathrin-dependent mechanism, in the case of DT or a clathrin-independent mechanism, in the case of ricin (53Moya M. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Louvard D. Boquet P. J.

https://openalex.org/W1981284849,"von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury. The A3 domain of vWF (vWF-A3) forms the principal binding site for collagens type I and III. We report here the crystal structure of the vWF-A3 domain at 2.2-Å resolution. As expected, the structure is similar to the integrin I domain but with several novel features. Sequence alignments had suggested that the domain contained an integrin metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, but the crystal structure shows that the motif is modified and that no metal ion is bound. We have introduced mutations into the vestigial MIDAS motif and report that, unlike the I domain of integrin α2β1, vWF-A3 continues to bind collagen after disruption of the motif. We conclude that collagen recognition by vWF-A3 occurs by a mechanism different from that of the integrin α2β1. von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at sites of vascular injury.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22777-22780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abnormalities in vWF lead to von Willebrand disease, the most common congenital bleeding disorder. Clinical bleeding occurs when the plasma vWF level falls below the normal level of 5–10 μg/ml (type I disease) or when dysfunctional molecules are produced (type II disease) (2Ewenswtein B.M. Handin R.I. Handin R.I. Lux S.E. Stossel T.P. Bleeding. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994: 1069-1095Google Scholar). Mature vWF contains 2050 residues (∼240 kDa) and contains four types of repeated domains (A–D) present in 2–4 copies each, in the order D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2 (3Bonthron D.T. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ginsburg D. Handin R.I. Orkin S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 324: 270-273Google Scholar). vWF forms dimers and multimers that enhance its biological activity (4Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Dimer formation involves interchain disulfide bonding between C-terminal domains, whereas higher order multimers are formed by disulfide bonding between D3 domains (5Voorberg J. Fontijn R. von Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy reveals a tadpole-shaped vWF protomer with a large bilobal body (∼250 × 50 Å), thought to include the N terminus, and a filamentous tail (∼350 long × ∼20–30 Å thick), presumed to end at the C terminus. The protomer makes tail-to-tail (“dimer” contact) and head-to-head (“multimer” contact) with other protomers (6Slayter H. Loscalzo J. Bockenstedt P. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8559-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fowler W.E. Fretto L.J. Hamilton K.K. Erickson H.P. McKee P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 76: 1491-1500Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Initial platelet adhesion is mediated by sequences within the A1 and A3 domains of multimeric vWF. The A1 domain (residues 479–717 of mature vWF) binds to platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX, heparin, and cell surface sulfatides. Although both the A1 and A3 domains can bind to collagen, the A3 domain contains the principal collagen-binding site (8Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The adhesive properties of vWF are tightly regulated so that plasma vWF does not normally interact with circulating platelets. vWF, however, binds to subendothelial collagen that has been exposed following vascular injury, leading to a conformational change in vWF that allows the A1 domain to bind to platelet glycoprotein Ib/IX. A large number of proteins contain vWF A-type domains, including the α-subunits of leukocyte integrins (9Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Doliana R. Matrix. 1993; 13: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), where the domains are generally called I domains. Crystal structures have previously been reported for the I domains of integrins αMβ2 and αLβ2 (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 11Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10277-10281Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The I domain from the integrin α2β1 is its principal collagen recognition domain (12Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its crystal structure has also been solved recently. 2J. Emsley, S. King, J. Bergelson, and R. Liddington, submitted for publication.2J. Emsley, S. King, J. Bergelson, and R. Liddington, submitted for publication. In all cases, the integrin I-domain adopts the classic “dinucleotide binding” fold with a central hydrophobic parallel β-sheet, flanked on two sides by amphipathic helices (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The domain also contains a metal-binding site at the top of the β-sheet which is critical for its adhesive function (14Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been called the MIDAS (Metal IonDependent Adhesion Site) motif (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and recent mutagenesis studies support the proposal that the upper surface of the I domain forms the integrin-ligand interface (15Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,16Rieu P. Sugimori T. Griffith D.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15858-15861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We report here the crystal structure of the vWF-A3 domain, which we determined as a first step in understanding the molecular basis of vWF-ligand interactions. Since the integrin α2-I domain also binds collagen, it had been suggested that the two domains would have similar binding motifs. However, our results show that the vWF-A3 domain, unlike the α2-I domain, does not bind metal and that the collagen binding properties of vWF-A3 persist even after the disruption of its MIDAS-like motif by site-specific mutagenesis. Recombinant vWF-A3 containing residues 908–1111 of mature vWF was expressed inEscherichia coli using the pQE9 expression vector and purified as described previously (8Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion from 24 to 32% PEG 8000, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 200 mm MgCl2 at 22 °C. Crystals belong to space group P21 with cell dimensionsa = 42.5 Å, b = 66.8 Å,c = 57.8 Å, and β = 101.9°. The asymmetric unit contains two vWF-A3 domains and has a low solvent content (34%). Magnesium is not required for crystal growth but affects the growth rate. Crystallization from 0, 10, 100, and 200 mmMgCl2 took 2 months, 1 month, 7 days, and 2 days, respectively, to produce crystals suitable for diffraction. A second crystal form was also observed under the same conditions in space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 58.0 Å,b = 65.1 Å, c = 84.5 Å, and β = 101.8° but has not been further studied. A mercury derivative was obtained by soaking a crystal in 1 mmCH3HgNO3 for 4 h, and a gadolinium derivative was obtained by soaking a crystal in 10 mmGd(NO3)3 for 3 days. Data from native and derivative crystals were collected on a MarResearch Imaging Plate and a Rigaku rotating anode generator with focusing mirrors at room temperature. Data were reduced with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC, Daresbury, UK1993: 59-62Google Scholar). The positions of six gadolinium atoms and two mercury atoms were readily determined by inspection of difference Pattersons and Fouriers using phases calculated by HEAVY (18Terwilliger T. Eisenberg D. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1983; 39: 813-817Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Further heavy atom refinement and phasing was performed using the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). Phases were refined using MLPHARE with the anomalous signal included. An electron density map calculated at 3-Å resolution could be partly interpreted by manually steering a model of an integrin A domain into the electron density. The first round of refinement used a polyalanine model of the central β-sheet and helices 1–5. This partial model was refined using XPLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar), and the model phases were recombined with MIR phases using SIGMAA to produce a new map from which the loops, helix 6 and side chains were constructed. The R factor at this stage was 31%. After additional rounds of refinement, model building, and extension of the data to 2.2-Å resolution, weak density emerged for the C-terminal helix, α8 (residues 178–197), and the disulfide bridge. A round of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging was performed to resolve the ambiguities in this region. The finalR factor was 16% for all data between 8 and 2.2 Å (R free = 21.5%) with restrained individual atomic B factors. The final model contains two molecules of vWFA3 and 169 water molecules. The geometry is excellent with r.m.s. difference from ideal bond lengths of 0.010 Å and 1.58° for bond angles. All main chain torsion angles lie within most favored (92.5% of residues) or additional allowed regions (7.5% of residues) of the Ramachandran plot as defined in PROCHECK. Mutations were introduced into vWF-A3 cDNA using two rounds of polymerase chain reaction amplification. First, each reverse oligonucleotide primer was combined with the 5′-end primer and each forward primer was combined with the 3′-end primer and amplified. Second, the resultant DNA fragment was then combined with the opposite end primer to produce the cDNA fragment. The outside primers introduced BamHI and HindIII restriction sites for cloning. The mutant cDNA fragments were isolated by digestion with BamHI and HindIII and used to transform the expression vector, pQE9, as described previously (8Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The following primers were constructed (desired nucleotide substitution underlined). Reverse primers: 5′-GGGAAACGGGAGGAGCC-3′ (Ser938 → Arg); 5′-GGTGGTGATGTCTCCATACTG-3′ (Ser974 → Asp); 5′-CCCCGATTTGGACGGGGCCTCCC-3′ (Ser1005→ Val). Forward primers: 5′-TCCTGGTCACGGCCGTCTCTGTGG-3′ (Asp1039→ Ala); 5′-TCCTGGTCACGCAGGTCTCTGTG-3′ (Asp1039 → Gln). Mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously for the wild-type domain (8Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A final concentration of 2 mg/ml homogenized insoluble bovine type I collagen (Sigma) or 1% bovine serum albumin was added to microtiter wells in 65 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to remove unadsorbed collagen, residual binding sites were blocked by the addition of 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 60 min. Concentrations varying from 1 to 4 μm of either wild type or each of the vWF-A3 mutant proteins was added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Wells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and the remaining bound vWF-A3 detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Wells were incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of monoclonal anti-His antibody (Qiagen, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times, a secondary anti-mouse antibody that was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added for 1 h and bound antibody visualized by the addition ofo-phenylenediamine. Nonspecific binding was determined by subtracting peroxidase-conjugated antibody bound to wells coated only with bovine serum albumin and subtracted from total binding. We crystallized a recombinant vWF-A3 domain and solved its structure at 2.2-Å resolution using two heavy atom derivatives (Table I). The final structure contains two molecules of vWF-A3 and 169 water molecules. All of the main chain is well defined, with the exception of residues at the N and C termini (923–925 and 1098–1109 (α8)) in both molecules, for which the electron density is weak. The disulfide bridge linking the N and C termini (Cys923-C1109) is visible and delimits the ordered residues. The overall fold is, as expected, very similar to the integrin I domain, with a central hydrophobic parallel β-sheet flanked on two sides by amphipathic helices (Figs.1 and 2). The domain is globular with a height of 40 Å and a width (across the β-sheet) of 30 Å. The main chain atoms of the central β-sheet overlap with the integrin αM I domain with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 Å. There are several surprising features of the structure that could not have been readily predicted from homology modeling using the integrin αM and αL I domains. First, the α2-helix is replaced by a loop and helix α3 is extended by 5 residues. Second, at the top of the domain, the βE-α6 loop adopts a different conformation. Third, the α7-helix is only two turns long and is followed by an abrupt 90° turn before forming a new 8th helix, ending with the C-terminal cysteine Cys1109.Table ISummary of crystallographic analysisdminUnique %RedundancyR symR isoSitesPhasing PowerFOMNative2.215,112 (96)2.55.60.55Hg2.710,182 (96)2.112.824.321.5Gd2.59,419 (96)2.29.023.460.9The space group and cell dimensions are: P21 a= 42.5 Å; b = 66.8 Å, c = 57.8 Å; β = 101.9°.

The r.m.s. bond lengths and angles are the deviations from ideal values. The MIDAS motif in integrin I domains consists of three closely apposed loops which together form the metal-binding site. In vWF-A3, these three loops have a very similar conformation, and two of the loops have identical or analogous residues as follows: the βA-α1 loop contains the DXSXS consensus sequence (residues Asp934-Ser938), and the α3-α4 loop contains a serine (Ser1005) in place of the threonine in the integrin I domains. However, in the third loop, βD-α5, the position of the MIDAS aspartic acid (Asp242in αMβ2) is taken by Thr1038. Sequence comparisons had suggested that the next residue, Asp1039, might be analogous to the MIDAS aspartic acid, but the crystal structure shows that the sequence alignment was incorrect. Although crystallization occurred in the presence of 200 mmMg2+, no metal is bound to the vestigial MIDAS motif (Fig.3). There is a buried water molecule that hydrogen-bonds to the side chains of Asp934, Ser1005, and Tyr972; it also hydrogen-bonds to the backbone nitrogens of Asp1039 and Thr1038, which would not be possible for a metal ion. The water molecule corresponds most closely in position to one of the metal-coordinating water molecules in the integrin I domain, not to the metal ion itself. At the top of the βA-α1 loop, a phenylalanine side chain (Phe939) points out into solution, creating a pocket occupied by three water molecules (in the integrin I domains, the analogous residue is buried in the hydrophobic core). The buried MIDAS aspartate (Asp934) lies at the base of this pocket. This water-filled cavity is sealed at the other end by the side chain of Arg1000; although 8 Å distant, the positive charge, together with the solvent channel, may help to stabilize the buried aspartate. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form a dimer related by a 2-fold axis of symmetry. The dimer interface comprises parts of the βC-α3 turn, and the α4-βD turn is chiefly hydrophobic and buries 1220 Å2 of surface area, more than twice the area of the next largest contact. The two molecules can be superimposed very closely; the overall r.m.s. difference for backbone atoms is 0.65 Å, 0.17 Å for the central β-sheet (Fig.1 b). Curiously, there is a breakdown of symmetry at the dimer interface where the βC-α3 turn adopts a quite different conformation in the two molecules. In one conformation, Asn983 and Val985 are involved in dimer contact, whereas Val984 packs against the backbone of the loop. In the second conformation, Asn983 substitutes for Val984, and Val984 and Val985 form the dimer contact. At opposite ends of the interface there are two pairs of closely apposed histidine side chains. In one case, a pair of aspartates can form salt bridges with the histidines. Despite the intriguing crystal structure, we do not yet have independent evidence that the dimer has physiological relevance. The interaction is not strong, since recombinant A3 runs as a monomer on a gel filtration column at concentrations up to 50 μm. We have previously shown that the principal recognition site for types I and III collagen resides in the A3 domain of vWF (8Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Jee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To explore the role of the MIDAS motif in vWF-A3 binding to collagen, we introduced a series of mutations into the MIDAS-like sequence, expressed the recombinant mutant proteins, and examined their ability to bind to collagen by two independent methods. The mutations were either to homologous residues in vWF-A1 (Ser938 → Arg and Ser1005 → Val) (since vWF-A1 binds only weakly to collagen), two alanine mutants (Asp934 → Ala and Asp1039 → Ala), and one loss of charge mutant (Asp1039 → Gln). All five of the mutant proteins were readily expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. As shown in Fig. 4, none of the five substitutions perturbed collagen binding. The integrin α2β1 binds collagen via the homologous I domain. This led to the suggestion that vWF and α2β1 might bind collagen via similar motifs. The crystal structure of α2β1 I domain has recently been determined2; it contains, as expected, an authentic MIDAS motif with bound Mg2+. Two groups have shown that collagen binding to α2β1 is metal ion-dependent, being supported by Mg2+ and Mn2+, but not by Ca2+ (21Tuckwell D.S. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, point mutations in residues that comprise the MIDAS motif abolish collagen binding, implicating the upper surface of the domain (23Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains are different in other respects also: the α2β1 I domain contains an insertion at the top of strand βE which forms a prominent α-helix that protrudes from the MIDAS face of the domain. vWF-A3 contains no such insertion (Fig. 2 b). The surface charge distribution on the MIDAS face is also quite different; in vWF-A3 the upper surface is largely acidic, and in α2-I, the metal ion creates a region of positive charge (Fig. 5). One similar feature is the lack of helix α2 and the extension of helix α3 compared with the leukocyte (αM and αL) I domains, which creates a flat hydrophobic surface at one edge of the β-sheet (Fig.2 b). The crystal structure of the vWF-A3 domain shows that the domain does not bind metal even though the vestigial MIDAS motif contains only one non-conservative change (Asp to Thr). The lack of metal binding to the isolated vWF-A3 domain did not preclude the possibility that metal bound only to the A domain-collagen complex, providing a bridge between them (as suggested for integrin I-domain-ligand interactions (10Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar)). However, our mutagenesis studies demonstrate that residues comprising the vestigial MIDAS motif are not critical for collagen binding, effectively ruling out a role for metal in vWF-A3 collagen interactions. The lack of metal binding may be related to the unusual conformation of the phenylalanine residue that follows the DXSXS motif. Its side chain sticks out into solution, rather than packing into the hydrophobic core as the analogous residues do in the integrin I domains. This opens a water channel to the buried aspartic acid, Asp934. In the integrin I domains, the negative charge is neutralized by the metal ion. The water channel may thus be important for the stability of the folded conformation of vWF-A3, obviating the need for metal. In vWF-A1, one of the MIDAS serines is replaced by an arginine (Arg524), which may play a role analogous to the metal ion in stabilizing the buried aspartic acid (Asp520). Comparison with the structure of the α2β1 I domain shows that although they have similar three-dimensional folds, there are no obvious shared structural features that could define a common collagen binding motif. The metal ion dependence of α2β1-collagen binding and the existence of a conventional MIDAS motif make it seem very likely that the mode of collagen binding is different and therefore that the requirement for specific collagen sequences will be different. The A/I domain fold is a member of a larger family called the dinucleotide binding fold, which is present in many intracellular phosphoryl transfer enzymes (24Branden C. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1991: 43-57Google Scholar). In enzymes with this class of fold, the top of the central β-sheet (which contains the MIDAS motif in integrin I domains) always plays a functional role. Our results do not rule out a role for the upper surface of the vWF-A3 domain in collagen binding. Alternatively, vWF-A3 may employ this surface for another purpose, such as binding to the A1 or A2 domains, with collagen binding to a different surface. Our crystal structure will allow the design of experiments to test these hypotheses. We thank Carlo Petosa for preparing figures and Laurie Bankston for critical reading of the manuscript."

APC was chemically modified to create the FRET donor species, Fl-FPR-APC, with a fluorescein dye (Fl) covalently attached to the active site via ad-Phe-Pro-Arg (FPR) tether and located in the active site near S4. FRET was observed when Fl-FPR-APC was titrated in the presence of Ca2+ ions with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (4:1) vesicles containing the FRET acceptor, octadecylrhodamine (OR). Assuming a random orientation of transition dipoles (κ2 = 2/3), the average distance of closest approach between the fluorescein in the active site of the membrane-bound APC and the OR at the membrane surface is 94 Å. The same calcium-dependent distance was obtained for both small and large unilamellar vesicles and for vesicles that contained phosphatidylethanolamine. The active site of membrane-bound APC is therefore located far above the phospholipid surface. Upon addition of protein S, the efficiency of Fl-FPR-APC to OR energy transfer increased due to a protein S-dependent rotational and/or translational movement of the APC protease domain relative to the surface. If this movement were solely translational, then the average height of the fluorescein in the membrane-bound APC·protein S complex would be 84 Å above the surface. The extent of Fl-FPR-APC to OR energy transfer was unaltered by the addition of thrombin-inactivated protein S. The protein S effect was also specific for APC, since the addition of protein S to similarly-labeled derivatives of factor Xa, factor IXa, or factor VIIa did not alter the locations of their active sites. This direct measurement demonstrates that the binding of the protein S cofactor to its cognate enzyme elicits a relocation of the active site of APC relative to the membrane surface and thereby provides a structural explanation for the recently observed protein S-dependent change in the site of factor Va cleavage by APC.

Since the fVa and fVIIIa substrates are membrane-bound, their inactivation by APC occurs on a phospholipid surface. APC activity is also modulated by a non-enzymatic protein cofactor, protein S (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Walker F.J. Fay P.J.

Hematology, Basic Principles and Practices. Churchill Livingstone, New York1995: 1597-1605Google Scholar). APC inactivation of fVa has been studied much more than that of fVIIIa, in part because a common polymorphism occurs in fV at Arg506, one of the APC-cleavage sites in fVa, and this polymorphism is associated with thrombotic disease (4Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3792) Google Scholar, 5Dahlbäck B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This form of fV is generally referred to as fV Leiden, and the resultant phenomenon is referred to as APC resistance. Factor Va inactivation by APC is a complex process involving at least two and probably three proteolytic cleavages (6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg506, the polymorphic site leading to APC resistance, results in a partial loss of fVa activity, with the extent of loss depending on the assays employed (6Kalafatis M.

Cleavage at Arg306 results in complete loss of fVa activity, occurs at a slower rate than cleavage at Arg506, and is enhanced by prior cleavage at Arg506 (6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Recently it was shown that protein S stimulates APC cleavage of fVa at Arg306 and that the rate of this cleavage in the presence of protein S is unaffected by factor Xa (11Rosing J. Hoekema L.

Thus, protein S apparently switches the relative rates of the Arg506 and Arg306 cleavages and thereby overcomes protection by factor Xa (11Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D.

APC and protein S are vitamin K-dependent proteins whose N-terminal Glu residues are post-translationally modified to 4-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues (1Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a prothombin derivative, are each located high above the membrane surface, thereby showing that the protease domain was located furthest from the bilayer in each case and confirming that the bound protein was oriented approximately perpendicularly to the plane of the membrane. The same conclusion was reached in another FRET study which showed that the protease domains of prothrombin and meizothrombin are both far above the surface, although in somewhat different locations (26Chen Q. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4701-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These spectroscopic results, obtained with membrane-bound proteins under near-physiological conditions, are completely compatible with the recently reported solid-state crystal structures of fIXa (27Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and of fVIIa bound to a proteolyzed derivative of tissue factor (28Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Thus, one goal of the work reported here was to determine to what extent the membrane-bound structure of the anticoagulant APC is similar to those of the procoagulant enzymes. The activity of each Gla-containing procoagulant enzyme is sufficient to support coagulation only when it is bound to a membrane surface and associated with a protein cofactor (29Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

The specific molecular mechanisms by which the cofactors, with no enzymatic activity of their own, stimulate the enzymatic activity and specificity of their cognate enzymes remain largely undefined. However, four general types of cofactor-mediated changes have been observed. First, cofactor association increases the enzyme concentration at the membrane surface by increasing its affinity for the enzyme (9Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4557-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, cofactor-dependent alterations in the conformations of enzyme active sites have been detected (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23016-23021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that may regulate enzyme activity. Third, the cofactors can bind the substrate (37Luckow E.A. Lyons D.A. Ridgeway T.M. Esmon C.T. Laue T.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2348-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Vehar G.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and elicit conformational changes, as has been observed when fVa binds to a prothrombin activation intermediate (25Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that may allow better complementation between the enzyme and substrate and/or alter the sequence of proteolytic cleavages during activation. Fourth, the cofactors can reposition the active site relative to the membrane surface (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12956-12962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism may be particularly relevant when a cofactor is known to alter the relative rates of cleavage of two peptide bonds within the substrate, as is the case with the prothrombin (40Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fVa (11Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) substrates. This fourth potentially critical mechanism for cofactor regulation of enzyme activity was discovered by examining the effect of cofactor binding on the location of the enzyme active site above the membrane (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, the binding of fVa to fXa on the membrane was found to alter the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor dye in the active site of fXa and acceptor dyes at the membrane surface (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the height and/or orientation of the active site probe was changed when fVa associated with fXa on the membrane. This cofactor-dependent movement of the fXa active site groove presumably occurs to position the active site in the intact prothrombinase complex at both the proper height and orientation to optimize the cleavage of peptide bonds in its prothrombin substrate (22Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Va also alters the topography of the membrane-bound prothrombin substrate, so a cofactor may align both the enzyme and the substrate on the membrane to maximize the rate of activation (25Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, tissue factor has recently been shown to relocate the active site of fVIIa upon forming the fVIIa·tissue factor complex (24McCallum C.D. Hapak R.C. Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28168-28175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin also positions the active site of the thrombin·thrombomodulin complex at a specific location above the membrane surface (39Lu R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12956-12962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association of fVIIIa with membrane-bound fIXa did not result in a detectable change in energy transfer (23Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether no cofactor-dependent change in topography occurred or whether the magnitudes of cofactor-dependent rotational and translational movements offset each other so as to yield no net change in energy transfer efficiency. In this paper we show that protein S relocates the active site of APC, thereby providing a structural explanation for the protein S-dependent alteration in APC cleavage of fVa (11Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bovine protein C (1 mg) was activated in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) plus 5 mm EDTA by incubation (2.5-ml final volume) with 50 μg of human thrombin at 37 °C (41Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Initial rates of protein C activation were determined by removing small aliquots from the reaction mixture and assaying for APC activity by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrates Spectrozyme PCa or Spectrozyme TH (46Kisiel W. Ericsson L.H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4893-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage of the chromogenic substrates in these assays was eliminated by incubating the aliquots with a 100-fold molar excess (over thrombin) of antithrombin III for 20 min prior to addition of chromogenic substrates. Chromogenic assays of APC activity were done as described elsewhere (41Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Le Bonniec B. Johnson A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 359-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Factor Va inactivation was monitored by a three-stage assay similar to that published earlier (51Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and described in detail elsewhere (52Dharmawardana, K. (1994) The Sensitivity of the Active Site Conformation and Topography of Membrane-bound Factor Xa to Individual Factor Va Subunits and to Cofactor Inactivation. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OKGoogle Scholar). Immediately following the activation incubation, APC (1 mg) was incubated at room temperature in 2.5 ml of buffer A plus 5 mm EDTA with a 5–10-fold molar excess ofN α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-FPR-chloromethylketone that had been synthesized as described by Bock (53Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The extent of active site labeling was monitored by the loss of enzymatic activity of APC using Spectrozyme PCa, and the labeling reaction was typically allowed to proceed until the APC was 99.9% inactive. The inactivated APC was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A plus 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 15 h with 2 changes to remove unreacted reagent. The resulting preparation was treated with a 25-fold molar excess of 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein in the presence of 0.1 mNH2OH for 2 h at 25 °C, and then chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.7-cm, inner diameter, × 20 cm) in buffer A plus 1 mm EDTA at room temperature to remove unreacted iodoacetamidofluorescein. Fluorescent APC eluted in the void volume was dialyzed overnight in the same buffer at 4 °C, and then further purified from free dye by ion-exchange chromatography at room temperature (Mono-Q HR 5/5, Pharmacia) using a linear 100–600 mm NaCl gradient (20 ml total) in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. The fluorescent APC, designated Fl-FPR-APC, eluted in a single peak near 450 mm NaCl. The Fl-FPR-APC was dialyzed into buffer A plus 2 mmCaCl2 at 4 °C before being aliquoted into convenient sizes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −95 °C. In some cases, the Fl-FPR-APC was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 200, Pharmacia; buffer A plus 5 mm EDTA; room temperature) prior to dialysis and freezing as above. The number of dyes per protein molecule in each Fl-FPR-APC preparation was determined as described by Bock (53Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fl-FPR-fXa (23Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fl-FPR-fIXa (23Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J.

However, the cellular components responsible for this organization are not known. To examine this question a series of studies was carried out using intact and permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cells. We show that cold shock dramatically reduces the protein synthetic capacity of these cells by as much as 95%. The loss of activity can be reversed by a short recovery period under conditions that allow energy metabolism to occur; transcription and translation during the recovery period are not needed. While individual components of the translation apparatus are not inactivated by the cold shock, the supramolecular organization of the system appears to be altered and F-actin levels are found to decrease. Resumption of protein synthesis during the recovery period coincides closely with the restoration of F-actin to normal levels. Moreover, disruption of actin filaments, but not microtubules, also leads to a major reduction in translation. These data support the conclusion that the cellular microfilament network plays an important role in the structure and function of the translation system and that perturbations of this network can have profound effects on protein synthesis.

These data support the conclusion that the cellular microfilament network plays an important role in the structure and function of the translation system and that perturbations of this network can have profound effects on protein synthesis. Considerable evidence has now accumulated showing that the mammalian protein synthetic machinery is highly organized in vivo, both structurally and functionally (1Barbarese E. Koppel D.E. Deutscher M.P. Smith C.L. Ainger K. Morgan F. Carson J.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2781-2790PubMed Google Scholar, 2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, recent work with a permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EF-1a, elongation factor 1a; TRITC, tetramethylrhodaminyl phalloidin.1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EF-1a, elongation factor 1a; TRITC, tetramethylrhodaminyl phalloidin. system, that closely mimics the living cell, demonstrated that a channeled tRNA cycle functions during the translation process (3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), i.e.aminoacyl-tRNA and tRNA, the intermediates in the process, are directly transferred from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, to the elongation factor, to the ribosome, and back to the synthetases, without dissociation into the cellular fluid. Such studies suggest that the various parts of the translation apparatus must associate as tRNA is transferred from one component to the next. In fact, since only small amounts of RNA and protein leak out of permeabilized cells under conditions in which large, exogenously-added macromolecules can enter, it is likely that the components of the translation machinery are permanently organized into a supramolecular structure (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additional evidence for an organized translation machinery comes from the isolation of a multienzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex and other assemblies which contain multiple translation components (4Deutscher M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Irvin J.D. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Mirande M. Prog.

Interactions among various individual components of the translation system also have been demonstrated in vitro, supporting the idea that similar associations occur in vivo (9Ganoza M.C. Aoki H.

Thus, elucidating the components responsible for this supramolecular organization and how they influence protein synthesis is essential for a complete understanding of the translation process in vivo.Several pieces of information suggest that the cytoskeletal elements of the cell serve this organizing function for the eukaryotic protein synthesizing system. For example, microscopic analyses showed that a number of translation components colocalize with cytoskeletal structures (13Bassell G.J. Powers C.M. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. J.

However, very little is understood about the physiological significance of such interactions between the cytoskeleton and components of the translation apparatus and how these interactions might actually affect protein synthesis.In this paper we show, using intact and permeabilized CHO cells, that rapidly reversible, relatively minor perturbations of the cytoskeleton can have profound effects on protein synthesis and on the structural organization of the translation system. These effects have been localized to the actin filaments. Our data suggest that the microfilament network plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the protein synthesizing machinery of the mammalian cell.RESULTSRelation of Protein Synthesis and Cell Organization—Previously, we suggested that the structural organization of the cell influences channeling of aminoacyl-tRNA and the efficiency of protein synthesis (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To re-enforce this point, we directly compared the rate of protein synthesis in intact, permeabilized, and sonicated CHO cells (TableI). Protein synthesis was carried out under optimal conditions for each system, but the overall concentration of cellular components was kept identical in each case. What differed, and what can be seen to affect translation as much as 100-fold, is how these cellular components are organized in each system. For example, rendering cells permeable reduced protein synthesis 2–3-fold. This value is slightly different from that reported earlier (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) primarily because of the use of more optimal conditions for the intact cells. However, a much more dramatic 40-fold reduction in translation was observed when the permeabilized cells were sonicated, or likewise, when homogenates were used (not shown). These data emphasize the importance of the organization of the protein synthesis machinery for efficient translation and they raise the important question of what cellular component(s) is responsible for maintaining this organization.Table IRelation between cell organization and protein synthesisPreparationProtein synthesis%Intact cells100Permeabilized cells40Sonicated cells1Recovered cells were divided into three portions. Intact cells remained in PBS. The other two portions were permeabilized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and suspended in PSW buffer. One of them was sonicated in PSW buffer. Protein synthesis was measured in each preparation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein synthesis in the sonicated cell preparation was measured the same way as for permeabilized cells, except that 0.5 mmdithiothreitol was present. Incubation was at 28 °C for 10 min. Open table in a new tab Recovered and Non-recovered CellsTo approach this question, we made use of an earlier observation (3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in which it was found that CHO cells after trypsin/EDTA treatment to remove them from the substratum transiently lost most of their translation capacity. Protein synthesis could be restored by preincubating the suspended cells in 10% calf serum in PBS for 20 min at 28 °C (3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). More detailed investigation has shown that the serum requirement can be replaced by a mixture of glucose and calcium and magnesium ions, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Presented in Fig.1 is a comparison of the rate of protein synthesis in cells that were treated with trypsin/EDTA/cold PBS without a subsequent recovery period and identically treated cells that were allowed to recover at 28 °C. In the absence of the recovery period (non-recovered cells), there is an almost complete shut-down of protein synthesis, especially during the first several minutes of incubation. However, as incubation of these cells continues, the rate of protein synthesis begins to accelerate because the recovery process also occurs during the conditions of protein synthesis. In contrast, cells allowed a prior 20-min recovery period at 28 °C (recovered cells) immediately synthesize protein at a rapid rate which is comparable to that of cells remaining in a monolayer. These dramatic effects are not due to differences in amino acid uptake which was found to be identical for both recovered and non-recovered cells. Moreover, non-recovered cells were fully recoverable and were able to grow normally after plating on DMEM. Additional studies revealed that the loss of protein synthetic capacity was not due to removal of cells from the substratum nor to the trypsin/EDTA treatment, but rather to the cold shock engendered by placing the suspended cells in ice and washing them with cold PBS. This was shown by the major reduction in protein synthesis observed when cells still present in a monolayer were cooled on ice and washed with cold PBS (Table II).Table IIEffect of cold treatment on protein synthesis and F-actin levels on CHO cells in monolayer and in suspensionCellsProtein synthesisF-actin%Monolayer Without treatment100100 Recovered84105 Non-recovered1668Suspension Recovered8375 Non-recovered353Cell monolayers in 25-cm2 flasks (two for each condition) were either washed once with warm PBS (monolayer without treatment) or treated as in the preparation of cell suspensions, except that the trypsin/EDTA was omitted. Cells in suspension were prepared using trypsin/EDTA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein synthesis in one flask was carried out at 28 °C for 5 min in PBSP buffer. The second flask was used for F-actin measurement. Protein synthesis and F-actin levels in the untreated cells in monolayer were set at 100% for this experiment. Open table in a new tab The fact that protein synthesis in cold-shocked cells could be restored completely by a brief incubation with glucose and cations suggested that the reversible rapid loss and subsequent recovery of translation capacity might simply represent subtle changes in organizational states of the cells, and that these changes might be used to investigate the importance of cellular organization for the functioning of the translation machinery. This idea was examined in more detail in the studies to follow.Comparison of Components of the Translation Machinery from Recovered and Non-recovered CellsThe low level of protein synthesis in non-recovered cells suggested that whatever perturbation of the translation machinery had occurred in these cells, its effects on protein synthesis were major. As a first step to ascertain what these alterations might be, we compared the level of a number of the obvious, key components of the translation machinery in recovered and non-recovered cells.The amount of aminoacyl-tRNA was the same in both groups of cells (1382versus 1379 cpm/106 cells). Since it is known that most of the tRNA in the cell is in the aminoacylated state (29Gouy M. Grantham R. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the amount of total tRNA in the cell is unaltered. Likewise, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity in non-recovered cells (432 cpm/1.5 min/106 cells) was as high as that in their recovered counterparts (428 cpm/1.5 min/106 cells), indicating that this component of translation machinery also was not damaged.The level of elongation factor 1a (EF-1a), was measured by Western blot analysis and densitometric scanning of the resulting films. No significant difference was found in the amount of this translation component between recovered (100%) and non-recovered cells (95%).The most vulnerable and short-lived component of the protein synthetic machinery is the mRNA, the vast majority of which is polyadenylated at its 3′ end. mRNA would be a likely component to be affected when protein synthetic capacity is diminished. However, as with the other components, there was no decrease in the amount of radioactive poly(A) RNA in non-recovered cells (120% of recovered cells), suggesting that mRNA degradation during trypsin/EDTA-cold PBS treatment was not responsible for the loss in protein synthetic capacity. Taken together, these data suggest that important elements of the translation machinery have not been destroyed or lost in non-recovered cells.Effect of Inhibitors on the Recovery ProcessAs an additional approach to understanding the translation defect in non-recovered cells, and the recovery process that corrects it, a series of inhibitors that affect various metabolic processes were examined for their ability to interfere with recovery. Inhibitors were added during the recovery period at a concentration that was shown in control experiments to dramatically reduce the specific metabolic process under study, but which could be washed out after the recovery period so that subsequent protein synthesis would be unaffected. Using such a protocol, inhibitors that are known to affect RNA synthesis, protein synthesis, or energy metabolism were examined.As shown in Table III, neither the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, nor the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide, affected the recovery process as determined by the subsequent initial rate of protein synthesis. At the concentrations used actinomycin D inhibited RNA synthesis >95% and cycloheximide inhibited translation >80% during the recovery period. The lack of an effect by actinomycin or cycloheximide on recovery supports the conclusion that the resumption of translation after recovery does not involve re-synthesis of any of the RNA or protein components of the translation apparatus. From this information and that presented above, it is likely that the depressed protein synthetic capability of non-recovered cells is not a consequence of the destruction of a translation component.Table IIIEffects of inhibitors on recovery processInhibitorEffect on recoveryTranscription Actinomycin D, 50 μg/mlNo effectTranslation Cycloheximide, 0.3 μg/mlNo effectEnergy metabolism 2-Deoxyglucose, 10 mmInhibits Fluoride, 5 mmInhibits Dinitrophenol 0.4 mmInhibits Cyanide, 1.5 mmInhibits Low temperature (0 °C)InhibitsCells after the washes with ice-cold PBS were incubated with the indicated amounts of various inhibitors at 28 °C for 20 min (except for the 0 °C incubation), then were spun down washed once, and protein synthesis measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recovery was assessed by the initial rate of protein synthesis. Control experiments were performed to determine the concentration of inhibitor, which after washing had a minimal effect on subsequent protein synthesis. Thus, the effects seen here are on the recovery process only. In the case of actinomycin D, the inhibitor was present during both the recovery period and the protein synthesis measurement. Open table in a new tab On the other hand, the fact that incubation at 28 °C in the presence of glucose is necessary to obtain recovery suggests that this process might require energy. Indeed, as shown in Table III, a variety of inhibitors of energy metabolism interfere with the recovery process. As mentioned, in control experiments all of these inhibitors were shown to be without effect on protein synthesis after the cells are washed. Thus, the effect of the energy inhibitors is not on protein synthesis per se, but on the recovery process. The importance of energy metabolism is supported by the experiment presented in Fig.2 A in which the recovery process was carried out at temperatures below 28 °C. At 10 and 19 °C, metabolic processes would be expected to occur at a slower rate, and as can be seen, there is a concomitant reduction in the rate of recovery of protein synthesis at these temperatures. The higher the temperature during the recovery period, the more rapid the attainment of the maximum translation rate. From these data we conclude that a continued and sufficient energy supply is required for the restoration of translation capacity.Figure 2Effect of temperature on recovery of protein synthesis and F-actin levels. A, protein synthesis. Preparation of cells and protein synthesis were carried out as in Fig.1 except that the preincubation temperature was as indicated.B, F-actin levels. Cells after the washes with ice-cold PBS were incubated at the indicated temperatures. Samples were withdrawn at the indicated times for the determination of F-actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The level of F-actin after incubation at 28 °C for 20 min was set at 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Organization of the Translation Machinery in Recovered and Non-recovered CellsSince the data presented above failed to show any significant damage or reduction in individual components of the translation apparatus in non-recovered cells, it appeared that the components needed for protein synthesis, although present, might not be functioning optimally. A hallmark of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells is that the process is carried out by a highly organized translation apparatus (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and as shown in Table I, damage to this organization can lead to major reductions in the efficiency of the process. This knowledge, coupled with the data presented above, raised the possibility that the diminished protein synthesis in non-recovered cells might be due to an effect on the supramolecular organization of the translation machinery, rather than to a reduction in the amount of individual components. A useful tool to test the organization of the translation machinery is measurement of the leakage of certain of its components after cells are permeabilized with saponin (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3601-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Permeabilization generates cells able to synthesize proteins at rates similar to that of the intact cell rate despite the fact that there are openings in the cell membrane large enough for macromolecules to enter (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Since the macromolecular components required for protein synthesis are organized into a supramolecular structure, they are largely retained within the permeabilized cells (2Negrutskii B.S. Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Negrutskii B.S. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3601-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, if this structure were disturbed, one might expect increased leakage of at least some macromolecular components of the translation machinery. Accordingly, we examined whether there was any change in leakage from permeabilized, non-recovered cells compared with permeabilized, recovered cells.The results of these experiments are shown in TableIV. Reproducibly, a significantly greater percentage of the total aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-1a populations leaks out of non-recovered cells compared with recovered cells. These data are consistent with what might be expected if there were damage to the supramolecular organization of the translation machinery resulting in release of aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-1a. It should also be noted that the values shown probably represent minimum values for leakage from non-recovered cells. During the permeabilization procedure cells are incubated at 37 °C for 6 min and some recovery can occur during this period. Thus, the full extent of leakage of components may not be realized. In contrast to aminoacyl-tRNA and EF-1a, only a small difference in leakage between recovered and non-recovered cells was observed for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Table IV), suggesting that these enzymes are tightly sequestered even within non-recovered cells. Likewise, using a different procedure involving Triton X-100, no difference was found in the extractibility of total RNA or poly(A) RNA from the two cell populations (data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that non-recovered cells have been altered with respect to their supramolecular organization. As a consequence, some of the translation components are more weakly, or no longer, associated with other parts of the system, resulting in their leakage from permeable cells.Table IVLeakage of translation components by permeabilized, recovered, and non-recovered cellsComponentPresent in supernatant fractionRecoveredNon-recovered%Aminoacyl-tRNA2851EF-1a3561Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase3138Recovered and non-recovered cells were prepared and permeabilized with saponin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After permeabilization, cell and supernatant fractions were separated by centrifugation, and the amounts of individual components of translation were determined in each fraction. Each component was measured in a separate experiment.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the cytoskeleton to determine whether changes in its structure might be related to the loss and recovery of translation capabilities. We first examined whether the microtubule network might be affected during the course of re-acquisition of protein synthetic capacity during recovery. Our data indicated that the exposure of cells to cold shock was what initiated the decrease in translation activity, and such treatment is known to depolymerize a major portion of the cell's microtubules (31Weisenberg R.C. Science. 1972; 177: 1104-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 3 A, addition of the microtubule depolymerizing agent, colchicine, to non-recovered cells has no effect on their ability to recover and to resume protein synthesis despite the fact that the concentration of colchicine used has dramatic effects on cell division and on the morphology of cells. Thus, these observations suggest that the recovery process is not dependent on the re-formation of microtubules.Figure 3Effect of colchicine and cytochalasin D on the recovery of protein synthetic capacity. Cells washed with ice-cold PBS were placed in PBSP buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) and incubated at 28 °C for measurement of protein synthesis in the presence or absence of either 40 μg/ml colchicine or 100 μg/ml cytochalasin D.

Chemokines are a large and growing family of 6–14-kDa (nonglycosylated) heparin-binding proteins that mediate a wide range of biological functions (1Taub D.D. Oppenheim J.J. Ther. Immunol. 1994; 1: 229-246PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokines are divided into two main families based on the position of four cysteine residues that form two disulfide bonds. The presence or absence of an amino acid between the first two conserved cysteines distinguishes the CC and CXC chemokines. Generally the CXC family of chemokines acts on neutrophils, while the CC family members act on other leukocytes, which include monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Recently a new family of chemokines was defined with the discovery of lymphotactin, which lacks two of the four cysteine residues found in other chemokines characterized to date and acts specifically on lymphocytes (2Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W. Schall T.J. Zlotnik A.

The chemokine receptors are divided into the CXCR (4 members) and CCR families (5 members) for CXC and CC chemokines, respectively (3Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Most chemokine receptors bind to several chemokines, and some chemokines also interact with several receptors. Chemokines play a vital role in leukocyte adhesion and extravasation.

Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We describe here a novel chemokine that acts specifically on activated T lymphocytes. Because the activity profile of this chemokine is restricted to activated T lymphocytes, we called it STCP-1 (stimulated T cell chemotactic protein). Macrophages were generated by in vitro differentiation from monocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from leukopheresis packs by Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) density centrifugation. Monocytes were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C, after which time the nonadherent cells were removed by two washes with warm medium. Each flask then received 40 ml of RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% human AB serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 5% fetal calf serum, 50 nm calcitriol (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were fed with a complete change of fresh media on days 3 and 6. On day 7, the media of each of the 7 flasks was adjusted to contain one of the following 7 stimuli; 1 μg/ml E. coli K562 LPS (Sigma), 100 units/ml IFN-γ, LPS, and IFN-γ in combination, 100 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor in combination with 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 50 ng/ml IL-4, 10 ng/ml IL-10, and 10 ng/ml Consensus-IFN-α. Consensus-IFN-α was prepared at Amgen. All other cytokines were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Macrophages were stimulated for 3 h with various stimuli, prior to isolation of the RNA. Purity and differentiation of 7-day macrophages were determined in separate cultures by flow cytometric analysis. More than 90% of the cells were positive for both CD14 and CD71. Cells from various treatments were combined, and poly(A+) RNA was isolated by using the Invitrogen Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA). A cDNA library was constructed in the pcDNAII vector (Invitrogen). The library was screened in EST analysis (29Adams M.D. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Merril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F. Kerlavage A.R. McCombie R.W. Venter J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). Individual clones from this library were randomly picked and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer using vector primer andTaq dye-terminator reactions (Applied Biosystems). The resulting nucleotide sequences obtained from the randomly picked clone STCP-1 was translated, then compared with the existing data base of known protein sequences using a modified version of the FASTA program (30Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). The human genomic clone was isolated from a human genomic P1 library (Genome System Inc., St. Louis, MO) with a labeled human cDNA probe. The STCP-1 cDNA sequence coding for the protein from amino acid 25 (Gly) to amino acid 93 (Gln) was cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector and transformed into Escherichia coli. The 8-kDa protein was purified from E. coli and used in all the biological function analyses. Northern blots of multiple human tissues were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). In addition, equal amounts of poly(A+) mRNA isolated from resting monocytes, CD4 T cells, macrophages, LPS-stimulated monocytes, stimulated macrophages (as described above), and chronically activated CD4 T cells (as described below) was blotted onto nitrocellulose. The Northern blots were probed with a human STCP-1 cDNA probe. Human peripheral blood was collected in 10% (v/v) 0.1 m EDTA, layered onto 1-Step Polymorphs gradient (Accurate Chemical Co., Westbury, NY), and centrifuged at 400 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Neutrophil and mononuclear cell layers were collected, resuspended in DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and centrifuged for 15 min at ∼750 × g. Red blood cells were lysed in the neutrophil fraction by resuspending the pellet in E-Lyse (Cardinal Associates, Santa Fe, NM) for 5 min on ice. Both cell fractions were washed twice with ice-cold DPBS. The mononuclear cells were allowed to adhere to protein-coated plastic for 2–3 h, and then nonadherent cells were gently washed off the plate. After a further 12 h the nonadherent dendritic cells were washed off the plate and depleted with anti-CD19 and anti-CD2 Dynabeads (5 beads/cell), followed by culture in 50 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 40 ng/ml IL-4, DMEM, 10% FCS plus additives for 7 days. T lymphocytes were purified from mononuclear cells by plastic adhesion, followed by nylon wool depletion of B cells. The T lymphocytes were of more than 95% purity as assessed by FACS analysis (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). In some cases CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were obtained by depletion with anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 Dynabeads, respectively. These cell populations were of greater than 95% purity. Eosinophils were purified from the neutrophil preparations of asthmatic individuals. Neutrophils in DMEM, 2% FCS at 2 × 107cells/ml were bound with anti-CD16 at 20 μg/ml for 30 min at a ratio of 4 beads/cell for 30 min at 4 °C, washed three times with ice-cold DMEM, 2% FCS, and depleted with anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads. The neutrophils were removed with a magnet, leaving the eosinophils. ECV304 cells (ATCC) were cultured on gelatin-coated flasks in DMEM with 4% FCS. Mouse T lymphocytes were isolated by Geys treatment of splenocytes to remove red blood cells, followed by nylon wool depletion to remove B cells and macrophages. In some cases CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were obtained by depletion of the purified T lymphocytes with anti-CD8 and anti-CD4 Dynabeads (Dynal), respectively, to greater than 95% purity. OVA lines were made by footpad injection of 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of ovalbumin (OVA) (1 mg/ml) and Freund's complete adjuvant into C57/Black mice. Seven days later the lymph nodes were removed and the lymphocytes were isolated and stimulated with OVA (50 μg/ml) in the presence of mitomycin-treated splenocytes followed by 4–5 days in IL-2-containing media. The OVA-specific T cells were then either used or re-stimulated for 5 days and expanded in IL-2 before use in assays. The following mAbs were used in this study: OKT3, an anti-human CD3 mAb (ATCC); 145–2C11, an anti-mouse CD3 mAb (ATCC), anti-human CD28 mAb (Becton Dickinson), and anti-mouse CD28 mAb (Pharmingen). All chemokines with the exception of STCP-1 were purchased from R & D, Minneapolis. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 were also purchased from R & D. mAbs FD411.8 (rat anti-mouse LFA-1), YN1.7 (rat anti-mouse ICAM-1), PS/2 (rat anti-mouse CD49d) were obtained from the ATCC whereas 2H8 (hamster anti-mouse CD31) was obtained from Endogen, and MEC13.3 and 390 (rat anti-mouse CD31) mAbs were obtained from Pharmingen. The polyclonal to STCP-1 was generated by three intradermal injections of STCP-1 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Titermax at several sites on the back of a rabbit at 3-week intervals. The rabbits were bled via the ear 10–20 days after the final immunization, and the polyclonal was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. The human endothelial cell line ECV304 was purchased from ATCC, while the bEND3 cell line (31Montesano R. Pepper M.S. Mohle-Steinlein U. Risau W. Wagner E.F. Orci L. Cell. 1990; 62: 435-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. W. Risau (Max-Planck-Institute, Bad Neuheim, Germany). As described previously (32Sunder-Plassmann R. Breiteneder H. Immermann K. Strunk D. Majdic O. Knapp W. Holter W. Blood. 1996; 12: 5179-5184Crossref Google Scholar) six-well Falcon plates were coated overnight with 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 and 2 μg/ml OKT3 and then washed twice with PBS. Umbilical cord blood CD4 lymphocytes (Poietic Systems, German Town) or adult blood T lymphocytes were then cultured at 105–106 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% FCS and IL-2 (4 ng/ml). After 5 days, the activated T lymphocytes were washed once in DMEM and recultured for 4–7 days in DMEM with 10% FCS and IL-2 (1 ng/ml). Following this, the activated T lymphocytes were re-stimulated for 5 days with anti-CD28/OKT3/IL-2 and then cultured again with IL-2 for 4 days. Activated T lymphocytes were maintained in this way for a maximum of three cycles. Activated mouse T cells were prepared in a similar manner but using anti-mouse CD3 and anti-mouse CD28 mAbs, while using human IL-2 in the rest cycle. The inserts of Costar Transwells of 5-μm pore diameter were coated with 2% gelatin for 2 h. Then 0.45 ml of DMEM with 5% FCS was placed in the lower wells of the chambers, and 2 × 105ECV304 cells or bEND3 cells were added to each gelatin-coated insert in 0.2 ml of DMEM, 5% FCS. After 2 days the wells and inserts were washed twice with RPMI with 0.5% human serum albumin, 10 mmHepes, and chemokine was added to the lower well. The cells under study were washed once in RPMI and resuspended at 4 × 106cells/ml in RPMI with 0.5% human serum albumin and 10 mmHepes. An aliquot of 100 μl of cell suspension was added to each insert. After 2 to 4 h the inserts were removed, and the number of cells which had migrated through the ECV304 monolayer to the lower well counted for 60 s on a Becton Dickinson FACScan with the gates set to acquire the cells of interest. Using this technique 100% migration would be 25,000 cells with the FACScan set to count for 60 s. Chemotaxis assays were identical to ECV304 migration assays, but fibronectin-coated inserts (10 μg/ml) were used instead of inserts coated with a monolayer of ECV304 cells. In all cases the data points were the result of duplicate wells, with the mean value shown and the error bars representing the sample standard deviation. Two methods were used. To analyze Ca2+ mobilization in subsets of cells lymphocytes were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in prewarmed PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 μm Fluo 3/AM cell permeant (Molecular Probes, Catalog No. F1242). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following this the labeled cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 and resuspended at 106cells/ml in DPBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 5.5 mm glucose. An aliquot of 0.4 ml was taken and placed on the FACScan with the gates set to acquire the cells of interest examining FL1 (fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence)versus time. After 20 s to establish the baseline FL1 level, chemokine was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cells were analyzed within 30 min after labeling due to leaching of the dye from the labeled cells. For other experiments cells at 106cells/ml in DPBS were labeled for 30 min with Fura 2/AM cell permeant dye (Molecular Probes, Catalog No. F1221) at 2 mm, washed three times in DPBS, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in DPBS containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 5.5 mmglucose and analyzed within 30 min of labeling on a Fluorimeter using 10% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm EDTA to establish the maximum and minimum Ca2+ mobilizations. While sequencing the stimulated macrophage cDNA library by EST analysis, we identified a 1-kb fragment of cDNA, STCP-1, encoding a protein homologous to the human RANTES. As shown in Fig.1, it encodes a protein of 93 amino acids. Hydropathic analysis predicts a hydrophobic signal peptide of 24 amino acids. Beginning with Gly (residue 25), the mature protein containing 69 amino acids has a predicted molecular mass of 8 kDa. No apparent sites for N-linked glycosylation are present. The protein contains four cysteines whose positions are identical to that of RANTES (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that STCP-1 belongs to the C-C family of the chemokines. The amino acid sequences of the protein share 62% similarity and 34% identity with that of RANTES.Figure 2A, comparison of amino acid sequences between STCP-1 and RANTES.

The length of each intron is shown inparentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The human STCP-1 genomic clone was isolated from a P1 genomic library by using a labeled human cDNA probe. About 8 kb of the gene has been sequenced. The gene consists of 3 exons and 2 introns. The sequences of the intron-exon junctions conform to the consensus sequence of eukaryotic splice junctions (Fig. 2 B). The genomic structure of the STCP-1 shares great homology with RANTES in the sizes of exons and the location of the intron-exon junction. We used a 282-base pair cDNA fragment spanning the coding region of STCP-1 as a probe to analyze the tissues and cell type-specific expression of the STCP-1 gene. As shown in Fig.3 A, STCP-1 was expressed as a 3.4-kb transcript in the tissues of thymus, lymph node, and Appendix. The STCP-1 cDNA clone was originally isolated from the stimulated macrophage cDNA library. In a preliminary Northern blot analysis, STCP-1 transcripts were also found in activated monocytes, resting and activated macrophages, but not in resting or activated CD4 lymphocytes (Fig. 3 B). To express the recombinant protein in E. coli, we constructed an expression vector which contains a coding region from residue 25 (Gly) to residue 93 (Gln) downstream of the luciferase promoter. The protein expressed fromE. coli was purified and analyzed. The protein has a molecular mass of 8 kDa as we predicted from amino acid sequence (data not shown). To search for a responsive cell population to STCP-1, we examined the ability of STCP-1 to support the transendothelial migration of different cell populations. This assay was used in preference to chemotaxis, as the assay has a much lower background and is therefore more sensitive and robust. STCP-1 was unable to support the transmigration of either neutrophils, monocytes, or eosinophils (Fig.4, A, B, andC) across a monolayer of ECV304 cells (an endothelial cell line) at several concentrations. Other chemokines reported to act on these cell populations were able to direct migration of these different cell types. However, when resting T lymphocytes from umbilical blood were activated with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 mAbs followed by culture in IL-2 for 5 days, these activated T lymphocytes became responsive to STCP-1 (Fig. 4 D). While the transendothelial migration of activated T lymphocytes supported by STCP-1 was not as great at that directed by RANTES, a further two rounds of stimulation of T lymphocytes resulted in increased responsiveness to STCP-1 (Fig.4 E). A polyclonal antibody raised against STCP-1 blocked STCP-1-induced transendothelial cell migration of these chronically activated T lymphocytes (Fig. 4 E). Chronically activated adult CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes chemotaxed to STCP-1 indicating that both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets are responsive to STCP-1 (Fig.4 F). Checkerboard analysis demonstrated that STCP-1 stimulated chemotaxis of chronically activated T lymphocytes rather than random migration in the transendothelial chemotaxis assays used here (Table I).Table ICheckerboard assay of STCP-1 in transendothelial chemotaxisSTCP-1 concentration in lower chamberSTCP-1 concentration in top chamber0 ng/ml100 ng/mlcells migrated0 ng/ml183 ± 32191 ± 11100 ng/ml2181 ± 333157 ± 18 Open table in a new tab To ensure that the in vitro culture system used in this study was generating chronically activated T lymphocytes we stained umbilical T lymphocytes and secondary activated T lymphocytes with mAbs reacting with surface molecules which define activation markers. On T lymphocyte activation, CD31, CD45RA, and CD62L are down-regulated from the T lymphocyte surface, while CD45RO expression is up-regulated on T lymphocytes. As shown in Fig. 4 G repeated activation of umbilical T lymphocytes resulted in a transition to a phenotype predictive of activated T lymphocytes. By the second stimulation the chronically stimulated T lymphocytes were CD45RA-negative, CD62L-negative, CD31-negative, and CD45RO-positive as expected. STCP-1 activity is not restricted to the human system, as STCP-1 was also found to be a very potent chemoattractant for the chronically activated mouse T lymphocytes, as was mouse MIP-α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1 (Fig. 5 A). STCP-1-directed transendothelial migration was blocked by pretreatment of the chronically activated T lymphocyte cells with anti-CD11a and anti-ICAM-1 mAbs (Fig. 5 B) and partially with anti-CD49d mAbs, while anti-CD31 mAbs had no effect. As in the human system both chronically activated CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes were responsive to STCP-1 (Fig. 5 C). To examine T lymphocytes activated in a more physiological manner mice were immunized in the footpad with OVA, and a primary T lymphocyte line was established. STCP-1 was a chemoattractant for the activated OVA-specific T cell line, with MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-5 also proving to be chemoattractants, while TCA3 had no effect. It could be argued that STCP-1 acts indirectly on activated T lymphocytes by inducing ECV304 or bEND3 cells to produce another chemokine. Therefore, we tested STCP-1 for its ability to support chemotaxis of chronically activated mouse T lymphocytes across fibronectin-coated inserts. STCP-1 supports the chemotaxis of chronically activated T lymphocytes (Fig. 5 E). Due to the poor transendothelial migration of primary activated T lymphocytes supported by STCP-1, we thought it possible that only a subpopulation of primary activated T lymphocytes expressed the relevant chemokine receptor for STCP-1. To examine this possibility, we looked at the ability of STCP-1 to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization in activated T lymphocytes and other leukocyte subsets. As predicted from our results in the ECV304 transmigration assays, STCP-1 was unable to stimulate Ca2+mobilization in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, or dendritic cells, while the relevant chemokines for each of these cell populations proved stimulatory (Fig. 6,A–D). We also examined the response of LPS-activated B lymphocytes to STCP-1 to determine whether activation of other lymphocyte subsets resulted in responsiveness to STCP-1. While cross-linking of surface IgG on activated B lymphocytes induced Ca2+ mobilization, STCP-1 had no effect (Fig.6 E). However, chronically activated T lymphocytes responded to STCP-1 (Fig. 6 F). When we examined Ca2+mobilization in primary and chronically activated T lymphocytes to STCP-1, using a FACScan, which can detect Ca2+ mobilization in subsets of cells a much larger proportion of the chronically stimulated T lymphocytes than the primary activated T lymphocytes responded (Fig. 7). Similarly, previously characterized chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1α, IP-10, and RANTES, which were poor stimulants of primary activated T lymphocytes, proved to be much more potent chemokine agonists for chronically activated T lymphocytes. Other chemokines such as eotaxin (Fig. 7) had no activity either on primary activated or chronically activated T lymphocytes.Figure 7Chronic activation of T lymphocytes up-regulates the response of T lymphocytes to STCP-1. T lymphocytes activated once with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3 and then cultured for 5–7 days in IL-2 were compared with T lymphocytes which had been activated three times with plate bound with anti-CD28 and anti-CD3, followed by rest cycles of 5–7 days in IL-2. These two populations were then labeled with Fluo 3 and analyzed on the FACScan for Ca2+ mobilization in response to 100 ng/ml eotaxin, STCP-1, MIP-1α, RANTES, MCP-1, and IP-10. The experiment was performed twice with similar results. To quantitate the Ca2+ flux of the two cell populations to the various chemokines we set two regions over the time interval in which Ca2+ flux occurred. The regions were set in the time area of 20.5–30.5 s using limits of mean fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence of 1–25 to define region 2 (nonresponding cells) and of 25–1000 mean fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence units to define region 1 (responding cells). By division of the number of cells in region 1 by the total number of cells in regions 1 and 2 we calculated the percentage of cells undergoing Ca2+ flux over the time period of 20.5–30.5 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) STCP-1 shows a unique profile of chemokine activity. Other CC chemokines such as MCP-1 and MIP-1α are also chemoattractants for activated T lymphocytes. However, the activity of these chemokines is not restricted to activated T lymphocytes, as they also act as chemoattractants for monocytes. However, two CXC chemokines, IP-10 and Mig, are reported to act specifically on activated T lymphocytes through CXCR-3. Therefore, we tested the ability of IP-10 to desensitize the response of chronically activated T lymphocytes to STCP-1 and vice versa (Fig.8 K) as well as other known chemokines (Fig. 8, C–J). IP-10 did not block the response of chronically activated T lymphocytes to STCP-1 (Fig. 8 K) but did block Ca2+ mobilization of these cells to a second stimulation with IP-10 (Fig. 8 B). Similarly, STCP-1 prestimulation prevented Ca2+ mobilization to a second activation with STCP-1 (Fig. 8 A). In this study we describe a novel human chemokine, STCP-1, which shares homology with RANTES in the amino acid sequence and the genomic structure. The gene is specifically expressed on the lymph node thymus and Appendix. STCP-1 is selectively chemotactic for activated T lymphocytes. Numerous chemokines act as chemoattractants for lymphocytes, although the data from various groups are contradictory. Several studies have demonstrated that certain CXC (33Qin S. LaRosa G.

J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3482-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and CC chemokines (35Schall T.J. Bacon K. Camp R.D.R. Kaspari J.W. Goeddel D.V. J. Exp.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) direct the transendothelial migration or chemotaxis of memory T lymphocytes, while other reports claim that activation of T lymphocytes (28Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 37Taub D.D. Conlon K. Lloyd A.R. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. Science. 1993; 260: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) is required for the response to several chemokines. These discrepancies probably reflect the different signal/noise ratios of the assays used by individual groups and/or the different culture condition used. In this study, STCP-1 did not act on monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, LPS-activated B lymphocytes, or freshly isolated resting T lymphocytes. However, upon activation of T lymphocytes by culture with plate-bound anti-CD28/CD3 mAbs in the presence of IL-2, followed by culture in IL-2 for 5 days, STCP-1 was found to act as a weak chemoattractant for these cells. Similarly, STCP-1 was able to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization in a subset of activated T lymphocytes. MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1α, and RANTES also stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in a subset of activated T lymphocytes, while eotaxin was inactive. Further rounds of stimulation of the T lymphocytes resulted in increased chemotaxis of the T lymphocytes to STCP-1 as well as other chemokines. Ca2+mobilization data also show that a much greater percentage of chronically stimulated T lymphocytes respond to STCP-1, MCP-1, IP-10, MIP-1α, and RANTES than was observed with the primary activated T lymphocytes. Therefore, repeated rounds of stimulation increase the percentage of T lymphocytes which respond to these CC and CXC chemokines. STCP-1 is unusual in only acting on activated T lymphocytes. Two CXC chemokines, Mig and IP-10, were also recently reported to act on activated T lymphocytes as well as monocytes (38Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). We feel it unlikely that the receptor for STCP-1 is the Mig/IP-10 chemokine receptor, CXCR-3, as there is as yet no example of a CC chemokine which binds to a CXC chemokine receptor. Also, IP-10 did not desensitize activated T cells to stimulation with STCP-1. TER1 (39Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Nista A. Storlazzi G.T. Rocchi M. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2759-2763PubMed Google Scholar) could possibly be a receptor for STCP-1, as this receptor is weakly expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, the receptor is not up-regulated on lymphocyte activation and so it would appear unlikely. Finally, a recently described chemokine, MIP-3β (40Rossi D.L. Vicari A.P. Franz-Bacon K. McClanahan T.K. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1033-1036PubMed Google Scholar), shows an identical distribution to STCP-1, as it is expressed selectively in Appendix, lymph nodes, and thymus, as is STCP-1. The function for this chemokine is not yet known, but it is likely that MIP-3β may, like STCP-1, act selectively on activated T lymphocytes. The lack of expression of STCP-1 in spleen and lung, where macrophages are also found, is surprising. This may reflect selective expression of STCP-1 by subsets of macrophages. Future studies with a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay will examine the expression of STCP-1 by various leukocyte subsets in more detail. While it is known that subsets of memory T lymphocytes respond to certain chemokines (33Qin S. LaRosa G. Campbell J.J. Smith-Heath H. Kassam N. Shi X. Zeng L. Butcher E.C. Mackay C.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the physiological reason for this is not yet known. However, just as the expression of certain cell adhesion molecules directs activated T lymphocytes to inflammatory sites it is also possible that the expression of specific chemokine receptors on activated T lymphocytes is also required for their trafficking to these sites. This study demonstrates that on repeated stimulation, T lymphocytes up-regulate chemokine receptors for chemokines which are known to be expressed in acute and chronic inflammatory sites, such as MIP-1α and MCP-1. In addition T lymphocyte activation probably also results in the expression of novel chemokine receptors which are selectively expressed on these cells and which may play a unique role in the adhesion and transendothelial migration of activated T lymphocytes at inflammatory sites. STCP-1, which acts specifically on activated T lymphocytes, may bind to one such chemokine receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2046396383,"Burn injury is associated with insulin resistance. The molecular basis of this resistance was investigated by examining insulin receptor signaling in rats after thermal injury. The impaired insulin-stimulated transport of [3H]2-deoxyglucose into soleus muscle strips confirmed the insulin resistance following burns. In vivoinsulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, pivotal in translocation of GLUT4, was decreased in burns when assessed by its insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated activity. Insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor (IR) and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were also attenuated. Immunoprecipitated IR, however, appeared to have normal insulin-responsive kinase activity. Finally, immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was tested for its effect on partially purified recombinant IR and was found to inhibit its kinase activity. This inhibitory effect of IRS-1 was abolished by prior treatment of IRS-1 with alkaline phosphatase, indicating that burn injury-related hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 is similar to that observed in TNFα-induced inhibition of IR signaling. All of these changes were observed in the absence of quantitative changes in IR, IRS-1, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Alterations in postreceptor insulin signaling, therefore, may be responsible for the insulin resistance after thermal injury. Burn injury is associated with insulin resistance. The molecular basis of this resistance was investigated by examining insulin receptor signaling in rats after thermal injury. The impaired insulin-stimulated transport of [3H]2-deoxyglucose into soleus muscle strips confirmed the insulin resistance following burns. In vivoinsulin-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, pivotal in translocation of GLUT4, was decreased in burns when assessed by its insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated activity. Insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor (IR) and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were also attenuated. Immunoprecipitated IR, however, appeared to have normal insulin-responsive kinase activity. Finally, immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was tested for its effect on partially purified recombinant IR and was found to inhibit its kinase activity. This inhibitory effect of IRS-1 was abolished by prior treatment of IRS-1 with alkaline phosphatase, indicating that burn injury-related hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 is similar to that observed in TNFα-induced inhibition of IR signaling. All of these changes were observed in the absence of quantitative changes in IR, IRS-1, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Alterations in postreceptor insulin signaling, therefore, may be responsible for the insulin resistance after thermal injury. Insulin, the principle hormone maintaining glucose homeostasis, stimulates glucose influx into muscle, glycogen synthesis in the liver, and fat deposition in adipocytes (1White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin resistance is a major metabolic abnormality following burn injury (3Muller M.J. Herndon D.N. Lancet. 1994; 343: 216-220Abstract PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Willmore D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Deitch E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Demling R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance of burn injury is indicated by elevated glucose production (gluconeogenesis) and blood glucose levels in association with normal or increased insulin levels. Muscle constitutes approximately 40% of the body mass, and insulin resistance results in muscle wasting due to the lack of anabolic effects. Indeed, insulin resistance as documented in skeletal muscle after burn injury results in enhanced gluconeogenesis and protein catabolism (3Muller M.J. Herndon D.N. Lancet. 1994; 343: 216-220Abstract PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Deitch E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Thomas R. Aikawa N. Burke J.F. Surgery. 1979; 86: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar). Vigorous nutritional support to optimize the hypermetabolic state and promote anabolism has not been effective. Attempts have been made to correct this burn stress-induced pseudodiabetes, hyperglycemia, and muscle wasting with pharmacological doses of insulin, but this treatment resulted in fatty liver and increased wasted substrate cycling, enhanced CO2production, and attendant complications of hepatic and respiratory failure (8Wolfe R.R. Herndon D.N. Jahoor F. Miyoshi H. Wolfe M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 317: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 9Wolfe R.R. Semin.

The molecular mechanism of this abnormal insulin function has not been elucidated. The binding of insulin to the α-subunit of the IR 1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI 3-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI 3-K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. induces rapid autophosphorylation of its β-subunits, activating its tyrosine kinase activity (1White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic molecules, including IRS-1, whose phosphorylation is pivotal in the biological actions of insulin (11Clausen J.O. Hansen T. Bjorbaek C. Echwald S.M. Urhammer S.A. Rasmussen S. Andersen C.B. Hansen L. Almind K. Winther K. Haraldsdòttir J. Borch- Johnsen K. Pedersen O. Lancet. 1995; 346: 397-402Abstract PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 leads to the second intracellular step in insulin action, the association of phosphorylated IRS-1 with the enzyme PI 3-K, which propagates the distinct metabolic functions of insulin (12Myers M.G.J. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The association occurs through phosphorylated YMXM or YXXM motifs on IRS-1 and the SH2 domains on the 85-kDa subunit of the PI 3-K, resulting in activation of the catalytic (110-kDa) subunit of PI 3-K (12Myers M.G.J. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Treatment of cultured cells with wortmannin, a potent PI 3-K inhibitor, or overexpression of dominant negative p85, both of which inactivate endogenous PI 3-K activity, abolishes insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (13Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 15Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). These data, along with the time course and the dose response of production of PI 3,4-P2 and PI 3,4,5-P3 in response to insulin, are consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-K is an important element of the signaling pathways of insulin action for glucose uptake (16Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This notion is further substantiated by recent studies indicating that PI 3-K activity is critical in maintaining glucose homeostasis in muscle and adipose tissues (13Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular pathogenesis of insulin resistance in diabetes has been intensively studied. In non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, IR phosphorylation is significantly attenuated and is paralleled by a reduction in IRS-1 phosphorylation in both liver and muscle (1White M.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In insulin resistance of obese diabetic subjects, the IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI 3-K activity are all decreased when tested in skeletal muscle strips (16Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

Ineffective functioning of IR, IRS-1, and PI 3-K can, therefore, alter the metabolic actions of insulin in vivo. Recently, it has been reported that increased expression of TNFα in adipose tissues of obese animals is, at least in part, responsible for this impaired insulin signaling (18Hotamisligil G.S. Spiegelman B.M. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of TNFα were due to serine rather than tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1; serine phosphorylation functioned as a dominant negative molecule for IR tyrosine kinase activity (20Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Increase in the levels of TNFα is a well known phenomenon following burn injury (21Endo S. Inada K. Yamada Y. Kasai T. Takakuwa T. Nakae H. Kikuchi M. Hoshi S. Suzuki M. Yamashita H. Yoshida M. Burns. 1993; 19: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Marano M.A. Fong Y. Moldawer L.L. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 1990; 170: 32PubMed Google Scholar, 23Molloy R.G. O'Riordain M. Holzheimer R. Nestor M. Collins K. Mannick J.A. Rodrick M.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2142-2149PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this background, it seemed reasonable to assess the mechanism of burn-induced insulin resistance by focusing on the in vivo activities of PI 3-K as well as on the functions of IR and IRS-1. We initiated this study based on the hypothesis that insulin resistance after severe thermal injury is induced by aberrant IR intracellular signaling. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence indicating that postreceptor insulin signaling is impaired in skeletal muscle tissues after burn injury. The protocol for the studies was approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. The animal care facility is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Germantown, NY) weighing about 150–160 g were used. Six animals were used for each group (sham burn with or without insulin injection and burn with or without insulin injection). After clipping of the hair, a full thickness third degree burn injury was produced under anesthesia by immersing the back of trunk for 15 s and abdomen for 5 s in 80 °C water. A weight- and time-matched sham burn group (controls) was treated in the same manner as the trauma group, except that they were immersed in lukewarm water. All biochemical experiments were performed in the gastrocnemius (fast) and/or soleus (slow) muscles excised from the animals at 3 days after burn or sham burn injury. Glucose transport in soleus muscle was determined as described previously, with minor modifications (24Le Marchand Y. Freychet P. Jeanrenaud B. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 234: E348-E358PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were killed by cervical dislocation, and solei were surgically removed and tied via their tendons to stainless steel clips. Muscles were preincubated for 15 min in 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm pyruvate. They were then incubated for 10 min in another flask containing 10 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.3, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin containing [3H]2-deoxyglucose (final 0.1 mm, 0.5 μCi/ml), and [14C]sucrose (final 0.1 μCi/ml) as a marker, with or without 100 nm insulin added to the mixture. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by transferring the muscles to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The 3H and 14C incorporated were counted and normalized to their protein content. A correction for extracellular 2-deoxyglucose was made by the14C count. Following an 18-h overnight fast, anesthetized rats received insulin (5 milliunits/g) as a bolus injection via the portal vein, exposed under anesthesia as described by Folli et al.(17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 90 s after the insulin injection, the gastrocnemius muscles were removed. This routine of insulin injection and time after its injection for muscle sampling has been shown to be the optimal condition for measurement of insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activity (17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was confirmed by us (data not shown). The excised gastrocnemius muscles were homogenized immediately in (1:10, w/v) ice-cold solubilization buffer A (50 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The Polytron homogenizer was operated at maximum speed for 30 s, and samples were left on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. IR was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml of anti-IR mAb (Calbiochem) from aliquots of supernatant containing 10 mg of protein. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from the same aliquots with 0.3 μg/ml of anti-IRS-1 mAb, 1D6 (25Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PI 3-K molecule consists of a regulatory p85 and catalytic p110 subunits. p85 PI 3-K was immunoprecipitated from a sample of the same aliquot with a 1:300 dilution of anti-p85 mAb (26Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preimmune mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) was used as a control. Following the addition of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), immunoprecipitates were washed successively three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, three times in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) with 0.5 m LiCl2 and 100 μmNa3VO4 and three times in 10 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5) incorporated with 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. Aliquots of resuspended precipitates of IR or IRS-1 prepared as described above were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% T) in a miniature slab gel apparatus (Bio-Rad). After electrotransfer of protein from the gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the membrane was first exposed to blocking buffer (10 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at 37 °C. The membrane was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.3 μg/ml of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20H, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and then washed three times with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20) for 15 min at room temperature. The proteins of interest were visualized by chemiluminescence (Sigma). PI 3-K activity associated with immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 or p85 PI 3-K was measured in vitro as described previously by its ability to phosphorylate exogenous PI to PI 3-P (17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To each pellet of immunoprecipitated homogenate of muscles were added 10 μl of 100 mmMgCl2 and 10 μl of PI (2 mg/ml) sonicated in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) with 1 mm EGTA. The PI 3-K reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of 440 μmATP containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After 10 min at room temperature with constant shaking, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 8 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). After the centrifugation of samples, the lower organic phase was removed and applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Whatman), which was prebaked for 10 min. The plate was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11:3.2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity in spots which co-migrated with a PI-4 standard was measured by PhosphorImager (BAS 2000, Fuji, Kanagawa, Japan). These molecules were detected by immunoblotting (25Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The samples (immunoprecipitates or 200 μg of protein of lysates from gastrocnemius muscles) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was first exposed to phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with anti-IRβ polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, provided by J. Avruch, Massachusetts General Hospital), anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or anti-p85 mAb (1:500 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was further incubated with anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution, Calbiochem) for 90 min at room temperature, and immunoreactive bands were visualized as described above. Aliquots of resuspended precipitates of IR from sham burned or burned animals' hind limbs muscle lysate prepared as described above were resuspended in 50 μl of kination buffer (50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.025% Triton X-100, 5 mmMnCl22+). The IR were preactivated by 100 nm insulin for 10 min in the presence of the kination buffer without ATP and mixed with 1 mm ATP for 30 min at 25 °C. Following 30 min of exposure to ATP, the reaction were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to detection of tyrosine phosphorylation using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20) as described above. IR was purified as described previously (27White M.F. Peptide Hormone Action: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990Google Scholar). CHO-IR cells overexpressing human insulin receptor (25Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kitamura T. Hara K. Nakafuku M. Okabayashi Y. Kadowaki T. Kaziro Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4634-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in 12 100-mm dishes to confluence, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline on ice, and then lysed in 50 ml of buffer W (50 mmHEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 1 h. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 125,000 ×g for 60 min, and supernatant was subjected to wheat germ lectin column (1-ml bed volume, Pharmacia) affinity chromatography equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer W at 4 °C. The column was subsequently washed with 10 ml of buffer W with 1 m NaCl followed by 10 ml of buffer W and then eluted with 1 ml of buffer W with 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. The elution was repeated nine times, and peak fractions of recombinant IR were determined by Western blotting, which were then used as purified recombinant IR. The procedure was adopted from the one described by Hotamisligil et al. (20Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from gastrocnemius muscle extracts of sham and burned animals as described above and incubated with or without 20 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) at 25 °C for 30 min for dephosphorylation. The pellets were washed five times in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and resuspended in 20 μl of reaction buffer A (50 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.025% Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the partially purified IR was assessed by the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP when stimulated by insulin. The IR were preactivated by 100 nm insulin for 10 min in the presence of buffer A without ATP or [γ-32P]ATP and mixed with the IRS-1 precipitates for 30 min at 25 °C. Following 30 min of exposure to insulin with IRS-1, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and32P-labeled IR was visualized by autoradiography. Autophosphorylation of IR was tested in the presence of immunoprecipitated IRS-1 from hind limb muscles of sham burned, burned, or fa/fa rats, which were positive controls. In an attempt to demonstrate the presence of insulin resistance in our burn model, we initially examined insulin-stimulated in vitro glucose uptake in soleus muscle strips. Previous reports had indicated that insulin resistance was clearly observed at 2–7 days after burn injury (28Yu C. Hua H. Tong C. Burns. 1989; 15: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Nelson K.M. Turinsky J. J. Parenter. Enteral Nutr. 1982; 6: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Clark A.S. Kelly R.A. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We chose 3 days after burn injury as the time for analysis of glucose uptake and insulin resistance. Basal rates of glucose uptake in the muscle strip were significantly reduced (30%) in burned animals as compared with the sham burned animals at 3 days after burn (Fig. 1,p < 0.05). Consistent with other reports (30Clark A.S. Kelly R.A. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Simth R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 32Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Gautier N. Tanti J.-F. Giorgetti S. Obberghen E.V. Marchand-Brustel Y.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1336-1358Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), glucose uptake was increased 5-fold in response to insulin in sham burned rats. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was, however, totally abolished in the muscle strips of burned animals compared with those of sham rats (Fig. 1, p < 0.001). These data directly demonstrated that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was inhibited in burned animals at 3 days after burn and validated the use of 3 days after burn injury as an appropriate point for further analysis. The fact that insulin was ineffective even in vitro suggests that the inhibition may not be due to the presence of circulating extracellular inhibitory factors (e.g.glucosamine) that would inactivate the insulin signaling itself (33Baron A.D. Zhu J.S. Zhu J.H. Weldon H. Maianu L. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); such circulating factors might not be present under the in vitro conditions. We next investigated PI 3-K activity as an intracellular marker of insulin activation. As described in previous protocols (17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the skeletal muscles extracted from the hind limb were solubilized, and PI 3-K associated with IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody. Insulin stimulation results in the binding of PI 3-K to IRS-1 (26Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these experiments therefore specifically measure the insulin-stimulated activation of PI 3-K by IRS-1. Consistent with previous reports (17Folli F. Saad M.J. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22171-22177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sham rats showed a 5-fold increase of PI 3-K activity relative to basal value in response to insulin, giving a product that co-migrated with PI 3-P on TLC (Fig. 2). Almost complete absence of insulin-mediated PI 3-K activation, however, was observed in muscle samples from burned animals. Basal values were also decreased approximately 10% in burns relative to controls. These results indicate that the IRS-1-associated PI 3-K activity is defective following burn injury and parallels the almost complete defect of insulin action on glucose uptake in muscle (Fig. 1). PI 3-K is a cytosolic protein and has a basal lipid kinase activity, even in the cytosol. In order for the insulin-mediated metabolic effects to be initiated, PI 3-K needs to be bound to IRS-1, which mobilizes the PI 3-K from cytosol to the cellular membrane, where its substrate is available. The possibility that PI 3-K function by itself was impaired was excluded in the following experiments (Fig.3). PI 3-K is composed of a regulatory subunit, p85 and a kinase subunit, p110. The total (both cytosolic and IRS-1-bound) PI 3-K activity, in the absence of insulin, was quantified by assessing PI 3-K activity immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb (F11) from hind limb muscle extracts of overnight-fasted burned or sham burned animals (26Yonezawa K. Ueda H. Hara K. Nishida K. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Matsuba H. Shii K. Yokono K. Fukui Y. Calas B. Grigorescu F. Dhand R. Gout I. Otsu M. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25958-25966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total PI 3-K activity was, by itself, not different between the two groups (Fig. 3). Therefore, it can be concluded that the decrease of IRS-1-associated PI 3-K activity observed following burns is not due to qualitative or quantitative changes in the PI 3-K itself but rather to its defective association with IRS-1. The possibility that the attenuated PI 3-K activity was due to a quantitative change in IRS-1 was assessed in the following experiment. The immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 obtained with the anti-IRS-1 mAb were quantified by immunoblotting, using the anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody. The immunoreactivities of IRS-1 were the same between sham burn and burn animals (Fig.4, lower panel). Thus, altered quantities of IRS-1 were not the cause of decreased PI 3-K activity. Next, the efficiency of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was examined. The immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-IRS-1 antibodies were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20H). The results (Fig. 4, upper panel) indicated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was completely absent in burn-injured animals, in both the presence and absence of insulin. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in sham burned animals was enhanced by insulin. To further confirm that the association of PI 3-K to IRS-1 is inhibited after burns, we assessed the direct interaction of IRS-1 with p85 PI 3-K molecules when stimulated by insulin in vivo. Following in vivo insulin stimulation, aliquots of muscle homogenates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 mAb. The immunoprecipitates obtained in this manner were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibody or anti-IRS-1 antibody. The total amount of IRS-1 was the same in the two groups (Fig.5, lower panel), and thus the previous findings (Fig. 4, lower panel) that there were no quantitative changes in IRS-1 were confirmed. In the absence of insulin (Insulin −), p85 immunoreactivity associated with IRS-1 was absent in both sham and burn samples (Fig. 5, upper panel;S1, S3, B1, B3). The association of p85 with IRS-1 was promoted by the stimulation of insulin in vivo (Insulin +) in sham burn animals but was completely absent in burned animals. The results clearly indicate that despite the presence of normal amounts of IRS-1, the physical association of IRS-1 with p85 PI 3-K was deficient in burns. After insuli"

PRL triggers activation of Jak2 kinase which phosphorylates the PRL receptor itself and the mammary gland factor, Stat5, a member of the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat). Selection of the particular substrate (Stat 5), that is characterized by transcriptional responses to PRL, has been shown to be determined by specific tyrosine-based motifs common to many cytokine receptors. PRL-induced activation of Stat5 was abolished in 293 fibroblasts expressing PRL receptor mutants lacking all intracellular tyrosines. We have identified tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the PRL receptor (residues 580, 479, and 473) necessary for maximal Stat5 activation and subsequent Stat5-dependent gene transcription. Moreover, we have shown that none of the tyrosine residues of the PRL receptor are implicated in activation of Jak2. This study demonstrates that only specific tyrosines in the PRL receptor are phosphorylated and are in fact utilized differentially for Stat5-mediated transcriptional signaling.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Members of this family are devoid of any catalytic domain in the cytoplasmic region and are known to associate with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Jak family that are necessary for signal transduction. The PRLR is constitutively associated with the tyrosine kinase Jak2 (2Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In BaF3 cells, prolactin (PRL) also induces activation of Jak1 (3Dusanter-Fourt I. Muller O. Ziemiecki A. Mayeux P. Drucker B. Djiane J. Wilks A. Harper A.G. Fischer S. Gisselbrecht S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2583-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells Jak3 may interact with Jak2. Downstream of Jak2 activation, PRL induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of other cytoplasmic signaling proteins including signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats). Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 can all be activated by PRL in Nb2, 32D, and T-47D cells (4DaSilva L. Rui H. Erwin R.A. Zack Howard O.M. Kirken R.A. Malabarba M.G. Hackett R.H. Larner A.C. Farrar W.L. Mol.

Stat5, which was initially isolated as a factor that binds to DNA sequences essential for a lactogenic response (5Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), plays a critical role in regulating the expression of milk protein genes (6Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). However, the expression of Stat5 is not restricted to the mammary gland. Recent studies indicate that there are at least two isoforms of Stat5 (a and b) (7Mui A.L-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A-M. Harada N. Miyajima A.

It has also been shown that Stat1 and Stat3 can be activated by Jak kinases (7Mui A.L-F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A-M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 10Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Stat proteins are presumed to be transiently recruited by activated cytokine receptor complexes via binding to specific phosphotyrosyl residues through their SH2 domain. Studies of the inhibitory activities of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the α chain of the interferon-γ receptor, the IL-4 receptor, the IL-10 receptor, or the EPO receptor provide evidence for a direct coupling of receptor and, respectively, Stat1, Stat6, Stat3, or Stat5 during the Stat activation cycle (13Greenlund A.C.

In addition, Stat3 has been shown to associate with gp130, the signal transducing component common to IL-6, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and IL-11 receptors. The regions of gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β chain required for Stat3 activation have been defined as a small tyrosine containing motif YXXQ (17Stahl N. Farruggella T.J.

Studies of deleted or truncated mutant of IL-2, EPO, or GH receptor reported that cytoplasmic regions of this receptor other than the one required for Jak2 activation are necessary for a maximal Stat5 activation. This suggests that Stat5 activation may require binding of Stat5 to a receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the PRLR is a necessary event for activation of gene transcription. A single phosphotyrosylated tyrosine in the Nb2 form of the PRLR (Nb2R), lacking 198 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, is required for PRL-mediated transcriptional induction of β-casein gene promoter. Indeed, mutation of the COOH-terminal tyrosine (Tyr382) of the Nb2R results in the absence of phosphorylation of the receptor and correlates with a complete loss of activation of gene transcription (18Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the same residue in the long form of PRLR (Tyr580) leads to a variant receptor that retains ∼20% of transcriptional activity of wild type PRLR (18Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the intermediary region of the cytoplasmic domain absent in the Nb2 form (amino acids 322–520) might contain other phosphorylated tyrosines involved in Stat5 recruitment, similar to the GH receptor where two regions of interaction with Stat5 have been identified; the region of residues 454–638 (19Sotiropoulos A.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that a region in the human GHR between amino acids 520 and 540 regulates the inactivation of the Jak/Stat pathway and appears to implicate SHP-1 (24Hackett R.H. Wang Y.D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11128-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of the PRLR contains 9 tyrosines, among which 6 are found in the region that is deleted in the Nb2 form of the receptor and thus may be potentially specific to functions of the long form. In this paper, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of these individual tyrosine residues in the Jak-Stat pathway and their requirement for Stat5 activation. This study demonstrates that PRL stimulation of 293 cells transfected with the PRLR plasmid activates Stat5 and that three of the four COOH-terminal tyrosine residues of the intracellular domain of the PRLR are required for its complete activation. Each of these tyrosine residues is able to induce transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter gene controlled by the lactogenic hormone response element that has been shown to bind Stat5 protein (11Gouilleux F. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Wakao H. Haldosen L-A. Norstedt G. Levy D. Groner B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Additionally, each of these mutant receptors co-immunoprecipitated with tyrosyl-phosphorylated Stat5, suggesting a direct interaction between Stat5 and the PRLR. However, in 293 cells overexpressing the kinase Jak2, receptor mutants expressing normally inactive forms are able to transmit a lactogenic signal, suggesting a direct activation and interaction between Stat5 and Jak2. Recombinant human GH was kindly provided by Dr. A. Ythier, Serono Aeres, Geneva, Switzerland; recombinant bovine GH was kindly provided by Dr. W. Brumbach, American Cynamile Co, Prinston, NJ. Ovine PRL was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Baltimore, MD. The construction of mutants was carried out using the cDNA encoding the long form of the rat PRLR subcloned into pRc/CMV expression vector using its M13 origin of replication and the MK07 M13 helper phage. Single stranded DNA was generated for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in CJ236 cells. The mutated cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nut F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum). Six hours before transfection, cells were plated in a rich medium (two-thirds Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nut F-12, one-third Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4.5 g/liter glucose containing 10% fetal calf serum). Cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate technique with the indicated amount of cDNA encoding either wild type or different mutant forms of PRLR and Jak2 and incubated overnight in 3% CO2 at 37 °C. After 24 h of expression, the cells were deprived of serum for an overnight period. 293 cells were split into 6-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) before being transiently transfected with, for each well, 0.5 μg of PRLR cDNAs. Transfected cells were deprived of serum for an overnight period. Then cells were incubated with 100,000 cpm of125I-hGH and increasing concentrations (0 to 50 pm) of unlabeled ovine PRL (oPRL) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% BSA. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1 ml of 0.5n NaOH and counted in a γ-counter. 125I-hGH was prepared using chloramine T; specific activity ranged from 75 to 120 μCi/μg. 293 cells were split into 6-well plates before being transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pCH110 (β-galactosidase expression vector from Pharmacia), 0.1 μg of LHRE-TK-Luciferase (fusion gene carrying 6 copies of LHRE and the TK minimal promoter linked to the coding region of the luciferase gene) and 0.05 μg of plasmid pRc/CMV containing the different forms of PRLR cDNA. Co-transfected cells were incubated in a serum-free medium with or without 18 nmoPRL, 24 h, and then lysed. Luciferase activity was measured in relative light units and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Each 100-mm culture dish of 293 cells was co-transfected with 2 μg of either wild type or mutant forms of PRLR cDNA, and 1 μg of the cDNA encoding the human tyrosine kinase Jak2. Cells were stimulated by oPRL (10−7m) for 10 min. Cells were subsequently lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysates were incubated with anti-Jak2 antibody (1 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or with a monoclonal anti-PRLR antibody (U5, 5 μg/ml) and 15 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were washed in lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol). The amount of protein was equalized in all samples by measurement of protein concentration using the Bradford technique. Proteins, divided into 3 fractions, were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 or 6% gel), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Polyscreen™, NEN Life Science Products), and immunodetected with antibodies to anti-Jak2 (UBI, 1:5000), anti-PRLR (mAb U5, 5 μg/ml), anti-Stat5 (affinity 1:1000), or anti-phosphotyrosine (UBI, 1:4000) for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the membranes were incubated with an anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (1:8000) for 1 h at room temperature and revealed by ECL detection system (Amersham). To investigate individually the role of each tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain of the PRLR regarding Stat5 recruitment and the corresponding signaling pathway, several PRLR mutants were prepared (Fig.1): A, mutant 9F in which all tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanine; B, individual substitution of each phenylalanine for tyrosine (8F-Ynnn). The cDNA encoding the natural and mutant forms of the PRLR were transiently transfected in human 293 fibroblast cells to determine their binding capacity along with their ability to transmit a lactogenic signal by the activation of the LHRE-TK-Luciferase reporter construct. Additionally, mutants were assayed for PRL-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak2, which is associated with the PRLR and Stat5. To confirm that the PRLR constructs encoded proteins of the expected sizes, we analyzed the receptor proteins in solubilized membranes of transfected 293 cells. Western blots were performed after immnoprecipitation of the extracts with the anti-PRLR antibody U5. As shown in Fig. 2, the mutated PRLRs migrated as a protein of the expected size (∼92 kDa) and showed no evidence of unusual receptor cleavage that could contribute to any loss of activity. In order to determine the possible effect of tyosine replacement on cell surface PRLR expression, similar experiments using biotinylated PRL to purify specifically PRLR of cytoplasmic membrane were performed. The level of PRLR precipitated was similar for each PRLR variant (data not shown), suggesting that mutations of tyrosine residues have no effect on processing of PRLR. Specific binding of 125I-hGH to transiently transfected 293 cells demonstrated again that wild type and variant receptors were normally expressed. The number and affinity of PRL-binding sites were obtained with competition assays followed by Scatchard analysis (TableI). All clones exhibited a single class of binding sites with an apparent affinity of 2 to 5 nm−1 and expressed similar levels of cell surface receptor ranging from 33,000 to 66,000 sites per cell.Table IAssociation constants of PRL receptor mutants expressed in 293 cellsPRLRK a(nm−1)Sites/cellWT4.8 ± 0.555,800 ± 4,1009F6.3 ± 0.956,100 ± 3,8008F-Y5803.6 ± 0.941,700 ± 2,8008F-Y5154.4 ± 1.032,800 ± 2,9008F-Y4793.3 ± 1.345,600 ± 1,6008F-Y4735.8 ± 1.737,200 ± 3,7008F-Y4024.7 ± 0.545,500 ± 1,9008F-Y3463.7 ± 1.061,300 ± 3,1008F-Y3304.9 ± 1.151,400 ± 2,5008F-Y3094.4 ± 0.466,000 ± 2,4008F-Y2375.5 ± 0.837,200 ± 1,9004PA4.9 ± 0.633,800 ± 2,500The affinity constant K a and the number of of binding sites were calculated from the Scatchard analysis (Ligand program) of competition experiments using 293 cells expressing WT and mutant PRLR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.

To assess the transcriptional activity mediated by Stat5, we used the LHRE-TK-Luciferase reporter gene (19Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this construct, six copies of the lactogenic hormone response element (LHRE) were fused to the minimal promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (TK promoter) which governs the expression of the luciferase gene. LHRE is an element of the β-casein promoter that has been used for the affinity purification of Stat5 (6Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), in addition, it is a PRL responsive enhancer (19Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding mutated or wild type PRLRs were transiently cotransfected with the cDNA encoding the reporter gene in 293 cells. As shown in Fig.3, the activity associated with the wild type PRLR corresponds to a 27-fold luciferase induction in the presence of PRL. The mutated PRLR 8F-Y580 displayed ∼80% of the wild type receptor activity and the PRLR mutants 8F-Y479 and 8F-Y473 each retained ∼12% of the wild type receptor activity. In contrast, the other forms, particularly the 9F variant, failed to respond to PRL. The 4P-A mutant which is unable to interact with Jak2 (25Pezet A. Buteau H. Kelly P.A. Edery M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is not able to induce transcription of the reporter gene in response to PRL stimulation. To determine which PRLR tyrosines are involved in Stat5 activation, we analyzed the phosphorylation level of mutant PRLRs. In these experiments, the PRLR was immunoprecipitated with anti-PRLR antibody from cells expressing either the wild type or mutant receptors following PRL stimulation. The immunoprecipitates resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters and probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. As indicated in the Western blot in Fig. 4, two major bands of 95 and 92 kDa are co-immunoprecipitated with anti-PRLR antibody from PRL-treated 293 transfected cell lysates. To confirm that the 92- and 95-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated bands are indeed phosphorylated PRLR and Stat5, respectively, and not other co-immunoprecipitated proteins, parallel samples of the same immunoprecipitate were probed with anti-PRLR or anti-Stat5. The PRLR monoclonal antibody revealed the 92-kDa protein (Fig. 2), while Stat5 antiserum detected a 95-kDa protein (Fig. 4, lower panel). The 8F-Y580 mutant, which retains 80% of transcriptional activity of wild type PRLR, also displayed a level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 that is comparable to that observed with the wild type PRLR. Stat5 phosphorylation was seen for mutants 8F-Y479 and 8F-Y473, which have reduced transcriptional activation, but to a lesser extent than that seen with wild type and 8F-Y580. No induction of Stat5 phosphorylation was detected with the other mutated receptors, which failed to induce transcriptional activity upon PRL stimulation. These results support the notion of an interaction between Stat5 and the PRLR, suggesting that 8F-Y479 and 8F-Y473 variants have a lower affinity for Stat5 than wild type and 8F-Y580 form. To determine whether Jak2 can restore PRL signaling of the mutated PRLRs, cDNAs for Jak2 were cotransfected with the receptor mutants and the LHRE-TK-Luciferase construct in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 (upper panel), the basal level of luciferase activity was increased in cells overexpressing Jak2. However, the 4P-A mutant was still unable to transmit a lactogenic signal (50 versus 60 RLU/UβGal/h in response to PRL stimulation, representing a 1.2-fold induction in presence of Jak2). The other defective mutants, and most notably the 9F mutant, were able to partially activate the signaling pathway (fold induction ranged from 2.8 to 4.5). On the other hand, the three active mutants and the wild type receptor showed a lower fold induction when Jak2 was overexpressed, implying that the system was close to saturation. These results suggest that Jak2 is able to complement the absence of receptor tyrosines and interacts with and activates Stat5. To assess the importance of Jak2 for PRL-induced Stat5 activation, we compared the ability of wild type PRLR and 9F or 8F-Y479 mutant forms to mediate PRL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 (Fig. 5 lower panel). Overexpression of Jak2 in cells expressing mutated 8F-Y479 PRLR resulted in complexes that retained the ability to stimulate Stat5 at levels comparable to those observed with wild type receptor, while the 9F PRLR variant showed Stat5 activation, but at a decreased level. Based upon these observations, it appears that phosphotyrosyl residues of the receptor complex outside of the receptor, likely in Jak2, also contribute to the recruitment of Stat5 in response to PRL. However, the decrease in phosphorylation intensity of Stat5 in cells expressing 9F mutant suggests that Jak2 is less efficient than the receptor to activate Stat5. To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the Jak-Stat pathway, we evaluated whether different forms of the PRLR were able to phosphorylate Jak2. This was measured in 293 cells which were cotransfected with the cDNA encoding various PRLRs and Jak2. Lysates from unstimulated (−) or PRL-stimulated (+) 293 transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with Jak2 antibody, and further analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.6 shows that Jak2 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in response to PRL, except for the mutant 4P-A. As described previously (25Pezet A. Buteau H. Kelly P.A. Edery M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 129: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the presence of Jak2 in the immunoprecipitated complexes from unstimulated cells suggests preassociation of the kinase with the PRLR. Parallel samples of the same immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with an antibody to Jak2, confirming the 130-kDa band as Jak2. In addition, it can be seen that comparable levels of Jak2 were present in all samples. Therefore, the defect associated with the 4P-A mutant is not due to an absence of Jak2. The prevailing hypothesis of signal transduction by members of the cytokine receptor family is that upon binding of ligand to its receptor, association and activation of one or more members of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases occurs (26Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The Jak kinases trans-phosphorylate each other as well as their associated membrane receptors. The latent cytoplasmic Stat proteins are recruited by the phosphotyrosines and serve as substrates for the Jak kinases. Subsequent to phosphorylation, the Stat proteins homo- or heterodimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and induce receptor-associated gene expression (27Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). For various tyrosine kinase receptors such for epidermal growth hormone or platelet-derived growth factor, the tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region recruit specific signal transducers containing SH2 domains, (28Heldin C.H.

Based on the ability of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of different cytokine receptors to inhibit DNA complex formation with Stats, it has been proposed that activation of Stats occurs through direct receptor-Stat interactions. These include the activation of Stat1 by the interferon-γR (13Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 30Shuai K.

https://openalex.org/W1977746317,"Gonadotropin receptors are unique members of the seven-transmembrane (TM), G protein-coupled receptor family with a large extracellular (EC) sequence forming the high-affinity ligand binding domain. In a patient with Leydig cell hypoplasia, we identified a mutant LH receptor that is truncated at TM5. This protein retains limited ligand binding ability but cannot mediate cAMP responses. To study interactions between receptor fragments defective in either ligand binding or signal transduction, we co-expressed this truncated receptor together with a chimeric receptor containing the EC region of the FSH receptor and the TM region of the LH receptor. Although the chimeric receptor could not respond to human chorionic gonadotropin in producing cAMP, co-expression with the truncated LH receptor allowed partial restoration of ligand signaling through intermolecular interactions. In addition, co-expression of the same truncated LH receptor with an N-terminally truncated LH receptor that lacked the EC ligand binding domain also partially restored ligand signaling. Further shortening of the TM region in the mutant receptor found in the patient indicated that the EC domain and TM1 were sufficient for interactions with the N terminally truncated receptor. In contrast, co-expression of the N terminally truncated receptor together with cell-associated or soluble EC region of the LH receptor did not allow ligand signaling. Unlike thrombin receptors, co-expression of the anchored EC region of the LH receptor together with the N-terminally truncated receptor did not allow ligand signaling despite moderate levels of human chorionic gonadotropin binding in transfected cells. These studies demonstrate that the co-expression of binding (+)/signaling (−) and binding (−)/signaling (+) receptor fragments partially restores ligand-induced signal generation and indicate the importance of TM1 of the LH receptor in the proper orientation of the EC ligand binding domain.

Molecular cloning analysis indicated that proteins in this family share a common structure, consisting of seven α-helical hydrophobic putative transmembrane (TM) regions, joined by three extra and intracellular loops. Agonist occupancy of these G protein-coupled receptors leads to the activation of different G proteins, which, in turn, modulate the activity of different effector enzymes or ion channels. The receptors for LH, FSH, and thyrotropin represent a small subclass of this superfamily that has a large extracellular (EC) amino-terminal region responsible for high affinity binding of their large (28–38-kDa) ligands (6Xie Y.B.

Ascoli M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar). Occupancy of glycoprotein hormone receptors by specific ligands allows stimulation of Gs proteins and activation of the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway (15Richards J.S. Endocr.

Earlier studies using β2-adrenergic, muscarinic, and angiotensin II receptors and rhodopsin indicate that the TM regions of these heptahelical molecules are composed of independent functional units and that the co-expression of receptor fragments allows partial reconstitution of functional proteins (17Kobilka B.K.

In addition, co-expression of receptor peptides leads to the functional rescue of mutant V2 vasopressin receptors found in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (26Schoneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For receptors used in these studies, their TM regions are important for both ligand binding and signal transduction, thus rendering it difficult to separate the two important functions of these proteins. For gonadotropin and TSH receptors, their ligand binding and signal transduction domains can be separated (6Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The thrombin receptor, a protein evolutionarily related to these glycoprotein hormone receptors, also has a large N-terminal domain and is activated by proteolytic cleavage within its EC region to unmask a new N-terminal peptide sequence capable of binding to and activating the TM region (29Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). Of interest, an N-terminally truncated thrombin receptor defective in thrombin signaling can be rescued by co-expression with the N-terminal EC region of the thrombin receptor anchored to the cell surface by the TM domain of CD8 (30Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting intermolecular interactions. We have recently found a mutant LH receptor truncated at TM5 in a patient with Leydig cell hypoplasia. The defective receptor retained limited ligand binding ability but was incapable of mediating cAMP responses (31Laue L. Wu S.M. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J.W. Cutler Jr., G.B. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. Brain C. Berry A.C. Grant D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1429-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the unique separation of ligand binding and signal transduction domains of gonadotropin receptors, we have studied the interactions between this binding (+)/signaling (−) mutant receptor and several receptor mutants defective in ligand binding but retaining their C-terminal transmembrane endodomain. We have also tested if the anchored receptor approach used for the related thrombin receptor could allow restoration of ligand signaling for anchored LH receptors. Our findings suggest that ligand signaling can be partially restored when defective LH receptors are co-expressed, but, unlike thrombin receptors, TM1 is essential for interactions between gonadotropin receptor fragments. Purified hCG (CR-129) and FSH (I-3) were supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). 125I-Sodium was purchased from Amersham Corp. Human LH and FSH receptor cDNAs have been cloned and characterized as described previously (32Jia X.C. Oikawa M. Bo M. Tanaka T. Ny T. Boime I. Hsueh A.J.W. Mol.

PCR-based mutagenesis was performed using overlapping primers to construct cDNAs for mutant LH receptors and chimeric FSH/LH receptors (Fig.1) as described previously (34Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K.

PCR was performed with deep VENT® DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). L(EC-TM1–5), L(EC-TM1–3), L(EC-TM1), and L(EC) represent LH receptor mutants with truncation at amino acids 544, 462, 388, and 363, respectively.

All cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). When PCR was used to generate plasmids, two or three clones derived from different PCR were prepared for each construct and used for expression studies. Both the fidelity of PCR-amplified regions and the junctional sequences were confirmed by sequencing on both strands using the dideoxy chain termination method (Cyclist Exo Pfu DNA Sequencing kit, Strategene, La Jolla, CA) (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) as well as by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. All plasmids were purified using a Maxi plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). DNA concentration and plasmid purity were estimated by reading optical density at 260/280 nm and confirmed using ethidium bromide staining following agarose gel electrophoresis. 293 cells derived from human embryonic kidney fibroblast were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Before transfection, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes (Nunc, Naperville, IL). When cells were 70–80% confluent, transient transfection was performed using up to 30 μg of expression vector with or without cDNA inserts by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (34Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the empty plasmid (mock) served as negative controls. In cells co-transfected with two plasmids, 15 μg of DNA of each construct was used. When cells were transfected with a single construct, 15 μg of DNA containing insert cDNA was mixed with same amounts of empty plasmid. After 12–16 h of incubation with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates, media were replenished with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum. 12–36 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, harvested from culture dishes, and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 5 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. 200,000 cells in 300 μl were placed on 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Corning, NY) and preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.25 mm3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (Sigma) before treatment with or without hormones for 3 h. At the end of incubation, cells and medium in each well were frozen and thawed once and then collected and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min to inactivate phosphodiesterase activity. Total cAMP in each well was measured in triplicates by specific radioimmunoassay (39Davoren J.B. Hsueh A.J.W. Biol. Reprod. 1985; 33: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times using cells from independent transfections. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Purified hCG was iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method (40Miyachi Y. Vaitukaitis J.L. Nieschlag E. Lipsett M.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1972; 34: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and characterized by radioligand receptor assay using human LH receptors stably expressed in 293 cells. Specific activity and maximal binding of the labeled hCG were 100,000–150,000 cpm/ng and 40–50%, respectively. To estimate ligand binding on the cell surface, cells were washed twice with PBS and collected in PBS before centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin 200,000 cells/300 μl were incubated with a nearly saturating amount of labeled hCG at room temperature for 18–22 h in the presence or the absence of unlabeled hCG (Pregnyl, 100 IU/tube). At the end of incubation, cells were centrifuged and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Radioactivities in the pellets were determined in a γ-counter. Confluent 293 cells stably transfected with L(EC)tCD8 were incubated with 10 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10 μg/ml of α-thrombin for 72 h. Conditioned media were concentrated ∼250-fold using DIAFLO ultrafiltration membrane XM50 and Centricon 30 (Amicon, Bradford, MA). Aliquots of the concentrated media were incubated with labeled hCG (3 μg/ml, final concentration) for 6 h at room temperature. Complexes formed between labeled hCG and the soluble EC region of the LH receptor were cross-linked using disuccinimidyl suberate (2 mm) for 1 h, and the reaction was terminated with the addition of 3.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After the addition of Laemmli buffer without reducing reagents, cross-linked complexes were visualized following fractionation using SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In duplicate experiments, complexes between nonlabeled hCG and the soluble EC of the LH receptor similarly prepared were incubated with 293 cells expressing L(TM1–7) for 3 h at 37 °C to estimate cAMP stimulation. For studies using cells transfected with the plasmid encoding L(EC), similar ligand binding and cross-linking analyses were performed using intact cells followed by solubilization with buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 20% glycerol or by using total cell homogenates to estimate intracellular and cell surface ligand binding. A mutant receptor identified in a patient with Leydig cell hypoplasia was found to have a stop codon at TM5. Although low levels of high-affinity ligand binding to this truncated receptor L(EC-TM1–5) (Fig.1) could still be found, cAMP stimulation by hCG was impaired (31Laue L. Wu S.M. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J.W. Cutler Jr., G.B. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. Brain C. Berry A.C. Grant D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1429-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have generated a chimeric receptor FLR containing the EC region of the FSH receptor and the TM region of the LH receptor (34Kudo M. Osuga Y. Kobilka B.K. Hsueh A.J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In cells expressing FLR, FSH but not hCG stimulated cAMP production. We tested if ligand signaling could be restored in cells co-transfected with the truncated LH receptor L(EC-TM1–5) together with FLR. As shown in Fig. 2, no stimulation of cAMP production by hCG was found in cells transfected with plasmids encoding either L(EC-TM1–5) or FLR. In contrast, cells co-transfected with both plasmids responded to hCG treatment and showed dose-dependent increases in cAMP production. Significant stimulation of cAMP production was found at 30 ng/ml hCG (p < 0.01). Furthermore, hCG treatment (1 μg/ml) did not stimulate cAMP production in cells expressing the wild type FSH receptor (FFR together with L(EC-TM1–5; Fig. 2)), suggesting the importance of the LH receptor TM segments in the restoration of ligand signaling to hCG. To define the minimal TM region of the LH receptor needed for interactions between defective receptors, we truncated the LH receptor at TM1 and 3 to derive L(EC-TM1) and L(EC-TM1–3) (Fig. 1). As expected, cells transfected with either of these constructs alone did not respond to hCG treatment. Again, co-transfection of cells with plasmids encoding FLR together with those encoding L(EC-TM1) or L(EC-TM1–3) allowed dose-dependent cAMP stimulation by hCG (Fig. 2). An earlier study demonstrated that a mutant rat LH receptor with the EC ligand binding region deleted could be expressed in transfected cells but required pharmacological concentrations of hCG for signal transduction (35Ji I.H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this finding, we generated a similar mutant LH receptor containing exons 1 and 10 of the human receptor and named it L(TM1–7) (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3 A, treatment with up to 1 μg/ml of hCG did not stimulate cAMP production in cells transfected with the plasmid encoding L(TM1–7). However, hCG treatment of cells co-expressing L(TM1–7) and L(EC-TM1–5) led to dose-dependent increases in cAMP production to levels that were 20% of that found in cells expressing wild type LH receptors, indicating restoration of ligand signaling. Stimulation of cAMP in cells expressing L(TM1–7) required high doses (>10 μg/ml) of hCG (35Ji I.H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cells co-expressing L(TM1–7) and L(EC-TM1–5) responded to 10 ng/ml hCG with significant increases in cAMP production (p < 0.01). We further investigated the minimal TM region required for interactions with L(TM1–7). As shown in Fig. 3 B, hCG treatment induced dose-dependent increases of cAMP production in cells co-expressing L(TM1–7) together with L(EC-TM1) or L(EC-TM1–3). These data suggested that the presence of TM1 is sufficient to partially restore ligand signaling. Because an earlier report suggested that co-expression of the EC region and endodomain of the porcine LH receptor could allow hCG stimulation of cAMP production (41Remy J.J. Bozon V. Couture L. Goxe B. Salesse R. Garnier J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we constructed the plasmid L(EC) encoding the EC region of the human LH receptor but lacking the endodomain (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 3 C, treatment with 1 μg/ml of hCG did not stimulate cAMP production in cells co-transfected with L(EC) together with L(TM1–7) as compared with a major stimulation of cAMP by hCG (100 ng/ml) in cells co-expressing L(TM1–7) and L(EC-TM1). To demonstrate that L(EC) could still bind hCG, ligand cross-linking experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 3 D (left panel), formation of high molecular mass complexes (87 kDa) between labeled hCG and L(EC) was found in the total cell extract from cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding L(EC) and L(TM1–7), and the complex formation could be competed by nonlabeled hCG. However, cross-linking of labeled hCG to plasma membrane proteins in the same cells did not lead to complex formation in direct contrast to the formation of high molecular mass, competable complexes (130 kDa) between labeled hCG and wild type LH receptor (Fig. 3 D, right panel). These data suggest minimal restoration of receptor function when cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding L(TM1–7) and L(EC) under the present experimental conditions and the importance of TM1 in ligand signaling. Earlier studies demonstrated that the ligand-binding EC region of the thrombin receptor, anchored on the cell surface through the single TM region of CD8, interacted efficiently with the TM segments (endodomain) of the thrombin receptor to restore ligand signaling (30Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also anchored the EC region of the LH receptor to the single TM domain of CD8 to facilitate ligand binding to the cell surface (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 4 A, moderate levels of hCG binding were found in cells expressing the anchored chimeric receptor L(EC)CD8. Although hCG binding to L(EC)CD8 was lower than that of the wild type LH receptor, it was much higher than for cells expressing L(EC-TM1–5). In addition, co-transfection of cells with plasmids encoding L(TM1–7) and L(EC)CD8 did not increase hCG binding above that in cells expressing L(EC)CD8 alone. Signal transduction of cells expressing these mutant receptors was also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4 B, hCG stimulation of cAMP production was found in cells co-expressing L(EC-TM1–5) together with L(TM1–7). However, no stimulation of cAMP production by hCG could be detected in cells co-expressing L(EC)CD8 and L(TM1–7). These data suggested that the LH receptor is different from the related thrombin receptor in that co-expression of its TM endodomain together with its anchored EC region fused to a foreign TM domain could not restore ligand signaling. We further investigated whether the soluble EC region of the LH receptor complexed with its ligand hCG could activate the TM endodomain. We constructed a chimeric anchored receptor, L(EC)tCD8 (Fig. 1), by fusing the EC region of the LH receptor to the single TM region of CD8 through the thrombin cleavage site found in the thrombin receptor to allow proteolytic cleavage. Following expression of this anchored receptor in 293 cells, thrombin was added to the culture media to allow proteolytic cleavage of the EC region of the LH receptor. We concentrated large amounts of the conditioned media containing the LH receptor EC region and incubated the media with 3 μg/ml of labeled hCG for 6 h at 23 °C before cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the EC region of the LH receptor cleaved after thrombin treatment formed complexes with labeled hCG. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel, a lower band showed the migration of labeled hCG, whereas a higher band (at 105 kDa) indicated the presence of a complex between hCG and the EC region of the LH receptor. Although the exact amount of this soluble LBP was unknown, the concentrated, conditioned media allowed the binding of >95% of hCG to form the high molecular mass complexes (left lane). The same conditioned medium from thrombin-treated cells was incubated with unlabeled hCG (3 μg/ml) and added into cultures containing cells transfected with the L(TM1–7) plasmid. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the hCG·LBP complexes failed to stimulate cAMP production by cells expressing L(TM1–7). In contrast, ligand signaling could be found in cells co-expressing L(TM1–7) and L(EC-TM1–5). TM helices of G protein-coupled receptors are believed to represent independent folding units and form a tightly packed channel-like structure (5Baldwin J.M. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Our study indicated that co-transfection of cells with LH receptor fragments or chimeric gonadotropin receptors defective in either ligand binding or signal transduction led to functional complementation and ligand-activated signal generation (Fig.6 A). Studies using the EC region of the LH receptor alone, the EC region anchored through the heterologous single TM domain of CD8 to the cell surface, or as soluble complexes with its ligand, further suggested that the TM1 region of the LH receptor is important for receptor function. The large EC region of the LH receptor, when connected to one or several of the TM domains, can be reconstituted into functional proteins after co-expression with its own endodomain. The observed interactions between receptor fragments took place with TM1 connected to the EC region in cells co-expressing L(EC-TM1) together with L(TM1–7) or with FLR. This interaction is receptor-specific, because co-expression of L(EC-TM1–5), together with the wild type FSH receptor, was ineffective in restoring ligand signaling. Our results are consistent with earlier studies showing that the function of truncated β-adrenergic, vasopressin V2 and muscarinic M3 receptors could be reconstituted when co-transfected with the missing TM folding domains (reviewed in Ref.21Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the interactions between different mutant LH receptors is not clear. Transient (collisional) oligomer formation at the fluid cell surface could allow ligand signaling. Alternatively, co-expression of mutant receptors could lead to the “rescuing” of misfolded receptor fragments through receptor complementation and proper trafficking of functional complexes to the plasma membrane (21Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although our early studies indicated that the majority of the L(EC-TM1–5) protein was trapped intracellularly (31Laue L. Wu S.M. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J.W. Cutler Jr., G.B. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. Brain C. Berry A.C. Grant D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1429-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), co-expression of both L(EC-TM1–5) and L(TM1–7) did not lead to higher cell surface binding despite partial restoration of ligand signaling. Dimerization of adrenergic receptors has been proposed to be important for ligand signaling (42Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear whether receptor dimerization is required for all G protein-coupled receptors. The metabotropic glutamate receptor, which has a large EC domain similar to the gonadotropin receptors, forms disulfide-linked dimers through its EC domain (43Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The observed functional complementation between L(EC-TM1–5) and L(TM1–7), which lacks the EC region, indicated that interactions between EC domains are not obligatory for LH receptor function. Our attempts to restore LH receptor function by expressing ecto- and endodomains separately did not lead to ligand signaling, unlike an earlier study using porcine LH receptor fragments (41Remy J.J. Bozon V. Couture L. Goxe B. Salesse R. Garnier J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the exact reason for the observed discrepancies is unclear, ligand cross-linking analysis indicated that the expression levels for the EC ectodomain are low and the proteins formed are trapped inside transfected cells. The intracellular form of the EC fragment of LH receptor is probably not fully glycosylated because it is smaller than the cleaved EC region (LBP) derived from the anchored chimeric receptor L(EC)tCD8. Activation of the LH receptor appears to require proper orientation between the EC and TM segments, and the integrity of the EC/TM1 junction is a prerequisite for a functional protein (Fig.6 B). Although efficient formation of complexes could be demonstrated between hCG and the soluble EC domain or hCG and the EC region anchored to the TM domain of CD8, these complexes could not activate L(TM1–7) that lacked the EC region. Based on the proportion of complexes formed between hCG and the soluble EC region of the LH receptor, up to 3 μg/ml hCG binding equivalent of the complexes was incubated with the cells expressing L(TM1–7), but no stimulation of cAMP production was evident. Moreover, co-expression of L(EC)CD8 together with L(TM1–7) did not lead to ligand signaling despite the ability of L(EC)CD8 to bind hCG, suggesting that the presence of high concentrations of the ligand on the cell surface is not sufficient for signal transduction. In contrast, co-expression of a CD8-anchored ectodomain of the thrombin receptor, together with an N-terminally truncated thrombin receptor lacking the “agonist” peptide sequence, reconstituted thrombin signaling (30Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the single TM region of CD8 used to anchor the ectodomain of the LH receptor in L(EC)CD8 is incompatible with one or more of the TM segments of the LH receptor (Fig. 6 B). Although both thrombin and LH receptors have a large EC region important for ligand binding, activation of thrombin receptors can be mimicked by a small peptide agonist (30Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ligand signaling of the gonadotropin receptors may require multiple interaction sites between the TM segments (especially the intervening extracellular loops) of the receptor and the large EC region and hCG (44Moyle W.R. Campbell R.K. Rao S.N. Ayad N.G. Bernard M.P. Han Y. Wang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20020-20031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Proper orientation between the ecto- and endodomains of gonadotropin receptors appears to be essential for receptor activation, which can be achieved through the native TM1 of the LH receptor but not by the heterologous CD8 TM region (Fig.6 B). Based on structure-function analysis and crystal structures of hCG and the ribonuclease inhibitor, it has been proposed that the EC region of the LH receptor binds to the hormone-specific β-subunit to allow a second step activation of the endodomain via the common α-subunit (11Braun T. Schofield P.R. Sprengel R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 45Jiang X. Dreano M. Buckler D.R. Cheng S. Ythier A. Wu H. Hendrickson W.A. Tayar N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1341-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Direct interaction between the common α-subunit of glycoprotein hormones with the TM region has also been demonstrated (46Ji I. Zeng H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22971-22974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification at residue Lys91 (to Asp) of the α-subunit of gonadotropins affects receptor activation but not ligand binding. Furthermore, a complementary mutation on the first EC loop of the TM region of the LH receptor (Asp397 to Lys) was found to partially restore receptor activation by the Lys91 to Asp mutant of hCG-α. The present findings do not rule out the proposed interactions between the ligand and the TM segments and the intervening extracellular loops of the receptor and are consistent with the observation that the affinity between hCG and the second binding site in the TM region is extremely low (35Ji I.H. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13076-13079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that the interaction between the endodomain and the ligand-bound EC region is too weak to allow receptor activation without a covalent linkage between the EC and TM1. The present finding that L(EC-TM1) could complement L(TM1–7) in functional restoration suggests that conformational changes in the EC/TM junction induced by ligand binding may be essential for ligand signaling. Alternatively, these two mutant receptors may interact such that TM1 of L(EC-TM1) displaces TM1 of L(TM1–7) and folds into a functional complex in which the EC region of L(EC-TM1) is in direct contact with the TM domains of L(TM1–7) (Fig.6 B). Leydig cell hypoplasia is a form of male pseudohermaphroditism, in which affected 46 XY males show a female phenotype associated with low androgen production by Leydig cells (31Laue L. Wu S.M. Kudo M. Hsueh A.J.W. Cutler Jr., G.B. Griffin J.E. Wilson J.D. Brain C. Berry A.C. Grant D.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1429-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The present findings that co-transfection of L(EC-TM1–5) and L(TM1–7) partially restores ligand signaling suggest that overexpression of L(TM1–7) in testis cells could form the basis of gene therapies to rescue genetic defects found in these patients. A similar approach has allowed the restoration of the function of defective vasopressin V2 receptors found in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (26Schoneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The present finding extends the co-expression strategy in the treatment of diseases caused by inactivating mutations in the seven-TM receptor family. In conclusion, the observed complementation of LH receptor fragments defective in either signal transduction or ligand binding provides a unique model to study the bifunctional receptor molecule and indicates the unique role of TM1 and/or the EC/TM1 junction of gonadotropin receptors in signal transduction. We thank Dr. Shaun Coughlin (University of California, San Francisco) for providing the thrombin receptor/CD8 plasmid."

Truncation of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail to 20 amino acids had little or no effect on chemotaxis or signal transduction, but further truncation resulted in marked functional defects. Upon incubation with monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, CCR2B underwent rapid and extensive internalization, and this was impaired progressively as the carboxyl tail was truncated from 52 to 8 amino acids. Mutation of all of the serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl tail to alanine also resulted in markedly impaired receptor internalization but did not affect signaling or chemotaxis. We conclude that the membrane-proximal portion of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail of CCR2B is critically involved in chemotaxis and signal transduction, but neither phosphorylation of carboxyl serines or threonines nor internalization of the receptor is required for robust chemotaxis.

Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are small, basic peptides that induce directed migration in leukocytes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev.

The chemokines can be subdivided into two families, based on the positions of the first two cysteines and on the quaternary structure of chemokine homodimers (5Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Science. 1994; 263: 1762-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 6Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Monocyte chemoattractant 1 (MCP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; CCR, C-C chemokine receptor; HEK, human embryo kidney; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. is a member of the C-C or β chemokine family, in which the first two cysteines are adjacent, and is a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, basophils, and memory T cells. Chemokine receptors are members of the seven-transmembrane domain family of receptors and mediate leukocyte activation by coupling to G-proteins. We have shown previously that CCR2A and CCR2B, the chemokine receptors for MCP-1, signal through multiple G-proteins, including Gαi, Gαq, and Gα16 (7Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21814-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast to other seven-transmembrane domain receptors in which an extended third intracellular loop (50–75 amino acids long) interacts directly with G-proteins, the chemokine receptors are characterized by extremely short third loops (12 amino acids in the case of CCR2), and thus other portions of these receptors, such as the carboxyl-terminal domain, may be critically involved in signal transduction (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of CCR2, phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the carboxyl tail has also been shown to mediate rapid receptor deactivation (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar). Chemotaxis is the prototypic function of the chemokines, but the signal transduction pathways utilized to initiate directed cell migration are not well understood. Moreover, accurate tracking of changing chemokine gradients may require rapid modulation of signaling at the level of the receptor. In the present study, we have created a series of CCR2B mutants to test the hypothesis that receptor deactivation is required for chemotaxis. MCP-1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis). LipofectAMINE, RPMI 1640, and minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt were from Life Technology, Inc. M1 antibody was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Fetal calf serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). [γ-32P]ATP and [3H]adenine were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Truncation mutants of CCR2B were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the wild-type receptor as a template (9Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Downstream primers were designed to introduce a stop codon as well as an NotI restriction site. An upstream primer was located at ∼10 base pairs 5′ to an internal EcoRI site in CCR2B. Mutation of serine/threonine residues to alanine was also done by polymerase chain reaction as described (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs incorporated the Flag epitope and prolactin signal sequence at their 5′ end as described previously (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar), were subcloned into the vector pCMV-1 (10Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and were sequenced completely before use. Human embryo kidney (HEK)-293 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (CRL 1573, Bethesda, MD) and were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 IU/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. cDNAs were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions, and stable cell lines were obtained by selection in G418. 300-19 pre-B cells (11Reth M.G. Ammirati P. Jackson S. Alt F.W. Nature. 1985; 317: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. G. La Rosa (LeukoSite, Cambridge, MA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), glutamine (2 mm), and β-mercaptoethanol (55 μm). Transfection of 300-19 cells was done by electroporation (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells in 400 μl of medium were mixed with 30 μg of the cDNAs in expression vectors and 1.5 μg of a plasmid that conferred resistance to neomycin (pSV2-neo) and were maintained at 4 °C for 15 min. Electroporation was performed at 250 V and 960 microfarads. After an overnight incubation, positive clones were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. A pool of G418-resistant cells was analyzed for cell surface expression of receptors by a FACS. Approximately 3 × 106 harvested cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with culture medium containing phycoerythrin-conjugated M1 antibody. Unbound antibody was removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were resuspended in PBS plus 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. MCP-1 (5 μg) was labeled using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (diiodide, NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (12Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Unconjugated iodide was separated from labeled protein by elution through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with PBS and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1% w/v). Specific activity was determined by immunoassay (Quantikine; R&D) of the labeled protein and by counting gamma emissions and was typically 2,200 Ci/mmol. Equilibrium binding was performed as described (12Monteclaro F.S. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, 125I-labeled ligand, with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand, was added to 0.5 × 106cells in polypropylene tubes in a total volume of 300 μl (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5% BSA) and incubated for 90 min at 27 °C on an orbital shaker set at 150 rpm. The cells were collected on glass-fiber filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylimine and 0.2% BSA with a Skatron cell harvester (Skatron Instruments, Sterling, VA). Unbound ligand was removed by washing with 4 ml of buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA) for 10 s. Competition with unlabeled ligand was determined by incubation of 0.5 × 106 transfected cells (as above) with 1.5 nm radiolabeled ligand in a final volume of 300 μl. The samples were collected, washed, and counted as above. The data were analyzed with the curve-fitting program Prism (GraphPad, San Diego) and the iterative nonlinear regression program LIGAND. Agonist-dependent increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ were determined in transfected 300-19 cells as described previously (13Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells stably transfected with wild-type and truncated CCR2B were grown until subconfluent in 12-well dishes and labeled overnight with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (25–30 Ci/mmol) in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The next day, the cells were washed with serum-free medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mmHEPES. After removal of the washing medium, the cells were stimulated by the addition of fresh medium containing 50 μmforskolin and the indicated concentrations of MCP-1 in the presence of 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP levels were quantitated by chromatography on Dowex 50W and neutral alumina columns as described (13Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Measurement of ERK activation was performed as described previously (14Arai H. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 522-528PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 300-19 cells stably transfected with wild-type or mutant CCR2B were maintained in the absence of serum for 24 h and then activated by incubation with 10 nm MCP-1 for 5 min. After two washes with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with an anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. Samples were then washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then incubated in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 50 μm ATP, 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma), 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor (Sigma), and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 25 °C. After incubation, Laemmli sample buffer was added (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed by electrophoresis and visualization of the phosphoproteins by autoradiography. A PhosphorImager (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT) was used to quantitate band intensity. The surface expression of CCR2B was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (16Wong L.-M. Myers S.J. Tsou C.-L. Gosling J. Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1038-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 106 cells/tube were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with 1 μg/ml M1 antibody in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with or without 50 nm MCP-1 for various times at 37 °C and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (Bio-Rad; 1:1,000 dilution in RPMI 1640, 0.1% BSA) for 30 min at room temperature and washed once again with PBS. Color development was initiated by the addition of 1 mg/ml 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma) in citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (VMAX, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The rate of internalization was expressed as a ratio of receptor expression in the presence or absence of MCP-1. The migration of 300-19 cell lines was determined using a modification of the method of Campbell et al. (17Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300-19 cells stably transfected with mutated or wild-type CCR2B were resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus BSA (1 mg/ml). Cell density was adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml, and 5 × 105 cells were added to the top chamber of a 24-transwell apparatus (6.5-mm diameter, 5-μm pore size, Costar 3421, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells that passed through the membrane were collected from the lower well and counted in a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Chemotaxis was distinguished from chemokinesis by “checkerboard” analysis as described by Zigmond and Hirsch (18Zigmond S.H. Hirsch J.G. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 387-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Cell numbers, determined with a Coulter counter (Coulter, Miami, FL), were in excellent agreement with the results of the FACscan analysis. To examine the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CCR2B in chemotaxis and signaling, we created a series of four mutants in which this region of 52 amino acids was truncated progressively to 33, 27, 20, and finally 8 amino acids. These constructs were designated CCR2Δ1, CCR2Δ2, CCR2Δ3, and CCR2Δ4, respectively (Fig.1). Because phosphorylation of carboxyl tail serine and threonine residues is known to contribute to the desensitization of CCR2 (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar), we created two additional mutants. CCR2-ALA contains the full-length carboxyl tail in which all of the serine and threonine residues (a total of 10) were changed to alanines. In CCR2Δ3-ALA, the serine and threonine in CCR2Δ3 were changed to alanine. Stably transfected cell lines were established in a murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line (300-19) (11Reth M.G. Ammirati P. Jackson S. Alt F.W. Nature. 1985; 317: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and analysis by flow cytometry revealed cell surface expression of the six variant forms comparable to that of wild-type CCR2 (Fig.2).Figure 2Expression of wild-type and truncated receptors in 300-9 cells.

Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19084-19092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In equilibrium binding studies, each of the carboxyl tail truncation mutants bound 125I-labeled MCP-1 with an affinity similar to that of wild-type CCR2B (TableI). An intact cytoplasmic carboxyl tail, therefore, is not required for high affinity binding of MCP-1 to CCR2B.Table IComparison of MCP-1 binding, EC50 of Ca2+ flux, and IC50 of adenylyl cyclase inhibitionReceptorEquilibrium binding KdCa2+ flux EC50Adenylyl cyclase inhibition IC50nmnmnmCCR2B0.655.950.053Δ10.342.220.026Δ20.40NDNDΔ30.763.220.086Δ3ALA0.54ND0.046Δ40.5827.31.31CCR2B-ALA0.274.92NDThe data shown are the mean of at least three independent experiments.

Because the CCR2B truncation mutants bound MCP-1 with high affinity, we next assessed their ability to initiate signal transduction. We first examined agonist-dependent mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in the 300-19 cell transfectants. In response to a saturating concentration of MCP-1, a robust calcium flux was observed in cells expressing CCR2Δ1, CCR2Δ3, and the two alanine mutants (Fig. 3 A). CCR2Δ2 was not studied in detail because the more severely truncated CCR2Δ3 was essentially identical to CCR2Δ1. CCR2Δ4, which retained only eight carboxyl tail residues, had a significantly diminished maximal response. Dose-response studies of these constructs over a broad range of MCP-1 concentrations confirmed that all, except CCR2Δ4, had EC50 values very similar to that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3 B and Table I). Consistent with published findings (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar), mutation of CCR2 carboxyl tail serines and threonines, or loss of these residues as a result of receptor truncation, led to a prolongation of the rise in intracellular calcium (Fig. 3 B). Chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA did not affect either the magnitude or the prolongation of the calcium response in the truncation mutants (data not shown). CCR2B couples to Gαi to lower cAMP levels (7Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21814-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 13Myers S.J. Wong L.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5786-5792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and as a second assay of signal transduction, we determined the ability of each mutant to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Except for CCR2Δ4, the truncation mutants were as active as wild-type CCR2B in this assay (Fig.4). As summarized in Table I, the IC50 for CCR2Δ4 was approximately 25-fold higher. These experiments, which were performed in a different cell type (HEK-293 cells), recapitulated the results of the calcium flux studies in 300-19 cells. In contrast to the results of the calcium flux and adenylyl cyclase experiments, CCR2Δ4 was as potent as wild-type CCR2B or the longer truncation mutants in activating ERK (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the carboxyl tail of CCR2B does not play a critical role in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In response to MCP-1, CCR2B was internalized rapidly, with 60–70% of the wild-type receptor removed from the cell surface by 15 min (Fig.6). Truncation of the carboxyl tail resulted in a progressive slowing of internalization, such that more than 75% of CCR2Δ4, CCR2Δ3, Δ3ALA, and CCR2-ALA remained on the cell surface at 15 min. The internalization of the truncation mutants could be roughly divided into three groups: Δ4 was the most impaired; Δ3, Δ3-ALA, and CCR2-ALA had an intermediate level of impairment; and Δ2 and Δ1 were internalized almost as well as the wild-type receptor. These data suggest that multiple regions of the carboxyl tail and, in particular, the amino acids between 316 (CCR2Δ4) and 328 (CCR2Δ3) play important roles in agonist-dependent receptor internalization. The data further indicate that neither the serine nor the threonine in CCR2Δ3 plays a critical role in receptor internalization, since mutation of both to alanine (Δ3-ALA) did not change the rate of internalization compared with Δ3. Finally, we examined each of the mutants for its ability to induce chemotaxis when stably expressed in 300-19 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, cells transfected with CCR2B exhibited a classical biphasic response to MCP-1. The MCP-1 concentration for optimal chemotaxis was 1 nm, and the chemotactic index (ratio of cells migrating in the presenceversus the absence of MCP-1) was in excess of 5,000. Checkerboard analysis confirmed that virtually all of this response was caused by chemotaxis and not chemokinesis (data not shown). Except for Δ4, a similar pattern was seen with each of the truncation mutants, although the chemotactic indices tended to be lower. In Δ1, the peak response was similar to that in the wild-type receptor but was left-shifted to 0.1 nm. In cells expressing Δ4, the chemotactic index was clearly lower, the curve was also right-shifted, and the optimal response occurred at approximately 10 nmMCP-1. Once again, checkerboard analysis confirmed that this response was not caused by chemokinesis (data not shown). We have shown previously that the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of CCR2B plays an important role in receptor deactivation and internalization (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if this region of the receptor is critically involved in chemotaxis, we created a series of progressive truncations of the carboxyl domain and also mutated all serine and threonine residues to alanine. There are two important results of this study. First, the 12 amino acids between CCR2Δ3 (Phe-328) and CCR2Δ4 (Leu-316) are critically involved in signal transduction, agonistdependent internalization, and chemotaxis. Second, rapid deactivation of the receptor, either by agonist-induced phosphorylation of carboxyl domain serine and threonine residues or by receptor internalization, is not required for chemotaxis. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a dissociation of receptor internalization/desensitization and chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the prototypic function of the chemokine receptors, yet little is known of the signaling pathways and receptor domains involved in this complex phenomenon. Unlike freshly isolated blood cells, transfected cells do not generally show robust chemotactic responses (19Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.-M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and this has been a significant problem in the chemokine field. Our studies have utilized a modification of the chemotaxis assay described by Campbell et al. (17Campbell J.J. Qin S. Bacon K.B. Mackay C.R. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Stable lines of wild-type and mutated CCR2B were established in a pre-B lymphocyte cell line (300-19) and yielded a chemotactic index (for the wild-type receptor) in excess of 5,000, as opposed to 15 for transfected HEK-293 cells (19Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.-M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using this assay, we have found that truncation of CCR2B to within 8 amino acids of the membrane (CCR2Δ4) does not abolish chemotaxis but does result in a reduced chemotactic index as well as a shift to higher MCP-1 concentrations for optimal cell migration. The reduction in chemotaxis correlated well with reduced signal transduction in the calcium flux and cyclase assays and is thus most simply explained as a direct consequence of poor coupling of the truncated receptor to G-proteins. That the most severely truncated mutant (CCR2Δ4) signaled well in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase assay most likely reflects the multiple rounds of signal amplification between ligand binding and ERK activation. CCR2Δ4 internalized much more slowly than the wild-type receptor, and its ability to mediate chemotaxis was also markedly impaired. This result raised the question of whether receptor sequestration is necessary for robust chemotaxis. To address this issue, we created a second CCR2 mutant, CCR2-ALA, in which all 10 of the carboxyl tail serine and threonine residues were mutated to alanine. Agonist-dependent internalization of seven-transmembrane domain receptors is in large part dependent upon phosphorylation of these serine and threonine residues (for review, see Ref. 20Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), and as expected, CCR2-ALA internalized very slowly. The chemotactic response, however, was fully as robust as that of the wild-type receptor. In addition, a number of other slowly internalizing mutants (CCR2Δ3, CCR2Δ3-ALA) were similar to the wild-type CCR2B in their chemotactic response. We conclude that receptor internalization is not an important component of the chemotactic response, at least as measured in this unidirectional assay. Further, because CCR2-ALA cannot undergo rapid desensitization (8Franci C. Gosling J. Tsou C.-L. Coughlin S.R. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5606-5612PubMed Google Scholar), we further conclude that neither of the these two well described mechanisms of receptor deactivation is critically involved in mediating chemotaxis. Rather, these results suggest that once activated, the cell migrates in a process that does not require continuous modulation at the level of the receptor. Whether receptor internalization and desensitization are important for a migrating cell to change direction (i.e. follow a changing gradient) remains to be determined. Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of CCR2B to 8 amino acids markedly impaired signal transduction. The cytoplasmic carboxyl tails of seven-transmembrane domain receptors have been implicated in G-protein coupling. Liggett et al. (21Liggett S.B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hnatowich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4816-4821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the carboxyl portion of the third intracellular loop and, to a lesser extent, the membrane-proximal region of the carboxyl tail participated in the coupling of the β2-adrenergic receptor to Gαs. Similarly, Cotecchia et al. (22Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) found that substitution of the most membrane-proximal amino acids of the carboxyl tail of the α1-adrenergic receptor with the corresponding region of the β2-adrenergic receptor resulted in a marked decrease in agonist-dependent activation of phospholipase C. More recently, Namba et al. (23Namba T. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Irie A. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Ito S. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Nature. 1993; 365: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) showed that differentially spliced isoforms of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the prostaglandin E receptor couple to different G-proteins. In the current study, G-protein coupling was assessed by determining agonist-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in transfected epithelial HEK-293 cells, as well as by intracellular calcium elevation in the hematopoietic 300-19 cells. In both cell types, our data indicate an important role for the membrane-proximal amino acids of the CCR2 carboxyl tail (i.e. amino acids 316–328) in coupling to G-proteins. Truncation of the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail also led to a progressive impairment in the ability of the mutants to undergo agonist-dependent internalization. That CCR2Δ4 was clearly more impaired in its ability to internalize than CCR2-ALA also indicates that carboxyl tail residues other than the 10 serines and threonines play a role in receptor sequestration. Further evidence for this point is derived from the fact that CCR2Δ3 and CCR2Δ3ALA had virtually identical phenotypes in terms of receptor sequestration. Cysteine residues in the carboxyl tails of the G-protein-coupled receptors are potential sites for palmitoylation and may serve to form a fourth intracellular loop (22Cotecchia S. Exum S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2896-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 24Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is not known if either of the two cysteines in this region of CCR2B (329 and 332) is palmitoylated. However, CCR2Δ3 (F328) lacks both of these cysteines, and yet was very similar to the wild-type receptor in signaling and chemotaxis assays. The cysteine residues in the carboxyl tail of CCR2B, therefore, do not appear to be critical for receptor function. To our knowledge, only one other study has examined the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of a chemokine receptor in chemotaxis (19Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.-M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In that study, truncation of the carboxyl tail of CXCR2 to 6 amino acids completely abolished chemotactic activity, and the authors postulated a role for this receptor domain in mediating chemotaxis (19Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A. Johnston J.J. Wang J.-M. Kim J. Chuntharapai A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9121-9128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, because other measurements of signal transduction were not performed, it was equally likely that the truncated receptor was simply uncoupled from G-proteins. Data in the current study support this latter view and further suggest that normal mechanisms of rapid receptor deactivation, such as agonist-induced sequestration and desensitization, are not involved in chemotaxis. In summary, we have shown that the 12 amino acids between leucine 316 and phenylalanine 328 of the CCR2B carboxyl domain play an important role in chemotaxis, signal transduction, and agonist-dependent receptor sequestration. Neither agonist-induced receptor internalization nor phosphorylation of carboxyl tail serine/threonine residues appears to be critically involved in any of these responses, including chemotaxis. Further elucidation of this pathway may identify targets for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of inflammation. We thank Drs. Robert W.

Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; RI, RII, and RIII, TGF-β receptor types I, II, and III, respectively. belongs to a multifunctional growth factor family. Three isoforms of TGF-β, designated as TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, have been identified in mammals. They all function by binding mainly to three cell surface proteins called type I (RI), type II (RII), and type III (RIII) receptors. RI and RII are serine/threonine kinase receptors that form a heteromeric complex to propagate TGF-β signaling. TGF-β isoforms first bind to RII to form TGF-β·RII complex which then recruits RI (1Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that RI can relay the signal to intracellular transducers after being phosphorylated by RII (2Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). RIII is a proteoglycan with a large extracellular domain and a small intracellular domain. Although it is the major TGF-β binding molecule on the cell surface in most cases (3Cheifetz S. Like B. Massague J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar), sequence analysis suggests that the intracellular domain of RIII contains no known signaling motif (7Lopez-Casillas F.

However, it was shown recently to be necessary to enhance cell responsiveness to exogenous TGF-β2 (9Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J.

TGF-β isoforms are secreted in a latent form in that the mature TGF-βs are noncovalently associated with the N-terminal remainder of their respective processed precursor called latency-associated peptide. A number of enzymes and extracellular proteins have been shown to be involved in the activation of the latent TGF-β (11Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J.

More recently, it was shown that suppression of endogenous TGF-β expression in TGF-β-sensitive colon cancer cells, or restoration of TGF-β sensitivity in TGF-β-resistant colon and breast cancer cells, can reduce tumorigenicity of these cells in vivo suggesting that a functional autocrine TGF-β loop is tumor-suppressive in these model systems (17Wu S.P.

Pathol. 1996; 148: 1887-1894PubMed Google Scholar). The net effect of this decreased receptor expression and increased ligand expression is the accumulation of free TGF-βs in the stroma. In addition to its growth inhibitory activity, TGF-βs are known to suppress immune response (42Sosroseno W. Herminajeng E. Br. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 52: 142-148PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulate angiogenesis (43Yang E.Y. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 44Ueki N. Nakazato M. Ohkawa T. Ikeda T. Amuro Y. Hada T. Higashino K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears highly feasible that increased TGF-βs in the stroma may act in a paracrine fashion on the stromal components to stimulate tumor progression. Indeed, overexpression of TGF-β1 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells led to increased, estrogen-independent tumor formation in athymic nude mice (45Arteaga C.L. Carty-Dugger T. Moses H.L. Hurd S.D. Pietenpol J.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 193-201PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of TGF-β1 in rat prostate cancer epithelial cells was shown to significantly stimulate tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, although the cells were growth inhibited in vitro(46Steiner M.S. Barrack E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, antagonizing paracrine TGF-β tumor-promoting activity in highly progressed cancers may offer a novel approach to reduce malignancy. Since TGF-β RIII binds all three TGF-β isoforms with high affinity with K d values ranging from 50 to 300 pmdepending on cell type (4Cheifetz S. Bassols A. Stanley K. Ohta M. Greenberger J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10783-10789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Massague J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23282-23287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that cell surface RIII can sequester active TGF-βs to antagonize their paracrine tumor-promoting activity. To test this hypothesis, we expressed RIII in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Our studies show that RIII-transfected cells released less active TGF-βs in the conditioned medium and were less tumorigenic in athymic nude mice than the control cells. These results suggest that RIII could be a novel target for antagonizing paracrine TGF-β tumor-promoting activity. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, ZR75–1, and Hs578T, human untransformed mammary myoepithelial cell line Hs578Bst, and mink lung epithelial cell line CCL64 were originally obtained from ATCC. Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and human untransformed mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A were originally obtained from the Michigan Cancer Foundation. These cell lines were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum (49Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Human colon cancer cell lines CBS and FET were generously provided by Dr. M. G. Brattain (50Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L.C. Willson J.K. Long B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). They were adapted to serum-free McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with pyruvate, vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 20 μg/ml insulin, and 4 μg/ml transferrin (49Mulder K.M. Brattain M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Working cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231 limiting dilution clones were obtained by plating parental cells into 96-well culture plates at 0.5 cell/well. The full-length cDNA of human TGF-β RIII, generously provided by Dr. C.-H. Heldin, was subcloned into a tetracycline-repressible expression system as described previously (19Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sense orientation of the RIII cDNA was confirmed by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. We used the tetracycline-repressible expression system to express RIII because we wished to demonstrate the specificity of the effect of RIII expression on extracellular mature TGF-β levels and onin vivo tumorigenicity within the same transfected clone. The expression vectors were linearized and transfected into one of MDA-MB-231 limiting dilution clones with a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator at 250 V and 950 microfarads. The control cells were transfected with the empty vectors. The transfected cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and maintained in the 10% fetal bovine serum medium for 2 days. Selection of stable transfectants were accomplished by adding Geneticin (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies, Inc.) to the culture medium at 600 μg/ml. G418-resistant, RIII-transfected clones were pooled in one dish and ring-cloned in another dish. Control clones were pooled and designated as Neo pool. The cell lines were expanded for screening of RIII expression. Total RNA from various cell lines was isolated by guanidine thiocyanate homogenization and acidic phenol extraction (51Xie W.Q. Rothblum L.I. Biotechniques. 1991; 11 (, 326–327): 324PubMed Google Scholar). To isolate total RNA from xenografts, they were first pulverized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and a pestle. The tissue powder was then homogenized in a 4 m guanidine thiocyanate solution. Total RNA was isolated by ultracentrifugation through a cesium gradient as described by Chirgwin et al. (52Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). To measure RIII mRNA levels in various cell lines, we constructed a human RIII riboprobe by inserting the full-length RIII cDNA into pBSK(−) plasmid (Stratagene Cloning Systems). The recombinant plasmid was then linearized with NcoI and T3 RNA polymerase was used to synthesize a radioactive antisense human RIII riboprobe of 438 bases. RNase protection assays were performed using this radioactive antisense riboprobe to measure RIII mRNA levels in various human cell lines, the transfected clones, and xenografts as described previously (19Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26449-26455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simian recombinant TGF–β1 was purified from conditioned media of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (53Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Purified TGF-β1 was iodinated by the chloramine-T method as described by Ruff and Rizzino (54Ruff E. Rizzino A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To measure the expression of cell surface RIII, 125I-TGF-β1 (200 pm) was incubated with a cell monolayer in 35-mm tissue culture wells and then cross-linked to its receptors as described by Segarini et al. (55Segarini P.R. Roberts A.B. Rosen D.M. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14655-14662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled cell monolayer was solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of cell lysate protein were electrophoresed in 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and exposed for autoradiography. A bioassay was used to measure growth inhibitory activity of the media conditioned by control and RIII-transfected cells on the growth of the mink lung epithelial CCL64 cells as described previously (56Sun L. Wu S. Coleman K. Fields K.C. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and RIII-transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with or without 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline until they reach 100% confluence. The media were replenished and conditioned for 72 h. The media were then collected and cell number in each well was counted with a hemocytometer. The conditioned media (10 μl) from duplicate wells for each cell type were added to CCL64 cells after they were plated in a 96-well plate. After 5 days of incubation, relative cell number in each well was obtained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay (57Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed as optical density. To measure the amount of active TGF-β in the media conditioned by control or RIII-transfected cells, monolayer cells in 6-well culture plates were cultured in the 10% fetal bovine serum medium until confluence. The cells were washed twice with a serum-free McCoy's 5A medium and incubated in 1.5 ml of this serum-free medium for an additional 72 h. The conditioned medium was then collected in siliconized microcentrifuge tubes and the cell number was counted with a hemocytometer. The amount of mature, activated TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in the conditioned medium was determined, respectively, with a TGF-β1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI) or a TGF-β2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells from exponential cultures of MDA-MB-231 transfectants were inoculated subcutaneously behind the anterior forelimb of 4-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc.). Each mouse was inoculated on both sides at three or four million cells per site. To test the specificity of RIII's tumor suppressive activity, tetracycline was added to the drinking water in one experiment to repress RIII expression in xenografts generated by RIII-transfected cells. Half of the inoculated mice were given 5% sucrose solution as drinking water, while the other half were given 5% sucrose solution containing 0.5 mg/ml tetracycline as drinking water 2 days prior to the inoculation and during the entire experiments. The water was replenished twice a week. Xenograft sizes were determined weekly by externally measuring tumors in two dimensions using a caliper. Volume (V) was determined by the following equation: V = (L ×W 2) × 0.5, where L is length andW is width of a xenograft. At the termination of the study, xenografts were resected from anesthetized mice, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for total RNA extraction. Human breast cancer cell lines have been shown to express readily detectable amounts of one or more TGF-β isoforms (21Arteaga C.L. Tandon A.K. Von Hoff D.D. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3898-3904PubMed Google Scholar, 58Arrick B.A. Korc M. Derynck R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 299-303PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, many of them are resistant to TGF-β in growth inhibition assays (21Arteaga C.L. Tandon A.K. Von Hoff D.D. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3898-3904PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161PubMed Google Scholar, 59Zugmaier G. Ennis B.W. Deschauer B. Katz D. Knabbe C. Wilding G. Daly P. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. J. Cell Physiol. 1989; 141: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As a result, the TGF-β isoforms in these cells could act in a paracrine fashion to promote tumor growth. To assess the potential use of RIII to antagonize the paracrine TGF-β activity, we first compared RIII expression levels in four human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, ZR75–1, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-231) with those in two untransformed human mammary cell lines (Hs578Bst and MCF-10A) and two well differentiated, TGF-β-sensitive human colon cancer cell lines (CBS and FET). RNase protection assays revealed that all four breast cancer cell lines express very low levels of RIII mRNA as shown in Fig.1. In contrast, the untransformed mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells, myoepithelial Hs578Bst cells, and the two well differentiated colon cancer CBS and FET cells express relatively high levels of RIII mRNA. These results suggest that RIII may be down-regulated during mammary neoplastic transformation and progression. To test our hypothesis that re-expression of RIII in breast cancer cells could lead to sequestration of endogenous TGF-β and consequently suppression of its paracrine tumor-promoting activity, we transfected tetracycline-repressible human RIII expression vectors into a typical limiting dilution clone of MDA-MB-231 cells. We chose this cell line for our study because it was shown that endogenous TGF-β isoforms could increase tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells (60Arteaga C.L. Hurd S.D. Winnier A.R. Johnson M.D. Fendly B.M. Forbes J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2569-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). After selecting the transfected cells with G418, we used RNase protection assays to screen a pool of G418-resistant clones as well as several individual clones for RIII expression and found that both the pool and one of the clones expressed higher levels of RIII mRNA than the control vector-transfected cells (Neo pool) as shown in Fig.2. They were designated the RIII pool and RIII clone, respectively. We then used receptor cross-linking assays to examine TGF-β RIII protein levels on the surface of Neo pool, RIII pool, and RIII clone cells. Consistent with the RNA data, RIII pool and RIII clone cells also expressed higher levels of cell surface RIII protein than Neo pool cells (Fig. 3). The specificity of the increased 125I-TGF-β1binding to RIII was confirmed by competition with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 (Fig. 3, third lane). Treatment of RIII pool and RIII clone with 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline for 4 days prior to the receptor cross-linking assay reduced their RIII protein levels to that of the Neo pool, indicating that tetracycline could reversibly regulate the expression of transfected RIII. This was particularly useful in subsequent experiments for us to demonstrate the specificity of the effect of RIII expression on the growth inhibitory activity of the media conditioned by RIII-transfected cells and on the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells.Figure 3Cell surface expression of TGF-β RIII in MDA-MB-231 transfectants. Receptor cross-linking assays were used to examine the cell surface TGF-β RIII levels of Neo pool, RIII pool, and RIII clone cells. Confluent monolayer cultures of the three types of cells were incubated with 200 pm125I-TGF-β1 alone (first, second, and fifth lane) or in the presence of 20 nm cold TGF-β1 (third lane) for 3 h at 4 °C. For the fourth and sixth lane, the RIII transfectants were cultured in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline for 4 days prior to the receptor cross-linking assay. The receptor-bound 125I-TGF-β1 was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed in 4–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The125I-TGF-β1-linked RIII was visualized after autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MDA-MB-231 cells are known to express TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 mRNA (58Arrick B.A. Korc M. Derynck R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 299-303PubMed Google Scholar) and to release active TGF-β into culture media (15Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Dugger T.C. McCutchen C.M. Moses H.L. Lyons R.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar, 21Arteaga C.L. Tandon A.K. Von Hoff D.D. Osborne C.K. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3898-3904PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that RIII expression should result in sequestration of active TGF-β isoforms and reduction of active TGF-β isoforms in conditioned media. To test this hypothesis, we first measured the effect of the media conditioned by Neo pool or RIII clone on the growth of mink lung epithelial CCL64 cells which are highly sensitive to TGF-β's growth inhibitory activity. While Neo pool-conditioned medium significantly (p < 0.0005 by Student's t test) inhibited CCL64 cell growth in comparison with no conditioned medium in Fig.4, RIII clone-conditioned medium had almost no growth inhibitory activity. In contrast, the medium conditioned by RIII clone that was treated with 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline showed growth inhibitory activity similar to that of the medium conditioned by Neo pool treated with tetracycline. This suggests that cell surface RIII can regulate the level of growth inhibitory activity in the conditioned medium. To confirm that the reduced growth inhibitory activity in RIII clone-conditioned medium was due to a reduced amount of active TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure active TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in the media conditioned by Neo pool and RIII clone. While we could detect active TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in Neo pool-conditioned medium at 49 and 21 pg/106 cells/72 h, respectively, we could not detect either active isoform in RIII clone-conditioned medium suggesting that RIII significantly reduced the amount of active TGF-βs released into the culture medium. The MDA-MB-231 cell line used in this study was insensitive to the growth inhibitory activity of TGF-β, similar to what was described by Kalkhoven et al. (22Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2012873748,"The mechanisms by which genetic material crosses prokaryotic membranes are incompletely understood. We have developed a new methodology to study the translocation of genetic material via pores in a reconstituted system, using techniques from electrophysiology and molecular biology. We report here that planar bilayer membranes become permeable to double-stranded DNA (kilobase range) if Bacillus subtilis membrane vesicles containing high conductance channels have been fused into them. The translocation is an electrophoretic process, since it does not occur if a transmembrane electrical field opposing the movement of DNA, a polyanion, is applied. It is not an aspecific permeation through the phospholipid bilayer, since it does not take place if no proteins have been incorporated into the membrane. The transport is also not due simply to the presence of polypeptides in the membrane, since it does not occur if the latter contains gramicidin A or a eukaryotic, multi-protein vesicle fraction exhibiting 30-picosiemens anion-selective channel activity. The presence of DNA alters the behavior of the bacterial channels, indicating that it interacts with the pores and may travel through their lumen. These results support the idea that DNA translocation may take place through proteic pores and suggest that some of the high conductance bacterial channels observed in electrophysiological experiments may be constituents of the DNA translocating machinery in these organisms.

The transport is also not due simply to the presence of polypeptides in the membrane, since it does not occur if the latter contains gramicidin A or a eukaryotic, multi-protein vesicle fraction exhibiting 30-picosiemens anion-selective channel activity. The presence of DNA alters the behavior of the bacterial channels, indicating that it interacts with the pores and may travel through their lumen. These results support the idea that DNA translocation may take place through proteic pores and suggest that some of the high conductance bacterial channels observed in electrophysiological experiments may be constituents of the DNA translocating machinery in these organisms. Current understanding of the transport of proteins and nucleic acids across biomembranes lags behind the knowledge accumulated on transport of smaller molecules and ions. In these latter fields, a crucial step is the reconstitution of the transport activity as membrane fractions, crude detergent extracts, and finally as isolated molecular species in artificial membrane systems. For prokaryotes, important advances along these lines have been made in the case of protein transport (1Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but less progress has been achieved in the case of nucleic acids. We have now devised an experimental strategy that might prove fruitful in this respect. We assayed DNA translocation through a planar bilayer separating two chambers, taking advantage of the powerful techniques of PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); pS, picosiemens; nS, nanosiemens. amplification and Southern blotting to detect the presence of DNA, initially added in one (cis) chamber, in the opposite (trans) one. Since the bilayer is built in the context of a standard electrophysiological setup, the procedure also allows the simultaneous monitoring of channel activity in (or, in general, current conduction by) the membrane, and it is thus particularly suitable to study pore-mediated translocation of genetic material. The evidence is growing that large channels, or channel-like structures, are involved in macromolecule transport.

Bakt. 1993; 278: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a component of macromolecule transport systems, have been shown to form channels when part of their sequence (the “gate”) is deleted. The evidence pointing to the involvement of proteic DNA-conducting channels in bacterial conjugation and transformation and in phage infection has been reviewed recently (9Dreiseikelmann B. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 293-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the most interesting examples concern phage DNA injection into the parasitized cells. For example, FhuA, which is also a phage receptor, gives rise to large ion- and possibly DNA-conducting channels upon binding bacteriophage T5 (10Bonhivers M. Ghazi A. Boulanger P. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Phage lambda can inject its DNA into liposomes bearing only its receptor, LamB, in a process involving the formation of long-lived open channels (11Roessner C.A. Ihler G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 386-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LamB is a porin of known structure (12Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) have been proposed to be involved in the injection of DNA into the infected cells. In the laboratory, uptake of DNA by bacteria is often obtained by exposing the cells to the genetic material under specific conditions of temperature and Ca2+ concentration (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.84Google Scholar). The mechanism of the process is obscure. Much also remains to be learned on the naturally occurring transformation processes (9Dreiseikelmann B. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 293-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dubnau D. Microbiol.

Over the past decade, the application of patch clamp has led to the discovery and characterization of non-porin, stretch-activated, voltage-dependent channels in the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative (25Martinac B.

No information is yet available on the proteins forming these pores, with the exception of one E. coli channel that has been sequenced and cloned (35Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). At least in Gram-positive bacteria, the various conductances, ranging from several pS to a few nS, have similar voltage dependence, selectivity, and sensitivity to stretch (39Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be due to a small number of proteins, possibly acting as oligomeric complexes (42Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Schroeder M. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A366Google Scholar). We have presented evidence supporting a role of these channels in osmoprotection (30Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabò I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). When the cells are subjected to an osmotic downshock the pores open, allowing the efflux of cytoplasmic solutes, including glutamate, lactose, and ATP, at high rates. The ease with which such relatively high molecular weight species flow through the pores suggested to us that they might be capable of conducting biopolymers, in particular DNA. The results presented here support this notion, suggesting that some of the pores might be constituents of the machinery responsible for DNA translocation in vivo. For planar bilayer experiments, a homemade apparatus was used, following established techniques (43Alvarez O. Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 115-130Crossref Google Scholar). Phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti) or sometimes purified soybean azolectin (Sigma) planar bilayers with a capacity of approximately 300 picofarads were prepared by painting a decane solution (25–40 mg/ml) across a smoothed hole in a Teflon film (25-μm thickness, Goodfellow) separating two chambers carved in a Teflon block. The standard experimental medium was 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm Hepes/K+, pH 7.2. Connection to the electrodes was provided by agar bridges. The contents of the chambers (3 ml) could be stirred by magnetic bars. The output of the amplifier was recorded on tape and analyzed off-line. Patch-clamp experiments were conducted essentially as described previously (39Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The chamber contained approximately 1 ml of medium (350 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmHepes/K+, pH 7.2). To test the effect of DNA, an excised inside-out patch was established, 5–30 μg of total E. coli DNA (Sigma) was added to the chamber with a pipette, and the contents of the chamber were mixed manually by withdrawing and re-adding approximately 0.7 ml of the contents three times. For bilayer experiments, the cis side voltage is reported. For patch-clamp experiments, the voltage reported is that of the bath side of the patch (opposite of the pipette voltage). Current (cations) flowing from the cis to the trans compartments in bilayer experiments or into the pipette in patch-clamp experiments are considered positive and plotted upward. Current was filtered at 1–3-kHz and sampled at 5–10-kHz for computer analysis. In a typical experiment, the planar bilayer was monitored for a few minutes to check for stability and possible leak current. 300 μl were withdrawn from the cischamber and replaced with 300 μl of 3 m KCl to favor fusion and to establish a transmembrane salt concentration gradient. Mostly inside-out B. subtilis membrane vesicles, prepared as described (41Alcayaga C. Venegas R. Carrasco A. Wolff D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), containing approximately 5–20 μg of protein were then added to the cis side, and the chambers were stirred at intervals until incorporation occurred. Activity was monitored at a few voltages for a short time. The cis chamber was then perfused with 20 ml of the experimental medium to avoid further incorporation, and activity was again monitored at a few voltage values. In most cases a sample of medium, to be used as a control against contaminations, was then taken from the trans side. A solution of plasmid containing the aequorin cDNA (see below) was then added to thecis compartment. The final concentration was in the range 0.8–8 μg of DNA/ml. Negative voltages in the −40 to −80 mV range were applied to the cis compartment, to provide a driving force for DNA translocation. 100- or 200-μl samples were taken at regular intervals from the trans compartment and replaced with the same volume of fresh experimental medium. The contents of both compartments were stirred for several seconds before each sampling and after additions. Samples from both compartments (“final cis” and “final trans”) were taken 10–30 min after the eventual membrane collapse, for use as positive controls in the subsequent PCR amplifications. The samples collected were stored in Eppendorf tubes at −20 °C until needed. Stringent precautions were necessary to avoid contamination artifacts. For example, the agar bridges were discarded, and the Teflon chambers were left immersed in sulfochromic mixture overnight after each experiment. Variable-volume pipettes were kept segregated according to their use and were washed (HCl/NaOH/UV light) every few days. Only filter-equipped pipette tips were employed throughout. All refuse containing (or suspected to contain) plasmid DNA was immediately eliminated in closed containers. To test DNA translocation we used either the recombinant plasmids mtAEQ-pcDNAI (44Rizzuto R. Brini M. Bastianutto C. Marsault R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or cytAEQ-pcDNAI (45Brini M. Marsault R. Bastianutto C. Alvarez J. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar),i.e. 4.2-kilobase pair double-stranded plasmids containing a construct comprising the cDNA of aequorin and addressing sequences or the 633-bp aequorin cDNA itself. The choice was dictated mainly by the easy availability of the material in our department. The plasmid solutions used contained linearized and/or fragmented species as well, produced by normal pipetting and handling. Aliquots of the samples withdrawn during each experiment were subjected to 35- or sometimes 40-cycle (95/57/72 °C) PCR amplification. The primers were chosen so as to lead to the amplification of the 633-base fragment encoding the aequorin gene. Pre-mixed PCR reaction medium, including Taq polymerase, and sample were used in a 4:1 ratio. Stringent precautions were required to avoid contamination artifacts. For example sample-loading operations were conducted under a “clean” hood in a room where the aequorin DNA was never otherwise introduced, strict measures were taken to avoid the accidental transfer of DNA from one sample to another during handling, and water samples were included in every amplification series as a contamination control. Unless otherwise specified, 20-μl aliquots of the amplified mixtures were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and Southern blotted onto positively charged nylon sheets (Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were then processed using the Boehringer Mannheim digoxigenin non-radioactive DNA labeling and detection reagents, using CSPD® as a substrate for chemiluminescent detection. Kodak Biomax film was used to obtain images of the blot. The amplification product migrated on gels slightly more slowly than the 564-bp mass marker. The translocation of only a relatively small number of DNA species was expected to take place in our experiments, and an estimate of the sensitivity of the method was desirable. Routine amplification and processing of solutions of the plasmid used in the translocation experiments, prepared by dilution in standard experimental medium, showed that we could reproducibly detect the presence of 10 (or, often, less, as in Fig. 1) template molecules in the amplification sample, leading to a conservative estimate of our lower detection limit as 6000 translocated molecules (Fig. 1). High conductance, low selectivity channels were routinely observed upon fusion of B. subtilis vesicles with planar bilayers, in agreement with the observations by Alcayaga et al. (41Alcayaga C. Venegas R. Carrasco A. Wolff D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Incorporation of a vesicle invariably led to the appearance of several conductances, ranging from about 0.1 to 1.5 nS (100 mm KCl), some of which clearly represented substates of others. The abundance of conductances and substates observed both in patch clamp and in bilayer experiments suggests the presence of interacting and cooperating components forming a channel system (see below). Channels of various conductances can be activated in patch-clamp experiments by applying a pressure difference across the membrane. Similarly, in bilayer experiments the activity often displayed a characteristic dependence on the presence of an osmotic pressure difference between the two compartments separated by the planar membrane. The open probability of the channels was higher in the presence of the gradient. Fig. 2illustrates this behavior that had not been previously reported for planar bilayer experiments. A transmembrane osmotic pressure gradient was routinely present at the beginning of our experiments, due to the higher [KCl] in the cis compartment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Channel activity arose under these conditions, but in many experiments (not always) continued also after the medium of thecis compartment had been replaced with the same solution of the trans side. This behavior is analogous to the patch-clamp experiments where “aging” or the repeated application of suction often led to stretch-independent activity (38Zoratti M. Petronilli V. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys.

The channels reconstituted in planar bilayers presumably underwent the same modification of their properties. Sub-millimolar concentrations of gadolinium have been shown to inhibit various stretch-activated channels, including those of bacteria (30Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabò I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows the inhibitory effect of 500 μm Gd3+ on a channel studied in the presence of transmembrane osmotic gradient (n = 4). The effect is well observable both from the current traces (Fig. 3, Aand B) showing a marked decrease of the open probability and by comparison of the current amplitude histograms (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 3 shows also the probability density histograms for the closed (Fig. 3 D) and open (Fig. 3 E) levels obtained from this representative experiment. The time constants obtained by fitting the histograms had values similar to the ones obtained for bacterial channels in patch-clamp experiments (40Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in general the kinetic parameters of the channels varied from experiment to experiment in both the bilayer and the patch-clamp systems.Figure 3Bacterial channels in planar bilayer experiments are inhibited by gadolinium. Representative current traces were recorded at V cis −40 mV in the presence of salt gradient (600 mm KCl cis, 100 mm KCl trans) before (A) and after (B) the addition of 500 μm Gd3+. The 530-pS conductance channel was slightly anion-selective (PCl−/PK+ = 1.75) and had an open probability of 0.312 before the addition of Gd3+. After the addition of the inhibitor the channel was closed as it is also observable from the shift of the peak toward 0 pA in the current amplitude histogram (C). D andE, show the probability density distributions for the closed and open states, respectively, from the same experiment prior to the addition of Gd3+. The histogram for the closed state was adequately fitted by the sum of two exponentials (time constants: τ1 = 3.8 ms; τ2 = 91.8 ms), and the open dwell-time histogram was fitted by one exponential with τ =25.6 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Concerning the selectivity, we have reported (39Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1112: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Szabò I. Petronilli V. Zoratti M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that the various conductances observed in patch-clamp experiments discriminated poorly between cations and anions. This is also the case for the channels observed in planar bilayers. Fig. 4 shows current-voltage relationships in the absence and in the presence of salt gradient from a representative experiment. The ohmic relationship is a further similarity to the channels observed in patch-clamp experiments. In the case presented here, the channel exhibited a slight anion selectivity (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas slightly cationic conductances were also observable in other bilayer experiments (not shown). As mentioned above, one of the characteristics of the bacterial channels studied using patch clamp is the presence of substates, i.e. of different current levels within a multi-level event, which are not due to the operation of independent channels. Substates were often present in bilayer experiments as well; one example is shown on Fig. 4 C. The lower current substate was visited by the channel only at positive cis side potentials (see Fig. 4 A) and exhibited a slightly more anionic selectivity with respect to the main conductance level. In most cases the channels exhibited voltage-dependence, although less markedly than in patch-clamp experiments; negative cispotentials favored closed or lower conductance states, as expected from the fusion of inside-out vesicles. Fig. 5shows representative current traces at various potentials and current amplitude histograms, demonstrating that lower conductance states were predominant at negative voltages. In some cases, however, an opposite voltage dependence was observed, probably due to the opposite orientation of the vesicle incorporated, and in a few cases the channels seemed to have lost their voltage dependence. In summary, the dependence on stretch and voltage, the weak selectivity, the sensitivity to Gd3+, and the size of the observed conductances in bilayer experiments were analogous to the properties of the channels observed in patch-clamp recordings and strongly suggested that the same molecular species were involved. We investigated whether DNA could be translocated across a planar bilayer membrane containing B. subtilis channels. While pore activity was continuously monitored, DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) was added on one side, and samples were taken at regular intervals from the other. The samples were then subjected to PCR amplification and Southern blotting to verify DNA content. Most of our DNA-translocation experiments were conducted in the absence of a transmembrane salt gradient. To better observe the channels' behavior and to exclude the presence of membrane “leaks,” the experiments were conducted with only a few active channels in the membrane. For an overall evaluation of the results, we arbitrarily considered only experiments lasting at least 30 min and yielding at least two samples. In 21 experiments, lasting 30 min to 2 h, cis potentials in the −40 to −80 mV range were applied. In 12 experiments there was clear evidence of translocation (i.e. DNA in all samples), while in 2 cases we could not detect translocated DNA and in 7 experiments the outcome was dubious, since bands appeared only in part of the blots. In other attempts the membrane lifetime was too short for the performance of a meaningful translocation experiment. The translocation of any specie through pores is driven by the electrochemical gradient of the specie itself. In the case of DNA, a polyanion, the voltage gradient is thus expected to contribute importantly to the driving force. Furthermore, its polarity and magnitude may be expected to have a strong influence on the kinetics of the translocation. We therefore verified whether translocation would take place in the presence of a field opposing the electrophoretic movement of the polyanion, i.e. at cis side positive voltages. We could not detect any DNA in the samples from thetrans side if the V cis was held at positive values (four experiments, lasting 40–100 min). In three further experiments we applied first a cis side positive voltage (20–40 min) followed by a period atV cis negative (40–80 min). The Southern blot from one of these experiments is shown in Fig.6 A. Translocation of DNA was not observed in the presence of cis-positive voltage, although it occurred upon application of cis-negative voltage in the same experiment. Control experiments were conducted following the procedures described above, except that the addition of membrane vesicles was omitted, and therefore the planar membrane contained no proteins. Fig. 6 Bshows the Southern blot resulting from one such experiment. No DNA permeation was detected. The same result was obtained in nine other similar experiments, lasting 40–240 min. The addition of plasmid had little or no effect on the membrane conductance, and no channel-like or “noisy” events were induced by it (not shown). To check whether the translocation might be an aspecific consequence of the presence of proteins in the bilayer, we performed two types of experiments. In the first, gramicidin A was incorporated into th"

Sci. 1996; 17: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These compounds modulate the NMDA receptor by at least four distinct mechanisms, possibly occurring at distinct receptor sites (27Williams K. Zappia A.M. Pritchett D.B. Shen Y.M. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar, 30Durand G.M. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Williams K. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J.I. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar). In subsaturating concentrations of the coagonist glycine, polyamines enhance the binding of glycine to NMDA receptors (glycine-dependent stimulation) (32Sacaan A.I. Johnson K.M. Mol.

In saturating glycine concentrations, polyamines stimulate receptor opening (glycine-independent stimulation) at concentrations below 200 mm (28Lynch D.R. Lawrence J.J. Lenz S. Anegawa N.J. Dichter M. Pritchett D.B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1462-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Williams K. Dawson V.L. Romano C. Dichter M.A. Molinoff P.B. Neuron. 1990; 5: 199-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), whereas at higher concentrations, polyamines block NMDA receptors in a voltage-dependent manner (35Rock D.M. Macdonald R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 83-88PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rock D.M. MacDonald R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 157-164PubMed Google Scholar) and decrease the affinity of the receptor for glutamate (31Williams K. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J.I. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar). Glycine-independent stimulation depends on subunit composition, with receptors containing NR1 splice variants lacking the 5′-insert (such as NR1A) exhibiting stimulation, whereas receptors containing NR1 subunits with the 5′-insert (NR1B) do not exhibit glycine-independent stimulation (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Durand G.M. Bennett M.V. Zukin R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, glycine-independent stimulation is seen only in receptors containing NR2B and is not exhibited by NR2A-, NR2C-, or NR2D-containing receptors (27Williams K. Zappia A.M. Pritchett D.B. Shen Y.M. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Chao J. Igarashi K. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1131-1141PubMed Google Scholar). Several specific residues of NR1 affect glycine-independent stimulation. A residue between the M3 and M4 putative transmembrane regions (Asp-669) (37Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Chao J. Igarashi K. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1131-1141PubMed Google Scholar) and the NH2-terminal residues Glu-342 and Glu-339 of NR1A (38Williams K. Casero R.A. Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 129-170Google Scholar) have all been implicated in the control of polyamine sensitivity. Mutation of these residues causes a loss or reduction in glycine-independent polyamine stimulation. Specific residues of the NR2B subunit which are involved in glycine-independent polyamine stimulation have not been reported, although we have previously localized the determinants of NR2B-specific polyamine stimulation to the NH2-terminal third of this subunit (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The current mediated by NMDA receptors is sensitive to protons in a subunit-specific manner (39Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1995; 268: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Like polyamines, proton sensitivity is altered by the presence or absence of the 5′-insert. NR1B (5′-insert present)-containing receptors show an EC50 for proton inhibition of pH 6.3, whereas NR1A (lacking insert)-containing receptors have a greater proton sensitivity (EC50 = pH of 7.3) (39Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1995; 268: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Proton inhibition depends on NR2 subunit expression, although coexpression of either NR2A or NR2B subunits with NR1A yields receptors with a half-maximal pH inhibition of 7.3; NR2C-containing receptors are insensitive to protons (half-maximal pH = 6.8) (39Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1995; 268: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The NR1A mutations (Asp-669, Glu-342, and Glu-339), implicated in glycine-independent polyamine stimulation (37Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Chao J. Igarashi K. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1131-1141PubMed Google Scholar, 38Williams K. Casero R.A. Polyamines: Regulation and Molecular Interaction. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1995: 129-170Google Scholar, 39Traynelis S.F. Hartley M. Heinemann S.F. Science. 1995; 268: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), also affect proton sensitivity, suggesting that these modulatory effects may be linked. In the present study we have probed the NR2B-specific interaction of the polyamine spermidine and protons with the NMDA receptor to understand further the allosteric modulation of these agents at the molecular level. Chimeric ε1/ε2 subunits were used to localize the NR2B-specific determinants of glycine-independent polyamine stimulation to the NH2-terminal region of NR2B. Mutation of a glutamate residue (Glu-201(ε2)) in this region altered glycine-independent polyamine stimulation. In addition, replacing the three amino acids of ε1 (MQN) with the corresponding ε2 residues (LEE) formed a subunit that partially conferred glycine-independent polyamine stimulation. This mutant showed an increase in proton sensitivity compared with wild type NR1A/ε1 receptors, further suggesting that glycine-independent polyamine stimulation may be linked to proton inhibition. Understanding the mechanism(s) of modulation of the NMDA receptor at the molecular level will provide vital information for the design of agents with higher therapeutic potential for the treatment of ischemia or other neurological diseases. Restriction enzymes and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from either Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates used in PCR applications were bought from Pharmacia. (+)MK-801 (hydrogen maleate), ifenprodil (tartrate), and NMDA were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. (+)-3-125I-MK-801 and [35S]dATPαS were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Spermidine, polyethyleneimine, and Hepes were products of Sigma. Sequencing was performed using the Sequenase II kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Female Xenopus laevis were obtained from either NASCO or Carolina Biological. Fetal bovine serum was a product of Hyclone Laboratories. Horse serum, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin were all products of Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents used were obtained from standard commercial sources. The constructions of the ε1/ε2 chimeras CH5 and CH6 were described previously (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A chimera that contains the ε2 sequence between residues 138 and 464 was constructed by replacing the corresponding sequence of ε1 between the restriction sites BamHI (414) and AflII (1393). Because there was an additional BamHI site in the 5′-untranslated region of our ε1 clone, we needed to eliminate the 5′-untranslated region. By using the primers 5UTSALP2 (5′-CCACCTTCTCCGTCGACAGGGACCCTAAGTGGC-3′), which introduces anSalI site at the immediate 5′ end of ε1, and the previously reported primer E1AFLII3 (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the first 1.3 kilobases of ε1 were synthesized by PCR (ε1 as the template). Substituting the 1.3-kilobaseSalI/AflII fragment into the parent clone yielded the plasmid pE1BAM, with a unique BamHI at base 414. The primers BamHI53 (5′-GGCAGATAAGGATCCGTCCTCCATGTTCTTC-3′) and E2AFLII3 (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were then used to amplify (by PCR) a 979-bp fragment of ε2, which could be cloned into pE1BAM at the uniqueBamHI and AflII sites, thus yielding the product CH1. Three additional chimeras were made by utilizing an NdeI site unique to the coding sequence of CH8. Unfortunately, the vector of CH8 (pRK7) contained an additional NdeI site, so the coding sequence of CH8 was subcloned into Bluescript between theSalI and EcoRI sites. A PCR fragment was obtained using the primers E1NDE153 (5′-GGTCTCATTTAGTCTCATATGACGACTGGGACTAC-3′) and E1AFLII3 (see above) with ε1 as the template. The resulting 552-bp fragment was cloned into CH8 (Bluescript) at theNdeI/AflII sites. TheSalI/AflII fragment from the resulting plasmid was subcloned back into ε1, yielding the chimera CH2. CH9 was derived from CH2 by ligating the SalI/XhoI fragment of CH1 into the same sites in CH2. Likewise, CH10 was made by ligating the SalI/XhoI fragment of CH5 into the same sites of CH2. The sequences of all chimeras were verified by double stranded dideoxy sequencing. The mutants E201A, E201D, E201N, E201R, and E200Q,E201N were constructed by PCR using 5′-mutagenic primers at the unique XhoI site (bp 595) in ε2. The primers E2E201A5 (5′-GCTTTGTGGGCTGGGAGCTCGAGGCAGTCCTCCTGCTAGAC-3′), E2E2201-D5 (5′-GCTTTGTGGGCTGGGAGCTCGAGGATGTCCTCCTCCTAGAC-3′), E2-E201N5 (5′-GGCTGGGAGCTCGAGAACGTCCTCCTGCTAGAC-3′), and E2E201R5 (5′-GCTTTGTGGGCTGGGAGCTCGAGAGGGTCCTCCTGCTAGAC), E2EENQ5 (5′-GCTTTGTGGGCTGGGAGCTCCAGAACGTCC-3′) were used with the 3′-primer E2AFLII3 to amplify the 798-bp fragment between theXhoI and AflII sites of ε2. Subcloning the fragments containing the mutations back into ε2 yielded the mutants E201A, E201D, E201N, E201R, and E200Q,E201N, respectively. The triple mutation of ε1(M200L,N201E, Q202E) was designed by introducing the mutations and anXhoI site into ε1 using the primers N202EE15 (5′-GTGGGCTGGGATCTCGAGGAGGTGATCAC-3′) and E1AFLII3 to amplify the same 798-bp region of ε1. Ligation of the fragment following digestion with XhoI and AflII back into ε1 yielded the triple mutant M200L,N201E,Q202E. HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were propagated as described previously (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with a 1:1 ratio of NR1A and either chimeric or mutant NR2 subunits by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (40Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell.

Cells were protected from NMDA receptor-mediated cell death by the addition of 10 μmMK-801 during all steps of the transfections. Cell membranes were prepared as described previously (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lynch D.R. Lawrence J.J. Lenz S.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 540-545PubMed Google Scholar). Each modulator concentration was performed in duplicate with a corresponding blank containing 10 μm cold MK-801. Membranes were incubated in saturating glycine (100 μm) and glutamate (100 μm), 300 pm125I-MK-801, and the desired concentration of either ifenprodil or spermidine for 3 h to allow the ligand to reach equilibrium. For the experiments assessing glycine effects, membranes were washed without glycine twice before incubations were commenced with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 μm glutamate, 100 μm spermidine, and the designated concentration of glycine. Membranes were harvested (Brandel Harvester) onto polyethyleneimine-coated glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and subsequently counted with a Beckman (model 5500B) γ-counter. Xenopus oocytes were prepared for injection as described previously (42Zhong J. Russell S.L. Pritchett D.B. Molinoff P.B. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 846-853PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained in ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmBaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.55 g/liter pyruvate and 50 mg/ml gentamycin. NR1A, ε2, and E201N cRNA were synthesized in vitroafter digestion with either XbaI (NR1) or EcoRI (NR2 types). Recordings were performed 2–4 days after coinjection of 1 ng of NR1A and 5 ng of ε1, ε2 or E201 mutant cRNA. Oocytes were perfused continuously with ND-96 solution (10 ml/min, 22 °C) during two electrode voltage clamp experiments. Oocytes were perfused with ND-96 supplemented with the desired concentration of drug for 1 min before inducing current with 100 μm NMDA and 100 μm glycine (identical concentration of drug included). I-V curves were performed by stepping the holding potential in −10-mV increments from −120 to +40 mV. Leak currents were subtracted in all cases. For experiments examining pH sensitivity, oocytes were equilibrated at the pH to be examined before application of agonists. Because the molecular basis for the NR2B-specific effects of polyamines is currently unknown, chimeric NR2A/NR2B subunits could be valuable tools for determining the subunit-specific interactions of these modulators. We designed six chimeric ε1(NR2A)/ε2(NR2B) subunits that, when expressed with NR1A, form intact receptors that allowed the localization of the effects of polyamines to a specific region of the NH2 terminus of NR2B. We have previously localized the determinants of glycine-independent polyamine stimulation to the NH2-terminal region between amino acids 198 and 364, using chimeras CH8, CH25, CH5, and CH6 (21Gallagher M.J. Huang H. Pritchett D.B. Lynch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9603-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the polyamine stimulation curves for chimeras CH5 and CH6 (top panel), demonstrating that the peak stimulation of 1A/CH5 receptors is approximately 80% of wild type stimulation, whereas 1A/CH6 showed only 63% wild type levels of stimulation. These and our previous studies suggested that although components downstream from amino acid 464 (perhaps in the channel region) may be important for polyamine stimulation, the region between amino acids 138 and 356 must be important for polyamine effects. Results from two additional chimeras make the localization of the stimulatory region less clear (Fig. 1, bottom panel). 1A/CH9 receptors (containing amino acids 138–238 of ε2) lacked polyamine stimulation and mimicked closely the profile of 1A/ε1 receptors. Surprisingly, the polyamine stimulation of 125I-MK-801 binding mediated by 1A/CH10 receptors (Fig.1, bottom), which possess even less NR2B sequence (amino acids 198–238), was identical to 1A/ε2 receptors. These results suggest that multiple regions of NR2B are required to form an intact polyamine stimulatory site and that tertiary and quaternary structural components must be involved in spermidine stimulation, although the region between amino acids 198 and 238 is likely to contain important determinants for NR2B-specific polyamine stimulation. Because the data from the chimera experiments implicated the region between amino acids 198 and 238 for polyamine stimulation, the protein sequences of NR2A were compared with the known NR2B sequences to search for residues in this region which were unique to NR2B. This search revealed a conserved negatively charged amino acid (Glu-201 in ε2 and NR2B) which was an asparagine (Asn-202) in both the NR2A and ε1 sequences (Fig.2 A). Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that glycine-independent polyamine stimulation preferred a negatively charged residue at amino acid 201 (Fig. 2 B). Conservation of negative charge at position 201 had a small effect on glycine-independent polyamine stimulation. 1A/E201D receptors exhibit polyamine stimulation levels that are 88% of 1A/ε2 receptors, whereas 1A/E201A receptors only exhibit 63% the level of wild type stimulation (Fig.2 B). Glycine-independent polyamine stimulation was eliminated with substitution of a positively charged amino acid (E201R). Thus, the loss of a negatively charged residue at amino acid 201 reduced polyamine stimulation, whereas substitution of a positively charged residue at this position created receptors that were inhibited by polyamines. To ensure that the effects noted were truly independent of the glycine concentration, the effects of spermidine were assessed in the presence of multiple glycine concentrations. The amount of polyamine stimulation of wild type ε2-containing receptors was unchanged by varying the glycine concentration (Fig.3, A and B). Similarly, the glycine dependence curves resulting from radioligand binding assays are identical for 1A/ε1, 1A/ε2, and 1A/E201R receptors. This further confirms that alterations in the effects of glycine cannot explain the differences seen in our study. Electrophysiological measurements of the effects of spermidine on the NMDA-induced currents in oocytes injected with NR1 and the E201 mutants were used to characterize further the voltage dependence of the observed changes in polyamine stimulation exhibited by these mutant receptors. It has been described previously that at depolarized potentials (more positive than −70 mV) polyamine stimulation is increased, whereas at more negative potentials voltage-dependent block predominates over potentiation by polyamines (27Williams K. Zappia A.M. Pritchett D.B. Shen Y.M. Molinoff P.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar). The top panel of Fig.4 shows the polyamine effects on NMDA-induced currents at a holding potential of −40 mV. At this holding potential there is a stimulation of both wild type 1A/ε2 and 1A/E201D receptors, whereas no significant stimulation was found for 1A/E201A, 1A/E201N, 1A/E201R, or 1A/ε1 receptors. At a holding potential of −110 mV (Fig.4, middle panel) all wild type and mutant receptors exhibit voltage-dependent block, suggesting that mutation of Glu-201 has no effect on the mechanism of voltage-dependent block of these receptors. Consistent with previous studies (31Williams K. Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J.I. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar), the stimulation of 1A/ε2 receptors at a holding potential of −70 mV exhibited an intermediate level of stimulation (100–125% over base line) between the results shown for −40 and −110 mV holding potentials, whereas 1A/ε1 receptors exhibited no stimulation at any of the holding potentials tested (data not shown). Polyamine stimulation increases at more acidic pH conditions (37Kashiwagi K. Fukuchi J. Chao J. Igarashi K. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1131-1141PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore studied the polyamine stimulation of both wild type and mutant receptors at a pH of 6.8 (holding potential = −70 mV) (Fig. 4, lower panel). Both 1A/ε2 and 1A/E201D receptors showed a 2–3-fold increase in glycine-independent polyamine stimulation, whereas a slight increase was seen in E201N- and E201A-containing receptors. Both 1A/E201R and 1A/ε1receptors were unaffected by the shift in pH. This provides additional evidence that glycine-independent polyamine stimulation and proton inhibition may be directly linked. Because glycine-independent polyamine stimulation may result from the relief of the tonic inhibiti"
https://openalex.org/W2074554005,"Abstract The skeletal muscle Ca2+release channel (RYR1), which plays a critical role in excitation-contraction coupling, is a homotetramer with a subunit molecular mass of 565 kDa. Oxidation of the channel increases its activity and produces intersubunit cross-links within the RYR1 tetramer (Aghdasi, B., Zhang, J., Wu, Y., Reid, M. B., and Hamilton, S. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3739–3748). Alkylation of hyperreactive sulfhydryls on RYR1 withN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibits channel function and blocks the intersubunit cross-linking. We used calpain and tryptic cleavage, two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, N-terminal sequencing, sequence-specific antibody Western blotting, and [14C]NEM labeling to identify the domains involved in these effects. Our data are consistent with a model in which 1) diamide, an oxidizing agent, simultaneously produces an intermolecular cross-link between adjacent subunits within the RYR1 tetramer and an intramolecular cross-link within a single subunit; 2) all of the cysteines involved in both cross-links are in either the region between amino acids ∼2100 and 2843 or the region between amino acids 2844 and 4685; 3) oxidation exposes a new calpain cleavage site in the central domain of the RYR1 (in the region around amino acid 2100); 4) sulfhydryls that react most rapidly with NEM are located in the N-terminal domain (between amino acids 426 and 1396); 5) alkylation of the N-terminal cysteines completely inhibits the formation of both inter- and intrasubunit cross-links. In summary, we present evidence for interactions between the N-terminal region and the putatively cytoplasmic central domains of RYR1 that appear to influence subunit-subunit interactions and channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2015201781,"Drosophila genetic studies suggest that in the Wingless (Wg) signaling pathway, the segment polarity gene products, Dishevelled (Dsh), Zeste-white 3 (ZW-3), and Armadillo (Arm), work sequentially; wg and dsh negatively regulate zw-3, which in turn down-regulatesarm. To biochemically analyze interactions between the Wg pathway and Drosophila E-cadherin (DE-cadherin) which bind to Arm, we overexpressed Dsh, ZW-3, and Arm, in theDrosophila wing disc cell line, clone 8, which responds to Wg signal. Dsh overexpression led to accumulation of Arm primarily in the cytosol and elevation of DE-cadherin at cell junctions. Overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative forms of ZW-3 decreased and increased Arm levels, respectively, indicating that modulation in zw-3 activity negatively regulates Arm levels. Overexpression of an Arm mutant with an amino-terminal deletion elevated DE-cadherin levels, suggesting that Dsh-induced DE-cadherin elevation is caused by the Arm accumulation induced by Dsh. Moreover, the Dsh-, dominant-negative ZW-3-, and truncated Arm-induced accumulation of DE-cadherin protein was accompanied by a marked increase in the steady-state levels of DE-cadherin mRNA, suggesting that transcription of DE-cadherin is activated by Wg signaling. In addition, overexpression of DE-cadherin elevated Arm levels by stabilizing Arm at cell-cell junctions.

These genes are dishevelled, zeste-white 3, and armadillo, and their order of action in the pathway has been defined by genetic and molecular studies (24Noordermeer J. Klingensmith J. Perrimon N.

Genetic and cell biological studies suggest that Wg activates Dsh through a recently characterized Wg receptor, Drosophilafrizzled 2 (38Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman-Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Dsh then negatively regulates the Ser/Thr protein kinase ZW-3, which normally stimulates the instability of Arm protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Consequently, the Wg signal stabilizes intracellular Arm, which is thought to alter the expression of the target genes of Wg such as engrailed. The vertebrate counterparts of these components of the Wg signaling cascade inDrosophila function similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway (39Klymkowsky M.W. Parr B.

BioEssays. 1993; 15: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-catenin binding to the tumor suppressor gene product APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene (45Rubinfeld B.

Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that APC can be placed between GSK3β and β-catenin in the Wnt pathway. Arm was originally discovered as the product of a segment polarity gene (48Riggleman B. Wieschaus E. Schedl P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but this protein is closely related to the mammalian protein β-catenin (49Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 50Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar), a component of intercellular adhesion junctions that binds to the intracellular domain of cadherin (51Takeichi M. Curr. Opin.

Recently, Drosophila α-catenin (Dα-catenin, 53) and DE-cadherin (54Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) have been cloned, and a cadherin-catenin cell adhesion system has been proven in Drosophila. Therefore, Arm/β-catenin is considered to have dual functions as an element of the adhesion apparatus and a transducer of the Wg/Wnt signal.In some mammalian cells, however, Wnt-1 expression up-regulates steady-state levels of plakoglobin and E-cadherin (20Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or stabilizes β-catenin and N-cadherin (21Hinck L. Nelson J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), leading to an increase in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. These findings suggest that Wnt modulates cell-cell interaction during morphogenesis by regulating the properties of cell-cell adheren junctions. In this regard, several studies of Drosophila genetics and the Wgin vitro assay using the Drosophila imaginal disc cell line, clone 8 (55van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), have shown that activation of the Wg pathway results in Arm accumulation (25Siegfried E. Wilder E. Perrimon N. Nature. 1994; 367: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 26Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Peifer M.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), indicating that DE-cadherin can be regulated by the Wg signaling cascade.In this study, we analyzed the effects of modulating components of the Wg pathway on DE-cadherin expression levels in clone 8 cells. We demonstrated that activation of the Wg pathway in clone 8 cells either directly by Wg or by the overexpression of Dsh or dominant-negative ZW-3 led to Arm accumulation and elevation of DE-cadherin protein levels. Moreover, overexpression of amino-terminal deleted Arm resulted in DE-cadherin elevation. In addition, the Dsh-, dominant-negative ZW-3, and truncated Arm-induced accumulation of DE-cadherin protein was preceded by a marked increase in the steady-state levels of DE-cadherin mRNA, suggesting that DE-cadherin induction by the Wg signaling is, at least in part, regulated at the transcriptional level.DISCUSSIONUsing a Drosophila cell culture system that responds to the Wg signal, a cDNA clone of DE-cadherin and a monoclonal antibody against DE-cadherin, we analyzed the interaction between Wg signaling and DE-cadherin expression. We overexpressed three components of the Wg signal transduction pathway, Dsh, ZW-3, and Arm, in clone 8 cells and investigated their effects on DE-cadherin levels. The effect of DE-cadherin overexpression on the levels of Arm and Dα-catenin were also analyzed. This study showed that activations of the Wg signaling pathway by overexpression of downstream components of this cascade all increase mRNA and protein levels of DE-cadherin.We showed that amino-terminal deleted but not full-length Arm protein can be overexpressed in either transient or stable transfection systems (Fig. 4). We also found that Myc-tagged full-length Arm protein accumulates when the transfectants were incubated with Wg (data not shown). These findings suggest that the NH2-terminal sequences in Arm proteins are responsible for their rapid turnover. In this regard, Yost et al. (74Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) reported that a β-catenin mutant lacking the amino-terminal region is more stable and more active in an ectopic axis induction in Xenopus embryos and that specific phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in the amino-terminal domain of the protein by GSK3β facilitates rapid degradation of β-catenin. Zecca et al. (75Zecca M. Basler K. Struhl G. Cell. 1996; 87: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) noted similar data inDrosophila. Munemitsu et al. (76Munemitsu S. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Plakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also noted deletion of an amino-terminal sequence stabilizes β-catenin in cultured mammalian cells. Moreover, Morin et al. (77Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar) found a special class of mutant β-catenins that eliminate the specific amino acids that become phosphorylated by GSK3β. These mutant β-catenins escape GSK3/APC-mediated degradation and thus accumulate in high levels and function as oncogenic proteins in colon carcinoma cell lines with normal levels of wild-type APC. The amino-terminal deleted Arm protein used in this experiment may be stabilized by a similar mechanism because these specific amino acid residues of the ZW-3 kinase target are conserved in the amino-terminal domain of Arm.Compared with clone 8 cells, we did not detect obvious morphological changes in cells transfected with Dsh, a dominant-negative ZW-3 or truncated Arm constructs, even after induction with CuSO4. However, the induced DE-cadherin transfectants formed firm cell aggregates in which individual cells made tight cell-cell junctions. Fig. 8 shows that the accumulation of DE-cadherin in cells overexpressing Dsh and DE-cadherin (Fig. 6, C andE) actually increases cadherin-dependent cell adhesivity.Fig. 5 shows the DE-cadherin induced modulation of Arm and Dα-catenin. Our findings were in agreement with those of the following studies. Oda et al. (54Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of DE-cadherin results in increases of Arm and Dα-catenin in Schneider S2 cells. Uemura et al.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 672-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) also showed that Arm and Dα-catenin levels are significantly reduced in the embryonic epidermis of shotgunnull mutant embryos.Oda et al. (54Oda H. Uemura T. Harada Y. Iwai Y. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 716-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and Uemura et al. (78Uemura T. Oda H. Kraut R. Hayashi S. Kataoka Y. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) compared lateral views of stage 10 embryos stained for DE-cadherin and Arm. They confirmed that Arm accumulated at high levels in the area of Wg expression. Thus, Arm was stained in a repeated segment manner. However, the uniform staining of the embryos with anti-DE-cadherin suggests that distribution of DE-cadherin is uniform in the embryos and that Arm accumulation cannot induce an increase in DE-cadherin protein at least in the epidermis of the extended germ band stage embryos. This finding seems incompatible with our in vitro data from clone 8 cells. However, it seems that fluctuations in Arm protein levels sharply affect DE-cadherin levels in clone 8 cells, which contain a very limited amount of DE-cadherin, but not in the embryonic epidermis where DE-cadherin is highly expressed. Wg signaling-dependent DE-cadherin regulation (either transcriptional or post-transcriptional) is probably operative in embryonic epidermis, but this regulation mechanism may be overwhelmed by other Wg-independent regulations of DE-cadherin in these cells. In this regard, Hinck et al. (21Hinck L. Nelson J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) noted that Wnt-1 expression results in the induced accumulation of β-catenin and N-cadherin in AtT 20 cells and C57MG cells, whereas Wnt-1 has no effect on the modulation of cadherin-catenin levels in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that express very high levels of cadherin and catenins and thus show tight cell-cell adhesion in the presence of calcium. It is also of interest to see whether DE-cadherin levels in zw-3 mutant embryos are increased because very high levels of Arm accumulate in these mutant embryos compared with the wild type (33Siegfried E. Chou T.-B. Perrimon N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1167-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).Hinck et al. (21Hinck L. Nelson J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and Bradley et al. (20Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Wnt-1 expression in some mammalian cultured cells leads to increases in the steady-state levels of β-catenin and plakoglobin (another vertebrate Arm homologue) and elevated E- or N-cadherin, resulting in a concomitant increase in the strength of calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. They demonstrated that the elevation of cadherin was primarily caused by stabilization of this protein by complex formation with β-catenin or plakoglobin. Thus, they did not analyze the effect of Wnt-1 expression on cadherin mRNA levels. We have shown in this study that modulation of the more downstream components of Wg pathway, Dsh, ZW-3, and Arm can induce up-regulation of DE-cadherin. We cannot rule out the possibility that Dsh- and dominant-negative ZW-3-induced elevation of cytoplasmic Arm also increases DE-cadherin·Arm complex formation on the plasma membrane, which leads to DE-cadherin stabilization. This post-translational mechanism may partly contribute to the DE-cadherin accumulation induced by Dsh and dominant-negative ZW-3 overexpression. However, a major new insight of this study is that the DE-cadherin protein accumulation induced by overexpression of Dsh, dominant-negative ZW-3, and deleted Arm is preceded by elevation of steady-state levels of DE-cadherin mRNA that probably leads to increased DE-cadherin protein synthesis. Furthermore, elevation of cytoplasmic pools of amino-terminal deleted Arm alone induce DE-cadherin mRNA levels, supporting the idea that DE-cadherin mRNA accumulation observed in cells overexpressing Dsh and a dominant-negative ZW-3 is caused by Arm elevation induced by overexpression of these proteins. To address whether overexpression of these proteins activates DE-cadherin transcription, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays with the DE-cadherin promoter region are now underway. If transcriptional activation occurs, the transcription factor(s) that seems modulated by elevated cytoplasmic pools of Arm may be characterized using gel shift assays with the DE-cadherin promoter region.

https://openalex.org/W2112979020,"Kinase-related protein, also known as KRP or telokin, is an independently expressed protein product derived from a gene within the gene for myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). KRP binds to unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin filaments and stabilizes them against ATP-induced depolymerization in vitro. KRP competes with MLCK for binding to myosin, suggesting that both proteins bind to myosin by the KRP domain (Shirinsky, V. P., Vorotnikov, A. V., Birukov, K. G., Nanaev, A. K., Collinge, M., Lukas, T. J., Sellers, J. R., and Watterson, D. M. (1993)J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16578–16583). In this study, we investigated which regions of myosin and KRP interact in vitro. Using cosedimentation assays, we determined that KRP binds to unphosphorylated myosin with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of KRP/1 mol of myosin and an affinity of 5.5 μm. KRP slows the rate of proteolytic cleavage of the head-tail junction of heavy meromyosin by papain and chymotrypsin, suggesting it is binding to this region of myosin. In addition, competition experiments, using soluble headless fragments of nonmuscle myosin, confirmed that KRP interacts with the regulatory light chain binding region of myosin. The regions important for KRP's binding to myosin were investigated using bacterially expressed KRP truncation mutants. We determined that the acid-rich sequence between Gly138 and Asp151 of KRP is required for high affinity myosin binding, and that the amino terminus and β-barrel regions weakly interact with myosin. All KRP truncations, at concentrations comparable to theirK D values, exhibited some stabilization of myosin filaments against ATP depolymerization in vitro, suggesting that KRP's ability to stabilize myosin filaments is commensurate with its myosin binding affinity. KRP weakened the K mbut not the V max of phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK, demonstrating that bound KRP does not prevent MLCK from activating myosin.

In resting smooth muscle, myosin exists in a predominantly dephosphorylated and inactive state (1Somlyo A.V. Butler T.M. Bond M. Somlyo A.P. Nature. 1981; 294: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and contraction is initiated by a calcium-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; ELC, essential light chain; HMM, heavy meromyosin; LMM, light meromyosin; S1, subfragment-1; S2, subfragment-2; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated kinase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin protein; KRP, kinase-related protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. of myosin by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (2Murphy R.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In vitro, phosphorylation of myosin activates its MgATPase activity in the presence of actin and also allows myosin to translocate actin filaments (3Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando1987: 381-418Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also affects the equilibrium between filamentous and monomeric myosins in vitro (4Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filaments formed from unphosphorylated myosin are dissociated by MgATP into a monomeric form of myosin in which the tail forms a hairpin fold back onto the neck region of the myosin head. This folded monomeric myosin has been termed “10 S” myosin based on its sedimentation coefficient in the analytical ultracentrifuge, while phosphorylated monomeric myosin exists primarily in an extended conformation, called “6 S” (5Craig R. Smith R. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1983; 302: 436-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vivo, smooth muscle myosin filaments appear to be stable even under conditions where myosin is predominantly unphosphorylated (1Somlyo A.V. Butler T.M. Bond M. Somlyo A.P.

The discrepancy between myosin's filamentous state in vivo and in vitro may be explained by the presence of regulatory proteins, which stabilize unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin filaments in vivo. One candidate for such a protein is an abundant myosin-binding protein, termed kinase-related protein (KRP) and also referred to as telokin. KRP binds to unphosphorylated myosin filaments in vitro and stabilizes them against MgATP-dependent depolymerization (10Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KRP binds tightly to the heavy meromyosin (HMM), but not to the subfragment-1 (S1) or rod domains of myosin, suggesting that KRP's binding site is in the S1-S2 region of myosin. In addition, KRP may prevent myosin from adopting the 10 S conformation, by competing for the region on myosin where the tail folds over, which is thought to include the RLC binding site (11Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The gene encoding KRP is nested within the gene for MLCK, and, in fact, the 157-residue sequence of KRP is completely identical to the sequence of the carboxyl terminus of MLCK (12Collinge M. Matrisian P.E. Zimmer W.E. Shattuck R.L. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23945-23952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western analyses estimate that in avian gizzard smooth muscle, KRP is abundant compared with MLCK, and is approximately stoichiometric with myosin (10Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is likely that MLCK interacts with myosin primarily by its KRP domain, since KRP and MLCK compete for myosin binding and a truncated MLCK that lacks the KRP domain cannot bind myosin as well as intact MLCK (10Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of KRP has been solved and shows that the protein is a seven-stranded C2 immunoglobulin-like β-barrel with trailing arms at either end (15Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal 35 amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids were not resolved in the crystal structure, suggesting that they are in an unstructured or flexible conformation. The amino terminus contains two putative sites for phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent kinase (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (16Vorotnikov A.V. Silver D.L. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 17 (abstr.): 153aGoogle Scholar), while the carboxyl terminus is distinguished by a high content of acidic residues. To determine the sites of interaction between KRP and myosin, we have quantified KRP binding to myosin and examined its interaction with various proteolytic and recombinant fragments of myosin. We show that KRP binds at the RLC region of the myosin heavy chain, probably where the two heads join to form the rod region of myosin. We have expressed amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants of KRP and studied their binding to myosin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the acidic carboxyl terminus of KRP is important for high affinity myosin binding and subsequent stabilization of myosin filaments. Finally, we show that KRP affects the K m, but not theV max for phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK. Some of these data have been presented in preliminary form (17Silver D.L. Vorotnikov A.V.

KRP was expressed in bacteria using a nonmuscle MLCK cDNA clone corresponding to nucleotides 3966–4436 of cDNA sequence. KRP truncations were created by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers containing 5′NcoI restriction sites (including ATG) and 3′XhoI restriction sites. Primers are listed below 5′ to 3′: 1, TAATCCTCGAGATCTTCTTCTCCTTC; 2, TAACCCTCGAGCATTGTTTCCACAAGGAG; 3, AAGCCATGGCCTCTGGGAGCTCGC; 4, AAATCCATGGCAGACAAAGTAGAGAAC; 5, AAGAACCATGGTGGCTGAGGAAAAGCCC; 6, TTAACTCGAGTTCTTCCTCCTCCTCTTC; 7, CCATGGCAATGATTTCTGGTATG; 8, CATCCATGGTAAAGCCATACTTTAC; 9, TTGTCTCGAGTTCCACAAGGAGTTCTGC. The primers were used in the following combinations: truncation 1 (3 and 6), 2 (4 and 6), 3 (5 and 6), 4 (7 and 1), 5 (7 and 2), 6 (5 and 2), 7 (8 and 9), 8 (7 and 6). PCR was performed using a Perkin Elmer PCR System 9600 (Foster City, CA). PCR products were cut with NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) and gel-purified (Qiaex extraction kit, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). A bacterial expression vector, pET 21-d+ (Novagen, Madison, WI), was used for the expression of KRP cDNA. The truncations were ligated intoNcoI and XhoI sites downstream of a ribosome binding site and upstream from a 6-histidine tag and stop codon. As a result of subcloning, artificial sequences coding for two amino acids, leucine and glutamic acid, were inserted directly upstream to the histidine tag. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced expression of the constructs in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strains was performed according to the Novagen pET system protocol (Madison, WI). Cell pellets from a 1-liter culture were brought up in 10 ml of cold binding buffer (5 mm imidazole (pH 7.9), 0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl) and either used immediately for purification or frozen at −20 °C. Bacterial extracts were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.10 mm leupeptin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% of each of the following: chymostatin, pepstatin,N α -p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride, andN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. Following brief sonication and centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The supernatant (10 ml) was applied to a 3.0-ml bed volume TALON metal affinity column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which has a high affinity for recombinant 6-His-tagged proteins. After extensive washing with 10 volumes of binding buffer, the protein was eluted using 2 volumes of elution buffer (binding buffer containing a final concentration of 60 mm imidazole). The column was stripped of remaining protein using binding buffer containing 1 mimidazole and was reused. Protein fractions were analyzed electrophoretically, pooled, concentrated using Aquacide (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), and dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 3 mm DTT). Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometerically (Beckman, Columbia, MD). For KRP, the following extinction coefficients were calculated according to Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar): 0.74, 0.73, 0.77, 0.85, 0.73, 0.78, 0.99, 1.08, and 0.69, for tissue-purified KRP and truncations 1–8, respectively. Binding affinity and stoichiometry of wild type KRP were determined by using PKA-phosphorylated [32P]KRP (tissue-purified). [32P]KRP was prepared by incubation of 0.3 mg/ml KRP with 15 μg/ml PKA, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 10 mm DTT, for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by exhaustive dialysis against buffer A. Varying concentrations of myosin and [32P]KRP were incubated in 50 μl of buffer A for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 436,000 ×g for 10 min at 25 °C in a TLA 100 rotor in the Optima TLX ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Pellets were counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6001, Columbia, MD) and mol of [32P]KRP bound/mol of myosin was determined. The binding affinity and stoichiometry were calculated by fitting the data to the equation: b = (B max +S)/(K D + S), whereS = concentration of [32P]KRP,B max = mol of [32P]KRP/mol of myosin, and K D = dissociation constant. For bacterially expressed KRP truncations, nonradioactive samples were incubated and cosedimented as above, with myosin and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was used as a volume marker for the pellet. Binding was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The supernatants (40 μl) were removed and added to 10 μl of 5 × Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and DTT, boiled, and electrophoresed. The pellets were rinsed in buffer A, resuspended in 25 μl of 1 × sample buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 dye, destained, and scanned on a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After correcting for the H2O volume of the pellets by measurement of BSA, the mol of KRP bound/mol of myosin was quantitated by densitometry and the data were fit to the equation described above. For competition experiments, soluble nonmuscle myosin fragments (ranging from 1–6 molar excess) were added to smooth muscle myosin and recombinant KRP (1:3 molar ratio), in 50 μl of buffer A for 15 min at 25 °C. Cosedimentation and densitometry, as described above, were utilized to identify a depletion of KRP from the pellet. Percent competition was calculated by the proportion of KRP bound to myosin in the presence of soluble fragments versus KRP bound to myosin in their absence. For papain digestions, 5 μm HMM was incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μm KRP in buffer A at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 200 units of papain/mg of myosin (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) in papain activating solution (0.1m NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) Time points were collected every 30 s for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped with 20 mmiodoacetic acid. Samples were added to 2 × sample buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were quantitated by densitometry, and the digestion was monitored by the relative amount of S2 produced at each time point. Data were generated from four experiments. For chymotrypsin digestions, 3.7 μm HMM was incubated with 22 μm KRP in buffer A (without ATP) at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) to a 1:20 ratio (w/w) of protease to HMM, and time points were collected at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 min. The digestion was terminated with 1 mm PMSF. Samples were electrophoresed and quantitated by densitometry (NIH Image, Bethesda, MD) of the amount of RLC digested, with normalization to undigested essential light chain (ELC). Data were generated from three experiments. The protection of myosin filaments against ATP-depolymerization by KRP truncations was monitored by measurement of the (NH4)+EDTA-ATPase activities of soluble myosin. Myosin purified from chicken gizzards was used for these experiments, as this source of myosin was consistently soluble upon addition of 2 mm MgATP (>95%). Myosin filaments were prepared by dialysis against 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmEGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 3 mm DTT. 3 μm myosin filaments and 15 μm KRP truncations were incubated in buffer A brought to 100 mmNaCl in the presence of 2 mm MgATP, and cosedimented as above. Following centrifugation, 5 μl of the supernatants was added to the following ATPase mixture: 0.4 mNH4Cl2, 35 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 2 mmMOPS, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mg/ml BSA. The rate of phosphate release was measured at 25 °C over 15 min according to Sellers et al. (20Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were measured in duplicate, and the percent of soluble myosin was determined by normalization to the myosin control without KRP. HMM, ranging in concentration from 1 to 18 μm, was phosphorylated in buffer A with 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 1 nmMLCK, according to the procedure of Sellers et al. (20Sellers J.R. Eisenberg E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13880-13883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of 50 μm KRP. The values forK m and V max were determined from fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Enzfitter, London, United Kingdom). Studies of KRP binding to myosin were performed by a cosedimentation assay, using conditions in which KRP is soluble and myosin is filamentous and sedimentable. KRP has two sites for phosphorylation by PKA and MAPK, respectively. PKA-phosphorylated KRP has the same binding capacity as unphosphorylated KRP (16Vorotnikov A.V. Silver D.L. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. Shirinsky V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 17 (abstr.): 153aGoogle Scholar). Therefore, [32P]KRP was used in binding studies to determine KRP's binding affinity and stoichiometry of binding to myosin. The K D was 5.5 μm, and a stoichiometry of 1.10 mol of KRP/mol of myosin molecule was determined (Fig. 1). Previous experiments showed that KRP binds well to unphosphorylated HMM, but not to the S1 or rod domains of myosin (10Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of KRP to protect myosin against ATP-induced depolymerization in vitrosuggested that KRP may prevent myosin from adopting the 10 S (folded) conformation, which is thought to occur by binding of the rod of myosin to its S1-S2 junction (6Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6151-6155Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Olney J.J. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We examined whether KRP binds to this site by using proteolytic protection assays. Papain will proteolytically digest HMM into S1 and S2 fragments (25Sellers J.R. Soboeiro M.S. Faust K. Bengur A.R. Harvey E.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6977-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A depicts a time course of this reaction in the presence and absence of KRP. Inclusion of KRP retarded the rate of papain digestion of the heavy chain of HMM and also inhibited the rate of proteolysis of the RLC. In Fig. 2 B, this effect is quantified as the proportion of S2 produced over time. KRP also afforded protection of the RLC of HMM against chymotrypsin digestion (Fig. 2 C). In both experiments, KRP itself was not digested, indicating that it was not merely acting as a competitor for proteolysis by the enzymes. KRP protection of myosin against proteolysis suggested that it bound to the S1-S2 junction of myosin. Since KRP bound similarly to nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosins (data not shown), we used nonmuscle myosin fragments containing this region in competition binding experiments, to more precisely localize KRP's binding site. Soluble headless fragments of nonmuscle myosin IIB corresponding to S2, S2 and bound RLC, and S2 and bound RLC and ELC were prepared by baculovirus expression (Fig. 3 A). The soluble fragments were included in cosedimentation assays with smooth muscle myosin and KRP, and the depletion of KRP from the pellet indicated competitive binding to the soluble fragment. The two constructs containing the RLC binding site competed strongly with myosin for KRP binding, while S2 alone did not compete as well, indicating a weaker interaction with KRP (Fig. 3 B). Truncation mutants of KRP were made by PCR of a nonmuscle MLCK cDNA template. The truncations were designed based upon the crystal structure previously determined (15Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the primary structure, as shown in Fig.4 (A and B). The three-dimensional structure of KRP consists of a core seven-stranded β-barrel with a C2-type IgG motif. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails, containing amino acids 1–35 and 138–157, respectively, were not resolved in the crystal structure, presumably due to their flexibility. The consensus sites for phosphorylation by PKA and MAPK are found within the amino terminus, and an acid-rich domain characterizes the carboxyl terminus (13 of 17 residues are acidic). Truncations were created to understand the significance of these regions for myosin binding and stabilization properties in vitro. Fig. 5 A is a schematic representation of the expressed truncations, and their migration on a 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel is shown in Fig. 5 B. Since preparations of truncations 5, 6, and 7 consistently migrated as more than one band, the integrity of these truncations was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. This method revealed the expected sequences with only a methionine missing in some cases, suggesting that the extra bands may be due to intramolecular bonds (data not shown).Figure 5Bacterial expression of KRP mutant truncations.

The binding affinities (K D, dissociation constant) of the KRP truncations are indicated in Table I. Truncation of the first 23 residues at the amino terminus, K(12–157) and K(23–157), did not affect myosin binding, while truncation of the first 36 residues, K(36–157), weakened the binding slightly. Truncation of 7 residues at the carboxyl terminus, K(1–150), also did not affect binding affinity, whereas removal of 19 residues at the carboxyl terminus, K(1–138), weakened KRP binding by about 5-fold. The smallest truncations, representing the amino acids resolved in the crystal structure, K(36–138), and the core β-barrel, K(43–136), also had weaker binding affinities.Table IThe carboxyl terminus of KRP is significant for myosin binding and filament stabilization in vitroKRP constructKRP binding (K D)Filament stabilityμm% solubleWT9.513 ± 3.01K (12–157)12.25 ± 2.02K (23–157)13.77 ± 2.03K (36–157)27.517 ± 6.04K (1–150)7.318 ± 5.05K (1–138)46.067 ± 8.06K (36–138)42.559 ± 3.07K (43–136)62.080 ± 9.0The binding of KRP to myosin and the stabilization of myosin filaments to MgATP-dependent depolymerization were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The KRP and myosin concentrations in the filament stabilization assays were 15 and 5 μm, respectively. Open table in a new tab The binding of KRP to myosin and the stabilization of myosin filaments to MgATP-dependent depolymerization were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The KRP and myosin concentrations in the filament stabilization assays were 15 and 5 μm, respectively. KRP truncations (15 μm) exhibited a similar pattern in their abilities to protect against the depolymerization of myosin (3 μm) by MgATP in vitro. All three amino-terminal KRP truncations, K(12–157), K(23–157), and K(36–157), stabilized myosin filaments like wild type KRP. However, all of the carboxyl-terminal truncations, K(1–138), K(36–138), and K(43–136) which lack the acidic region, failed to stabilize myosin filaments (Table I). Increasing the concentration of these weaker binding truncation mutants to levels where binding was comparable toK D led to further stabilization. For example, inclusion of 60 μm of K(1–138) and K(36–138) left 45% and 18% myosin soluble, respectively. The relative abilities of KRP truncations to stabilize myosin filaments in vitro appears to be proportional to their binding affinities. Altogether the data confirm that KRP binds myosin with high affinity by its acidic tail and weakly interacts with myosin by its amino terminus and core β-barrel. The evidence presented above suggests that KRP binds to the S1-S2 junction, probably in the vicinity of the phosphorylatable residue on the RLC and that this region is likely the same site to which MLCK binds. This raises the possibility that KRP might act as a competitive inhibitor of RLC phosphorylation. To directly examine this prospect, the steady state kinetics of phosphorylation of HMM was measured in the absence and presence of a near saturating concentration of KRP (50 μm). The data show that KRP increases theK m for phosphorylation approximately 10-fold, but does not dramatically affect the V max (Fig.6). A knowledge of the binding sites between KRP and myosin is necessary for understanding how KRP stabilizes myosin filaments and elucidating the structural and functional relationships between MLCK and KRP. The question of how KRP binds myosin was especially intriguing to address because of the shared structural motifs in KRP and MLCK. The predominant structure of KRP is a seven-stranded C2-type immunoglobulin (IgG)-like motif (15Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino- and carboxyl termini of KRP, which were not resolved in the crystal structure, are also characterized by interesting sequences, including phosphorylation sites at the amino terminus of KRP (16Vorotnikov A.V.

https://openalex.org/W2159072739,"T cell receptor signaling results both in T cell proliferation and apoptosis. A key enzyme at the intersection of these downstream pathways is phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3-kinase). In a previous report, we showed that the p85α subunit of the PI 3-kinase preferentially associated with the CD3-ζ membrane-proximal immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif of the ζ chain (ζA-ITAM) (Exley, M., Varticovski, L., Peter, M., Sancho, J., and Terhorst, C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 15140–15146). Here, we demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3-ε can recruit the PI 3-kinase enzyme in a T cell activation-dependent manner. In vivostudies with Jurkat cells stably transfected with a CD8-CD3-ε chimera (termed CD8-ε) shows that ligation of endogenous CD3-ε or CD8-ε by specific antibodies induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3-ε or CD8-ε, respectively. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with increased binding of p85α PI 3-kinase and recruitment of PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity to CD3-ε or CD8-ε proteins. Mutagenesis studies in COS-7 cells, transiently transfected with CD8-ε, p85α, and Fyn cDNAs in various combinations, show that both Tyr170 and Tyr181 within the CD3-ε-ITAM are required for efficient binding of p85α PI 3-kinase. Thus, replacement of Tyr170 by Phe (Y170F), or Tyr181 by Phe (Y181F) significantly reduces binding of p85α PI 3-kinase, whereas it does not affect binding of Fyn. Further in vitroexperiments suggest that a direct binding of the tandem SH2 domains of p85α PI 3-kinase to the two phosphorylated tyrosines in a single CD3-ε-ITAM may occur. The data also support a model in which a single CD3 subunit can recruit distinct effector molecules by means of TCR-mediated differential ITAM phosphorylation.

The program of early responses to antigen-receptor activation proceeds as follows. Rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation precedes phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-γ1 activation, elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+, Ras-GTP accumulation, and activation of serine/threonine kinases (4Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). T cell activation culminates in cell division and induction of effector functions such as interleukin-2 secretion and cytolytic activity. Since none of the TCR·CD3 subunits have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the earliest biochemical events are mediated by Lck and Fyn that associate with the CD4·CD8 and the TCR·CD3 complex, respectively (5Veillette A.

The individual cytoplasmic tails of the CD3 complex are necessary and sufficient for transduction of activating stimuli. The signal transduction function of the CD3 complex has been mapped to small sequence motifs, originally defined by Reth (15Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). This motif, termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), contains consensus sequence around two characteristic tyrosine residues spaced by 10 or 11 amino acids (YXX(L/I)X 7–8YXX(L/I)). There are three ITAMs within the ζ chain, ζA, ζB, and ζC, and one ITAM in each CD3 chain, ε, δ, and γ. The presence of distinct motifs in individual cells offers the potential for regulation of activation pathways with different specificities and consequences (16Wegener A.-M.K. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Motifs from different receptor subunits have partially distinct binding activity, consistent with their activation of distinct sets of effectors. The distinct selectivity of ITAMs for effector binding indicates that they may drive at least distinct biological responses (17Cambier J.C. Johnson S.A. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 44: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ITAMs contain structural information necessary for signal transduction, and they are rapidly tyrosine-phosphorylated on both tyrosines following receptor stimulation (7Baniyash M.

The ability of phosphorylated CD3 cytoplasmic tails to transduce mitogenic signals is based on specific recruitment of signaling molecules. One candidate for signal transducing molecule is PI 3-kinase. This enzyme phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of PI, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2 (19Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit (p110) (20Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

PI 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85 has an N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) region, two SH2 domains, and a domain with significant sequence homology to the product of the breakpoint cluster region gene (21Fry M.J.

Although the downstream effectors of the phosphoinositide 3-phosphates generated by the enzyme are not well characterized, it has been shown that they activate protein kinase Cζ, a non-calcium/diacylglycerol-regulated isoform of protein kinase C, and the RAC (related to the A and C kinases) serine threonine kinase (24Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition, PI 3-kinase products have been implicated in regulation of multiple cellular events, such as vesicular trafficking, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and mitogenesis. T cell activation results in association of PI 3-kinase with the TCR and an increase in levels of 3′-phosphorylated polyphosphoinositides (1Exley M. Varticovski L. Peter M. Sancho J. Terhorst C. J.

In this study, we report association of p85α PI 3-kinase with the CD3-ε, which is dependent on phosphorylation of the two tyrosine residues of the CD3-ε-ITAM. The data support a model of TCR-mediated activation in which the extent of CD3-ε phosphorylation may serve to recruit distinct SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins. Jurkat human T cells (ATCC) were used. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FCS (BioWhittaker), penicillin, streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine. Jurkat T cells were stably transfected by electroporation with the cDNA coding the CD8-ε chimera, and clones were selected by growth in media with neomycin. Clones were screened for surface expression of the chimera by staining with anti-CD8 (OKT8) antibody and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. COS-7 monkey kidney epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and sodium pyruvate minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase conjugate RC20 (E120H, Transduction Laboratories); anti-p85 PI 3-kinase subunit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-Shc pAb (Transduction Laboratories); anti-Cbl and anti-Fyn polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-human Lck rabbit polyclonal antibody (against carboxyl terminus; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-ZAP70 polyclonal antibody ZAP-4 (generously donated by Dr. Steven C. Ley, Medical Research Council, London); affinity-purified anti-CD3-ε anti-peptide polyclonal antibody (Dako); and anti-Grb-2 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) were used. Affinity-purified OKT3 mAb and OKT8 mAb were obtained from tissue culture supernatant of OKT3 and OKT8 hybridomas acquired from ATCC. For the construction of CD8-ε, 670- and 168-base pair cDNA fragments representing the human CD8α ecto/transmembrane and the mouse CD3-ε cytoplasmic domains, respectively, were amplified and then annealed at overlapping ends, filled in, and further amplified to produce the chimera. The chimera CD8-ε was generated by the polymerase chain reaction technique using the complete cDNA of human CD8α in pCD8α/pink2 (26Howard F.D. Moingeon P. Moebius U. McConkey D.J. Yandava B. Gennert T.E. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp.

To amplify the fragment of base pairs 481–648 of murine CD3-ε cytoplasmic domain, the murine CD3-ε cDNA in pDL1 (27Gold D.P. Clevers H. Alarcon B. Dunlap S. Novotny J. Williams A.F. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The products of both polymerase chain reactions were annealed by another polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction fragments were then digested with HindIII and BamHI and inserted in vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). This construct was used as a template to make mutants with Y170F and with Y181F. Primary sequences were verified by dideoxysequencing. Full-length cDNA encoding murine c-FynT were previously described (28Hall C.G. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Science. 1993; 261: 915-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); p85α cDNA was generously donated by Dr. C. Rudd (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston) (29Raab M. Cai Y.-C. Bunnell S.C.

The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase procedure using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) amino acids (30Chang C.D. Meinhofer J. Int. J. Pept.

Soc. 1975; 97: 6584-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) on a Ranin Symphony peptide synthesizer. The initial residue was linked to ap-alkoxybenzyl alcohol resin providing a C-terminal carboxyl group. The peptides were deblocked and cleaved from the resin by a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/ethanedithiol/anisol (9:0.5:0.3:0.2) to minimize side reactions. The individual peptides were precipitated from the trifluoroacetic acid cleavage mixture with diethylether and washed several times with cold ether to remove impurities generated by the cleavage reaction. Peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The synthetic peptides were chemically coupled via N-terminal Cys with maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce) tol-Lys-Sepharose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Coupling efficiency was monitored by determining the degree of binding of anti-peptide and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to the peptide affinity matrices as described (1Exley M. Varticovski L. Peter M. Sancho J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were serum-starved by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% FCS. Cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm phenylarsine oxide, protease inhibitors (antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) at 1 μg/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm iodoacetamide. After two preclearings with Lys-Sepharose, lysates were incubated with CD3-ε peptide affinity matrices for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice in solution A (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate), twice in solution B (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) and once in solution C (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Jurkat CD8-ε cells were serum starved by incubating for 4 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 with 0.1% FCS. Cells were washed and resuspended at 107 cells/100 μl in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before activation. Jurkat cells were then incubated with anti-receptor mAb (5 μg/107 cells) at 37 °C for 5 min. In indicated experiments, secondary antibody was used to further cross-link the receptors, e.g. goat anti-mouse IgG (whole molecule) or the F(ab′)2 fragments (Cappel). The concentration of the secondary antibody used for activation was 20 μg/107cells. In the latter case, cells were stimulated with the anti-receptor mAb for 2 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of secondary antibody for an additional 3 min at 37 °C. Lysis was carried out as described above. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations with mAbs OKT3 and OKT8, 5 μg/107cells of Ab were bound to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C after one preclearing with bovine serum albumin-Sepharose 1 h at 4 °C. Washes before loading were carried out as described previously. COS-7 cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μg/107cells of mAb OKT8 and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C after one preclearing with normal mouse serum (Sigma) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 1 h at 4 °C. COS-7 cells (10 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of expression vectors, containing the appropriate cDNA insert, by the DEAE-Dextran method (32Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1995)Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Suppl. 17, 16.13.1, John Wiley Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and lysed in a lysis buffer as described above. Aliquots of these lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with Abs to Fyn, p85α PI 3-kinase, and CD3-ε to confirm protein expression. In transfected cells, surface expression of the CD8-ε chimera was analyzed by flow cytometry with OKT8 antibody. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.). Filters were probed with specific antibodies as described previously (8Sancho J. Franco R. Chatila T. Hall C. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For detection, anti-mouse IgG (H+L) or anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Promega) were used followed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For anti-Tyr(P) Western blot, membranes were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Corp.). For stripping and reprobing, membranes were incubated for 10 min in stripping buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 2.3) at room temperature. Membranes were then washed for 3 × 10 min in TNA-Tween and reblocked. The PI 3-kinase assay was performed as described (33Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were prepared as above and incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, with OKT3 or with OKT8 and protein A-Sepharose. PI 3-kinase activity immobilized on beads was measured using PI and phosphatidylinositol biphosphate substrates. Reaction products were extracted and subjected to thin layer chromatography. PI 3-kinase activity was quantified by scintillation counting of 32P incorporated into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate. Results were expressed as net counts/min following background subtraction. In Jurkat and Jurkat CD8-ε cells, stimulation of the TCR·CD3 or CD8-ε receptors induces the association of p85α PI 3-kinase with the phosphorylated forms of CD3-ε and CD8-ε.We have previously shown that in vitro PI 3-kinase preferentially associates with the membrane-proximal ITAM of the ζ chain (ζA-ITAM). Maximal PI 3-kinase activity is recovered following TCR·CD3 activation and is dependent upon phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues of the ζA-ITAM (1Exley M. Varticovski L. Peter M. Sancho J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A chimera composed of the extracellular domain of CD8 and the cytoplasmic domain of CD3-ε (termed CD8-ε) was constructed to determine in vivowhether the intracellular domain of CD3-ε chain was capable of associating with the p85 PI 3-kinase independently of the presence of the other TCR·CD3 subunits. To this end, the CD8-ε chimera was stably transfected in Jurkat cells expressing the wild-type TCR·CD3 complex (hereafter termed Jurkat CD8-ε cells or JCD8-ε cells) and stimulated by the addition of the anti-CD8 mAb OKT8 alone or further cross-linked with a secondary antibody against mouse immunoglobulins (GαmIg). In these cells, the overall pattern of OKT8-induced substrate tyrosine phosphorylation was similar, although somewhat weaker, than that induced after TCR stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (data not shown). Regarding tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD8-ε chimera, in unstimulated cells or cells stimulated with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody alone, a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD8-ε was observed (Fig.1 A, lanes 5 and6), which was higher than the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous CD3-ε (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, the level of CD8-ε tyrosine phosphorylation induced upon stimulation of the chimera with anti-CD8 antibodies was similar to that observed in endogenous CD3-ε upon stimulation with the anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 7 and 8 with lanes 3 and4). Despite that, more tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins seemed to co-immunoprecipitate with CD3-ε than with CD8-ε (Fig.1 A, compare lane 4 with lane 8). Therefore, evidence clearly demonstrates that both the CD8-ε chimera and endogenous CD3-ε result in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to receptor ligation. To test in these cells whether an interaction between CD8-ε and p85 PI 3-kinase may occur in vivo, we reblotted the filter with an anti-p85α PI 3-kinase antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, p85 PI 3-kinase was weakly detected in OKT8 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated or GαmIg-stimulated Jurkat CD8-ε cells (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6). This association was highly increased in OKT8 immunoprecipitates from OKT8- or OKT8 plus GαmIg-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and8). The basal level of association of p85 PI 3-kinase to CD8-ε in nonstimulated and secondary antibody-stimulated cells (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6) could be due to the higher basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD8-ε as compared with that of endogenous CD3-ε (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 5 and 6 with lanes 1 and2). Thus, p85α PI 3-kinase was not detected in OKT3 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated Jurkat CD8-ε cells or from cells exposed to secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas p85α was readily co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CD3-ε when Jurkat CD8-ε cells were stimulated with OKT3 or OKT3 plus the secondary antibody p85α (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Altogether, these results suggest a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for p85 PI 3-kinase binding to the intracellular domain of CD3-ε, in which none of the other CD3 chains seems to play a role. To test whether PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity was detected in association with the cytoplasmic tail of CD3-ε, we performed kinase reactions on OKT8 or OKT3 immunoprecipitates from Jurkat CD8-ε cells stimulated with anti-CD8 mAb OKT8 or with anti-CD3 mAb OKT3, respectively (Fig.2). In agreement with the p85α immunoblot studies, an increase in PI 3-kinase activity associated with the chimera CD8-ε or with endogenous CD3-ε was detected upon engagement of these receptors with their specific antibodies (Fig. 2,first and third columns). This receptor-associated PI 3-kinase activity further increased by extensive cross-linking of OKT8 or OKT3 with GαmIg (Fig. 2, secondand fourth columns). Since for PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity the association of both p85α and p110 subunits is required, these results suggest that in JCD8-ε cells, CD8-ε or TCR·CD3 stimulation leads to the binding of a p85α/p110 heterodimer to the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of CD3-ε. Taken together, the above results are consistent with a mechanism for p85 PI3-kinase binding in which Lck (or Fyn) directly phosphorylates the CD8-ε chimera and subsequently p85α binds direct or indirectly to the chimera. However, Jurkat T cells contain other hematopoietic-specific tyrosine kinases (such as ZAP-70, etc.) and other signaling molecules, which confound the drawing of definitive conclusions from the above experiments. A previously described reconstitution system was used (28Hall C.G. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Science. 1993; 261: 915-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to determine whether Fyn was capable of directly tyrosine phosphorylating the CD8-ε chimera. In this system, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with mouse Fyn, or mouse p85α PI 3-kinase, or CD8-ε cDNAs alone or in various combinations. The CD8-ε chimera was isolated by immunoprecipitation with the anti-CD8 mAb OKT8 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig.3 A). Since COS-7 cells lack all known hematopoietic specific tyrosine kinases, only very weak CD8-ε tyrosine phosphorylation occurred without exogenous kinase expression in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 5). When the Fyn kinase was co-transfected with CD8-ε in these cells, a marked increase in the level of CD8-ε tyrosine phosphorylation occurred (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). Moreover, co-expression of these two proteins resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of a 59-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein with CD8-ε that was identified as Fyn (Fig.3, panel A and panel B, lane 6). In contrast, in cells transfected with Fyn cDNA alone, the OKT8 antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate any 59-kDa band (Fig.3 B, lane 3), suggesting that the interaction of phosphorylated CD8-ε with Fyn was specific. These results indicate that, without the ZAP-70 PTK, Fyn is able to directly tyrosine-phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8-ε chimera, resulting in a tight association of this kinase with the CD3-ε-ITAM. CD8-ε chimera was also analyzed for association with transfected mouse p85α PI 3-kinase. While in COS-7 cells co-transfected with CD8-ε and mouse p85α cDNAs, a low amount of p85α was co-immunoprecipitated with unphosphorylated CD8-ε (Fig. 3 C, lane 7), in cells co-transfected with CD8-ε, p85α, and Fyn cDNAs, a significantly increased amount of p85α was co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated CD8-ε (Fig. 3 C, lane 8). In contrast, in cells transfected with p85α cDNA alone the p85α protein did not bind unspecifically to the OKT8 mAb used for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 C, lane 4), suggesting that the CD8-ε/p85α interactions were specific. Fyn can efficiently bind to the CD8-ε chimera (Fig. 3 B,lane 6), and Src homology 3 domain of Fyn can mediate binding to PI 3-kinase in T cells (34Prasad K.V.S. Janssen O. Kapeller R. Raab M. Cantley L.C. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7366-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased association of p85α to the CD8-ε chimera observed in cells that were co-transfected with Fyn (Fig. 3 C, lane 8) suggested that either Fyn was the linker between CD8-ε and p85 PI 3-kinase or that tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimera could provide a high affinity binding site to the SH2 domains of p85 PI 3-kinase. To distinguish between these two possibilities, two mutated CD8-ε chimeras were constructed. In one chimera, the first tyrosine of CD3-ε-ITAM was replaced by phenylalanine (Y170F). In the second chimera the second tyrosine was replaced by phenylalanine (Y181F) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data showed that in COS-7 cells co-transfected with Y170F or with Y181F and Fyn, the chimeras resulted in weak tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with wild-type CD8-ε (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 10 and 14 withlane 6). Despite that, Fyn could still be detected associated with Y170F and Y181F chimeras (Fig. 3 B,lanes 10 and 14). These results suggest that phosphorylation of only a single tyrosine residue within the CD3-ε-ITAM is sufficient for high affinity binding of Fyn to the cytoplasmic tail of CD3-ε. In COS-7 cells transfected with Y170F or with Y181F and p85α cDNAs, the amount of p85α protein co-immunoprecipitated with the chimera was low (Fig. 3 C, lanes 11 and15). Moreover, in cells transfected with Y170F or Y181F and with p85α and Fyn cDNAs, the amount of p85α protein co-immunoprecipitated with either Y170F or Y181F chimeras did not increase as compared with that in the double transfectants (Fig.3 C, compare lanes"
https://openalex.org/W2069584316,"We investigated the mechanism of interleukin-6 (IL-6) synthesis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. TNF stimulated the synthesis of IL-6 dose dependently in the range between 1 and 30 ng/ml. Staurosporine and calphostin C, inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), significantly enhanced the TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, a specific activator of PKC, inhibited the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. The stimulative effect of TNF was markedly increased in the PKC down-regulated cells. TNF produced diacylglycerol. TNF had little effect on the formation of inositol phosphates and choline. On the contrary, TNF significantly stimulated the formation of phosphocholine dose dependently. D-609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, suppressed the TNF-induced diacylglycerol production. The TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis was significantly enhanced by D-609. TNF induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Neither C2-ceramide nor sphingosine but sphingosine 1-phosphate significantly stimulated the synthesis of IL-6. PKC down-regulation amplified the IL-6 synthesis by sphingosine 1-phosphate. These results strongly suggest that sphingosine 1-phosphate may act as a second messenger for TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis and that TNF autoregulates IL-6 synthesis due to PKC activation via phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C in osteoblast-like cells.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). As for intracellular signaling of TNF, it has been reported that TNF stimulates breakdown of sphingomyelin through sphingomyelinase activation, which results in the formation of ceramide (2Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It is subsequently metabolized to sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Ceramide has been reported to induce apoptosis in several cells, whereas sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate are mitogenic. Accumulating evidence suggests that these sphigomyelin metabolites mediate TNF-induced biological effects (3Schütze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Krönke M.

In addition, TNF has been shown to catalyze phosphatidylcholine (PC) hydrolysis via activation of PC-specific phospholipase C, resulting in the production of phosphocholine and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is generally recognized to be a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC) (6Schütze S.

Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). However, the precise intracellular signaling system of TNF has not yet been fully clarified. Bone metabolism is maintained by two types of functional bone cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone formation and bone resorption, respectively (8Nijweide P.J. Burger E.H. Feyen J.H.M. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 855-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts activity has been reported to be coupled through cytokines (such as TNF and interleukin-1), stimulation of osteoblasts, and the subsequent production of secondary peptide which activates osteoclasts (9Thomson B.M. Saklatuala J. Chambers T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 10Thomson B.M. Mundy G.R. Chambers T.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 775-779PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that TNF is a potent bone resorptive agent (11Ishimi Y. Miyaura C. Jin C.H. Akatsu T. Abe E. Nakamura Y. Yamaguchi Y. Yoshiki S. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3297-3303PubMed Google Scholar). Bone resorptive agents such as TNF, parathyroid hormone, interleukin-1, and platelet-derived growth factor have been reported to stimulate interleukin-6 (IL-6) production and its secretion in cultured osteoblasts (11Ishimi Y.

IL-6 is a pleiotropic multifunctional cytokine which regulates diverse cell functions (15Akira S. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2860-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 16van Snick J.V. Annu. Rev.

Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that IL-6 secreted from osteoblasts plays an important role in bone resorption as a downstream effector of a variety of bone resorptive agents. However, the exact mechanism of IL-6 synthesis in osteoblasts has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of IL-6 synthesis induced by TNF in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. We show here that sphingosine 1-phosphate may act as a second messenger for TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis and that TNF autoregulates IL-6 synthesis due to PKC activation via PC-hydrolyzing phospholipase C in osteoblast-like cells. myo-[3H]Inositol (90 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]choline chloride (85 Ci/mmol), and mouse IL-6 enzyme immunoassay kit were purchased from Amersham Japan (Tokyo, Japan). TNF, potassium tricyclo-(5,2,1,0)-decyl-[9(8)-xanthogenate] (D-609), C2-ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate were obtained from Funakoshi Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Calphostin C, staurosporine, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma. 1-Oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan).dl-Propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol) was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Calphostin C, TPA, and propranolol were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The maximum concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.1%, which did not affect the assay for IL-6 nor the measurement of DAG production. Cloned osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells derived from newborn mouse calvaria (18Kodama H. Amagai Y. Sudo H. Kasai S. Yamamoto S. Jpn. J. Oral Biol. 1981; 23: 899-901Crossref Google Scholar, 19Sudo H.

Kumegawa (Meikai University, Sakado, Japan) and maintained in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The cells (5 × 104) were seeded into 35-mm diameter dishes in 2 ml of α-MEM containing 10% FCS. After 5 days, the medium was exchanged for 2 ml of α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS. The cells were used for experiments after 48 h. In the experiments for the measurement of inositol phosphates, the medium was exchanged for 2 ml of inositol-free α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS. The cultured cells were stimulated by TNF, C2-ceramide, sphingosine, or sphingosine 1-phosphate in 1 ml of α-MEM containing 0.3% FCS for the indicated periods. The conditioned medium was collected, and IL-6 in the medium was measured by an IL-6 enzyme immunoassay kit. When indicated, the cells were pretreated with calphostin C, staurosporine, OAG, or D-609 for 20 min. To determine phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C activity, the cultured cells were labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol (3 μCi/dish) for 48 h. The labeled cells were preincubated with 10 mm LiCl for 10 min in 1 ml of an assay buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 1 mmCaCl2) containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then stimulated by TNF or sodium fluoride at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The acid supernatant was treated with diethyl ether to remove the acid and neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml Dowex AG1-X8 column (100–200 mesh, formate from) as described by Berridge et al. (20Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The radioactive inositol phosphates were eluted from the column with 8 ml of 0.1 m formic acid containing 1m ammonium formate. To determine PC-hydrolyzing phospholipase C and phospholipase D activities, the cultured cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (2 μCi/dish) for 24 h. The labeled cells were stimulated by TNF in the assay buffer containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin for the indicated periods. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.75 ml of ice-cold methanol. The dishes were placed on ice for 10 min. The contents were transferred to tubes to which chloroform was added and placed on ice for a further 60 min. Chloroform and water were then added for a final chloroform:methanol:water ratio of 1:1:0.9. The tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min and the upper aqueous methanolic phase was taken for analysis of the water-soluble choline-containing metabolites. The methanolic phase was separated on a 1-ml Dowex 50-WH+ column (200–400 mesh) as described by Cook and Wakelam (23Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with a minor modification (24Shinoda J. Suzuki A. Oiso Y. Kozawa O. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E524-E529PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the phase was diluted to 5 ml with water and applied to the column. Glycerophosphocholine was removed by 4 ml of water. Phosphocholine was then eluted by 10 ml of water, and choline was eluted with 10 ml of 1m HCl. The cultured cells were incubated in the assay buffer containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 20 min, and then stimulated by TNF for the indicated periods. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.75 ml of ice-cold methanol, and the lipids were extracted by the previously described method (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42828) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki A. Kozawa O. Shinoda J. Watanabe Y. Saito H. Oiso Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DAG was quantitated using sn-1,2-DAG assay reagents system (Amersham, Japan) essentially according to the procedure of Preiss et al. (27Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactive spot corresponding to phosphatidic acid was analyzed by BAS2000 (Fuji, Japan) equipped with imaging plates (28Amemiya Y. Miyahara J. Nature. 1988; 336: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). When indicated, the cells were pretreated with D-609 or propranolol for 20 min. Sphingomyelin levels were measured as described by Okazaki et al. (29Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the cultured cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (2 μCi/dish) for 24 h. The labeled cells were stimulated by TNF in the assay buffer containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin for the indicated periods. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42828) Google Scholar). The samples were dried down, dissolved in chloroform, and then applied on Gel 60A TLC plate. To identify sphingomyelin, TLC plate was developed in chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:5). The sphingomyelin spot was scraped. The radioactivity of 3H-labeled samples was determined with a Beckman LS-6500IC liquid scintillation spectrometer. The data were analyzed by Student'st test and a p < 0.05 was considered significant. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. TNF (30 ng/ml) significantly induced the synthesis of IL-6 in a time-dependent manner up to 48 h (Fig.1 A). The stimulative effect of TNF was dose-dependent in the range between 1 and 30 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). The maximum effect of TNF was observed at 30 ng/ml. Our findings are consistent with a previous report in osteoblasts (11Ishimi Y. Miyaura C. Jin C.H. Akatsu T. Abe E. Nakamura Y. Yamaguchi Y. Yoshiki S. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3297-3303PubMed Google Scholar). PKC is well known to play a pivotal role in the regulation of various cellular functions (7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PKC in the mechanism of TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells, we first examined the effect of calphostin C, a highly potent and specific inhibitor of PKC (30Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), on the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Calphostin C, which alone had little effect on IL-6 synthesis, significantly enhanced the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis (Fig. 2). The effect of calphostin C was dose-dependent in the range between 30 nm and 0.3 μm. Staurosporine (10 nm), an inhibitor of protein kinases (31Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), also enhanced the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis (data not shown). It seems that PKC has an inhibitory effect on TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. We next examined whether the activation of PKC exogenously by addition of cell-permeant DAG would further inhibit the IL-6 synthesis in response to TNF. OAG (0.1 mm), a synthetic DAG known to be a specific activator of PKC (7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar), which alone had no effect on IL-6 synthesis, inhibited the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis (TableI). Thus, it is probable that PKC activation suppresses the IL-6 synthesis by TNF.Table IEffect of OAG on the TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6 in MC3T3-E1 cellsOAG (0.1 mm)TNF (30 ng/ml)IL-6pg/ml−−<10−+428 ± 35+−<10++279 ± 321-ap < 0.05, compared to the value of TNF alone.The cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 mm OAG or vehicle for 20 min, and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml TNF or vehicle for 48 h. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained with two additional and different cell preparations.1-a p < 0.05, compared to the value of TNF alone. Open table in a new tab The cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 mm OAG or vehicle for 20 min, and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml TNF or vehicle for 48 h. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained with two additional and different cell preparations. It has been shown that 24 h pretreatment of TPA (0.1 μm) down-regulates PKC in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells (32Sakai T. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. Oka N. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also found that the binding capacity of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, a PKC-activating phorbol ester (7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar), in PKC down-regulated MC3T3-E1 cells is reduced to approximately 30% of the capacity in intact cells (33Suzuki A. Shinoda J. Kanda S. Oiso Y. Kozawa O. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further clarify the role of PKC in the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis, we next examined the effect of TPA (0.1 μm) long-term pretreatment on the IL-6 synthesis stimulated by TNF. The effect of TNF on IL-6 synthesis was significantly enhanced in the PKC down-regulated cells compared with that in the cells without TPA pretreatment (TableII). These findings suggest that TNF activates PKC in MC3T3-E1 cells, and the PKC activation negatively regulates the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis.Table IIEffect of PKC down-regulation on the TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6 in MC3T3-E1 cellsTPA pretreatment (0.1 μM)TNF (30 ng/ml)IL-6pg/ml−−<10−+415 ± 33+−<10++720 ± 482-ap < 0.05, compared to the value of TNF alone.The cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 μm TPA or vehicle for 24 h, and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml TNF or vehicle for 48 h.

Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained with two additional and different cell preparations. We next investigated the intracellular signaling pathway responsible for TNF-activated PKC in MC3T3-E1 cells. It is well known that phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by phospholipase C results in the formation of DAG. To test the effect of TNF on phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, we examined whether TNF affects the formation of inositol phosphates. TNF had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates (control, 2,045 ± 99 cpm; 30 ng/ml TNF, 2,111 ± 106 cpm, as measured after 30 min stimulation). It is well recognized that heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins are coupled to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (34Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4713) Google Scholar). So, we examined the effect of sodium fluoride, an activator of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (34Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4713) Google Scholar), on phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, as a positive control. Sodium fluoride significantly stimulated the formation of inositol phosphates (control, 2,122 ± 101 cpm; 40 mm sodium fluoride, 30,300 ± 887 cpm, as measured after 30 min stimulation). It seems unlikely that TNF induces phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by phospholipase C. It is recognized that PC hydrolysis by PC-specific phospholipase C or D results in the formation of DAG and subsequent activation of PKC (35Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). To clarify the effect of TNF on PC hydrolysis, we examined the effects of TNF on the formations of phosphocholine and choline, the products of PC hydrolysis by phospholipases C and D, respectively. TNF did not affect the formation of choline, but significantly stimulated the formation of phosphocholine (Fig. 3). The stimulative effect of TNF was dose-dependent in the range between 10 and 30 ng/ml, and the maximum effect of TNF was observed at 30 ng/ml (Fig. 3). Thus, these findings suggest that TNF activates not phospholipase D but PC-specific phospholipase C. Based on our findings, it is probable that TNF activates PKC through PC hydrolysis by PC-specific phospholipase C in MC3T3-E1 cells. Thus, we examined the effect of TNF on DAG production. TNF (30 ng/ml) time dependently stimulated the production of DAG (Fig.4 A). The effect reached submaximum within 30 min, and decreased after 60 min. The stimulative effect of TNF was dose-dependent in the range between 1 and 30 ng/ml, and the maximum effect of TNF was observed at 30 ng/ml (Fig.4 B). The pattern of dose-response curve in TNF-induced DAG production was similar to that in TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. D-609, a specific inhibitor of PC-specific phospholipase C (37Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Weigmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited the production of DAG induced by TNF (TableIII). On the contrary, propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (38Pappu A.S. Hauser G. Neurochem. Res. 1983; 8: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), had little effect on the TNF-induced DAG production (Table III). It is most likely that TNF induces DAG production through PC hydrolysis by phospholipase C, and then activates PKC.Table IIIEffect of D-609 or propranolol on the TNF-induced production of DAG in MC3T3-E1 cellsPretreatmentTNF (30 ng/ml)DAGpmol/dishControl−292 ± 30Control+1,415 ± 155D-609−266 ± 30D-609+414 ± 453-ap < 0.05, compared to the value of TNF alone.Propranolol−299 ± 27Propranolol+1,514 ± 189The cultured cells were pretreated with 30 ng/ml D-609, 300 μm propranolol or vehicle for 20 min, and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml TNF or vehicle for 20 min.

Open table in a new tab The cultured cells were pretreated with 30 ng/ml D-609, 300 μm propranolol or vehicle for 20 min, and then stimulated by 30 ng/ml TNF or vehicle for 20 min.

To clarify the role of PC-specific phospholipase C in TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis, we examined the effect of D-609 on the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. D-609, which alone had little effect on IL-6 synthesis, significantly enhanced the synthesis of IL-6 induced by TNF (Fig. 5). The stimulative effect of D-609 was dose-dependent in the range between 0.1 and 0.3 ng/ml. This finding suggests that TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis is negatively regulated by PC-specific phospholipase C activated by TNF itself. It has been reported that sphingomyelin hydrolysis takes part in the signaling mechanism of TNF in several types of cells (2Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of TNF on sphingomyelin levels in MC3T3-E1 cells. TNF (30 ng/ml) decreased sphingomyelin levels to 77% of control 30 min after the stimulation (Fig. 6). The levels then returned to control levels by 60 min. Our finding indicates that TNF truly induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis in MC3T3-E1 cells. To clarify whether sphingomyelin hydrolysis is involved in TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis, we next examined the effects of sphingomyelin metabolites on IL-6 synthesis. C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable ceramide analogue, had no effect on the synthesis of IL-6 in the range between 0.1 and 30 μm (Fig. 7). In addition, sphingosine did not stimulate IL-6 synthesis between 0.1 and 30 μm (Fig. 7). On the contrary, sphingosine 1-phosphate significantly induced the synthesis of IL-6 (Fig. 7). The stimulative effect was dose-dependent in the range between 0.1 and 30 μm. The long-term pretreatment with 0.1 μmTPA markedly enhanced the IL-6 synthesis by sphingosine 1-phosphate compared with that in intact cells (TableIV). Therefore, it is probable that sphingosine 1-phosphate mediates the stimulative effect of TNF on IL-6 synthesis.Table IVEffect of PKC down-regulation on the sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced synthesis of IL-6 in MC3T3-E1 cellsTPA pretreatment (0.1 μm)Sphingosine 1-phosphate (30 μm)IL-6pg/ml−−<10−+223 ± 41+−<10++535 ± 554-ap < 0.05, compared to the value of sphingosine 1-phosphate alone.The cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 μm TPA or vehicle for 24 h, and then stimulated by 30 μmsphingosine 1-phosphate or vehicle for 48 h. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained with two additional and different cell preparations.4-a p < 0.05, compared to the value of sphingosine 1-phosphate alone. Open table in a new tab The cultured cells were pretreated with 0.1 μm TPA or vehicle for 24 h, and then stimulated by 30 μmsphingosine 1-phosphate or vehicle for 48 h. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Similar results were obtained with two additional and different cell preparations. In the present study, we showed that TNF induced the production of DAG in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. This finding suggests that TNF activates PKC in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, we demonstrated that calphostin C enhanced the TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6. Staurosporine also amplified the IL-6 synthesis by TNF. Thus, it seems that the TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6 is inhibited by PKC, which is activated by TNF itself. We next examined the effect of TNF on IL-6 synthesis in the PKC down-regulated cells. We demonstrated here that the stimulative effect of TNF on IL-6 synthesis was markedly amplified in the PKC down-regulated cells compared with that in intact cells. Additionally, we showed that the PKC activation by OAG inhibited the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Therefore, these results suggest that PKC activated by TNF regulates the overstimulation of IL-6 synthesis by TNF itself in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. We next investigated the exact mechanism behind the TNF-induced activation of PKC in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. We first showed that TNF had no effect on the formation of inositol phosphates. It is well known that phosphatidylinositol is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of inositol phosphates and DAG (39Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems unlikely that TNF activates phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Namely, our finding suggests that TNF does not activate PKC through phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In addition, we demonstrated that TNF did not affect the formation of choline, and that propranolol, did not affect the DAG production induced by TNF in MC3T3-E1 cells. It is recognized that phospholipase D hydrolyzes PC to yield phosphatidic acid and choline (35Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Phosphatidic acid is subsequently degraded into DAG by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase. Thus, it seems unlikely that TNF simulates PC-specific phospholipase D in MC3T3-E1 cells. On the contrary, TNF stimulated the formation of phosphocholine. PC is also hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, resulting in the formation of DAG and phosphocholine (35Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that D-609 reduced the DAG production by TNF. Therefore, these results suggest that TNF activates PKC via stimulating PC-specific phospholipase C in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated here that D-609 enhanced the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Taking our findings into account, it is most likely that TNF regulates IL-6 synthesis due to PKC activation through PC-hydrolyzing phospholipase C in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. We showed here that TNF induced sphingomyelin turnover in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and that neither C2-ceramide nor sphingosine but sphingosine 1-phosphate significantly stimulated the synthesis of IL-6. It is well known that sphingomyelin hydrolysis results in the production of ceramide. Ceramide can be subsequently metabolized to sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that these sphingomyelin metabolites mediate TNF-induced biological effects (3Schütze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Krönke M. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9895-9897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that sphingosine 1-phosphate is involved in the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, we showed that PKC down-regulation significantly enhanced the sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced IL-6 synthesis as well as TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. Therefore, our findings suggest that TNF exerts the stimulative effect on IL-6 synthesis through sphingosine 1-phosphate in MC3T3-E1 cells, and that PKC acts as a regulator of IL-6 synthesis at a point downstream from sphingosine 1-phosphate. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that TNF induces both PC hydrolysis by phospholipase C and sphingomyelin hydrolysis in osteoblast-like cells. Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a metabolite of the latter hydrolysis, may act as a second messenger for TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis, and that PKC activation due to the former hydrolysis autoregulates the TNF-induced IL-6 synthesis. We are very grateful to Drs. Junji Shinoda and Yasuko Watanabe-Tomita for skillful technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2031320408,"Substitution of alanine for Ser775 in a ouabain-resistant α1 sheep isoform causes a 30-fold decrease in apparent affinity for K+ as an activator of the Na,K-ATPase, as well as an increase in apparent affinity for ATP (Arguello, J. M., and Lingrel, J. B (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22764–22771). This study was carried out to determine whether Ser775 is a direct cation-ligating residue or whether the change in apparent affinity for K+ is secondary to a conformational alteration as evidenced in the change in ATP affinity, with the following results. Kinetics of K+(Rb+) influx into intact cells show that the change is due to a change in K+ interaction at the extracellular surface. The K+ dependence of formation of K+-occluded enzyme (E 2(K)) and of the rate of formation of deoccluded enzyme fromE 2(K) indicate that the Ser775 → Ala mutation results in a marked increase (≥30-fold) in rate of release of K+ fromE 2(K). The high affinity Na+-like competitive antagonist 1,3-dibromo2,4,6-tris-(methylisothiouronium)benzene (Br2TITU), which interacts with theE 1 conformation and blocks cytoplasmic cation binding (Hoving, S., Bar-Shimon, M., Tijmes, J. J., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29788–29793), inhibits Na+-ATPase of the mutant less than the control enzyme. With intact cells, Br2TITU acts as a competitive inhibitor of extracellular K+ activation of both the mutant and control enzymes. In this case, the mutant was more sensitive to inhibition. With vanadate as a probe of conformation, a difference in conformational equilibrium between the mutant and control enzymes could not be detected under turnover conditions (Na+- ATPase) in the absence of K+. These results indicate that the increase in apparent affinity for ATP effected by the Ser775 → Ala mutation is secondary to a change in intrinsic cation affinity/selectivity. The large change in affinity for extracellular K+ compared with cytoplasmic Na+ and to Br2TITU binding supports the conclusion that the serine hydroxyl is either part of the K+-gate structure or a direct cation-ligating residue that is shared by at least one Na+ ion, albeit with less consequence on rate constants for Na+ binding or release compared with K+. Substitution of alanine for Ser775 in a ouabain-resistant α1 sheep isoform causes a 30-fold decrease in apparent affinity for K+ as an activator of the Na,K-ATPase, as well as an increase in apparent affinity for ATP (Arguello, J. M., and Lingrel, J. B (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 22764–22771). This study was carried out to determine whether Ser775 is a direct cation-ligating residue or whether the change in apparent affinity for K+ is secondary to a conformational alteration as evidenced in the change in ATP affinity, with the following results. Kinetics of K+(Rb+) influx into intact cells show that the change is due to a change in K+ interaction at the extracellular surface. The K+ dependence of formation of K+-occluded enzyme (E 2(K)) and of the rate of formation of deoccluded enzyme fromE 2(K) indicate that the Ser775 → Ala mutation results in a marked increase (≥30-fold) in rate of release of K+ fromE 2(K). The high affinity Na+-like competitive antagonist 1,3-dibromo2,4,6-tris-(methylisothiouronium)benzene (Br2TITU), which interacts with theE 1 conformation and blocks cytoplasmic cation binding (Hoving, S., Bar-Shimon, M., Tijmes, J. J., Tal, D. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29788–29793), inhibits Na+-ATPase of the mutant less than the control enzyme. With intact cells, Br2TITU acts as a competitive inhibitor of extracellular K+ activation of both the mutant and control enzymes. In this case, the mutant was more sensitive to inhibition. With vanadate as a probe of conformation, a difference in conformational equilibrium between the mutant and control enzymes could not be detected under turnover conditions (Na+- ATPase) in the absence of K+. These results indicate that the increase in apparent affinity for ATP effected by the Ser775 → Ala mutation is secondary to a change in intrinsic cation affinity/selectivity. The large change in affinity for extracellular K+ compared with cytoplasmic Na+ and to Br2TITU binding supports the conclusion that the serine hydroxyl is either part of the K+-gate structure or a direct cation-ligating residue that is shared by at least one Na+ ion, albeit with less consequence on rate constants for Na+ binding or release compared with K+. The Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimeric protein comprised of a catalytic α subunit and a smaller heavily glycosylated β subunit (for review, see Ref. 1Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the exchange of three cytoplasmic sodium ions for two extracellular potassium ions coupled to the hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP. It is a member of the family of P-type ion pumps (reviewed in Ref. 2Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) that are characteristically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at an aspartyl residue. Its catalytic α subunit comprises probably 10 transmembrane helices and shows considerable homology to that of the other P-type pumps such as the gastric H,K-ATPase and the Ca-ATPases of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. During transport, both sodium and potassium ions are occluded within the Na,K-ATPase (for review, see Ref. 3Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The nature of the cation binding and occlusion sites is largely unknown. However, studies of the reaction mechanism underlying cation exchange and functional consequences of structural perturbations support the notion of a cation binding and occlusion pocket occupied consecutively by both Na+ and K+ ions during their translocation from the cytosol to extracellular milieu and vice versa (4Sachs J.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1980; 302: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The structure of the binding/occlusion region must accommodate the highly distinctive cation selectivities such that Na+ binds with high apparent affinity at cytoplasmic sites, and K+ binds at extracellular sites. A critical issue concerns the identification of amino acids that comprise the cation binding and occlusion sites of the Na,K-ATPase. To date, a number of functionally important carboxyl and hydroxyl containing amino acid residues have been identified by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis of residues in transmembrane regions. Thus, substituting polar residues by mutagenesis of carboxyl- or hydroxyl-bearing amino acids in transmembrane segments M4, M5, M6, M8, and M9 has resulted in either inactive or functionally altered enzymes with altered apparent affinities for Na+ and/or K+. Of these, one mutation localized to M5 (Glu779 → Gln; see Ref.5) alters (decreases) only Na+ affinity. An Asn326 → Leu mutation in M4 increased the apparent affinity for Na+ but decreased it for K+ (6Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other transmembrane substitutions resulting in relatively moderate decreases in apparent cation affinities for activating Na,K-ATPase are 1Residues are numbered according to the sequence of the sheep α1 enzyme.Glu327 in M4 (7Jewell-Motz E.A.

In contrast to the relatively modest effects of the foregoing mutations, non-conservative substitutions of Asp804 and Asp808 in M6 markedly disrupted K+-enzyme interactions as evidenced in K+-ouabain antagonism (14Kuntzweiler T.A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and substitution of Ser775 with either alanine or cysteine decreases apparent K+ affinity dramatically, 31- and 13-fold in the case of Ser775 → Ala and Ser775 → Cys, respectively (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of these three mutants, only those with substitutions of Ser775 are functional. Because of the remarkable change in apparent affinity for K+ caused by the replacement of Ser775 with alanine, we have carried out experiments to determine whether Ser775 is a direct ligand involved in K+binding and/or occlusion or whether the change in apparent K+ affinity is secondary to an alteration in the conformational equilibrium. HeLa cells were transfected with sheep Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit cDNA modified by two mutations (Gln111 → Arg and Asn122 → Asp) to encode an α1 form with low affinity for ouabain (RD) 2The abbreviations used are: RD, ouabain-resistant sheep α1 isoform; Br2TITU, 1,3-dibromo-2,4,6-tris-(methylisothiouronium)benzene;E 2(K), K+-occluded enzyme. and with a Ser775 → Ala mutant (S775A) of RD. The mutagenesis and cloning of these constructs, and the transfection and culture of HeLa cells, were described previously by Arguello and Lingrel (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated, and assays of Na,K-ATPase and Na-ATPase were carried out as described previously (17Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in medium containing 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and the indicated concentrations of ATP, Na+, and K+. Unless indicated otherwise, assays of ATP hydrolysis at pH 7.4 were carried out using 20 mm histidine-Tris, and those at pH 8.0 used 20 mm Tris-HCl. Prior to assay, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 5 μm ouabain in medium containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. K+ occlusion and the rate of K+ deocclusion were measured by the indirect assays described by Daly et al. (18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ouabain-sensitive K+(86Rb+) influx into transfected HeLa cells was measured as described by Munzer et al. (19Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 24-well Falcon plates and with medium containing 10 mm NaCl, the indicated concentrations of KCl, and choline chloride to maintain a constant (150 mm) chloride concentration, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mmPO4-Tris, pH 7.4, with 12 μm monensin to equilibrate Na+, and 10 μm bumetanide. Following preincubation for 10 min with K+-free medium, assays were carried out for 10 min with medium containing KCl and86RbCl as a congener of K+. Values of ouabain-sensitive K+(86Rb+) influx are differences between two sets of triplicate determinations, one set with 5 μm ouabain and the other with 10 mmouabain present during the preincubation and flux assay. For each set of triplicates, coefficients of variation were ≤5%. All materials were of the highest purity available. Choline chloride was purchased from Syntax AgriBusiness and recrystallized twice from hot ethanol. Br2TITU was synthesized as described by Tal and Karlish (20Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 3823-3830Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), dissolved in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 or pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C as a 1 mm stock solution. [γ-32P]ATP was synthesized by a modification (21Post R.L. Sen A.K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 773-776Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar) of the method of Glynn and Chappell (22Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. 86RbCl was from Amersham Life Science, Inc. When HeLa cells transfected with the RD Na,K-ATPase are grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10−6m ouabain, expression of the exogenous enzyme enables cell growth. In contrast, mutation of Ser775 → Ala in this enzyme results in suppression of growth unless the K+concentration is raised to at least 20 mm (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This behavior is associated with a marked decrease in apparent affinity of the mutant enzyme (S775A) for K+, as evidenced in studies of K+-activation of Na,K-ATPase activity (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With sided preparations (intact cells suspended in buffered choline chloride and containing 10 mm Na+ with monensin present to maintain a constant intracellular Na+ concentration as described in Munzer et al. (19Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), a marked decrease in apparent affinity for extracellular K+ is also observed (Fig. 1). The difference (30-fold; average of five separate experiments, with a cooperative 2-site model used to fit the data) between the S775A and RD enzymes is similar to that observed previously with unsided membranes (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is evident also that the V max of the mutant enzyme is higher than that of the control RD enzyme (5-fold in the representative experiments shown). This probably reflects the higher expression of S775A mutant compared with control RD protein observed previously (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although this finding lends further support to the conclusion that Ser775 is a cation-ligating residue, the question remains as to whether the decrease in apparent affinity for extracellular K+ is due to an intrinsic decrease in K+binding and/or occlusion in the cation binding “pocket” or reflects a change in theE 1/E 2conformational equilibrium during steady-state catalysis. Several experimental approaches were used to gain further insight into the function of Ser775. First, the Na,K-ATPase reaction was studied at very low ATP concentration since the K+-deocclusion reaction sequence (E 2(K) → E 1 + K+), which follows the K+-dependent dephosphorylation, is rate-limiting at concentrations of ATP sufficient to saturate only the low affinity binding site (23Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In fact, as shown earlier (17Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Wierzbicki W. Blostein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and in the experiment described in Fig.2 above, the response of Na-ATPase to K+ at micromolar ATP concentration is a simple and sensitive means of characterizing isoform- or mutant-specific differences in the K+ deocclusion pathway of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 2, marked stimulation by K+ is observed in the mutant S775A enzyme, whereas the control RD enzyme is characteristically inhibited by K+ at micromolar ATP concentration. With both enzymes, inhibition by K+ at concentrations above 10 mm is probably due to K+ antagonism at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites. This change in K+-response profile at low ATP concentration caused by the mutation suggests a change in rate of a reaction step following dephosphorylation of the K+-sensitive form of phosphoenzyme commonly referred to asE 2P in the Albers-Post mechanism. According to a branched pathway of K+ deocclusion, which follows K+-activated dephosphorylation ofE 2P, namely E 2(K) + ATP → ATP.E 2(K) → ATP.E 1K → ATP.E 1 + K+(pathway a), or E 2(K) → E 1K → E 1 + K+;E 1 + ATP → ATP.E 1(pathway b), an increase in either ATP.E 2(K) → ATP.E 1K or E 2(K) → E 1K effected by the mutation could be evidenced in a change from K+ inhibition to K+ activation at low ATP concentration. Consistent with this prediction is the increase in apparent affinity for ATP of S775A compared with RD shown previously (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and confirmed in this study. In fact, when the analysis is carried out with the ATP concentration varied from 1 to 500 μm and the data points fitted to a 2-component model describing the aforementioned pathways, one in the range 20–1000 μm ATP and the other in the range 0.5–10 μm ATP, the kinetic constants for the apparent affinities for ATP at low and high affinity sites, designatedK′L and K′H, respectively, are 47.9 ± 6.4 and 3.65 ± 1.40 for S775A and 504 ± 191 and 6.01 ± 1.75 for RD. Maximum velocities via pathways a (V′L) and b(V′H) were also derived from the plots, and the relative values, expressed as the ratioV′H/V′L, are 0.05 for RD and 0.34 for S775A. These results indicate that the mutation increases the affinity for ATP via pathway a and increases the relative activity via the high affinity pathway b. At face value, the behavior shown in Fig. 2 and the kinetic changes effected by the Ser775 → Ala mutation are not remarkably different from those resulting from certain mutations in cytoplasmic regions (reviewed in Ref. 25Daly, S. E., Lane, L. K., and Blostein, R. (1997) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). However, fundamental differences are revealed by further analysis as described below. Experiments aimed to obtain direct information about the effect of the Ser775 → Ala mutation on K+ binding, occlusion, and/or deocclusion were carried out as described previously. For K+ occlusion, the enzyme was equilibrated with varying concentrations of K+ (K+E 1 ↔ E 2(K)), and the resulting decrease in E 1 was measured as described by Daly et al. (18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this assay, the enzyme is first equilibrated at room temperature (i) without and (ii) with varying amounts of K+. The amount of K+-occluded enzyme is reflected by the decrease in phosphoenzyme (E32P) formed during rapid phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP at 0 °C. The reduction in E32P resulting from preincubation with K+(ΔE32P) is a measure of the amount ofE 2(K). The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that K+ occlusion in the RD enzyme can be described by a simple hyperbolic relationship (A max[S]n/(K diss+ [S]n)), with a K dissapproximately an order of magnitude lower than that of the S775A mutant. In contrast, K+ occlusion showed sigmoid behavior in all experiments (n = 4) with the mutant enzyme. When the data for the RD and S775A enzymes are fitted to a cooperativen-site model, values of n are 0.8 for RD and 1.6 for S775A. The sigmoid behavior of S775A has important implications regarding the effect of the mutation on the individual rate constants for occlusion and/or deocclusion of the first followed by the second K+ ion as discussed below. The presence of a fraction of enzyme (25% of RD; 50% of S775A), which can be phosphorylated but cannot form E 2(K) fromE 1, at least following preincubation with up to 8 mm K+, suggests the existence of transfected enzyme that is functionally altered (see “Discussion”). Fig. 4 shows that when the mutant enzyme is first preincubated with K+ to obtain maximalE 2(K), subsequent deocclusion at 10 °C is extremely rapid, precluding quantitation of the rate constant with the manual method used (18Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, with ≥90% ofE 2K disappearing within the first 4 s, the rate constant must be ≥0.6 s−1, which is ≥30 times that (≈0.02 s−1) of the RD enzyme. Previous experiments suggested that the Ser775 → Ala mutation markedly reduced the catalytic turnover of the enzyme. We have reexamined this characteristic for the following reasons. First, assays of hydrolytic activity and phosphoenzyme using commercially available [γ-32P]ATP are problematic: high base-line values and variable levels of purity of commercial [γ-32P]ATP have precluded reproducible measurements of phosphoenzyme. Second, to obtain maximal estimates of phosphoenzyme, EPmax, oligomycin is now added routinely to trap the phosphoenzyme as E 1P. Using [γ-32P]ATP synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures,” values for turnover calculated as the ratio of V max (data from assays carried out at 100 mm NaCl and varying K+ concentration fitted to a cooperative 2-site model)/EP max(min−1) are 7600 and 4700 for RD and S775A, respectively (experiment not shown). The lower turnover of the mutant compared with the control enzyme may be due, at least partly, to underestimation ofV max. Thus, with unsided preparations, it is likely that K+, at the high concentration needed to activate S775A at extracellular sites, inhibits at cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites. This member of a novel family of aromatic isothiouronium derivatives developed by Tal and Karlish (20Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 3823-3830Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) acts as a very high affinity Na+-like competitive antagonist (K i = 0.32 μm) that interacts with theE 1 conformation and blocks cytoplasmic cation binding and occlusion; at much higher concentration (K i ≈10 μm), particularly at low ionic strength, it affects cation interactions with theE 2 conformation. As discussed earlier (26Hoving S. Bar-Shimon M. Tijmes J.J. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), this family of antagonists should be uniquely useful in distinguishing between mutations that directly affect cation binding as distinct from those that have indirect effects due to alterations of rate constants of the reaction cycle. The experiment shown in Fig.5 compares the inhibitory effect of Br2TITU on Na,K-ATPase of the RD and S775A enzymes assayed with saturating (1 mm) ATP, 100 mmNa+ and sufficient K+ (50 mm) to achieve approximately 75% V max of the mutant enzyme (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the S775A mutant is more sensitive to inhibition by Br2TITU. The experiment shown in Fig.6 was carried out at 20 mmKCl and indicates that inhibition by Br2TITU (20 μm) decreases as the Na+ concentration increases. In this representative experiment, the pH was raised to pH 8.0 to increase the effectiveness of Br2TITU (26Hoving S. Bar-Shimon M. Tijmes J.J. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29788-29793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because of the low apparent affinity of the mutant enzyme for K+, it was not possible to compare the effects of Br2TITU on RD and S775A as a function of varying Na+ at low K+ concentration and, conversely, the effects of varying K+ at low Na+ concentration.Figure 6Effect of Na+ concentration on Br2TITU inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. Assays were carried out at pH 8.0 for 24 min with 20 μmBr2TITU, 20 mm KCl, and varying concentrations of Na+ as described in Fig. 5. Open circles, RD enzyme; closed circles, S775A enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase can occur by binding of Br2TITU at cytoplasmic sites with high affinity or at extracellular sites with lower affinity or by both. There are several possible explanations for the greater inhibition of S775A by Br2TITU in the conditions of Figs. 5 and 6. First, the balance of theE 1 and E 2 equilibrium could be shifted to E 1, which binds Br2TITU with a higher affinity thanE 2. Second, the large decrease in K+affinity at the extracellular surface could reduce the ability of K+ to compete with Br2TITU onE 2 and make it a better competitor in S775A than in RD. Third, the intrinsic Br2TITU binding might have been improved by mutation. A combination of these factors is also possible. Evidence in favor of the second explanation was obtained in experiments with intact cells, with Br2TITU present in the extracellular medium. Under these conditions, passive permeation of the compound is likely to be extremely slow in accord with its low (1:300) octanol:water partition (not shown) and triple positive charge. Thus, with both enzymes assayed at the same (2 mm) extracellular K+ concentration, Br2TITU inhibition of ouabain-sensitive (86Rb)K+ influx is weak with the RD enzyme and markedly increased with the S775A mutant (not shown). When the kinetics of extracellular K+ activation were compared in the absence versus presence of 100 μm Br2TITU as described in Fig.7, it is clear that Br2TITU is a competitive inhibitor. The apparent K′I for Br2TITU obtained by fitting a 2-site non-cooperative model to the data indicates that K′I for Br2TITU inhibition is reduced only moderately by the mutation. As indicated in the legend to Fig. 7, values ofK i (in micromolar) for Br2TITU as an inhibitor were 0.23 mm for RD and 0.16 mm for S775A. In the absence of K+, the Na-ATPase activity requires only micromolar ATP and Na+activation reaches saturation with ≈1 mm Na+. This initial phase of activation is due to Na+ binding at high affinity cytoplasmic sites; it is followed by a plateau or slight inhibition as Na+ is further increased to ≈10 mm (27Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 465-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 28Beauge L.A. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Kaplan J.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 915-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This inhibitory phase due to Na+ions acting at high affinity extracellular sites (28Beauge L.A. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. 1979; 289: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Kaplan J.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 915-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is followed by a further increase in activity as the Na+ concentration is raised above ≈20 mm due to Na+ acting as K+ congeners at extracellular activation sites (30Lee K.H. Blostein R. Nature. 1980; 285: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The increase effected by 100 mm Na+ is 2–3-fold for RD but less than 0.2-fold for the S775A mutant. This behavior (experiments not shown) suggests that the mutation affects the binding of both Na+ and K+ at extracellular sites. Another aim of these experiments was to determine whether the Ser775 → Ala mutation affects a ligand common to the binding of Na+ at cytoplasmic sites as well as Na+ and K+ at extracellular sites. In earlier experiments aimed to assess the Na+ dependence of Na,K-ATPase under V max conditions, a small change in the activation profile was evidenced as a decrease, in the mutant, in the Hill coefficient obtained by using a cooperativen-site model to fit the data (16Arguello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study, efforts to determine K′Na in assays of Na-ATPase with varying Na+ (initial phase of activation) were confounded by substantial activity present in the absence of added Na+ due, most likely, to traces of residual (tightly bound?) Na+ in the membrane preparations (experiments not shown). However, the following condition was found in which the two enzymes show a significant difference in Br2TITU binding at cytoplasmic Na+sites. In the representative experiment shown in Fig.8, carried out with Na+present in concentrations sufficient to saturate only high affinity cytoplasmic sites (0–1 mm), both enzymes are sensitive to inhibition by Br2TITU at low (5 μm) concentration. Inhibition diminishes as Na+ is further increased. This may be due to Na+ counteracting inhibition by Br2TITU at the high affinity cytoplasmic Na+-activation sites. The particularly interesting observation is that Na-ATPase of the mutant enzyme is less sensitive to inhibition by Br2TITU than the RD control. In other experiments (not shown), inhibition is diminished as the pH is decreased from pH 8.0 to 7.4, particularly with the mutant enzyme. These contrasting effects of Br2TITU on Na,K-ATPaseversus Na-ATPase are difficult to explain on the basis of a difference in conformational equilibrium between the two enzymes at very low Na+ concentration.

The spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+signaling is not homogenous, rather it is dynamically organized, and it has been speculated that spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals may function as a form of cellular information transmitted to downstream molecules. To address this issue, we studied the intracellular distributions of the signalings by CaMKII and Ca2+ in the same astrocytes. The former was visualized by monitoring site-specific phosphorylation of a cytoskeletal protein vimentin, using site- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies, while the latter was examined by fura-2-based Ca2+microscopy. Local Ca2+ signals induced vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII localized in the same area. On the other hand, Ca2+ waves in astrocytes induced global phosphorylation of vimentin by CaMKII. A small population of vimentin filaments highly phosphorylated by CaMKII underwent structural alteration into short filaments at electron microscopic level. These results indicate that CaMKII transmits spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals to vimentin as cellular information. The possibility is discussed that spatial patterns of vimentin phosphorylation may be important for intracellular organization of vimentin filament networks.

Cell signaling is the fundamental strategy by which cells respond to extracellular stimuli. Intracellular distribution of cell signaling is considered to be an important factor affecting the manner in which cells respond to extracellular stimuli with spatial specificity (1Gilbert S.H. Perry K. Fay F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 489-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Zheng J.Q. Felder M. Connor J.A. Poo M. Nature. 1994; 368: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Although little is known of the spatial aspect of cell signaling, that of Ca2+ signaling visualized by Ca2+ microscopy is presently the best characterized example. Numbers of reports have shown that intracellular Ca2+ signals occur locally and globally (3Tank D.W. Sugimori M. Connor J.A. Llinás R.R.

The intracellular distribution of Ca2+signaling in various types of cells was defined by the amplitude and direction of extracellular stimuli (7Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Schmitt-Veehulst A.-M.

Therefore, it has been speculated that spatial patterns of Ca2+ signals might be transmitted, as a form of cellular information, by a downstream molecule that induces Ca2+-dependent cellular responses (1Gilbert S.H.

To address this issue, we visualized site-specific phosphorylation of vimentin by CaMKII 1The abbreviations used are: CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α. and Ca2+ signaling in the same astrocytes. CaMKII is located downstream of Ca2+ signaling and is thought to regulate various cellular responses (11Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Hashimoto Y. Fong Y.-L. Rich D.P. Smith M.K. Sodering T.R. Biochem.

Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein distributed widely in the cytoplasm (13Franke W.W. Schmid E. Schiller D.L. Winter S. Jarasch E.D. Moll R. Denk H. Jackson B.W. Illmensee K.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Therefore, vimentin can serve as a substrate for the examination of the cytoplasmic distribution of protein kinase activities (17Inagaki N. Ito M. Nakano T. Inagaki M. Trends Biochem.

The intracellular area of the phosphorylation was precisely defined by that of Ca2+ signaling. Production of monoclonal antibodies YT33, TM50, 4A4, and MO82 was reported elsewhere (19Ogawara M.

Vimentin peptides PV6 (Cys-Ser-Thr-Arg-Ser-Val-phosphoSer6-Ser-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Arg), V6 (Cys-Ser-Thr-Arg-Ser-Val-Ser-Ser-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Arg), PV38 (Cys-Ser-Thr-Arg-Thr-Tyr-phosphoSer38-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ala-Leu), and V38 (Cys-Ser-Thr-Arg-Thr-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ala-Leu) were synthesized as described previously (21Tsujimura K.

A monoclonal antibody against PV6 (MO6) and a polyclonal antibody against PV38 (GK38) were produced following the methods described previously (21Tsujimura K. Ogawara M. Takeuchi Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S.

Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ha M.-H. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31097-31106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MO6 bound to PV6 but not to the unphosphorylated peptide V6, while GK38 reacted with PV38 but not with the unphosphorylated form V38. Production of recombinant vimentin and vimentin phosphorylated by CaMKII was described previously (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antibody specific for both 50- and 60-kDa subunits of CaMKII (23Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was provided by Drs. K. Fukunaga and E. Miyamoto (Kumamoto University). Primary cultured astrocytes (type 1 astrocytes) were prepared from the cerebral cortices of newborn rats as described previously (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Two days before the experiments, astrocytes were subcultured on collagen (type 1, Sigma)-coated glass coverslips attached to silicon walls (Heraeus Flexiperm Disc) for the measurement of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Then they were differentiated into process-bearing astrocytes by incubation with 250 μm dibutyryl cAMP in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium. Ionomycin or prostaglandin F2α(PGF2α) dissolved in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution (containing the following (in mm): NaCl, 115; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 0.8; glucose, 13.8; Hepes, 20 (pH 7.4)) were bath applied, or locally applied using a micropipette (Sterile Femtotips, Eppendorf) equipped with Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf) by pressure (30 hPa). The flow speed of the locally applied solution was 0.05–0.1 μl/h. The [Ca2+]i of cultured astrocytes was measured as described elsewhere (8Inagaki N. Fukui H. Ito S. Yamatodani A. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4215-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Tsien R.Y. Poenie M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 10 μm fura-2/AM in the Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution for 1 h and washed with the solution for 30 min. Cells on a coverslip were placed on the stage of an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope. Fluorescence images were obtained by a Hamamatsu CCD camera C2400 and stored in a digital image processor Argus-50. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities obtained with excitations at 340 nm and 380 nm on a pixel basis. Cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, followed by treatment with −20 °C methanol for 10 min. They were incubated with MO6 (3 μg/ml), YT33 (3 μg/ml), GK38 (14 μg/ml), TM50 (3 μg/ml), 4A4 (1 μg/ml), or MO82 (0.2 μg/ml) diluted in PBS for 2 h, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (BioSource) diluted 1:100 by PBS for 1 h. Then the samples were examined with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). For double immunostaining with MO82 and anti-vimentin antibody, fixed cells were incubated with MO82 (0.2 μg/ml) and goat anti-vimentin antibody (25Takemura K. Hirayama R. Hirokawa K. Inagaki M. Tsujimura K. Esaki Y. Mishima Y. Pathobiology. 1994; 62: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) diluted 1:300 in PBS for 2 h. MO82 immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:300 in PBS for 1 h, followed by the incubation with streptavidin-Texas Red (Amersham Corp.) diluted 1:300 in PBS for 1 h. On the other hand, vimentin immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat antibodies (BioSource) diluted 1:300 in PBS for 1 h. Then the double-stained samples were examined by a confocal microscope (Olympus, LSM-GB200). Immunofluorescent localization of CaMKII in astrocytes was done using an affinity-purified antibody specific for both 50- and 60-kDa subunits of CaMKII (23Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) as described previously (26Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins or lysate of 1.8 × 103 astrocytes were loaded in the lanes, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Then the blots were incubated with 2 ng/ml MO82 or 1.4 μg/ml GK38 in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham) and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham). Immunogold localization using MO82 was done as described previously (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For standard electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 1 mmMgCl2 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 30 min followed by further fixation in 0.15% tannic acid in the same buffer at room temperature for 5 min. They were fixed again with 1% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min, followed by postfixation with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer on ice for 1 h. The cells were dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were mounted on grids, doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under an electron microscope (JEM1200EX). For visualization of CaMKII signaling, we monitored the site-specific phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin. Ser38 and Ser82of vimentin are identified as the two major in vitrophosphorylation sites of vimentin by CaMKII, while Ser6, Ser33, Ser50, and Ser55 are phosphorylated not by CaMKII but by other kinases (15Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (TableI). We recently developed monoclonal antibodies YT33, TM50, 4A4, and MO82 that recognize the site-specific phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser33, Ser50, Ser55, and Ser82, respectively (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J.

In addition, we produced here a monoclonal antibody MO6 and a polyclonal antibody GK38 that recognize the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser6 and Ser38, respectively (TableI), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Consistent with the in vitro CaMKII phosphorylation sites, Western blotting analysis showed that GK38 and MO82 reacted with vimentin phosphorylated by CaMKII but not with nonphosphorylated vimentin (Fig.1, A and B). On the other hand, MO6, YT33, TM50, and 4A4 did not recognize vimentin phosphorylated by CaMKII (data not shown).Table IIn vivo phosphorylation sites of vimentin and antibodies that recognize site-specific phosphorylationSiteCaMKIIA kinaseC kinaseCdc2 kinaseAntibodySer6++MO6Ser33+YT33Ser38+++GK38Ser50++TM50Ser55+4A4Ser82+MO82 Open table in a new tab Cultured astrocytes differentiated by dibutyryl cAMP were used to detect CaMKII activity. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of CaMKII in astrocytes (26Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Scholz W.K. Baitinger C. Schulman H. Kelly P.T. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CaMKII activated by Ca2+ was shown to phosphorylate vimentin in these cells (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they display local and global Ca2+signaling in response to neurotransmitters (8Inagaki N. Fukui H. Ito S. Yamatodani A. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4215-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Cornell-Bell A.H. Finkbeiner S.M. Cooper M.S. Smith S.J. Science. 1990; 247: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). In vivophosphorylation of vimentin at Ser6, Ser33, Ser38, Ser50, Ser55, and Ser82 were immunocytochemically visualized using antibodies MO6, YT33, GK38, TM50, 4A4 and MO82, respectively. When [Ca2+]i of astrocytes was elevated by incubation of the cells with 1 μm ionomycin for 10 min, the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser38 and Ser82remarkably increased (Fig. 1, C–F) but those of Ser6, Ser33, Ser50, and Ser55 did not (Fig. 1, G–J). Elevations in the levels of phosphorylation at Ser38 and Ser82were further confirmed by Western blotting analysis using GK38 and MO82 (Fig. 2). Thus, the sites of vimentin phosphorylated by [Ca2+]i elevation completely overlapped with the in vitro phosphorylation sites by CaMKII (Table I). These results indicate that the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser38 and Ser82 detected the vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII. We also located CaMKII in differentiated astrocytes. The affinity-purified antibody specific for 50- and 60-kDa subunits of CaMKII (23Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) immunostained astrocytes as described previously (26Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the cell bodies and processes showed diffuse immunoreactivity, indicating that CaMKII is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of differentiated astrocytes (Fig. 1, K and L). Ser82 is at present the only known in vitro phosphorylation site specific to CaMKII (Table I) and the Ca2+-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser82was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of CaMKII, KN-62 (19Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S.-I. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore in the following studies, we monitored the phosphorylation of Ser82 to visualize CaMKII signaling. Ca2+signaling in astrocytes was induced by PGF2α; PGF2α binds to FP-receptors on astrocytes and induces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (30Inagaki N. Wada H. Glia. 1994; 11: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i of astrocytes was measured using fura-2-based digital imaging Ca2+ microscopy, then they were fixed and immunostained with MO82. When 10 μm PGF2α was locally applied using a micropipette for 15 s near the end of a process of an astrocyte, [Ca2+]i was elevated from the basal level (about 100 nm) to about 600 nm in the process but not in the cell body or in other processes (Fig.3 A, a andb). [Ca2+]i then decreased to the basal level within 4 min (Fig. 3 A, c). The [Ca2+]i increase did not appreciably spread beyond the boundary seen in Fig. 3 A, b, throughout the period. Activation of CaMKII monitored by the phosphorylation at Ser82 localized only in the process where [Ca2+]i had been elevated (Fig.3 A, d, arrowheads). We also observed local CaMKII activations that were similarly defined by the area of Ca2+ signals in five other experiments. Propagation of intracellular Ca2+ waves has been observed in astrocytes (8Inagaki N. Fukui H. Ito S. Yamatodani A. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4215-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Cornell-Bell A.H. Finkbeiner S.M. Cooper M.S. Smith S.J. Science. 1990; 247: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Consistent with reports that Ca2+ waves often initiate when cells receive stimuli strong enough to induce sustained [Ca2+]i elevation in a localized area (8Inagaki N. Fukui H. Ito S. Yamatodani A. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4215-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), sustained PGF2α-induced [Ca2+]ielevation propagated from a process to the cell body and then to the rest of the cell in the form of waves (Fig. 3 B,a–c). In this case, vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII was evoked throughout the cell (Fig. 3 B, d). The data above show a good spatial correlation between Ca2+signaling and vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII. Next, astrocytes were double-immunostained by MO82 and an anti-vimentin antibody, then examined by confocal microscopy. Vimentin phosphorylation by CaMKII occurred locally and globally, defined by the area of Ca2+signaling (Fig. 3 C, a, b,d, and e). On the other hand, vimentin was localized diffusely throughout the cells (Fig. 3 C,c and f). Furthermore, CaMKII immunoreactivity was observed diffusely throughout the cells (Fig. 1, K andL). These data demonstrate that local and global phosphorylation of vimentin by CaMKII was not due to local and global intracellular distribution of vimentin or CaMKII, thereby indicating that the spatial patterns of Ca2+ signaling were indeed transmitted by CaMKII to vimentin. We noted here that a small population of vimentin filaments in the processes of ionomycin- or PGF2α-stimulated astrocytes underwent structural alteration into partial granular aggregates, but not in unstimulated cells. Fig. 4 is an electron microscopic analysis of the CaMKII-phosphorylated vimentin filaments in astrocytes. Vimentin filaments in most of glial processes formed thick bundles running along glial processes (Fig. 4 A), as reported previously (32Fedoroff S. White R. Neal J. Subrahmanyan L. Kalnins V.I. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 7: 303-315Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, vimentin filaments in the aggregates were fragmented into short filaments running in random directions and thin glial processes appeared to form a varicosity there (Fig. 4 B). When examined by immunoelectron microscopy, the density of MO82 immunoreactive gold particles was higher on the aggregates of vimentin filaments (Fig. 4, C andD) compared with those on the filaments in other regions (Fig. 4, C and E). We counted the number of the gold particles per micrometer of vimentin filaments in Fig.4 C. The mean density of the particles in the aggregates of vimentin filaments was 11.7 particles/μm of filament, while that in the other regions was 2.9 particles/μm of filament. Similar data were obtained in three other samples. These data suggest that the filament reorganization occurs when the level of phosphorylation by CaMKII is very high. It is unclear whether the structural alteration observed here is a typical change of filament structure under control of cell signaling. Because the population of the fragmented filaments was very low, more minute and coordinated alteration of the filament dynamics not detectable by microscopy may predominate. However, these findings are consistent with in vitro data that vimentin filaments disassembled when phosphorylated by CaMKII (15Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The possibility that organization of intracellular vimentin filament networks is regulated by local and global phosphorylation by CaMKII would need to be considered. In conclusion, we visualized CaMKII signaling by monitoring the site-specific phosphorylation of vimentin and showed that the spatial patterns of Ca2+ signaling defined the intracellular distribution of vimentin phosphorylated by CaMKII. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of Ca2+ signaling were transmitted via CaMKII to vimentin, as a type of spatial information. Although the population was very low, the structural change of vimentin filaments observed here raises the possibility that spatial signaling from Ca2+ via CaMKII to vimentin may regulate the dynamics of vimentin filaments in astrocytes with spatial specificity. CaMKII phosphorylates a wide range of cellular proteins as well as vimentin (11Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Hashimoto Y. Fong Y.-L. Rich D.P. Smith M.K. Sodering T.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), therefore a population of CaMKII activity that could not be monitored by phosphorylation of vimentin might exist. Spatial signaling from Ca2+ via CaMKII to other substrates needs to be addressed in the future studies. We thank Drs. K. Fukunaga and E.

Our present results suggest the possible involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in the organization of the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of cisternae with dilated rims and is located in the perinuclear region via association with the microtubule organizing center. Although the principle of the organization of the Golgi apparatus is not fully understood, recent progress has revealed that a common fusion machinery works for vesicular traffic and the formation of cisternae from vesiculated Golgi membranes. Warren and co-workers (1Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G.

A 20 S NSF complex consisting of NSF, SNAPs, and SNAREs is known to mediate the fusion of transport vesicles with the target membranes in the exocytic and endocytotic pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 5Rothman J.E.

Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Since the structures of assembled Golgi cisternae by NSF and p97 are different from each other, it was postulated that the two proteins have different roles in the assembly of the Golgi apparatus (2Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.-M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Malhotra and co-workers (11Acharya U. McCaffery J.M. Jacobs R. Malhotra V. J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) also discovered the involvement of NSF and p97 in the assembly of vesiculated Golgi membranes. They found that IQ causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus to form small vesicles with 60–90 nm diameter (13Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and reconstituted the assembly of Golgi stacks from vesiculated Golgi membranes (11Acharya U. McCaffery J.M. Jacobs R. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the process of the assembly, NSF acts first to form larger vesicles of 300 nm diameter from small vesicles of 60–90 nm, and p97 plays a role in the formation of Golgi cisternae from larger vesicles (11Acharya U. McCaffery J.M. Jacobs R. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Acharya U. Jacobs R. Peters J.-M. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Malhotra V. Cell. 1995; 82: 895-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither GTPγS nor rab-GDI, inhibitors for intra-Golgi vesicular transport (14Melançon P. Glick B.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 794-797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked stack formation, suggesting that the mechanism of the assembly of vesiculated Golgi membranes is not exactly the same as that of intra-Golgi vesicular transport. We screened transport inhibitors using an intra-Golgi transport assay reconstituted in a cell-free system (16Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and found that NDGA, known as a dual inhibitor for lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenase, inhibits the transport assay (17Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Fukui T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A recent study using BHK-21 cells showed that NDGA, without affecting microtubules, blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane and retards the brefeldin A-mediated retrograde transport of mannosidase II (Man II) from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (18Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effect of NDGA on the Golgi apparatus in NRK cells. We found that NDGA causes reversible disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in a microtubule-independent manner. Interestingly, the effect of NDGA was markedly protected by AlF4−, an activator of the heterotrimeric but not the small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (19Higashijima T. Graziano M.P. Suga H. Kainosho M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15595-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using digitonin-permeabilized cells, we showed that GTPγS also blocks the NDGA-mediated disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. This effect of GTPγS was reversed by the addition of Gβγ. Our present results raise the possibility that heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the organization of the Golgi structure in cells. NDGA was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. and freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before use. Cycloheximide, AlCl3, and NaF were obtained from Wako Chemicals. Digitonin was obtained from Merck. C6-NBD-ceramide was obtained from Molecular Probes. Cholera toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories Inc. Pertussis toxin was purchased from Kaken Pherma. Plastic coverslips (Celldesk FL1) were purchased from Sumitomo Bakelite. A polyclonal antibody against the amino-terminal fragment (residues 1–10) of bovine Gβ was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin (clone DM1A), Man II (clone 53FC3), and protein disulfide isomerase were purchased from BioMakor, BAbCo, and Fuji Chemical Industry, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against Man II and β-COP were kindly donated by Dr. K. Moremen, University of Georgia, and Dr. Y. Ikehara, Fukuoka University, respectively. Gαβγ were prepared from bovine brain as described (21Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). βγ subunits were prepared as described (22Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified Gαβγ were incubated with 20 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h, and then Gβγ were isolated on a phenyl-Superose column. To prepare detergent-free Gβγ, the isolated Gβγ were extensively dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 125 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml glucose (buffer A). No significant precipitation was observed during dialysis. Immunoblotting confirmed no significant loss of the proteins during dialysis without detergents. Gβ1γ2 in 20 mmHEPES (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mmNaCl, and 0.7% CHAPS were kindly donated by Drs. Y. Kaziro and H. Itoh (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan). Bovine brain cytosol was prepared as described (23Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Shepherd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). NRK cells obtained from the Riken Cell Bank were grown on glass coverslips in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. NRK cells were washed twice with buffer A and then permeabilized with 40 μg/ml digitonin in the same buffer at 0 °C for 10 min. After washing with buffer A twice, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of the reaction mixture at 32 °C for 40 min. The reaction mixture contained buffer A, an ATP-regenerating system (final concentration 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 0.25 mm UTP, 0.05 mm ATP, and 12 IU/ml creatine kinase), and bovine brain cytosol (final concentration 1.5–2 mg/ml). NRK cells were pretreated with pertussis (0.1 μg/ml) or cholera (0.1 μg/ml) toxin for 16 h. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (24Tagaya M. Furuno A. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 466-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For electron microscopic analysis, cells were cultured on plastic coverslips and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After washing in distilled water, the cells were dehydrated in 50% ethanol for 10 min and block-stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 2 h. They were further dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol and were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were observed under a Hitachi H7000 electron microscope. NRK cells were incubated with NDGA at 37 °C for 30 min, and the distribution of the Golgi apparatus was analyzed with immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody against Man II, a medial Golgi marker protein. As shown in Fig.1, NDGA caused dispersion of Man II in a concentration-dependent manner. At 125–150 μm NDGA, the dispersed pattern of Man II was observed in more than 85% of cells. Microtubules play an important role in the perinuclear localization of the Golgi apparatus (25Rogalski A.A. Singer S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the morphology of microtubules was not affected by NDGA up to 150 μm (Fig. 1). When the Golgi apparatus was stained with C6-NBD-ceramide (26Pagano R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or rhodamine-conjugated WGA, the latter being known to bind to the trans-Golgi (27Tartakoff A.M. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), similar dispersed patterns were observed (Fig.2), indicating that the whole region of the Golgi apparatus is disassembled by NDGA.Figure 2Disassembly of the whole region of the Golgi apparatus by NDGA. NRK cells were incubated with 150 μm NDGA at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. The Golgi apparatus was stained with C6-NBD-ceramide and rhodamine-conjugated WGA.Bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The disassembly of the Golgi apparatus started at about 5 min after addition of NDGA and was completed at about 40 min (Fig.3). Upon removal of NDGA, the disassembled Golgi membranes started to reassemble, and complete Golgi stacks were formed at about 1 h (Fig. 3). The disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by NDGA did not occur in the presence of 50 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.05% azide (data not shown), implying the requirement of an energy for this process. We supposed that protein synthesis is not required for this process because NDGA has a strong inhibitory effect on protein synthesis of BHK-21 cells (18Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To ensure the blockage of protein synthesis, we added 20 μg/ml cycloheximide with NDGA throughout the experiments using intact cells. When cycloheximide was not added, the Golgi apparatus was disassembled in the same kinetics as that in the presence of cycloheximide (data not shown). Electron microscopic analysis confirmed the results of the immunofluorescence study (Fig. 4). At 15 min after addition of NDGA, Golgi membranes were converted into aggregates of small vesicles and tubulovesicular structures. At 50 min, no aggregates of vesicles were observed in the perinuclear region in many cells; instead, small vesicles appeared to be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Electron microscopic analysis also showed that no significant morphological changes occurred in mitochondria, the nucleus or the plasma membrane. A slight dilation of the ER was observed, but this phenomenon was generally observed when vesicular transport was inhibited. These results suggest that NDGA specifically affects the Golgi apparatus and the vesicular transport pathways. Brefeldin A causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and promotes the retrograde transport of Golgi components to the ER (for a review, see Ref. 28Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The effect by brefeldin A detectable within 30 s is the release of β-COP (29Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), a component of Golgi-derived transport vesicles (30Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 31Serafini T. Stenbeck G. Brecht A. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Nature. 1991; 349: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 32Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether or not β-COP is rapidly released from the Golgi apparatus by NDGA. When disassembly of the Golgi apparatus started at 5 min after addition of NDGA, β-COP was still associated with it (data not shown). In addition, β-COP was co-localized with Man II-containing vesicles even after complete disassembly occurred (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus is not due to the release of coat proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Recent studies revealed the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in the membrane traffic processes (for a review, see Ref. 33Nürnberg B. Ahnert-Hilger G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We examined whether or not heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. For this purpose, NRK cells were preincubated with or without AlF4− (50 μmAlCl3 and 30 mm NaF) at 37 °C for 10 min, and then NDGA was added at a final concentration of 125 μm, and incubation was continued for another 15 min. AlF4− is an activator of the heterotrimeric but not the small molecular weight G proteins (19Higashijima T. Graziano M.P. Suga H. Kainosho M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3396-3401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15595-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that AlF4− acts as a mnemonic for the γ-phosphate and activates the GDP-bound form of Gα. As shown in Fig. 6, the preincubation of cells with AlF4−markedly blocked the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by NDGA, whereas 50 μm AlCl3 alone did not exhibit such an effect. When AlF4− and NDGA were simultaneously added, some protective effect was detected but not as remarkable compared with the cells preincubated with AlF4− (data not shown). These results raise the possibility that heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by NDGA. When 150 μm NDGA was added, significant disassembly of the Golgi apparatus was observed even when cells were preincubated with AlF4− (data not shown). This may suggest that NDGA and AlF4− interact in a competitive manner. Electron microscopic analyses confirmed that the Golgi apparatus was not disassembled by NDGA when cells were preincubated with AlF4− (Fig.7).Figure 7Morphology of the Golgi apparatus incubated with NDGA in the absence or presence of AlF 4− .NRK cells were preincubated in the absence (A andB) or presence AlF4−(C) at 37 °C for 10 min and then incubated without (A) or with 125 μm NDGA (B andC) in the absence (B) or presence (C) of AlF4− for 15 min.

Digitonin was used for permeabilization because it selectively permeabilizes the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane but not other organelle membranes. This selectivity has allowed the reconstitution of a variety of membrane traffic events (34Diaz R. Stahl P.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We permeabilized NRK cells with 40 μg/ml digitonin at 0 °C for 10 min because under this condition the transport of vesicular stomatitis virus-encoded protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus could be reconstituted by the addition of an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol (36Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When permeabilized NRK cells were incubated with 60 μm NDGA in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system or cytosol at 32 °C for 40 min, the Golgi apparatus was considerably dispersed (Fig. 8 B). It is not certain whether or not this dispersion is relevant to the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in intact cells because ATP is required in the latter case. When an ATP-regenerating system was included in the assay, the Golgi apparatus was not significantly disassembled by NDGA (Fig.8 C). When permeabilized cells were incubated with 60 μm NDGA in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and bovine brain cytosol, the Golgi apparatus became dispersed throughout the cells (Fig. 8 D). The dispersion was remarkably suppressed when permeabilized cells were incubated in the presence of an ATP-depleting system and cytosol (data not shown), suggesting the requirement of ATP hydrolysis for this process. The dispersion pattern of the Golgi apparatus in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol was somewhat different from that in intact cells and rather similar to the ER pattern. Double staining revealed that the distribution of Man II significantly, but not completely, coincides with that of protein disulfide isomerase, an ER marker protein, suggesting that a part of Man II is redistributed to the ER (data not shown). β-COP was not co-localized with Man II in NDGA-treated permeabilized cells and rather seemed to be redistributed on vesicle-like structures at the perinuclear region (data not shown). This redistribution of β-COP might be related to the retrograde transport of Man II to the ER. At present we cannot reconstitute the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus without the redistribution of Man II to the ER. However, the dispersion of the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized cells was also blocked by AlF4− (data not shown), suggesting that the initial stage of the disassembly is relevant to that in intact cells. The requirement of a lower concentration of NDGA for the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus may reflect the fact that NDGA was partly adsorbed to serum components in the case of intact cells. Indeed, 60 μm NDGA was enough for complete disassembly of the Golgi apparatus when intact cells were incubated without fetal calf serum. When 20 μm GTPγS was added in the complete mixture containing an ATP-regenerating system, cytosol, and 60 μmNDGA, the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus was blocked (Fig.8 E). A similar result was observed when the concentration of GTPγS was 2 μm (data not shown). In contrast, addition of 20 μm AMPPNP (Fig. 8 F) or 2 μm ATPγS (data not shown) showed little effect. It should be noted that the concentration of ATP in the assay mixture is 50 μm. When 20 μm ATPγS was added, the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus was significantly suppressed. AMPPNP might be less effective than ATPγS with respect to the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis. These results suggest that the activation of GTP-binding proteins blocks the NDGA-induced disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. To exclude the possibility that small GTP-binding proteins are involved in the NDGA-promoted Golgi disassembly in permeabilized cells, we next examined the effect of βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins on the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. Gβγ bind to Gα but not toras-related small GTP-binding proteins (37Pang I.-H. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7814-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Bokoch G.M. Quilliam L.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the GDP-bound form of Gα is associated with Gβγ. When the bound GDP is replaced with GTP, Gα is activated and released from Gβγ. When excess Gβγ are present, Gα is associated with them, which results in the inactivation of Gα. If this scheme is also applicable to the case for the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, it is expected that the addition of Gβγ would prevent the effect of GTPγS and cause disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. As shown in Fig.9 D, addition of 1 μm detergent-free Gβγ to the assay mixture containing GTPγS resulted in disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, addition of buffer alone had no effect (data not shown). Furthermore, Gβγ alone did not significantly cause disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in the absence of NDGA (Fig. 9 E). Similar results were obtained when 180 nm Gβ1γ2 were used instead of Gβγ (data not shown). In this case, the assay mixture contained 0.014% CHAPS, which was derived from a solution containing Gβ1γ2. This concentration of CHAPS without Gβ1γ2 had no significant effect on the Golgi morphology (data not shown). Pertussis and cholera toxins are useful tools for determining which type of heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in signal transduction (39Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormik F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 40Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of α-subunit of Gi, which results in the uncoupling of the Gi from activation. Cholera toxin, on the other hand, catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs, which results in constitutive activation of the Gs. We next examined the effect of pertussis and cholera toxins on the NDGA-promoted disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. When pertussis toxin- or cholera toxin-treated cells were incubated with NDGA, the Golgi apparatus was disassembled by NDGA as in the case of nontreated cells (data not shown), suggesting that heterotrimeric G proteins involved in the process of the disassembly are different from pertussis toxin- or cholera toxin-sensitive ones. In the first half of this study, we showed that NDGA causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus of NRK cells in a dose-, time-, and energy-dependent manner. Ikehara 2Y. Ikehara, personal communication. at Fukuoka University also obtained similar results. A kinetic analysis using electron microscopy revealed that the Golgi apparatus is first converted to aggregates of small vesicles and then dispersed. Although microtubules were not disassembled by NDGA, disassembled Golgi vesicles seemed to be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast to brefeldin A (29Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), NDGA did not promote the rapid release of β-COP, a component of COP-coated vesicles (30Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 31Serafini T. Stenbeck G. Brecht A. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Nature. 1991; 349: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 32Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 349: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Since no significant morphological changes were observed in mitochondria, the nucleus, or the plasma membrane, it is obvious that NDGA interacts with a limited number of components involved in the organization of the Golgi apparatus. Malhotra and co-workers (13Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 41Veit B. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that IQ causes the Golgi apparatus to break down. There are several differences in the effect of the two compounds. First, NDGA strongly inhibits protein synthesis (18Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas IQ does not (13Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Second, NDGA does not disassemble microtubules, whereas IQ does (41Veit B. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by IQ is not due to this effect because the disassembly occurs even when microtubules are stabilized by Taxol (41Veit B. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Third, NDGA causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in a limited number of cell lines. No remarkable disassembly of the Golgi apparatus was observed when BHK-21, PC12, COS7, HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary or L-cells were incubated with 100–125 μm NDGA (Ref. 18Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and data not shown). The target molecules for NDGA may have different sensitivities to the compound in different cell lines. On the other hand, IQ causes the Golgi apparatus to break down in a wide variety of cell lines (13Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, the fundamental mechanism of the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus appears to be quite similar between NDGA and IQ. IQ causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus, but not the nuclear envelope, in a time- and energy-dependent manner. The Golgi apparatus is converted to aggregates of small vesicles and tubulovesicular structures and then dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. β-COP is not rapidly released by IQ. The similarities in the effects of IQ and NDGA strongly suggest that their target molecules are the same or, as described below, one of the components in the heterotrimeric G protein-signal transduction pathway. In the latter half of this study, using intact and digitonin-permeabilized NRK cells, we obtained several lines of evidence that heterotrimeric G proteins are involved in the NDGA-promoted disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. First, AlF4− markedly prevented this disassembly in intact cells and digitonin-permeabilized cells. Second, GTPγS had the same effect in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Third and most convincing, Gβγ suppressed the effect of GTPγS. These results strongly suggest that NDGA causes the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus via a pathway involving heterotrimeric G proteins. Recent data indicate that heterotrimeric G proteins are present on the Golgi apparatus and regulate vesicular transport. The first suggestion came from the finding that AlF4−inhibits intra-Golgi protein transport in a cell-free system (14Melançon P. Glick B.S. Malhotra V. Weidman P.J. Serafini T. Gleason M.L. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A later study revealed that Gαi3 is present on the Golgi apparatus and regulates the secretion of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in LLC-PK1 cells (42Stow J.L. de Almeida J.B. Narula N. Holtzman E.J. Ercolani L. Ausiello D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, Gs and Gi regulate the apical and basolateral transport pathways, respectively (43Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, the formation of large dense core vesicles is inhibited by Gi and stimulated by Gs (44Leyte A. Barr F.A. Kehlenbach R.H. Huttner W.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4795-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Denkeret al. (45Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Gαs, Gi, and Gαq/11 are present on the Golgi apparatus. Our present finding points to a new role of heterotrimeric G proteins: regulation of the organization of the Golgi apparatus. We previously suggested that the target molecules for NDGA may be phospholipase A2 (17Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Fukui T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observation that phospholipase A2 inhibitors, such as unsaturated fatty acids and analogues of arachidonic acid including NDGA, inhibit intra-Golgi protein transport (17Tagaya M. Henomatsu N. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Fukui T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If this were true, the present results could be explained as follows. The structure of the Golgi apparatus may be maintained by phospholipase A2, which is downstream in heterotrimeric G protein-signaling. Therefore, inhibition of this activity by NDGA would cause disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. Activators for heterotrimeric G proteins through transducing signals may somehow enhance the activity of the inhibited phospholipase A2 and block the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus. We examined whether the addition of arachidonic acid or hog pancreas phospholipase A2 reverses the effects of NDGA in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Either molecule failed to prevent the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by NDGA (data not shown). Therefore, we do not prefer this possibility. Another possibility in our mind is that NDGA may directly interact with heterotrimeric G proteins, which are insensitive to pertussis and cholera toxins. This is suggested by the finding that NDGA and AlF4−interact in a competitive manner. The heterotrimeric G proteins involved in the organization of the Golgi apparatus are most likely different from the one that regulates the association of β-COP with the Golgi apparatus (46Donaldson J.G. Kahn R.A. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) because the latter is known to be sensitive to pertussis toxin (47Ktistakis N.T. Linder M.E. Roth M.G. Nature. 1992; 356: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The lack of the rapid release of β-COP from the Golgi apparatus by NDGA in intact cells is consistent with this idea. Recently, Gz, formally a member of the Gifamily, was found to be inactivated by arachidonate and related unsaturated fatty acids (48Glick J. Santoyo G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2949-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this protein is insensitive to pertussis toxin (49Casey P.J. Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Gz is predominately expressed in platelets and neurons, this does not necessarily mean that this protein is not expressed in other types of cells. NSF, which consists of general fusion machinery for vesicular transport in cells, is also predominantly expressed in neurons (50Püschel A.W. O'Connor V. Betz H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,51Hong R.-M. Mori H. Fukui T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. Tagaya M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). How do heterotrimeric G proteins regulate the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus? One possible explanation is that heterotrimeric G proteins on the Golgi apparatus transduce signals in a way similar to those on the plasma membrane. In this scenario, signal molecules bind to receptors upstream of heterotrimeric G proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins modulate enzyme activities in the signaling pathway, and finally the Golgi apparatus is disassembled. Another possibility is that heterotrimeric G proteins on the Golgi apparatus may transduce signals in a different way from that on the plasma membrane. This possibility is raised by the finding that Gβγ may not be on the Golgi apparatus (45Denker S.P. McCaffery J.M. Palade G.E. Insel P.A. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since no signals were required for constitutive vesicular transport, heterotrimeric G proteins may be regulated by a mechanism other than by signals formed by the interaction between signal molecules and their receptors. At the onset of mitosis, the Golgi apparatus is converted into small vesicles in both COP-I-dependent and -independent pathways (3Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 4Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the vesiculated membranes are equally dispersed in the mitotic cytoplasm (52Lucocq J.M. Warren G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3239-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 53Lucocq J.M. Pryde J.G. Berger E.G. Warren G. J.

This disassembly may be due to the continuance of budding of vesicles and the inhibition of their fusion (55Warren G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 439-443Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We do not know whether or not the mechanism of the NDGA-induced disassembly of the Golgi apparatus is exactly the same as that of the break down of the Golgi apparatus at the onset of mitosis. Further study is required to address this question. We thank Drs. Y. Kaziro and H. Itoh for the donation of Gβ1γ2 and helpful comments on the purification of Gαβγ and Dr. K.

In this report, we demonstrated that Raf-1 protein kinase activity in the mouse parotid glands was induced by chronic isoproterenol administration in whole animals. To investigate the molecular nature underlying cellular responses to Raf-1 activation, we have stably transfected rat salivary epithelial Pa-4 cells with human Raf-1-estrogen receptor fusion gene (ΔRaf-1:ER) and used mRNA differential display in search of messages induced by ΔRaf-1:ER activation. Through this approach, the gene encoding non-histone chromosomal protein HMGI-C was identified as one of the target genes activated by oncogenic Raf-1 kinase. Activation of Raf-1 kinase resulted in a delayed and sustained increase of HMGI-Cexpression in the Pa-4 cells. The induction of HMGI-CmRNA level is sensitive to both the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. The role of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in theHMGI-C induction was highlighted by the result that the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD 98059, blocked ΔRaf-1:ER- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulatedHMGI-C induction.

Results from biochemical and genetic studies have emphasized that members of the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases (Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf) are the pivotal components of intracellular signal transduction pathways that relay signals from a plethora of activated cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular effectors (4Marshall C.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Although ERK1 and ERK2 are likely to be the essential mediators of Raf-1 action, there are situations in which Raf-1 exerts biological effects in the absence of detectable ERK1/2 activation (15Buscher D. Dello Sbarba P. Hipskind R.A. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. Baccarini M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kizaka Kondoh S. Okayama H.

Recent observations that Raf-1 activates cdc25 protein phosphatase in HeLa cells (19Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and p70 S6 kinase in Chinese hamster ovary cells (20Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) support the idea that there are branch points in the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that Raf-1 activates JNK (c-Jun terminal kinase) in 3T3 cells through an autocrine manner (21McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that these different pathways are not mutually exclusive and could be activated in a cell type-specific manner to mediate intracellular signaling events.The pathway linking G protein-coupled receptors to Raf-1 activation is still poorly understood. Recent reports indicate that the Raf-1 signaling pathway can be activated by a number of receptors linked to Gi, Gq, or Gs. For example, triggering of α2-adrenergic receptor (22Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22235-22238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), m1 muscarinic receptor (23Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), and α1- and β-adrenergic receptors (24Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. Circ.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) can all potently stimulate ERK activities. Moreover, the activation of MAP kinase appears not to be exclusively linked to cell proliferation. Accumulating evidence has suggested that persistent activation of the MAP kinase might lead to cell differentiation or hypertrophy in a cell type-specific manner (5Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). For instance, the sustained ERK activation following stimulation by nerve growth factor is believed to be necessary and sufficient for PC12 cell differentiation and neurite outgrowth (26Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent evidence using antisense RNA against ERKs suggests that ERK activation results in a hypertrophy of the cardiac myocytes (27Glennon P.E. Kaddoura S. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Using the β-adrenergic model of salivary hyperplasia/hypertrophy, we and others have shown previously that stimulation with β-agonist isoproterenol results in a transient induction of immediate-early gene (c-fos and c-jun) expression, followed by a delayed induction of tissue-specific proline-rich protein gene expression and the enlargement of mouse and rat salivary glands (28Ann D.K. Lin H.H. Kousvelau E. CRC Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1997; 8: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An understanding of molecular processes that contribute to salivary adaptive responses may provide new insights into cell signaling and mechanisms controlling long-term cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. In this study, we showed that chronic exposure of mice to the β-agonist isoproterenol effectively activates Raf-1 protein kinase activity in the parotid glands. To correlate salivary-specific gene expression with Raf-1 activation, we have attempted to identify the target gene(s) regulated by the activated Raf-1 kinase pathway in the salivary Pa-4 cells. To this end we present evidence that persistent activation of Raf-1 kinase using the regulatable and oncogenic form of Raf-1, ΔRaf-1:ER (29Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), induces the expression of non-histone chromosomal protein HMGI-C.HMGI-C protein belongs to the family of HMGI(Y). The HMGI(Y) family of proteins is barely detectable in the differentiated adult tissues. Developmental studies revealed that the mouse HMGI-C gene is expressed predominantly during the embryogenesis prior to 15.5 days post-coitum (30Zhou X. Benson K.F. Przybysz K. Liu J. Hou Y. Cherath L. Chada K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The exact biological function of HMGI-C is less well defined. There is evidence that suggests that the disruption of theHMGI-C gene causes growth retardation in pygmy mice (31Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). HMGI-C protein has been inferred to play a role in cell proliferation, based on the observation that HMGI-C is abundant in the fully transformed cells (32Giancotti V. Buratti E. Perissin L. Zorzet S. Balmain A. Portella G. Fusco A. Goodwin G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, dysregulation ofHMGI-C expression has also been assumed to be one of the causative factors involved in the development of various human tumors such as lipoma, uterine leiomyoma, and pleomorphic salivary adenoma (34Schoenmakers E.F. Wanschura S. Mols R. Bullerdiek J. Van den Berghe H. Van de Ven W.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 35Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Using antisense technology to block HMGI-C protein synthesis, the retrovirally induced neoplastic transformation of rat thyroid cells is suppressed (33Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that one of the specific changes brought about during the transformation process is the constitutive elevation of HMGI-C expression, and the induction of HMGI-C expression is directly correlated with cell transformation. However, the specific signaling pathway and molecular mechanism activating HMGI-C expression are still elusive. The results described here go further in characterizing the mechanism governing HMGI-C gene activation. By analyzing the expression pattern of HMGI-C steady state mRNA in cells treated with inhibitors of transcription or protein synthesis, in the presence of Raf-1 activator, we propose that the HMGI-C gene is a secondary response gene to Raf-1 activation. We also present evidence that there is a direct link between the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module and the induction of transformation-associated chromosomal architectural proteinHMGI-C expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report that delineates the signaling pathway that activatesHMGI-C expression. Our finding may provide a key element to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying salivary adaptive responses and cell transformation in general.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Stable TransfectionThe normal rat parotid acinar cell line Pa-4, also known as parotid C5 cells (36Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was plated on Primaria culture dishes (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (1.1 μm), and glutamate (5 mm) and were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air at 35 °C. All culture media contained 60 μg/ml kanamycin monosulfate. The stably transfected Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER clonal cell line was established by transfecting Pa-4 cells with plasmid pLNCΔRaf-1:ER (29Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) by a LipofectAMINETM-mediated method according to the standard procedure suggested by the manufacturer. After selection with Geneticin (G418, 600 μg/ml), the resistant clones were isolated. The clone that displayed the highest stimulation of ΔRaf-1:ER activity upon estradiol addition was selected and recloned for further studies. The Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 (1:1, phenol red-free) medium supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum plus the above-mentioned factors. β-Estradiol (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and stored at 1 mm in −20 °C. PD 98059 was purchased from Calbiochem and was stored at 20 mm in Me2SO at −20 °C.Isoproterenol Treatment and Preparation of Mouse Parotid and Cell ExtractsIsoproterenol was administered as described previously (36Lin H.H. Tu Z.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27637-27644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); each mouse received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg ofdl-isoproterenol HCl in 0.5 ml of 140 mmNaCl for the periods indicated. Mice were sacrificed at 30 min after the last injection, and the parotid glands were removed surgically. After being rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the isolated glands (0.1–0.2 g) were homogenized immediately in 1–2 ml of gold lysis buffer (GLB (29Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar)) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmtetrasodium PPi, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate at 4 °C. The homogenates were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The cell extracts from Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells were prepared in the same manner.mRNA Differential DisplayTotal RNA was isolated from untreated Pa-4 cells and estradiol-treated Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells using the TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The isolated RNA was then treated with RNase-free DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions to remove any DNA contaminant. Differential display PCR reaction was carried out using RNAimage™ 1 and 2 kits (GenHunter), and a total of 48 different primer pairs were used with [35S]dATP included in the reaction mixture to label the PCR products. The radiolabeled cDNA fragments were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography. The differentially expressed bands were identified and excised from the gel. The cDNA fragment was eluted from the gel by boiling the gel slice in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA (TE) solution. After ethanol precipitation, the cDNAs were amplified by a second round of PCR using corresponding primer pairs. PCR samples were then electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. The DNA bands were recovered from the gel and used, after labeling, as probes for Northern blot analyses. Northern blots confirm the authenticity of the differences in mRNA expression levels between parental Pa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells as demonstrated by the differential display. After confirmation, PCR products were subsequently cloned into pCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter) and subjected to DNA sequencing analyses using the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham). For further sequencing analyses, cDNA clones were isolated by screening a rat parotid cDNA library, synthesized by us, using the 32P-labeled fragments obtained from mRNA differential display as probes. Comparison of DNA sequence homology with the GenBankTM and the EMBL data bases was performed using the BLAST program (37Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69113) Google Scholar).Western AnalysisEqual amounts of protein from mouse parotid-soluble extracts or cell-soluble lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and the membranes were incubated with anti-Raf-1 antibody (C-12, Santa Cruz) or anti-eIF-2α antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Roger Duncan, USC). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham) were used to detect bound antibodies.Kinase AssaysRaf-1 Immune Complex Kinase AssayRaf-1 kinase activity was analyzed by the immune complex kinase assay as modified from Samuelset al. (29Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitation of endogenous p74raf-1 or ΔRaf-1:ER was carried out by incubating 1 mg of soluble tissue extract protein or 100 μg of soluble cell lysate protein in 1 ml of GLB with 1 μg of either anti-Raf-1 antibody (C-12, Santa Cruz) or anti-ER antibody (HC-20, Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of GLB each after addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) to the reaction mixtures and incubation at 4 °C with rotation for 2 h. The in vitro kinase activities of p74raf-1 and ΔRaf-1:ER were assessed by incubating the immune complexes in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μmATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 100 ng of recombinant MEK1 (Santa Cruz) as substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was resolved through a 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film to visualize the level of rMEK phosphorylation.Assay for MEK1Briefly, 100 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-MEK1 (C-18, Santa Cruz) antiserum for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation as described in the assay for Raf-1. The in vitro MEK kinase assay was carried out by incubating the immune complexes in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 40 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 600 ng of recombinant p42ERK2 protein (Santa Cruz) as substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to membranes and exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography.ERK Immune Complex Kinase AssayBriefly, 100 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with 2 μg of goat anti-ERK2 IgG (C-14, Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) to the reaction mixture and incubating with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C, and the pellets were recovered by centrifugation. The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of cold GLB each, and one more time with buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v). The in vitro kinase activities of ERK1/2 were determined by incubating immune complexes in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 40 mmMgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. The protein G plus-agarose beads were spun down, and the supernatant was electrophoresed through a 16.5% SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film to determine the ERK1/2 activities by visualizing MBP phosphorylation.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal cellular RNA (20 μg) from Pa-4 and estradiol-treated Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 mm formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membranes, and UV-crosslinked. The prehybridization and hybridization steps were carried out using QuickHyb solution from Stratagene according to manufacturer's instructions. Each differentially expressed cDNA fragment from mRNA differential display or HMGI-C cDNA insert was32P-labeled and used as the hybridization probes. The same filters were hybridized with a rat β-actin probe to ensure the quality of RNA prepared and that the same amount of RNA was loaded in each lane. After washing at a stringent condition, the membranes were then subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C using double-intensifying screens. The membranes were also quantified by electronic autoradiography with an Instantimager 228 (Packard Instrument Co.) to obtain radioactivity quantitation of each band for comparative analysis.Measurement of Cloning Efficiency in AgarosePa-4 and Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells were plated at 2,000 cells per 35-mm culture dish in 1 ml of 0.35% (w/v) low-melting-temperature agarose solution diluted with medium in the absence or presence of 1 μm estradiol. Different concentrations of PD 98059 were also added together with estradiol to the Pa-4ΔRaf-1:ER cells. The 1-ml overlay medium was changed every 3 days with freshly added estradiol and PD 98059. After 28 days, the cells were stained with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ((MTT), 0.2 mg/ml). The stained plates were photographed, and the number of colonies greater than 0.4 mm in diameter was counted and analyzed.DISCUSSIONA central goal in the field of molecular biology and signal transduction biology is to elucidate the mechanism through which short-lived signals, emanating from the surface of the cell, can be conveyed internally to effect long-term adaptive changes in cellular behavior, such as proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. In the present study we set out to investigate the signaling pathway linking β-adrenergic receptor stimulation to the activation of Raf-1 protein kinase in whole animals. We found that daily isoproterenol administration of the β-agonist isoproterenol induced a delayed activation of Raf-1 activities in the mouse parotid glands. It is of interest to note that the kinetics of Raf-1 activation correlates with the time course of the enlargement of mouse parotid glands as well as the time course for the induction of salivary-specific proline-rich protein gene expression following daily isoproterenol injection (28Ann D.K. Lin H.H. Kousvelau E. CRC Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1997; 8: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, our observation of a time-dependent Raf-1 kinase activation by isoproterenol treatment suggests that Raf-1 may play a critical role in promoting long-term adaptive changes in rodent salivary glands. Most of these changes in salivary glands are believed to be brought about by modulating gene expression at the level of transcription or post-transcriptional modification (49Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 50Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). For this reason, the mechanism by which altered gene expression occurs in response to Raf-1 activation in salivary cells is an important topic. The availability of estradiol-regulated forms of Raf-1 kinase provides a unique opportunity for us to express the conditional form of Raf-1 kinase in salivary epithelial Pa-4 cells to investigate biochemical mechanism underlying long-term cellular adaptive response to Raf-1 activation. We report here that the HMGI-C gene is one of the target genes that respond to Raf-1 activation.The result from the actinomycin D experiment implies that the increase in steady-state HMGI-C mRNA levels is a result of transcriptional activation rather than enhanced mRNA stability. In addition, HMGI-C gene expression responds to Raf-1 activation after a lag of more than 2 h and requires ongoing protein synthesis. Taken together, a mechanism different from that of the primary response or early response genes is likely to be involved in regulating HMGI-C gene expression. Many genes are classified as the immediate-early Raf-1 response genes based on the original definition of a transcriptional response to Raf-1 activation that is both insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors and transient. Three of the best known examples among these immediate-early Raf-1 response genes are the c-fos (51Eldredge E.R. Korf G.M. Christensen T.A. Connolly D.C. Getz M.J. Maihle N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7527-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), egr-1 (52Mundschau L.J. Forman L.W. Weng H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16137-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and HB-EGF (21McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 53McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Ramirez J.J.G. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, very little work has been done to identify and characterize the secondary response genes to Raf-1 activation. Analysis of the Raf-1 response element(s) inHMGI-C promoter/enhancer should provide new insights into the important factors involved in this adaptive response to Raf-1 activation.To demonstrate that HMGI-C induction by Raf-1 activation is mediated via an ERK-dependent pathway, we have shown that TPA, known as a protein kinase C activator, is capable of modulatingHMGI-C expression (Fig. 5 B). It has been reported that protein kinase C stimulates ERK activation through a direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 (47K"

Here we studied the effect of human arterial proteoglycans on proteolytic fusion of LDL in vitro. For this purpose, an assay was devised based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer that allowed continuous monitoring of fusion of proteoglycan-bound LDL particles. We found that addition of human arterial proteoglycans markedly increased the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL. The glycosaminoglycans isolated from the proteoglycans also increased the rate of fusion, demonstrating that this effect was produced by the negatively charged sulfated polysaccharides in the proteoglycans. Furthermore, heparin, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and dextran sulfate, three commercially available sulfated polysaccharides, also increased the rate of LDL fusion, with heparin and chondroitin 6-sulfate being as effective as and dextran sulfate more effective than human proteoglycans. The ability of the sulfated polysaccharides to increase the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL depended critically on their ability to form insoluble complexes with LDL, which, in turn, resulted in an increased rate of LDL proteolysis and, in consequence, in an increased rate of LDL fusion. The results reveal a novel mechanism regulating LDL fusion and point to the potentially important role of arterial proteoglycans in the generation of LDL-derived lipid droplets in the arterial intima during atherogenesis.

Human atherosclerosis is characterized by an initial accumulation of lipid in the extracellular matrix of the arterial intima in the form of lipid droplets and vesicles (1Pasquinelli G. Preda P. Vici M. Gargiulo M. Stella A. D'Addato M. Laschi R. Scanning Microsc. 1989; 3: 1151-1159PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tirziu D. Dobrian A. Tasca C. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 112: 101-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There is substantial evidence that a fraction of the lipid droplets is derived directly from plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); PG, proteoglycan; RET, resonance energy transfer; Pyr10CE, cholesteryl 1-pyrenedecanoate; BODIPY-CE, cholesteryl 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoate (cholesteryl BODIPY® FL C12); CETP, cholesterol ester transfer protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; GAG, glycosaminoglycan. particles that have entered the intima (3Smith E.B.

However, the mechanisms leading to the extracellular accumulation of lipid are difficult to study in man: human atherosclerosis takes a long time to develop, and serial samples from areas susceptible to atherosclerosis are impossible to obtain in man. In hypercholesterolemic experimental animals, accumulation of extracellular lipid in the arterial intima is much faster. Thus, in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, lipid accumulation similar to that observed microscopically in human atherosclerosis develops in months (5Frank J.S. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits, in days to weeks (5Frank J.S. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mora R. Lupu F. Simionescu N. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 67: 143-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 925-936PubMed Google Scholar). The most rapid accumulation of lipid droplets and vesicles in the arterial intima so far observed was in New Zealand White rabbits that had been infused intravenously with large amounts of human LDL (8Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Fogelman A.M. Mottino G. Frank J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these animals, extracellular accumulation of aggregates of lipid droplets was found in the subendothelially located proteoglycan (PG)-rich layer of the arterial intima as little as 2 h after the infusion. This experiment provided two valuable insights into the initiation of atherosclerosis: (i) in the normal arterial intima, extracellular lipid droplets can be formed directly from plasma LDL (in contrast to being first taken up by intimal cells and then released from these cells), and (ii) formation of lipid droplets from LDL particles (particle fusion) in the extracellular matrix can be rapid. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that LDL particles in the fluid phase do not fuse until they have undergone modifications that labilize their structure (9Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Pentikäinen M.O. Lehtonen E.M.P. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2638-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the arterial intima, however, a fraction of the LDL particles is bound to PGs (11Camejo G. Adv. Lipid Res. 1982; 19: 1-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and so it is possible for fusion to take place between the particles of this bound fraction. Indeed, by electron microscopic techniques, proteolytic fusion of heparin PG-bound LDL has been observed on the surface of mast cell granules in vitro (12Kokkonen J.O. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10749-10755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present methods cannot monitor the kinetics of fusion between LDL particles bound to PGs. Therefore, we devised an LDL fusion assay based on measurement of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (RET), a method widely used in liposome fusion studies (13Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). RET occurs when an excited fluorescent probe molecule excites a different fluorescent probe molecule in its close proximity. Different fluorescent probes in the core lipids of separate LDL particles are, on average, too far apart for RET to occur, but during fusion, mixing of the core lipids of the LDL particles brings the fluorescent probes into close proximity, thus allowing RET. In our experiments, we incorporated Pyr10CE and BODIPY-CE, two cholesteryl ester analogues with different fluorescent spectra, into the core lipids of two different samples of LDL particles and studied LDL fusion in a mixture of the two LDL preparations. In this system, RET can be detected by monitoring BODIPY emission upon excitation of the pyrene. This method made it possible, for the first time, to compare the rates of LDL fusion in the fluid phase and when bound to PGs. We found that fusion of LDL is faster when the particles are bound to PGs. Chymostatin, α-chymotrypsin (from bovine pancreas), dextran sulfate sodium salt (M r = 5000), Dextralip 50, and heparin were from Sigma. Pyr10CE and BODIPY-CE were from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.050 g/ml) was isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation (14Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). LDL was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate as described previously (9Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Apolipoprotein B-100 of LDL was tritiated by the Bolton-Hunter procedure (15Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar) to yield [3H]apoB-100. The amounts and concentrations of LDL are expressed in terms of protein. Purification of CETP was started from plasmapheresis plasma, which was ultracentrifuged at a density of 1.21 g/ml, and the density fraction d > 1.21 g/ml was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650(M) column (5.0 × 15 cm) and run essentially as described by Ohnishi et al. (16Ohnishi T. Yokoyama S. Yamamoto A. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing CETP activity were pooled and applied to a 1.5 × 8.5-cm heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. During this step, the two plasma lipid transfer proteins can be separated: the phospholipid transfer protein binds to the column, and CETP elutes in the unbound fraction (17Jauhiainen M. Metso J.

The unbound CETP-active fraction was dialyzed against Mono Q anion-exchanger equilibration buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) and then applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and run using a Merck-Hitachi HPLC system. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.5 m) prepared in equilibration buffer. The CETP-active fractions eluted in the NaCl range of 80–110 mm and were stored at −20 °C until use. The activity of CETP in the different purified batches varied between 20 and 30 nmol of cholesteryl esters transferred per h/ml. Purified CETP did not contain phospholipid transfer protein, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, or hepatic lipase activity, nor were these proteins detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies against phospholipid transfer protein, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, or hepatic lipase. Microemulsions were prepared essentially as described (18Via D.P. Craig I.F. Jacobs G.W. Van Winkle W.B. Charlton S.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Smith L.C. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a typical preparation, 5866 nmol of cholesteryl linoleate, 845 nmol of triolein, 1411 nmol of cholesterol, 1970 nmol of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine, and 652 nmol of either Pyr10CE or BODIPY-CE in chloroform were combined, and the solvent was removed under a stream of nitrogen. Any residual solvent was removed by vacuum desiccation for 2 h. The lipids were dissolved in 200 μl of dry 2-propanol, heated to 60 °C, and injected in 66-μl aliquots into 1.1 ml of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) at 18 °C (18Via D.P. Craig I.F. Jacobs G.W. Van Winkle W.B. Charlton S.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Smith L.C. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 570-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microemulsions containing either Pyr10CE or BODIPY-CE were incubated with 6 mg of LDL in the presence of 450 μl of CETP in 4.5 ml of buffer A for 20 h at 37 °C. The probe-containing lipoproteins were separated from the CETP and donor microemulsions by density gradient ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography. Briefly, the density of the samples was adjusted to 1.019 g/ml by addition of 310 μl of d= 1.21 g/ml KBr solution, and the samples were layered over 2 ml ofd = 1.1 g/ml KBr solution. The samples were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Ti-50 rotor (Beckman Instruments), and the LDL in the middle of the tube was collected. The LDL preparations were applied to a Bio-Gel A-5m column (1 × 60 cm) and eluted with buffer A at 6 ml/h. Fractions containing native-sized LDL were pooled, analyzed, and used for the experiments. The mass compositions of LDL, Pyr10CE-LDL, and BODIPY-CE-LDL were 5.8, 5.2, and 7.2% triacylglycerol; 7.8, 5.7, and 5.3% free cholesterol; 34, 33, and 32% cholesteryl ester; 26, 29, and 29% phospholipids and 26, 27, and 26% protein, respectively. The amounts of Pyr10CE and BODIPY-CE incorporated into LDL were 9.4 and 10.5 nmol/mg of apoB-100, respectively. Native LDL, Pyr10CE-LDL, and BODIPY-CE-LDL eluted from a heparin affinity column at 271, 275, and 276 mm NaCl, respectively, revealing that incorporation of fluorescent probes did not influence the strength of binding between LDL and glycosaminoglycans. PGs from the intima/media of human aortas obtained at autopsy within 24 h of accidental death were prepared exactly as described (19Paananen K. Saarinen J. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The disaccharide composition of PGs was analyzed by HPLC using a 5-μm NH2 column after treatment of PGs with chondroitinases ABC and AC (20Macek J. Krajickova J. Adam M. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 414: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The PG preparation contained 56% chondroitin 6-sulfate, 25% chondroitin 4-sulfate, and 19% dermatan sulfate. The amounts of PGs are expressed in terms of their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. For typical experiments, equal amounts of Pyr10CE-LDL and BODIPY-CE-LDL were mixed and dialyzed against buffer B (6 mm KCl, 4.4 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2). The mixture (containing 50 μg/ml Pyr10CE-LDL and 50 μg/ml BODIPY-CE-LDL) was then incubated in the presence and absence of the indicated amounts of α-chymotrypsin and the indicated amounts of PGs or GAGs in buffer B supplemented with 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene at 37 °C. Chymostatin was able to fully inhibit proteolysis and fusion of LDL, demonstrating that fusion of LDL was caused by chymotryptic activity of the α-chymotrypsin preparation used in this study. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 37 °C with a Hitachi F-4000 spectrofluorophotometer equipped with a thermostated cuvette holder. Excitation and emission slit widths were set at 1.5 and 10 nm, respectively, in all experiments except those for measurement of the fractions from size-exclusion chromatography, where the slits were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 346 and 395 nm for direct excitation of pyrene, at 346 and 530 nm for indirect excitation of BODIPY, and at 510 and 530 nm for direct excitation of BODIPY. RET is expressed as the ratio of indirect to direct excitation of BODIPY. The base line of RET (∼0.04) is caused by direct excitation of BODIPY at 346 nm. Modified LDL (250 μg in 250 μl) was cast into a 2% GTG low-melting-point agarose gel. Small pieces of the gel were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde at +4 °C for 18 h. The fixed samples were stained with the osmium/tannic acid/para-phenylenediamine technique as described (21Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1319-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and processed for electron microscopy. Thin sections were viewed in a Jeol JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope at the Institute of Biotechnology, Electron Microscopy, University of Helsinki (Helsinki, Finland). Protein was determined by the method of Lowryet al. (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Glycosaminoglycans were assayed by the method of Bartold and Page (23Bartold P.M. Page R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using commercial heparin as standard. Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured enzymatically (24Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VCH Verlagsgellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 1-160Google Scholar) using commercial reagents (Boehringer Mannheim). Phospholipids were assayed with the phospholipase D/choline oxidase/peroxidase method (25Takayama M. Itoh S. Nagasaki T. Tanimizu I. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 79: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) using commercial reagents (Wako Bioproducts). The activity of α-chymotrypsin was assayed spectrophotometrically usingN-benzoyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester as substrate exactly as described (26Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18134-18140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester unit of chymotryptic activity induces a change of 0.001 absorbance units/min at 256 nm. We incorporated Pyr10CE and BODIPY-CE into the core lipids of different samples of LDL particles and studied the effect of α-chymotrypsin on LDL fusion in a mixture of the two LDL preparations by measuring RET. As shown in Fig. 1, incubation of Pyr10CE-LDL and BODIPY-CE-LDL in the presence, but not in the absence, of α-chymotrypsin led to a rapid increase in RET. The small increase in RET in LDL incubated in the absence of α-chymotrypsin is not caused by spontaneous aggregation or fusion of the particles since at 24 h 95% of the particles eluted in the position of native LDL in size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Size-exclusion chromatography of LDL particles proteolyzed for 48 h (Fig. 2) showed that the large particles that eluted in the void volume of the column displayed a high RET, which gradually decreased toward the fractions containing native-sized LDL, which displayed a RET similar to that of native LDL particles (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that after a prolonged incubation of LDL with α-chymotrypsin, no intact apoB-100 is left (10Pentikäinen M.O. Lehtonen E.M.P. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2638-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments using size-exclusion chromatography have shown that after such proteolysis, both LDL eluting in the void volume and LDL eluting at the position of native LDL have lower protein/lipid ratios than native LDL (19Paananen K. Saarinen J. Annila A. Kovanen P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, proteolysis of LDL particles alone does not lead to an increased RET, whereas fusion of the proteolyzed LDL particles does. In a preliminary experiment, we found that also vortexing LDL, a method shown to generate both fused and aggregated LDL particles (27Guyton J.R. Klemp K.F. Mims M.P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased RET. Thus, at 15 s, RET was increased from 0.58 to 0.74, and at 60 s, RET plateaued at 0.92.Figure 2Effect of particle size on resonance energy transfer in a mixture of Pyr10CE-LDL and BODIPY-CE-LDL. Pyr10CE-LDL (125 μg) and BODIPY-CE-LDL (125 μg) were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with α-chymotrypsin (25 μg) in 500 μl of buffer A, and the sample was then applied to a gel filtration system consisting of two Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns connected in series and eluted with buffer A at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 500-μl fractions were collected, and fluorescence was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Elution of Pyr10CE-LDL and BODIPY-CE-LDL is shown as BODIPY fluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After validation of the RET fusion assay, we next investigated the effect of human arterial proteoglycans on LDL. When LDL was incubated with human arterial PGs in the absence of α-chymotrypsin, a slow linear increase in RET was observed that did not differ from the increase in RET when LDL was incubated alone (Fig.3 A). When a small amount of α-chymotrypsin (5 μg, i.e. one-tenth of the amount used in Figs. 1 and 2) was added, no increase in RET above the base line was observed (Fig. 3 B, •). However, when also human arterial PGs were added, a significant progressive increase in RET resulted over the 24-h incubation period. To investigate whether the increased rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL was caused by negatively charged GAGs, the effect of GAGs isolated from the arterial PG preparation used was also studied. Results similar to those with PGs were obtained (Fig.3 B), revealing that it is the GAGs in human arterial PGs that stimulate the proteolytic fusion of LDL. Next, we studied the morphology of the modified LDL particles (Fig.4). For this purpose, native LDL (panel A) was incubated with human arterial PGs (panel B), α-chymotrypsin (panel C), or both (panel D), and samples were taken for thin-section electron microscopy. As shown in panel B, arterial PGs caused extensive aggregation of LDL without affecting the size of the individual LDL particles. Proteolysis of LDL (panel C) resulted in the formation of some particles with increased diameters (up to 50 nm), some of which displayed extensions of membranous material. However, the sample containing LDL that had been proteolyzed in the presence of human arterial PGs (panel D) contained only large aggregates of lipid droplets (diameters up to 100 nm) and large amounts of membranous material both extending from fused LDL particles and as separate vesicle-like structures. This morphologic study indicated that in the presence of α-chymotrypsin, human arterial PGs can dramatically alter the structure of LDL. To study further the effects of sulfated polysaccharides on proteolytic LDL fusion, we compared the rates of proteolytic LDL fusion in the presence of dextran sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and heparin (Fig.5). In the absence of α-chymotrypsin (panel A), none of these polyanions markedly increased RET during a 7.5-h incubation. In sharp contrast, clear differences were noticed when dextran sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and heparin were incubated with LDL in the presence of α-chymotrypsin (panel B). The rate of proteolytic LDL fusion was increased most markedly by dextran sulfate, with the effects of heparin and chondroitin 6-sulfate being weaker. When the samples were examined by thin-section electron microscopy and the degree of fusion was estimated, fusion was most extensive when LDL was incubated with dextran sulfate and α-chymotrypsin (data not shown). Under the incubation conditions used, the sulfated polysaccharides formed insoluble complexes with LDL. To determine the relationship between the formation of insoluble complexes with LDL and the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL, we incubated different amounts of dextran sulfate with LDL and measured the amount of insoluble complexes formed (sedimentation at low speed centrifugation) and the rate of proteolytic LDL fusion. As shown in Fig.6 A, as little as 5 μg of dextran sulfate precipitated practically all of the LDL (50 μg) present in the incubation system. When the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL was followed (panel B), addition of increasing amounts of dextran sulfate (0–15 μg) progressively increased RET in the samples, with the maximal effect being achieved with 5 μg. Thus, the amount of dextran sulfate required to maximally increase the rate of LDL fusion was similar to that required for maximal sedimentation of LDL. In the absence of α-chymotrypsin, dextran sulfate did not cause significant changes in RET during the 3-h incubation (data not shown). To determine whether the size of the polyanions affected the rate of proteolytic LDL fusion, we studied the rate of proteolytic LDL fusion in the presence of dextran sulfates of different molecular weights. Dextran sulfates with M r values of 500,000 and 50,000 were equally effective in promoting proteolytic LDL fusion, but dextran sulfate with a M r of 5000 failed to induce fusion (data not shown). In accord with the above results, we also found that dextran sulfates with M r values of 500,000 and 50,000 were able to form insoluble complexes with LDL, whereas dextran sulfate with a M r of 5000 did not form such complexes (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that the degree of LDL fusion is directly proportional to the degree of proteolytic degradation of LDL (9Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether the rate of LDL proteolysis is affected by sulfated polysaccharides. As shown in Fig.7, the amounts of dextran sulfate that had triggered the formation of insoluble complexes with LDL and that had increased the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL markedly increased the rate of proteolysis of LDL as well. In an additional experiment, we found that in the presence of dextran sulfate, the rate of proteolysis with 0.15 μg of α-chymotrypsin was even higher than that with 5 μg of α-chymotrypsin in the absence of dextran sulfate. Similarly, heparin, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and human arterial PG stimulated LDL proteolysis, although to a lesser degree (data not shown). Thus, it appears that one mechanism by which the sulfated polysaccharides increase the rate of proteolytic LDL fusion is by increasing the rate of LDL proteolysis. Finally, we performed a set of experiments to elucidate the mechanism of the increased rate of LDL proteolysis in the presence of PGs and GAGs. We measured the activity of α-chymotrypsin (5 μg) with a small molecular weight molecule,N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester, as substrate in the absence and presence of dextran sulfate (50 μg) and found it to be the same (130 versus 140 units/min) under both conditions. Thus, the increased rate of proteolysis could not be explained by increased catalytic activity of α-chymotrypsin in the presence of GAGs. Next, we compared the rate and degree of proteolysis of native LDL and LDL reisolated from complexes with dextran sulfate by α-chymotrypsin and found that they were similar (11.0versus 11.9% of trichloroacetic acid-soluble apoB-100 fragments after 1 h of proteolysis). Thus, the increased rate of proteolysis could not be explained by irreversible conformational change in apoB-100 after binding to GAGs. Moreover, we studied the binding of both LDL and α-chymotrypsin to a dextran sulfate affinity column and found that LDL bound strongly and was eluted at ∼450 mm NaCl, whereas α-chymotrypsin bound weakly to the column, with the bound enzyme being eluted at a NaCl concentration of <50 mm. The rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL was markedly increased by dextran sulfate at 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 5), which totally prevented the binding of α-chymotrypsin to the LDL-dextran sulfate complexes. Thus, binding of α-chymotrypsin to the complexes was not required for the dextran sulfate effect. However, there was no increase in the rate of proteolysis of LDL in the presence of dextran sulfate when formation of insoluble complexes between LDL and dextran sulfate was prevented by the presence of 250 mm NaCl (6.9 and 6.4% of trichloroacetic acid-soluble apoB-100 fragments after 1 h of proteolysis in the presence and absence of dextran sulfate, respectively). Thus, it appears that the increased rate of LDL proteolysis in the presence of PGs or GAGs depends solely on the formation of insoluble complexes between these sulfated mucopolysaccharides and LDL. The novel method for studying LDL fusion based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer allowed continuous monitoring of particle fusion and, most important, was not perturbed by particle aggregation. With this method, we were able to show that human arterial PGs and GAGs increase the rate of proteolytic LDL fusion. Why is the rate of proteolytic fusion of LDL increased in the presence of PGs or GAGs? Their addition to a system containing both LDL and α-chymotrypsin was found to lead to two parallel phenomena: (i) formation of insoluble complexes (aggregation) between LDL and PGs or GAGs and (ii) an increased rate of LDL proteolysis. Aggregation of native LDL particles by PGs or GAGs in the absence of α-chymotrypsin did not lead to particle fusion. In contrast, proteolysis of LDL, in the absence of PGs or GAGs, can result in particle fusion (9Piha M. Lindstedt L. Kovanen P.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10120-10129Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since PGs and GAGs increase the rate of LDL proteolysis (this study), one explanation for the increased rate of LDL fusion in the presence of PGs or GAGs is that they increase the rate of LDL proteolysis. To assess whether fusion of proteolyzed LDL is promoted by the formation of insoluble complexes between the proteolyzed particles and PGs or GAGs independently of the proteolysis-stimulating effect of PGs and GAGs, LDL was first proteolyzed by α-chymotrypsin, proteolysis was then stopped by addition of a protease inhibitor, and dextran sulfate or anti-apoB-100 antibody was added to the reaction mixture. Under these conditions, aggregation of the proteolyzed particles did not by itself trigger particle fusion (data not shown). Thus, it appears that PGs and GAGs accelerate the rate of fusion solely by increasing the rate of LDL proteolysis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sulfated mucopolysaccharides contribute to the rate of particle fusion independently of their proteolysis-stimulating effect on LDL. What is the mechanism underlying the increased rate of proteolysis of apoB-100 of LDL in the presence of PGs or GAGs? In light of our results, it appears that the increased rate of LDL proteolysis in the presence of PGs or GAGs depends solely on the formation of insoluble complexes between these sulfated mucopolysaccharides and LDL, and not on increased catalytic activity of α-chymotrypsin. The formation of LDL-GAG aggregates may thus provide microenvironments favorable for proteolytic modification of LDL. Interestingly, it has been found that the formation of soluble complexes between LDL and PGs or GAGs increases the rate of apoB-100 proteolysis by trypsin, a finding that was suggested to result from increased exposure of the amino acids lysine and arginine of apoB-100 (28Camejo G. Hurt E. Wiklund O. Rosengren B. Lopez F. Bondjers G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the arterial intima, PGs are heterogeneous, with some having a high affinity and others a low affinity for LDL (29Srinivasan S.R. Vijayagopal P. Eberle K. Radhakrishnamurthy B. Berenson G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). From our finding that dextran sulfate, the polyanion with the highest affinity for LDL, accelerated the proteolytic fusion of LDL most strongly, we infer that the same relationship between affinity for LDL and ability to accelerate LDL particle fusion will also hold in the arterial intima. GAGs with the highest binding affinity for plasma LDL are present in human arteries with high susceptibility to atherosclerosis (30Cardoso L.E.M. Mouráo P.A.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 1: 115-124Crossref Google Scholar), especially at branch sites (31Schwenke D.C. Edwards I.J. Circulation. 1996; 94: I-395Google Scholar). In addition, PGs with high affinity for LDL are produced by smooth muscle cells of synthetic phenotype (32Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that are present at arterial sites susceptible to the development of atherosclerosis (33Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10002) Google Scholar). The above observations are consistent with the notion that there are specific atherosclerosis-prone (micro)environments in which LDL particles undergo rapid fusion. Interestingly, in the experiments in which large amounts of human LDL were infused intravenously into New Zealand White rabbits, electron microscopic analysis of the subendothelial space revealed small foci of fused LDL particles (8Nievelstein P.F.E.M. Fogelman A.M. Mottino G. Frank J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Atherosclerotic lesions of human aorta and coronary arteries contain mast cells capable of releasing granules that are complexes between heparin proteoglycans and fully active endopeptidases with either tryptic (tryptase) or chymotryptic (chymase) activity (34Kokkonen J.O. Lindstedt K.A. Kovanen P.T. Caughey G.H. Mast Cell Proteases in Immunology and Biology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 257-287Google Scholar). Indeed, many of these such mast cells have expelled their granules into the extracellular fluid, where also LDL is present (35Kaartinen M. Penttilä A. Kovanen P.T. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1669-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The protease-containing granules then bind the apoB-100 component of LDL (36Kaartinen M. Penttilä A. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and may proteolyze it. Therefore, it is conceivable that proteolytic modification of LDL may take place in the human arterial intima. The arterial intima is also the site of both lipolytic (37Schissel S.L. Tweedie-Hardman J. Rapp J.H. Graham G. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and oxidative (38Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) modifications of LDL. We recently found that these two types of LDL modification, in addition to proteolytic modification, render the particles unstable and induce their fusion in vitro (10Pentikäinen M.O. Lehtonen E.M.P. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2638-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the effect of immobilization of LDL by arterial PGs on the ability of these modifications to induce fusion of LDL is unknown. Future studies on modification of the PG-bound LDL particles should provide new insight into the actual processes leading to LDL fusion in the arterial intima during atherogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2063754272,"The extracellular domain of the human neurotrophin TRKB receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is a highly glycosylated protein, possessing binding ability for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Two distinct ligand binding domains of TRKB were isolated from proteolytic digests of the receptor by affinity separation on immobilized BDNF. One of these domains consists of amino acid residues 103–181 and contains both the third leucine-rich motif and the second cysteine cluster domain. The second domain is close to the second immunoglobulin-like domain (amino acid residues 342–394). Each of these two domains can bind BDNF independently. Disulfide linkages present in the first domain are necessary for BDNF binding, probably because of preservation of the native conformation. To study the second domain in greater detail, a truncated form of TRKB containing the second immunoglobulin-like domain (residues 248–398) was expressed in <i>Escherichia coli.</i> This domain was cross-linked to BDNF through a 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide coupling reaction. Several synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 343–379 were able to bind immobilized BDNF. Amino acid substitution and cross-linking analysis indicated that amino acids Phe<sup>347</sup>, Asp<sup>354</sup>, and Tyr<sup>361</sup> are intimately involved in BDNF binding. These results, obtained from a variety of experimental techniques, highlight the importance of two distinct regions of the extracellular domain of the TRKB receptor in binding BDNF."

The mature filaments are assembled from three polypeptide subunits: light (NF-L), medium (NF-M) and heavy (NF-H) (for review, see Ref. 1Lee M.K. Cleveland D.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 187-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Each subunit is encoded by a distinct gene and is regulated differently during development, with NF-L and NF-M being expressed early at the time of neuronal cell differentiation and NF-H expressed much later (2Cochard P. Paulin D. J. Neurosci. 1984; 8: 2080-2094Crossref Google Scholar,3Julien J.-P. Meyer D. Flavell D. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 1: 243-250Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The levels of NF gene expression are low during embryonic development with an up-regulation of transcriptional activity at postnatal time points (4Carden M.J. Trojanowski J. Schlaepfer W. Lee V. J.

The neuronal selectivity of neurofilaments has resulted in numerous studies aimed at identifying molecular mechanisms that regulate NF gene expression in neurons; nevertheless, little is understood about these processes. One approach to elucidate the regulation of gene expression is to fuse the genetic elements of interest to a reporter gene and monitor its expression in transfected cells or transgenic mice. In this way, the 5′-promoter regions of both the mouse and human NF genes have been shown to contain multiple positive and negative regulatory sites (7Shneidman P.S. Bruce J. Schwartz M.L.

However, in vivo attempts to identify neuron-specific elements within NF genes in transgenic mice have proven difficult (9Yazdanbakhsh K. Fraser P. Kioussis D. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Lindenbaum M.

For example, one report claims that 300 bp of the human NF-L gene promoter sequence are sufficient for neuronal expression (9Yazdanbakhsh K. Fraser P. Kioussis D. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Lindenbaum M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) while another report finds this region insufficient for neuron specificity (11Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Julien J.-P. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 116: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Such discrepancies have been interpreted as a relative weakness of the NF-L gene promoter regions in combination with a requirement for intragenic regulatory elements (9Yazdanbakhsh K. Fraser P. Kioussis D. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Lindenbaum M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Julien J.-P.

Further complications in understanding the tissue specificity of NF gene expression arise from in vitro studies that report efficient expression of either reporter genes, or NF genes themselves, under the control of various NF promoters when transfected into non-neuronal cells (7Shneidman P.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the identification of elements in the mouse NF-L gene 3′-untranslated region that stabilize the NF-L mRNA transcript suggests that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms play a role in NF gene expression (24Schwartz M.L. Bruce J. Schneidman P.S. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26364-26369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The majority of these in vivo studies were conducted in adult mice and do not address the developmental regulation of NF gene expression during embryogenesis. We reasoned that the initiation of transcription during development was a crucial step in attaining neuron-specific gene expression. As a model, we chose the promoter from the murine NF-L gene that has previously been used to direct the neuronal expression of several transgenes in adult animals (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Begemann M. Tan S.-S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1995; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In this study, we directed embryonic expression of a lacZreporter gene under the control of the murine NF-L promoter using a 2-tiered system of gene regulation in transgenic mice (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Gardner D.P. Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Kappen C. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of the reporter transgene in this system is dependent on the potent viral transcriptional transactivator, VP16. We report here the developmental activity, structure, and identification of critical tissue-specific regulatory regions of the murine NF-L gene promoter. Our results demonstrate that 1.7-kb upstream of the mouse NF-L promoter contain temporally separable and distinct enhancer elements that regulate transcription in neuronal and myogenic tissues during embryonic development. Transgenic mice were established following the standard protocols described in Hoganet al. (30Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 153-173Google Scholar). The NF-TIF4 and IE-LacZ16 transgenic mouse lines have been previously described (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Gardner D.P. Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Kappen C. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and all other lines were newly generated. The plasmid NFL-TSV (a gift from G. Byrne, Nextran, Inc., Princeton, NJ) was created by ligating the 0.87-kbSalI/BamHI fragment containing the SV40 virus splice region, intron and poly(A) site (pMSG, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) into the EcoRI site of pNF-TIF (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting insert DNA was released by a ClaI/BamHI restriction digest. Upon complete digestion, the DNA fragment was purified over a 20–40% sucrose gradient in a near vertical rotor and dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 0.25 mm EDTA. 2P. Yaworsky and C. Kappen, unpublished data.Purified DNA was diluted to a final concentration of 1.5–2.0 μg/ml for microinjection. FVB mice (31Taketo M. Schroeder A.C. Morbraaten L. Gunning K.B. Hanten G. Fox R.R. Roderick T.H. Stewart C. Lilly F. Hansen C.T. Overbeek P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) were used for microinjection and CD-1 mice were used as foster mothers. Genomic DNA from potentially transgenic founder mice was purified from tail biopsies (32Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify transgenic mice by virtue of the presence of the VP16 gene. A 494-bp VP16-specific PCR product was amplified using the primers 5′-CTATGTACCATGCTCGATACCTGGA-3′ and 5′-CCATAGGATCTCGCGGGTCAAAAAT-3′ for 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 30 s at 72 °C). DNA from PCR-identified founder animals was subjected to Southern blot hybridization to determine transgene copy number and to ascertain the integrity of the transgene (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Samples were hybridized with a digoxygenin-labeled 1.2-kb SalI probe corresponding to the VP16 gene. Specific hybridization was detected using the Genius system (Boehringer Mannheim). Embryos at various developmental stages were isolated after natural matings. The morning of the presence of a vaginal plug was designated as 0.5 days post-coitum (dpc). The embryos were removed from the uterus and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The yolk sac was separated from each embryo and used as a source of embryonic genomic DNA for PCR analyses. Embryos younger than 9.5 dpc were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, those between 10.5 and 12.5 dpc were fixed for 2 h, and those older than 13.5 dpc were fixed for 4 h. The fixative was rinsed away with three washes of 15 min at 37 °C in a substrate buffer containing 100 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Staining proceeded in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The staining reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and was monitored by the appearance of staining in the apical ectodermal ridge of embryos from the IE-LacZ16 line. This ectopic staining served as an internal control for the β-galactosidase staining reaction and is independent of VP16 transactivation (29Gardner D.P. Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Kappen C. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The staining was stopped by rinsing with PBS and post-fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Embryos were dehydrated in increasing gradations of ethanol and cleared in xylene. Photographs were taken with a 35-mm camera (Wild) on a Leica Stereo Zoom M3Z microscope. Histologic sections were obtained by embedding the embryos in paraffin wax and microtome sectioning at 10 μm thickness. Sections were analyzed and photographed with a Leica DMRB microscope. RNA was prepared from newborn mice 10 days after birth. Brain, spinal cord, muscle, skin, liver, spleen, kidney, and heart tissues were isolated and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was thawed in the presence of Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) and homogenized. Total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer specifications. Contaminating DNA was removed by treating 2 μg of each RNA sample with DNaseI (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of RNase Inhibitor (CLONTECH). First strand cDNA synthesis proceeded with 500 ng of RNA using the primers dT16VA, dT16VT, dT16VG, and dT16VC (12.5 μm each), where V = G, C, or A, and 100 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 50 min at 40 °C, 15 min at 70 °C. The manufacturer protocols were followed for all enzymatic reactions. For each primer set, a one-twentieth volume of cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification using cycling conditions identical to those stated above for 33 cycles. When primers were used to detect β-actin, 30 total cycles were used. Positive and negative control samples were carried out for each amplification reaction. The primers used wereVP16 (5′-CAACTGACGCCAGCTCTCCAGGTCGC-3′ and 5′-CTCGTTTCTTCCACGCCGAGCTAC-3′), lacZ(5′-ACCGAATTCAGTTGGTCTGGTGTC-3′ and 5′-GTGAAGCTTGTGATGCTATTGCTT-3′),NF-L (5′-AGCAGAATGCAGACATTAGCGCC-3′ and 5′-TGGTCTCTTCGCCTTCCAAGAGT-3′), and β-actin(5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3′ and 5′-TGGCCTTAGGGTGCAGGGGG-3′). Amplification products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Three independent cDNA preparations were analyzed. The sequence of the murine NF-L promoter was obtained using the plasmid NFL-TSV as a double-stranded DNA template. This plasmid contains 1.7 kb of the mouse NF-L promoter (−1.6-kb HindIII/+74 SmaI). Automated DNA sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer (Foster City, CA). Primers were specifically designed to provide sequence data from both DNA strands. Subsequent sequence analyses were carried out using the programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) and McMolly Tetra (Soft Gene GmbH, Berlin). The plasmid NFL-TSV was linearized by ClaI digestion. Deletions within the NF-L promoter were subsequently generated by partial digestion with one of the following enzymes: HaeII (at base −1215), BstXI (base −941), NspI (base −524), and NruI (base −328). The fragment of interest was purified from agarose gels and used to generate transgenic embryos as described above. Embryos were isolated at 13.5 dpc and stained for β-galactosidase activity as described previously. To examine the developmental activity of the murine neurofilament light chain gene promoter, we have employed a binary system of gene expression in transgenic mice (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,29Gardner D.P. Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Kappen C. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This system (Fig. 1 A) consists of two independent transgenic components. One transgenic parent, the transactivator, carries the gene for the transcriptional activator VP16 from herpes simplex virus under the control of the 1.7-kb murine NF-L promoter. The second transgenic parent, the transresponder, provides the reporter gene, lacZ, linked to the viral immediate early (IE) ICP4 gene promoter. The IE promoter contains the response elements for VP16-mediated transactivation but is not transactivated in the absence of VP16 (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Gardner D.P. Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Kappen C. Transgenic Res. 1996; 5: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Progeny that receive both transgenes will exhibit lacZ expression in those cells where the NF-L promoter is active. The structure of the transgene DNA constructs used in these studies is presented in Fig.1 B. Previous studies, using an IE-CAT transresponder mouse mated with the NF-TIF4 transactivator line, demonstrated CAT activity in homogenates of the brain and spinal cord of double transgenic adult progeny (25Byrne G.W. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5473-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We identified and established six NFL-VP16 mouse lines with the ability to transactivate the expression of an IE-LacZ transresponder gene. The activity of each NFL-VP16 transgene was ascertained by mating a male NF-L-transactivator to a female IE-LacZ16 mouse. Embryos were isolated at 10.5 dpc, and their genotypes were determined by PCR using transgene-specific primers on yolk sac genomic DNA (not shown). Transgenic progeny from several independent NF-L-transactivators showed the same pattern of expression of the IE-LacZ transgene. All six independent NF-L-transactivator lines produced identical staining patterns, indicating that lacZ expression reproducibly reflected the activity of the NF-L promoter (data not shown). With each of these transactivator lines, β-galactosidase activity was restricted to the cells of the developing brain and spinal cord. These results demonstrate that expression of the IE-LacZ transresponder transgene was specifically activated in the nervous system when an NFL-VP16 transactivator transgene was present. In addition, they reveal that the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter is active in embryogenesis and reproducibly directs reporter gene expression in the developing nervous system. To elucidate the onset and progression of NF-L promoter activity in the nervous system, we isolated embryos from crosses between NF-L-transactivators and IE-LacZ16 transresponders at different stages of development. Fig.2 depicts representative embryos carrying both transgenes. Both whole-mount embryo stainings and histologic sections from paraffin-embedded embryos were analyzed. The NF-L promoter first became active at 8.5 dpc when β-galactosidase activity was restricted to neuroepithelial cells (Fig. 2 A). No promoter activity was detected in embryos isolated at 6.5 or 7.5 dpc (not shown). At 9.5 dpc (Fig. 2 B), staining was restricted to the developing nervous system. In the brain, staining was observed in the neuroepithelium of the hindbrain, the midbrain, and weakly in the forebrain (Fig. 2 B). LacZ activity could also be detected in hindbrain rhombomeres as well as the trigeminal (V) and facial-acoustic (VII-VIII) complexes on histologic sections of the embryo (not shown). The neuroepithelium of the spinal cord exhibited β-galactosidase activity throughout its entire anterior-posterior axis (Figs. 2 B and 3 A). This staining pattern persisted at 10.5 dpc with increased activity in the mid- and forebrain (Fig. 2 C). Both the trigeminal and facial-acoustic ganglia were stained, as were the primitive optic apparatus and the otocysts (not shown). The neural tube continued to stain as did the early condensations of presumptive neural crest cells. The latter cells, which give rise to dorsal root ganglia, could be seen adjacent to the neural tube at the level of the forelimb bud (not shown). Neural tube staining appeared stronger in more ventral regions (Fig.3 B). There was little difference in the staining pattern at 11.5 dpc in whole-mount embryos; β-galactosidase activity was observed in the midbrain and forebrain (not shown). The trigeminal ganglion and the retina were also positively stained. In the developing spinal cord, the number of stained cells decreased (compare Fig. 3, B and C) and remained mostly confined to cells of the ventricular layer. Cells in the dorsal root ganglia were also stained (Fig. 3 C). However, by 12.5 dpc, β-galactosidase activity within the nervous system was noticeably weaker (Fig. 2 D). The walls of the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain continued to stain, and cells of the trigeminal ganglia, retina, and roof of the neopallial cortex were also positive (not shown). Within the spinal cord at the mid-trunk region (Fig. 2 D), staining persisted in neuroepithelial cells in ventrally and, weakly, in dorsally located areas (Fig. 3 D). Some cells in the dorsal root ganglia also exhibited β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3 D). Similar staining patterns were observed with at least three different, independently derived NFL-transactivator lines. These results demonstrate that the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter specifically directs transgene expression to neuroepithelial cells.Figure 3β-galactosidase activity within cells of the spinal cord. Histologic sections were obtained at a thickness of 10 μm from paraffin-embedded embryos. Cross-sections are through the anterior neural tube of embryos isolated at 9.5 (A), 10.5 (B), 11.5 (C), and 12.5 (D) dpc. β-galactosidase activity is detected only within nervous tissue. As development proceeds, there is a general decrease in lacZexpression within the neural tube. By 12.5 dpc, β-galactosidase activity is restricted to only a few neuroepithelial cells in the spinal cord with stronger intensity in more ventral regions. Staining within the dorsal root ganglia also declined with only a small number of stained cells detectable by 12.5 dpc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further characterized the developmental activity of the NF-L promoter by examining β-galactosidase activity in embryos at later stages. At 14.5 dpc, neuron-specific β-galactosidase activity persisted in several developing sensory organs (Fig.4). Both retinal neurons and cells of the developing lens exhibited staining. Fig. 4 A depicts intense retinal staining and weaker lens staining in a section from an NFL-TSV207 transactivator, and Fig. 4 B depicts strong lens and optic nerve staining while the retina was only weakly positive when an NFL-TSV6 transactivator was used. Despite differences in staining intensities, identical tissues were consistently positive forlacZ expression with different NFL-transactivator lines. The cells of the developing semicircular canals in the auditory complex also exhibited β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4 C) as did the cells of the developing olfactory epithelia (Fig. 4, Dand E). It is interesting to note that cells in the olfactory epithelia stained in a non-uniform manner with varying degrees of intensity (Fig. 4, D and E). The examination of whole-mount stained embryos at later developmental time points revealed a general decline in neuron-specific activity from the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter (Fig. 5). By 13.5 dpc, neuron-specific β-galactosidase staining became restricted to the neopallial cortex, midbrain, retina, and cerebellar primordia (Fig. 5 A). The spinal cord was only stained in the most posterior region, as were the dorsal root ganglia (not shown). The spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia in anterior regions were essentially negative (Fig. 5 B). By 14.5 dpc, staining within the developing brain was limited to the cerebellar anlage, neopallial cortex, olfactory epithelia, and the developing auditory and optic apparati (Figs. 4 and 5 C). Together, these data reveal that the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter is neuron-specific during early neurogenesis. The noticeable decrease in neuronal gene expression implies that while the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter contains regulatory elements for initiation of transcription early in development, other elements residing elsewhere may be required to maintain NF-L gene expression in neurons at later stages. Surprisingly, at later developmental stages, strong β-galactosidase staining was observed in non-neuronal cells. At 13.5 dpc, the premuscle masses of the fore and hind limbs as well as skeletal muscle precursors were labeled (Fig. 5 A). Thus, from 13.5 dpc on, the NF-L-promoter was active in myogenic cells in addition to specific neuron subsets. One day later, at 14.5 dpc, intense staining for β-galactosidase was observed in the developing abdominal and limb musculature, intercostal muscles, and some facial muscles (Fig. 5 C). The examination of histologic sections from these embryos confirmed the identity of the lacZpositive cells as myogenic cells (Fig. 5, D andE). Staining within the extrinsic ocular muscle is presented in Fig. 4 B where both neuronal (lens and optic nerve) and myogenic cells exhibited β-galactosidase activity. In addition, cells of the developing intercostal muscles also displayed strong β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5 D). Using a second, independent NF-L-transactivator line, NFL-TSV207, the staining pattern was similar to that observed with the NF-TIF4 line (not shown). Fig.5 E shows β-galactosidase activity within the extensor muscles of the developing fore limb surrounding the cartilage primordia of the humerus and the ulna from the NFL-TSV207 line. Embryos examined at 16.5 and 18.5 dpc exhibited no β-galactosidase activity in either whole-mount specimens or in isolated brain or muscle tissue (not shown). Furthermore, no β-galactosidase activity could be detected in tissues (neuronal and non-neuronal) isolated from mice at postnatal day 10 and at 1 and 3 months old (not shown). Taken together, these data reveal the presence of regulatory elements within the 1.7-kb NF-L promoter that direct gene expression to myogenic cells at later developmental time points. However, similar to the transient activity observed in neurons, NF-L promoter activity in muscle tissue does not continue through late developmental stages or into adulthood. Thus, the NF-L promoter contains temporally regulated DNA elements that can initiate but do not maintain transgene expression in different cell types at various developmental stages. The lack of β-galactosida"
https://openalex.org/W2046890979,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiaenucleolar protein Nop4p is necessary for processing of rRNA and assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Nop4p is unusual in that it contains four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) including one noncanonical RRM, as well as several auxiliary motifs, two acidic regions between the RRMs, and a carboxyl-terminal domain rich in lysines and arginines. To examine the functional importance of these motifs, we isolated random and site-directed mutations in NOP4 and assayed Nop4p function in vivo. Our results indicate that each RRM is essential for Nop4p function; mutations in conserved aromatic residues of Nop4p cause a temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype and diminished 60 S ribosomal subunit production. The carboxyl-terminal 68 amino acids are important but apparently not essential; carboxyl-terminal truncation of Nop4p causes slow growth, decreased ribosome production, and mislocalization of Nop4p. Deletion of both acidic motifs is lethal but replacement of most of the acidic residues with alanine has no apparent phenotype. These acidic residues may serve as spacers or tethers to separate the RRMs. The Saccharomyces cerevisiaenucleolar protein Nop4p is necessary for processing of rRNA and assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits.

The 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25–28 S rRNAs are produced in the nucleolus from a 35–40 S pre-rRNA by exo- and endonucleolytic processing at sites within the 5′ and 3′ external transcribed spacers and the two internal spacers of the pre-rRNA (1Raué H.A.

A number of yeast and metazoan small nucleolar RNAs and associated proteins have been identified that are necessary for rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (3Venema J. Tollervey D.

This complex might function analogously to spliceosomes containing small nuclear RNPs assembled on pre-mRNAs, to direct proper folding of rRNA necessary for its processing or assembly with ribosomal proteins and nonribosomal nucleolar proteins. In addition to snoRNP proteins, other nucleolar proteins necessary for ribosome biogenesis have been identified, especially using genetic schemes in yeast (1Raué H.A. Planta R.J. Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 71-77PubMed Google Scholar, 3Venema J. Tollervey D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1629-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These include the endonucleases MRP RNase and RNase III (Rnt1p), exonucleases Rat1p, Xrn1p, and Rrp4p, putative RNA-dependent ATPases/helicases Spb4p, Drs1p, Rrp3p, and Dbp3p, the rRNA methylase Dim1p, the putative shuttling protein Nsr1p, and the prolyl-peptidyl cis-trans-isomerase Npi46p/Fpr3p. Nop4p/Nop77p is a yeast nucleolar protein that was identified both by screening an expression library with a monoclonal antibody specific for a yeast nucleolar antigen and independently in a screen for mutants synthetically lethal in combination with a nop1 mutation (8Berges T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,9Sun C. Woolford Jr., J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Depletion of Nop4p impairs production of 25 S rRNA and causes a deficit of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Nop4p contains five motifs that potentially bind RNA: four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) (10Bandziulis R.J. Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R.

Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar) plus a carboxyl terminus rich in lysine and arginine residues. In addition, there are two regions in Nop4p rich in acidic residues, one between RRM1 and RRM2 and a second between RRM2 and RRM3 (Fig. 1 A). Acidic domains are frequently found in nucleolar proteins and have been suggested to interact with other proteins, for example with basic regions of ribosomal proteins (13Xue Z. Mélèse T. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Understanding the role of Nop4p in ribosome biogenesis will be facilitated by analysis of the structural features of Nop4p that are necessary for its functions. To initiate a structural and functional analysis of Nop4p, we constructed site-directed mutations in each of the above-mentioned motifs of Nop4p and isolated random mutations in the NOP4 gene. We assayed the effect of these mutations on Nop4p function in vivo. We found that each RRM is essential and that the carboxyl-terminal charged domain is important for function of Nop4p. However, most of the glutamic or aspartic residues in the acidic motifs can be deleted or replaced with alanine residues without affecting function or nucleolar localization of Nop4p.

Hunter R. Parker R. Yeast. 1992; 8: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was done under conditions predicted to cause misincorporation of nucleotides (17Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddei D.V. BioTechniques. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar, 18Zhou Y. Zhang X. Elbright R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The wild type NOP4gene used for generating gaps and as a substrate of PCR in this experiment is a 3.2-kilobase pair PstI/SmaI fragment cloned in a modified pRS315 plasmid (JW3434) that hasSpeI and XbaI sites in the polylinker destroyed by SpeI/XbaI double digestion and religation. The yeast strain used for transformation and the subsequent mutant screen is JWY4961, which has the chromosomal copy of NOP4 disrupted with the TRP1 sequence, and bears a wild typeNOP4 on plasmid pUN65. Four different gaps on theNOP4 gene were generated individually by digestion with different pairs of enzymes, each of which recognizes a single site in the gene or plasmid backbone. Gap 1 was created bySpeI/NcoI double digestion; it spans nucleotides 250–754, corresponding to the amino-terminal region of Nop4p including the RRM1 and the first 7 amino acid residues of RRM2. Gap 2 was created by NcoI/BlnI digestion, which removes sequences between nucleotides 754 and 1494, encoding RRM2 and RRM3. Gap 3 was created by BlnI/AatII digestion, which deletes sequences between nucleotides 1494 and 2103, corresponding to RRM4 and the linker region between RRM3 and RRM4. Gap 4 was generated byAatII/BamHI digestion, which removes sequences between nucleotides 2103 and 2469 that encode the 81 amino acid long carboxyl-terminal region of Nop4p. To use the NcoI site at nucleotide 754, the NcoI site at nucleotide 114 was destroyed in plasmid JW3434 by partial digestion and end-filling with Klenow enzyme, resulting in plasmid JW3435.

Conditional lethal nop4 mutants were identified by assaying the inability of cells to lose the NOP4 SUP11 URA3plasmid, indicated by either a color sectoring phenotype or by sensitivity to 5-fluoroorotic acid at nonpermissive temperatures, and by direct assays of Ts−/Cs− phenotypes on YEPD medium after loss of the URA3-bearing plasmid on 5-fluoroorotic acid plates. Yeast transformants were replica-plated to medium that contained 0.01% 5-fluoroorotic acid and 0.1% proline as the only nitrogen source (19McCusker J.H. Davis R.W. Yeast. 1991; 7: 607-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After incubation for 3–4 days, plates were then replicated on YEPD medium and incubated at 13, 23, 30, and 37 °C. Colonies that could not grow at high or low temperatures were identified and patched on YEPD plates and confirmed by going through another round of plate replication and temperature sensitivity tests. The mutants were then subjected to a plasmid shuffling test to determine whether the mutant phenotype was due to mutations in the plasmid-borne NOP4 gene. By this means 30 temperature-sensitive (Ts−) but no cold-sensitive (Cs−) nop4 mutants were identified. Plasmids to be mutagenized were transformed into Escherichia coli strain CJ236, and single-stranded DNA was prepared from the transformants. Site-directed mutagenesis reactions were carried out as described by Kunkel et al. (20Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The mutation in each of the mutant genes was confirmed by sequencing NOP4. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in Table II. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on cells grown in YEPD, as described by Copeland and Snyder (21Copeland C. Snyder M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A modified scheme was established to use two mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against different yeast nucleolar proteins in the same experiment. Yeast cells were fixed at room temperature for 1 h with an equal volume of 7.4% formaldehyde prepared freshly from paraformaldehyde, and cell walls were removed by digestion with Zymolase 100-T (Seikagaku Corp.) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and glucuronidase (Sigma) at a concentration of 40 μl/ml for 1 h at 30 °C. Approximately 1.5 × 107 cells were added to each well of a polylysine-coated glass slide; unattached cells were washed away by repeatedly adding buffer to the wells and aspirating with vacuum. Approximately 10 μl of the first primary antibody (anti-Nop1p) was applied to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used at 50 × dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The free Cy3 Fabs were then washed away by adding sorbitol buffer and 0.1% bovine serum albumin protein to the wells and aspirating with vacuum. Approximately 10 μl of the partially purified 28.3a (anti-Nop4p) at a concentration of 7 mg/ml was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing away the unbound 28.3a antibodies, the Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was applied to slides. Incubation proceeded at room temperature for 1 h before an extensive wash to remove the free Cy5 secondary antibody. A control experiment without application of the 28.3a antibody was included to ensure that the first primary antibody was saturated by the Cy3-conjugated Fab. To determine whether each of the four RRMs in Nop4 protein (Fig. 1 A) is important for its function, we assayed the effects of mutations inNOP4 predicted to compromise RNA binding of each RRM. X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic studies of several RRM-containing proteins indicated that the RRM consists of four anti-parallel β-strands forming a β-sheet and two α-helices. Solvent exposed aromatic side chains in the most conserved RNP-1 and RNP-2 domains of the β-sheet form ring stacking interactions with RNA bases (12Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

We constructed site-directed mutations in the most conserved Phe residues of RNP-1 in RRM1, RRM2, and RRM3 of NOP4 as shown in Fig. 1 B. nop4-11 contains Phe-68 → Leu and Phe-70 → Leu mutations in RNP-1 of RRM1, nop4-18contains a Phe-192 → Leu mutation in RNP-1 of RRM2, andnop4-19 contains a Phe-335 → Leu mutation in RNP-1 of RRM3. nop4-3, which was recovered in a screen for conditional lethal nop4 alleles (see below), contains a Phe-557 → Leu mutation in RNP-1 of RRM4. The phenotype resulting from each of these mutations was assayed in strains containing a nop4::TRP1 genomic disruption and a low copy CEN plasmid bearing the mutantnop4 gene. Each of these nop4 mutants is temperature-sensitive for growth, i.e. grows well at 30 °C but is unable to grow at 37 °C. To ascertain whether these four Ts− nop4 mutants were defective in ribosome biogenesis, lysates were prepared from each strain grown at 30 °C or after shifting to 37 °C for 4 h and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation to display 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, monoribosomes, and polyribosomes. As shown in Fig.2, each of the nop4 mutants is deficient in 60 S ribosomal subunits at 37 °C, as indicated by a decreased ratio of free 60 S ribosomal subunits to 40 S subunits compared with wild type NOP4 yeast, and accumulation of half-mer polyribosomes (9Sun C. Woolford Jr., J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford Jr., J.L.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2261-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Most of these nop4mutants exhibit similar shortages of 60 S subunits 2 or 3 h after shifting to 37 °C, compared with 4 h post-shift, and some (nop4-3 and nop4-19) are moderately deficient in 60 S subunits even when grown at 30 °C (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The ribosome deficiency phenotype of nop4-3 containing a Phe-557 → Leu mutation in RNP-1 of RRM4 indicates that RRM4 is important for Nop4p function. However, RRM4 may be an atypical RRM; the sequence of the amino-terminal 30 residues of RRM4 does not match the RRM consensus (10Bandziulis R.J. Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G.

In particular there is not a canonical RNP-2 sequence, and none of the conserved hydrophobic residues in predicted helix 1 are present in RRM4 (Fig. 1 B). To further test the importance of RRM4, we mutated Tyr-514 to Leu (nop4-16). The position of this Tyr residue within RNP-2 of RRM4 is similar to that of the highly conserved Tyr implicated in RNA binding of canonical RRMs (12Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

The nop4-16 mutant containing the Tyr-514 → Leu mutation has a pronounced shortage of 60 S ribosomal subunits and accumulates half-mer polyribosomes at 37 °C (Fig. 4) but is not Ts− for growth (Fig.3). In summary, in vivophenotypes caused by these mutations in RRM1–RRM4 of Nop4p suggest that each of the four RRMs is important for Nop4p function.Figure 3Mutations in two RRMs cause a slightly more severe Ts− growth phenotype than single mutations in each RRM of Nop4p. Ten-fold serial dilutions of cultures were spotted on YEPD medium and incubated 2 days at 30 or 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We generated a set of temperature-sensitive nop4 mutants to further investigate functional domains of Nop4p. Thirty Ts− nop4 mutants were generated by PCR amplification and gap repair of NOP4. Six of these mutants,nop4-1–nop4-6, were chosen for further study. Analysis of these nop4 mutants as well as other site-directed nop4 mutants further indicates the necessity of the RRMs for Nop4p function. nop4-1 contains two mutations, Arg-170 → Gly in RRM2 and Phe-310 → Leu in a conserved Phe residue in RRM3 (Fig. 1 B). Thenop4-1 mutant is Ts− for growth and for accumulation of 60 S ribosomal subunits (Figs. 3 and4). To determine the significance of each individual amino acid change in nop4-1, mutants containing each of the single mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. nop4-8 contains Phe-310 → Leu andnop4-9 contains Arg-170 → Gly. Like the nop4-1mutant,nop4-8 and nop4-9 mutants are deficient in 60 S ribosomal subunits. The nop4-8 mutant is Ts− for growth, and nop4-9 shows a very leaky Ts− phenotype. The nop4-8 mutant exhibits more extreme Ts− and 60 S ribosomal subunit deficiency phenotypes than nop4-9 but is still less pronounced than those of the nop4-1 double mutant (Figs. 3 and 4), indicating that mutations in RRM2 and RRM3 may cause an additive phenotype in the double mutant. The nop4-2 mutant contains an Arg-152 → Gly mutation in RNP-2 of RRM2 and a Glu-214 → Asp mutation in the carboxyl terminus of RRM2 (Fig. 1). nop4-10, which contains the single Arg-152 → Gly mutation, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. nop4-10 and nop4-2have similar phenotypes, both are tight Ts− mutants, exhibit moderate deficiencies of 60 S ribosomal subunits at 30 °C, and have more pronounced shortages of 60 S ribosomal subunits at 37 °C (Figs. 3 and 4). Three of the Ts− nop4 mutants examined,nop4-4, nop4-5, and nop4-6, contain single missense mutations in the interval between RRM3 and RRM4, indicating that the linker region between RRM3 and RRM4 is also important for Nop4p function. Each of these mutants is Ts− for growth and for 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (data not shown). To examine whether the observed nop4 mutant phenotypes described above simply result from decreased amounts of Nop4p, cell lysates were prepared from wild type and mutant strains at 30 °C and 3 h after shifting to 37 °C. Nop4p levels were examined by Western immunoblot analysis. The levels of mutant Nop4p were not significantly decreased compared with wild type protein, exceptnop4-10 and nop4-11 proteins (Fig.5). This suggests that, in most cases, Nop4p degradation is not the primary cause of the ribosome biogenesis defects observed in these mutants. The mutant phenotype of the alleles might result from mislocalization of the protein either as a result of inactivation of a nuclear localization sequence or as an indirect result of loss of binding to a nucleolar ligand. A nuclear localization sequence co-localizes with an RRM sequence in the U1 70K protein; mutations in an RRM prevent nuclear export of Npl3p and cause mislocalization of an Nsr1-β-gal fusion protein (42Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 45Scherly D. Dathan N.A. Boelens W. van Venrooij W.J. Mattaj I.W.

To test these possibilities, the intracellular localization of the mutant Nop4 proteins encoded by nop4-1and nop4-3 was examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Localization of the nucleolar protein Nop1p was included as a control for nucleolar structure and for accessibility of individual cells to antibodies. Mutants were examined at 30 °C and 3 h after shifting to 37 °C when ribosome deficiency phenotypes are more severe. Each mutant protein is localized to the nucleolus at both temperatures (Fig. 6 B and data not shown), identical to wild type Nop4p (Fig. 6 A). Nucleolar structure is not detectably perturbed in thesenop4 mutants, as both anti-Nop1p and anti-Nop4p antibodies stained an identical crescent-shaped pattern, as seen in wild type cells. Thus, mislocalization of Nop4p is not apparent as a result of mutations in the RRMs. The importance of the two acidic domains of Nop4p between RRM1 and RRM2 and between RRM2 and RRM3 was tested by assaying the effects of deleting portions of either or both domains or replacing residues within each with alanine. Deletion of residues 131–140, eight of which are Asp or Glu (nop4-14 mutation), or deletion of amino acids 250–267, 14/18 of which are Asp or Glu (nop4-13), does not cause any discernible effect on growth or ribosome biogenesis (data not shown). However, deletion of both acidic motifs (nop4-15) is lethal. The acidic domains may play critical but redundant roles; alternatively, lethality of the double deletion may be caused by disruption of Nop4p structure. To test these possibilities and to discern the minimal length of acidic peptide sufficient for essential Nop4p function, additional deletion and alanine replacement mutations were constructed in which most of the acidic residues in one of the two acidic domains were deleted, and many of the acidic residues in the other motif were changed to alanine. Thenop4-20 mutation contains the Δ250–267 deletion and residues 131–135 (EDEDD) are changed to alanine. nop4-21contains the Δ131–140 deletion, and residues 250–256 (EDAEENH) are changed to ala"

Its ligand binding specificity and important signal transduction mechanisms are conferred by the IL-4 receptor α chain (IL-4Rα). The I4R is a tyrosine-containing motif within IL-4Rα that is critical for proliferative responses to IL-4. Although the I4R also contributes to gene regulation, nuclear targets directly regulated by this motif have not been described. It is shown here that the tyrosine at position 497 in the I4R is critical for regulation of the phosphorylation status of a set of nuclear proteins that includes HMG-I(Y), small non-histone chromosomal proteins involved in the control of gene expression in hematopoietic cell lines. Moreover, IL-4 is unable to induce HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation in insulin receptor substrate-1-deficient cells, and the inhibitor wortmannin completely blocks IL-4 regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation status but not activation of an IL-4 Stat protein. Taken together, these data indicate that HMG-I(Y) is a nuclear target whose phosphorylation status is regulated through the I4R motif via insulin receptor substrate proteins, independent of activation of the Stat pathway.

Accordingly, the mechanisms by which IL-4Rα transduces signals to nuclear proteins represent a fundamental issue in understanding the functions of IL-4. IL-4Rα is widely expressed and contains an extended cytoplasmic tail devoid of intrinsic kinase activity. Non-covalently associated kinases of the Janus kinase family are activated after receptor engagement, leading in turn to phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of IL-4Rα (12Ihle J.N.

However, certain mRNAs may be IL-4-inducible in Stat6-deficient mouse hematopoietic cells (64Kaplan M.H. Grusby M.J. J. Allerg. Clin. Immunol. 1997; 99 (abstr.): S484Google Scholar), thus raising further questions about Stat6-independent signal transduction. The most membrane-proximal conserved tyrosine, Tyr-1, is at position 497 of the primary sequence of human IL-4Rα. In contrast to the distal residues thought most responsible for Stat6 recruitment, phosphorylation of the Tyr-1 residue leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins termed insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 (originally called 4PS), and this phosphorylation is critical for the ability of IL-4 to stimulate proliferation of the myeloid progenitor cell line 32D (26Wang L.

Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Based on a shared sequence motif and homology with insulin receptor signal transduction, the region spanning IL-4Rα Tyr-1 has been termed the I4R motif (28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although the I4R motif clearly regulates proliferative responses, its contribution to the regulation of nuclear proteins and gene transcription is less well understood. Emerging data indicate that the I4R motif can contribute to modulation of transcriptional activity through Stat6-independent mechanism(s) (29Wang H.Y. Paul W.E. Keegan A.D. Immunity. 1995; 4: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 3J. Youn, H. Y. Wang, M. Boothby, and A. D. Keegan, unpublished observations. However, the set of nuclear proteins whose phosphorylation status is regulated through the I4R and the dependence of their regulation on Stat6 remain unclear. One potential target for Stat6-independent regulation is the non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-I(Y). HMG-I(Y) is a nuclear protein involved in the signal-induced regulation of multiple genes, including virus activation of interferon β, IL-1 activation of E-selectin, induction of IL-2Rα chain and repression of IL-4 transcription in activated T cells, and regulation of the germ line immunoglobulin epsilon (Gε) promoter (30Thanos D.

The phosphorylation status of HMG-I(Y) is regulated in response to IL-4, and the phosphorylated form of HMG-I(Y) exhibits a lower affinity for Gε promoter DNA in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation decreases the repressor effect of HMG-I(Y) at the Gε promoter in B lymphocytes (37Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation status is regulated through a pathway that appeared independent from Stat6 activation but sensitive to the immunosuppressive agent rapamycin (37Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Wang D.-Z. Cherrington A.L. Famakin-Mosuro B.M. Boothby M. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we formulated the hypothesis that this phosphorylation is regulated through the I4R motif rather than the membrane-distal phosphotyrosine residues implicated in Stat6 activation. To investigate this hypothesis, the ability of wild-type and mutant forms of the IL-4 receptor to regulate HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation was measured. Because the I4R motif is linked to IRS-1 recruitment and activation of the lipid kinase PI 3-kinase, we also investigated the requirement for these signal transduction elements in IL-4-inducible HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation. Stable transfectants of the IL-3-dependent myeloid progenitor line 32D, bearing wild-type or mutant human IL-4Rα chains with or without transfected rat IRS-1, have been described previously (26Wang L.

After culture for 4 days in stationary phase, cell debris were removed by centrifugation and sterile filtration. For metabolic labeling experiments, 32D cells (106 cells ml−1) were removed from WEHI-3-conditioned medium and then cultured for 20 h in RP/10F.

Cells were cultured for 4 h at 37 °C with 40 μCi ml−1[32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) and then stimulated 4 h with huIL-2 (100 units ml−1; for M12 cells only), huIL-4 (10 ng ml−1), or mIL-4 (10 ng ml−1). For experiments with pharmacologic inhibitors, cells were separately incubated with rapamycin (100 nm), genistein (75 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm), or the solvent (a 1:1 v/v mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol) at 1:1000 for 20 h and 2 h prior to stimulation with IL-4. Purified recombinant human IL-4 (huIL-4) was obtained as generous gifts from M. Widmer (Immunex, Seattle, WA) and J. Devries (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA). Purified recombinant mouse IL-4 (mIL-4) was purchased from BioSource International (Camarillo, CA), and IL-4 conditioned medium was prepared from a myeloma cell line transduced with a mIL-4 expression vector as described previously (39Karasuyama H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except for supplementation with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Resolution of basic nuclear proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis on acid-urea gels followed by SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (37Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Kardalinou E. Zhelev N. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For selected experiments, the two-dimensional gels were silver-stained to detect relative protein levels, then exposed to autoradiographic film and phosphorimaging plates, whereas in other experiments aliquots of the nuclear proteins were silver-stained separately. To quantify incorporation of 32P into phosphorylated HMG-I(Y) using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimager, the net density units (“PSLs”) incorporated into HMG-I(Y) in each gel were adjusted by subtracting plate background. This incorporation into HMG-I(Y) was normalized by dividing HMG-I(Y)-specific PSLs by the net PSLs in an internal reference spot that was consistently resolved from other labeled proteins. The efficiency of the huIL-4R transfected into a given 32D clone relative to the mouse IL-4R was defined as follows: ({(normalized PSLs in HMG-I(Y)}huIL-4-treated − {normalized PSLs in HMG-I(Y)}basal) ÷ ({normalized PSLs in HMG-I(Y)}mouse IL-4-treated − {normalized PSLs in HMG-I(Y)}basal). For gel shift analyses, 32D cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of IL-3 for 0 or 2 h and then stimulated with IL-4 for 0.5 h. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide representing the Stat6 binding site spanning nucleotides −122 to −104 of the Gε promoter after preparation of whole cell or nuclear extracts, as described previously (38Wang D.-Z.

Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Analyses of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were performed as described previously (28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). After pretreatment with genistein as appropriate, cells deprived of serum for 2 h at 37 °C were cultured in the presence or absence of huIL-4 (5 ng ml−1) for 5 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by dilution in ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm Na3VO4. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, with 50 mm NaF, 10 mmNaPPi, and protease inhibitors (28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), followed by immunoprecipitation of proteins in the soluble fraction using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against rat IRS-1 (generous gift of L. M. Wang and J. Pierce, LCMB, National Institutes of Health). Precipitates were washed in lysis buffer, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with the 4G10 monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody or rabbit anti-IRS-1. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). At least two spatially distinct motifs have been identified within the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-4 receptor α chain as follows: an I4R region originally linked to control of proliferation but not gene expression or Stat6 phosphorylation (20Quelle F.W.

More recent evidence indicates that lymphocyte proliferation is impaired by Stat6 gene disruption (23Takeda K. Tanaka T. Shi W. Matsumoto M. Minami M. Kashiwamura S.-I. Nakanishi K. Yoshida N.

Pani B. Andrea P.D. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Philp R. Crane-Robinson C. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Goodwin G.H.

A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a role for either or both of the IL-4Rα motifs in regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation status. To determine which of these IL-4Rα motifs, the I4R or Stat6 docking motifs, mediates IL-4 regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation, the ability of wild-type and mutant forms of the human IL-4Rα (huIL-4R) to confer regulated HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation was analyzed using transfectants derived from the myeloid progenitor line 32D. To measure IL-4 regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation, metabolic labeling experiments and two-dimensional acid-urea/SDS-PAGE analyses were performed using a panel of 32D transfectants all of which also expressed rat IRS-1. Because of the known potential for clone-to-clone and inter-experimental variation, we employed a widely used strategy to control for these technical issues. Human and mouse IL-4 exhibit species-specific binding to their respective receptors. Thus, the effect of human IL-4 receptors expressed on a given 32D clone can be compared with the effect of the endogenous mouse IL-4 receptors, and huIL-4R expressed on different clones also can be compared. As shown in Fig. 1 A, IL-4 increases the phosphorylation of a set of the basic nuclear proteins which enter acid-urea gels. Of particular note, human IL-4 induced an increase in HMG-I(Y) (arrows) phosphorylation comparable to that observed with mouse IL-4. Since no significant changes in the amount of HMG-I(Y) and other nuclear proteins were observed on silver-stained gels (Fig. 1 B), this increase in labeled protein represents an increase in the specific activity of HMG-I(Y). Function of the I4R motif has previously been shown to require a tyrosine at position 497 (Tyr-1) (28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to test if I4R function is required for IL-4 to regulate HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation, parallel labeling experiments were performed using cells transfected with a full-length human IL-4Rα bearing the Tyr → Phe substitution that blocks IRS-1 recruitment and inactivates the I4R motif (28Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This Y497F (Y1F) substitution completely eliminated the ability of huIL-4 to induce increases in HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation in each of the two clones tested (8-5B6 and 8-5D3). In sharp contrast, the endogenous wild-type mouse IL-4R in these clones was fully competent to increase HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A, right-hand panels; Fig.1 C). This finding indicates that the failure to increase HMG-I(Y) labeling is specific for the mutant human receptor and contradicts the alternative possibility that the huIL-4R Y497F mutant leads to clones in which the basal rate of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation cannot be increased by IL-4 signaling. Quantitation of the results of these experiments showed that the wild-type human receptor was as potent as the mouse receptor, whereas the Y497F (Y1F) mutation dramatically inhibited this function of the IL-4Rα chain (Fig.1 C). The phosphorylation status of other basic nuclear proteins resolved in these two-dimensional gels also was sensitive to IL-4 and dependent on I4R function. Although the identity of these other proteins has not been determined, 4Spots co-migrating with the core histones (H2a, H2b, H3, and H4) demonstrated no significant phosphorylation, whereas histone H1 migrated in a cluster of highly labeled proteins exhibiting an IL-4-inducible increase in phosphorylation and could not be quantified separately. we nonetheless can conclude that an intact I4R is essential for regulation of IL-4-inducible increases in HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation. The above data provide evidence that an intact I4R is essential for regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation by IL-4. However, it was possible that the quantitative level of Stat6 activation might also contribute to regulation of HMG-I(Y) phosphorylation (37Wang D.-Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Human IL-4 receptors that terminate at amino acid residue 557 (d557), between Tyr-1 and Tyr-2, have a greatly reduced competence to induce Stat6 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, receptors truncated at residue 657 (d657) are fully competent to induce Stat6 (20Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.

The nucleoprotein complex is stable in vitro due to a large number of NCp7-HIV RNA and NCp7-NCp7 interactions and protects viral RNA against RNase degradation (6Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The 5′-terminal region of the HIV RNA contains several functional sites essential for the retroviral cycle, such as the RNA transactivation response element structure involved in the activation of provirus transcription or the primer binding site (PBS) located between RNA transactivation response element and the gag initiation codon (7Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).

Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, fluorescence experiments did not identify any high affinity binding site in tRNA and suggested a nonspecific NCp7-tRNA interaction (14Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Sorinas-Jimeno M. Keith G. Roques B.P. Marquet R. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NCp7 is a 72-amino acid protein originating from the C-terminal domain of a polyprotein precursor encoded by the gag 3′ region and conserved among retroviruses (15Henderson L.E. Bowers M.A. Sowder R.C. Serabyn S.A. Johnson D.G. Bess J.W. Arthur L.O. Bryant D.K. Fenselau C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1856-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NCp7 contains two copies of a conserved Cys-X 2-Cys-X 4-His-X 4-Cys zinc finger sequence flanked with basic residues (16Berg J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 485-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Both zinc finger sequences are tetra-coordinated to a Zn2+ ion, although their affinity for zinc differs (17Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Morellet N. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5175-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The first zinc finger is important for RNA binding since a truncated (residues 13–64) NCp7 containing both zinc fingers binds tRNA3Lys or HIV RNA, whereas a Cys23 (13–64) NCp7 mutant containing a disrupted first zinc finger is unable to bind RNA (18Déméné H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The basic residues located outside NCp7 zinc fingers are also important for the nucleic acid binding property (12de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L.

Virol. 1996; 70: 771-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 were obtained in different solvents to evaluate conformational heterogeneity. We then measured the far UV CD spectra of tRNA3Lys, NCp7·tRNA3Lys, and Cys23NCp7· tRNA3Lys complexes. The modification of the 260-nm band in the complexes, only due to the tRNA contribution, shows that NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 bind tRNA3Lys. However, the A-helical character of tRNA3Lys is maintained within the complexes. Our study shows that NCp7 does not induce tRNA unwinding. In addition, to evaluate conformational changes into tRNA, CD spectra were measured from 5 to 80 °C. tRNA melting was observed at 80 °C, and the resulting CD spectrum differs completely from the CD spectra of complexes. The NCp7-tRNA3Lys interaction was further investigated using molecular modeling according to the NMR structure of the zinc finger·Psi RNA complex (3South T.L. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This model shows that binding of the zinc finger region to the anticodon loop could position the NCp7 N-terminal region into the major groove of the tRNA anticodon stem. The chemical synthesis of NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 was performed by solid phase method using a Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and a hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl polystyrene resin with an Applied Biosystem model 431A peptide synthesizer, as described previously (20de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Zinc was added to the protein in a 2.5 molar ratio. Synthetic tRNA3Lys was obtained from in vitro transcription of BanI-linearized pTL9 with phage T7 RNA polymerase, as described previously (8Barat C. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After ethanol precipitation, tRNA3Lys was lyophilized and dissolved in 10% acetic acid. A Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Upsalla, Sweden) in 10% acetic acid was used to remove salt, and then tRNA was lyophilized to remove acetic acid. CD spectra were measured in 50-μm path length cells with a Jobin-Yvon (Longjumeau, France) UV CD spectrophotometer (Mark VI). Calibration of the instrument was evaluated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. A ratio of 2.2 was found between the positive CD band at 290.5 nm and the negative band at 192.5 nm. Protein CD spectra were obtained with a sample volume of 100 μl and protein concentrations of 1 mg/ml. Complex CD spectra were obtained at 5 °C with 0.7 mg/ml of tRNA3Lysmixed with 0.5 mg/ml concentrations of proteins corresponding to a molar ratio of one tRNA for three NCp7. Data was collected at 0.5-nm intervals with a scan rate of 1 nm/min. Light transmission in the far UV to 178 nm was verified with the Jobin-Yvon spectrophotometer, which is able to measure absorption and CD spectra simultaneously. Absorption spectra are reported as absorption units. CD spectra are reported as Δε/amide. Temperature was measured with a Haake thermal device. Analysis of CD data to evaluate secondary structure contents was performed according to the method of Manavalan and Johnson (21Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) using a set of 32 reference proteins. To determine the protein concentration, amino acid analyses were performed on a model 6300 Beckman analyzer according to the method of Sanger and Thompson (22Sanger F. Thompson E.O. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 71: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Models were built with Insight II, the Homology and Discover software from MSI Technologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics R5000PC workstation. NCp7 and NCp7·tRNA3Lys complex structures were optimized in terms of internal energies with the consistent valence forcefield. Molecular dynamics was performed at 300 K for 1.1 ps. 110 structures were sampled and analyzed from the 1100 structures produced in the dynamic trajectory. Energy minimization was performed at pH 7 with the steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms, down to a maximum derivative of 0.001 kcal/Å. CD was performed on wild type NCp7 and a Cys23 mutant, with His23 in the first zinc finger replaced by a cysteine (Fig. 1). To determine whether this mutation could affect secondary structures, CD was measured in two different solvents. In an aqueous buffer (pH 7), NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 show similar CD spectra, characterized by a strong negative band near 200 nm, typical of random coil structures (Fig. 2 A). However, minor structural changes in the mutant are revealed by the absence of a positive band near 220 nm. Structural changes are also observed after zinc depletion (data not shown). Trifluoroethanol (TFE) is a solvent that favors α helix structures within flexible regions. This solvent was used to check if NCp7 had flexible regions and if the Cys23 mutation had an effect on the extent of these flexible regions. In 80% trifluoroethanol, NCp7 and Cys23NCp7 display a class C CD spectra typical of α helix structures, with a positive band at 190 nm and two negative bands near 207 and 222 nm (data not shown). The percentage of secondary structures was determined from CD spectra according to the singular value decomposition method (Table I). In aqueous solvent, zinc depletion or substitution of His23 by cysteine induces an increase of non-ordered structures and a decrease of extended structures. In TFE, the α helix content is significantly higher with Cys23 NCp7 than with native NCp7, whereas the extended structure content decreases (Table I). Cys23/His23 replacement leads to structural changes in the first zinc finger, but the four cysteines remain coordinated to the zinc atom (18Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Ottmann M. Rouyez M.C. Jullian N. Morellet N. Mély Y. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Saragosti S. Roques B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Jullian N. Déméné H. Morellet N. Maigret B. Roques B.P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, when His23 is replaced by cysteine, residues in extended structures in the first zinc finger could adopt either a non-ordered structure in aqueous solvent or an α helical structure in TFE. The imidazol ring of His23bound to a zinc atom could induce the stretching of amino acid residues and favor extended structures in the first zinc finger. This is confirmed by the decrease in extended structure observed with NCp7 in the absence of zinc (Table I). Our results show that a third of the NCp7 structure is solvent-dependent. This conformational heterogeneity is consistent with the flexibility of the N- and C-terminal regions proposed in a 1H NMR study (24Morellet N. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H. Maigret B. Darlix J.L.

To understand the role of NCp7 in the HIV RNA/tRNA annealing, two complexes were formed with tRNA3Lys, one involving NCp7 and the other involving Cys23 NCp7. The far UV CD spectra of these two complexes were measured from 320 to 178 nm in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7) complemented with 50 mm KF and 5% glycerol at 5 °C (Fig.3). The tRNA3Lys CD spectrum, measured in similar conditions, is typical of an A-form helix, as usually observed with RNA stems (25Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A ratio of one tRNA for three NCp7 molecules was used for these complexes to ensure that no free tRNA was present. The association constant (K obs) of the NCp7-tRNA3Lys interaction is 10−6m−1 (14Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Sorinas-Jimeno M. Keith G. Roques B.P. Marquet R. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We used tRNA and NCp7 concentrations near 10−5m, higher thanK obs to ensure complex formation. Precipitation of the complexes did occur, however, when the experiments were done at temperatures higher than 5 °C. Absorption spectra confirmed the absence of protein precipitation when both complexes were formed at 5 °C (Fig. 3). The main protein chromophore has its contribution localized between 178 and 240 nm with a maximum at 190 nm, whereas tRNA has its maximum absorption near 190 and 260 nm (Fig. 3). Therefore, the CD band observed near 260 nm is only due to tRNA. When NCp7 or Cys23 NCp7 is added to tRNA, few changes occur in the CD spectra compared with tRNA alone (Fig. 3). Native NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 induce a similar decrease of the 260-nm band. This change in the 260 nm CD band shows that both native NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 binds tRNA3Lys. In a former CD study, a similar decrease of the 260-nm band was observed in the NCp7·tRNA3Lys complex and interpreted as a tRNA unwinding induced by NCp7 binding (25Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not agree with this interpretation. In polynucleotides, the 260-nm CD band is very sensitive to base stacking (26Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be modified upon binding of a protein without affecting the general nucleic acid structure (27Loret E.P. Georgel P. Johnson W.C. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9734-9738Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For instance, binding of an intercalating drug induces a specific modification of the 260-nm band in the RNA transactivation response element RNA CD spectrum (28Bailly C. Colson P. Houssier C. Hamy F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance studies reported modifications of tRNA base stacking induced by NCp7 binding (29Lam W.C. Maki A.H. Casas-Finet J.R. Erickson J.W. Kane B.P. Sowder R.C. Henderson L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10693-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, RNA unwinding should induce more significant changes in CD spectra. The negative band at 210 nm should completely disappear when the A-form helix is disrupted (26Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,30Woody R.W. Hruby V.J. Peptides. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1985: 15-114Google Scholar). The tRNA unfolding due to the addition of organic solvents results in a dramatic decrease of the positive CD band near 260 nm, which looses two-thirds of its magnitude and shifts to 275 nm (31Prinz H. Maelicke A. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Such modifications are not observed when the two complexes are formed. Our results thus suggest that there is no tRNA3Lys unwinding upon binding of NCp7 or Cys23 NCp7. To observe the effect of tRNA melting on the far UV spectrum, we measured CD spectra of tRNA3Lys from 5 to 80 °C (Fig. 4). The tRNA CD bands near 260 and 190 nm decreased progressively as a function of temperature. The 190-nm band completely disappeared at 80 °C, whereas the 260-nm band shifted to 275 nm, which was also observed in tRNA unstacking due to high salt concentration (31Prinz H. Maelicke A. Cramer F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 210-nm bands remained almost unchanged from 5 to 55 °C, dramatically changed at 60 °C, and almost disappeared at 80 °C. If NCp7 did denature tRNA3Lys, the complex CD spectrum should display similarities to what was observed with tRNA alone at 80 °C or to what was observed at 60 °C if denaturation was partial (Fig. 4). Such is not the case. The 260- and 190-nm bands are sensitive to base stacking, and the intensity of these bands is the highest when bases are well superimposed (26Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1985; 31: 61-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of the 260-nm band decreases when base stacking is altered, either by a temperature rise (Fig. 4) or by intermolecular contacts (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, base stacking can be altered in the absence of tRNA unwinding as observed from 5 to 55 °C (Fig. 4). This peculiarity made the measure of the 260-nm CD band very useful to check the binding of intercalating drugs on double-stranded RNA (28Bailly C. Colson P. Houssier C. Hamy F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1460-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Only the 210-nm band seems to be strictly related to the tRNA helical structure, its variation correlating clearly with wound and unwound conformational states. Fig. 4 shows that there is a partial melting of tRNA at 60 °C, which becomes complete after 80 °C. We used the variation of the 210-nm CD band to analyze the conformational stability of tRNA3Lys. The thermal unfolding curve shows that the equilibrium is reached at 57 °C (Fig. 4), which argues in favor of the high stability of tRNA3Lys. Near 260 nm, the CD spectra of both complexes (Fig. 3) are similar to the tRNA CD spectrum at 20 °C (Fig. 4). Between 250 and 178 nm, both protein and tRNA contribute to the CD spectrum. To evaluate protein-induced changes, the tRNA3Lys CD spectrum was subtracted from the CD spectra of the two complexes, from 250 to 178 nm (Fig. 2 B). These two difference spectra can be assigned to CD spectra of NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 bound to tRNA3Lys. It is not possible to determine the percentage of secondary structure due to the tRNA contribution, but protein-specific CD bands appear, which permit evaluation of structural changes in NCp7 and Cys23 NCp7 bound to tRNA3Lys. Intensity of the 200-nm band, associated to random coil structures, decreases in the difference CD spectra compared with unbound NCp7. Interestingly, a negative band at 185 nm usually associated to β-turn structures (30Woody R.W. Hruby V.J. Peptides. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1985: 15-114Google Scholar) appears clearly in bound NCp7 (Fig. 2 B). To investigate possible NCp7·tRNA3Lysbinding sites, a molecular model of the complex was realized (Fig.5). Our NCp7 model uses the NMR structure of the first zinc finger bound to an RNA fragment analogous to the Psi region (3South T.L. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), available in the protein data bank (32Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi O. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8183) Google Scholar). The second zinc finger adopts similar secondary structures with two turns and extended structures (33South T.L. Blake P.R. Hare D.R. Summers M.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6342-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our NCp7 model, the zinc fingers and linker region were positioned according to nuclear Overhauser effects between side chain protons observed by NMR (34Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottmann M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). No nuclear Overhauser effects are observed between side chain protons of the N- and C-terminal regions and these two regions were modeled to minimize protein-solvent interactions (Fig. 5). The model was then submitted to molecular dynamics and energy minimization in the consistent valence forcefield. The van der Waals energies reached 424 kcal/mol, which is in a range compatible with the NCp7 molecular weight. Repulsive and dispersive van der Waals energies are two of the 10 parameters in the consistent valence forcefield. Contrary to the consistent valence forcefield total energy, the van der Waals energy levels are proportional to molecular weights as they can be observed with high resolution x-ray structures. Our final NCp7 model agrees with the percentage of secondary structures calculated from the NCp7 CD spectrum in aqueous solvent (Table I). The 30 residues corresponding to the expected percentage of extended structures are found mainly in the N-terminal region and, in a lesser amount, in zinc fingers and C-terminal regions (Fig. 5). This is confirmed with dαN nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy connectivities observed in similar locations with NMR (34Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottmann M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). From the six β turns that can be deduced from CD data analysis in an aqueous solvent, two are located in each zinc finger, as described in zinc finger NMR structures (3South T.L. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33South T.L. Blake P.R. Hare D.R. Summers M.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6342-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two other β turns in our model are observed in the C-terminal region (residues 62–65 and 67–70). Conformationally restricted sequences are identified by NMR in the same region (34Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottmann M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The human tRNA3Lys sequence (Fig. 1) is highly similar to that of yeast tRNAPhe. Both are type I tRNAs with equal lengths and strictly conserved sequences in every tertiary base pair and triple. This high level of homology enabled us to use the yeast tRNAPhe x-ray structure (35Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as a template and to replace non-conserved bases (22/76 bases) by their human tRNA3Lys counterparts. This replacement did not introduce any significant changes and did not require additional refinement (Fig. 5). UV cross-linking and gel retardation assays demonstrated a tight interaction between tRNA3Lys and NCp7 involving 12 nucleotides in the anticodon domain (13Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We modeled the interaction between tRNA3Lys and the first zinc finger according to the NMR structure of the zinc finger·Psi RNA complex (3South T.L. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this model, the relative orientation of the first zinc finger with the RNA was well defined from intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects, and our first goal was to reproduce this arrangement. The tRNA anticodon loop positions 34–38 (5′-UUUAA-3′) are single-stranded (Fig. 1), exposed to solvent, and stacked in an A-helical form (Fig. 5) as the Psi analog (5′-ACGCC-3′) used in the NMR model. Consequently, this loop can be docked to the first zinc finger in an orientation very similar to that of the Psi analog in the NMR structure. The tRNA nucleotides 32–33 preceding the U turn in the anticodon loop face part of the 34–38 nucleotides and interfere with the side chain of Arg26, which can easily be moved away. The involvement of residues Lys14, Phe16, Glu21, Ile24, and Ala25 in interactions with tRNA was considered as probable from the NMR model. All these residues in our model are in hydrogen bond range to anticodon loop nucleotides. The sequence differences between Psi RNA and tRNA3Lys anticodon loop did not permit specific protein-RNA contacts to reproduce, as suggested in the NMR model. It is noteworthy, however, that no other part of tRNA contains such a stretch of single-stranded nucleotides available for a similar docking with zinc fingers (Fig. 5). The first zinc finger is involved in tRNA binding since (13–64) NCp7 binds tRNA, whereas (13–64) Cys23 NCp7 does not (18Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Ottmann M. Rouyez M.C. Jullian N. Morellet N. Mély Y. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Saragosti S. Roques B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, our CD data shows that full-length Cys23 NCp7 can bind tRNA3Lys, and this result confirms that residues located outside zinc fingers are involved in the NCp7-tRNA3Lys interaction (12de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The position of the NCp7 N-terminal region had to be changed to model the NCp7-tRNA3Lys interaction (Fig. 5). Table I shows that important structural changes occur in NCp7 in the function of the solvent. This conformational heterogeneity is mainly due to the N- and C-terminal regions, zinc fingers being described as rigid structures (34Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottmann M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The binding of the first zinc finger to tRNA brings the N-terminal region in proximity of the major groove of the anticodon stem (Fig. 5). Docking of the N-terminal region in this groove was tried and turned out to be successful, since the N-terminal region remained in the anticodon major groove after molecular dynamics and energy minimization (Fig. 5). The few arrangements that did occur during the refinement positioned the lateral chain of arginines in contact with tRNA phosphates, increasing coulombic interactions between the two molecules. These interactions involve the tRNA backbone rather than the bases, consistent with nonspecific contacts (36Mathews C.K. van Holde K.E. Weisberg S. Biochemistry. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Redwood City, CA1990: 133-142Google Scholar). A β turn appeared between the first zinc finger and the N-terminal region in the complex (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the difference CD spectra, which show an increase of β-turn structures in NCp7 bound to tRNA (Fig. 2 B). Nucleotides interacting with NCp7 in our model (Figs. 1 and 5) correspond to those identified in UV cross-linking experiments (13Barat C. Schatz O. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CD data indicate that NCp7 does not unwind tRNA upon binding, contrary to what was proposed in a former study (25Khan R. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except for few changes in base stacking, the tRNA retains its native A-helical form. Molecular modeling suggests that the NCp7 N-terminal region and the first zinc finger could be tRNA3Lys binding sites. This interaction would not require a base specificity and could occur with other tRNAs as well. This is in agreement with experiments showing that NCp7 binds different types of tRNAs (14Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Sorinas-Jimeno M. Keith G. Roques B.P. Marquet R. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1650-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We propose that tRNA3Lys unwinding is a consequence of the annealing with the PBS rather than an effect of NCp7 binding. However, NCp7 dramatically increases the efficiency of HIV RNA-tRNA3Lys annealing (37Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The function of NCp7 in HIV RNA-tRNA3Lysannealing could be to facilitate the HIV RNA-tRNA3Lys interaction. The C-terminal region comprising the second zinc finger of NCp7 can bind HIV RNA (12de Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, NCp7 bound to HIV RNA can interact with another NCp7 molecule (6Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NCp7 could bring together the tRNA 3′ end and its complementary sequence in the PBS either via binding of NCp7 to both tRNA and HIV RNA or via a tRNA·NCp7 complex binding a HIV RNA·NCp7 complex. We are indebted to Dr. Caroline Gabus-Darlix and Professor Bernard Roques for the generous gifts of tRNA3Lys, NCp7, and Cys23NCp7. We thank Nicole Zylber for technical assistance and Drs. Nathalie Jullian, Valérie Tanchou, Jean-Luc Darlix, and Claude Lazdunski for fruitful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2007067293,"Human factor XIII (FXIII) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are homologous proteins. FXIII requires thrombin for activation and cross-links the γ chains of fibrin(ogen) more efficiently than the Aα chains. On the other hand, tTG is thrombin-independent and forms predominantly Aα and Aα-γ chain complexes. Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that amino acid residues within exon 7 of FXIII were important for catalysis (Hettasch, J. M., and Greenberg, C. S. (1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 28309–28313). To determine to what extent the primary amino acid sequence within exon 7 defines substrate specificity, exon 7 of FXIII was replaced with the corresponding exon of tTG using gene splicing by overlap extension. Other work from this laboratory (Achyuthan, K. E., Slaughter, T. F., Santiago, M. A., Enghild, J. J., and Greenberg, C. S. (1993) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>268, 21284–21292) using synthetic peptides identified two other domains that might play a role in substrate recognition (located in exons 3 and 5). Therefore, recombinant chimeras of FXIII/tTG were also created in which these two exons were exchanged. FXIII, tTG, and chimeras 3, 5, and 7 were expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, purified, and the nature of the fibrin cross-linking pattern of these five proteins was determined by immunoblot analysis. FXIII preferentially formed the γ-γ dimer, whereas tTG formed Aα-γ complexes. Chimera 7 formed Aα-γ complexes that resembled the cross-linking pattern of tTG. This finding demonstrates that the primary amino acid sequence of exon 7 of tTG confers some of the specificity for the Aα and Aα-γ cross-link pattern characteristic of tTG. Chimera 5 exhibited reduced cross-linking activity (50% of FXIII activity) but still retained preference for formation of the γ-γ dimer, whereas chimera 3 was not active. In conclusion, exchanging the primary amino acid sequence of the active site exon of human FXIII with that of human tTG modifies the enzyme such that the fibrin cross-linking pattern more closely resembles that of tTG (Aα and Aα-γ complexes) instead of FXIII (γ-γ dimers)."
https://openalex.org/W2077192772,"This work studies the coordination of the action of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) on activated human c-Ha-Ras p21. Purified human p120-GAP was obtained with a new efficient procedure. To distinguish the GTPase-activating effect of p120-GAP from other effects dependent on the interaction with activated Ha-Ras, the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) was used. The results showed that the GTPγS/GTPγS exchange enhanced by the C-terminal catalytic domain of the yeast GEF Sdc25p (C-Sdc25p) is prevented by p120-GAP. This effect is strictly specific for the activated form of Ha-Ras, the target of GAP; no effect on Ha-Ras·GDP was detectable. The GAP catalytic domain also inhibited C-Sdc25p but to a lower extent. The interfering effect by p120-GAP was also evident in a homologous mammalian system, using full-length mouse RasGEF, its C-terminal half-molecule, or C-terminal catalytic domain. As a consequence of this inhibition, presence of p120-GAP enhanced the regeneration of Ha-Ras·GTPγS by GEF at a GDP:GTPγS ratio mimicking the in vivo GDP:GTP ratio. Our work describes a novel function of p120-GAP and suggests a mechanism by which GAP protects Ha-Ras·GTP in vivo against unproductive exchanges.

Helix α3 is proposed as a Ras element playing a key-role in the interference between GAP and GEF on Ras. Ras proteins are molecular switches of a pathway regulating cell growth and differentiation by cycling between two conformations: the active GTP-bound state and the inactive GDP-bound state (1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). As for most GTPases, the GDP/GTP cycle of Ha-Ras is controlled by two kinds of regulators, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; p120-GAP, human RasGAP; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; CDC25Mm, mouse RasGEF (p140-GRF); CDC25Mm631, C-terminal half-molecule of CDC25Mm of 631 amino acid residues; CDC25Mm285, catalytic domain of CDC25Mm of 285 amino acid residues; GTPγS, 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); EF, elongation factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and the GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF). Thus, the level of Ha-Ras·GTP depends on the ratio of the activities of these two regulators and consequently, conditions influencing their activity affect the function of Ha-Ras. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of these two ligands have only been in part clarified. For instance, why only in particular conditions is the decrease in GAP activity associated with the increase in the concentration of p21·GTP (2Downward J. Graves P.H. Warne R. Sydonia R.

Upon activation of receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, p120-GAP is phosphorylated in vivo, but it is as yet unclear whether this modification is involved in the regulation of its negative effect on Ha-Ras·GTP (5Pronk G.I. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning GEF, the activation of Ha-Ras by tyrosine kinase-linked receptors has been reported to depend on the transient translocation of the ubiquitous Ras·GEF SOS to the cell membrane (5Pronk G.I. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar), a process whose regulation still presents several unclear aspects. Recent work in vivo has suggested that Ca2+, calmodulin (6Farnsworth C.L. Feshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation (7Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) control the activity of the neuronal CDC25-like RasGEF, but how these effects are coordinated, remains an open question. The biochemical characterization of CDC25Mm has shown that the activity of its C-terminal catalytic domain is negatively regulated by the N-terminal moiety and that the Ca2+-dependent proteins calmodulin and calpain may be involved in this mechanism (8Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another important aspect, the effect of the simultaneous action of p120-GAP and GEF on the activated Ha-Ras state p21·GTP, has yet to be investigated. Indeed, GAP and GEF have both as common target GTP-bound Ha-Ras, with the specific difference that p120-GAP has a much higher affinity for Ha-Ras·GTP than for Ha-Ras·GDP (9Schaber M.D. Garsky V.M. Boylan D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Marshall M.S. Sigal L.S. Gibbs J.B. Proteins. 1989; 6: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas GEF acts on Ras·GTP and Ras·GDP with nearly the same efficiency (10Créchet J.B. Poullet P. Mistou M.-Y. Parmeggiani A. Camonis J. Boy-Marcotte E. Damak F. Jacquet M. Science. 1990; 248: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol.

In this context, it is also worth mentioning that the GTP-bound elongation factor (EF) Tu, a model GTPase in bacterial protein biosynthesis sharing structural and functional homology with Ras, is protected against the action of its GEF EF-Ts by amino acid tRNA and the ribosome that is since long known to exert a GAP-like activity on the EF-Tu GTPase (14Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Weissbach H. Petska S. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323-373Crossref Google Scholar, 15Weijland A. Harmark K. Cool R.H. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 683Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The importance of a coordination between the various Ras ligands is moreover suggested by the increasing number of ligands found to interact with Ha-Ras besides GAPs and GEFs (for references, see Wittinghofer and Hermann (16Wittinghofer A. Hermann C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Starting from these considerations, we have studied the influence of GAP on the action of GEF on activated Ha-Ras. For this purpose, we have tried to distinguish possible effects of GAP from its ability to enhance the Ha-Ras-dependent GTPase by substituting GTP with its nonhydrolyzable analogue GTPγS. As a system, we have chosen human p120-GAP, prepared by a novel method, and the catalytic domain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Sdc25p (C-Sdc25p), a model GEF acting equally well on Ha-Ras p21, and Ras2p (10Créchet J.B.

The results suggest that p120-GAP exerts an additional function that prevents GEF from interacting with p21·GTP. The evidence that this effect is involved in the modulation of the signals of the Ras pathway is discussed. TheEscherichia coli strain SCS-1 was transformed with a pGEX vector containing the NaeI-EcoRI fragment from pUC101, a vector kindly provided by Dr. F. McCormick. It encoded a p120-GAP lacking the first 5 amino acids, thus comprising residues 6–1047. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 800 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression of the GST-fused protein was induced overnight at 24 °C by adding low amounts of IPTG (0.01 mm) at a cell density of 0.4 A 600unit. The cell culture, chilled to 4 °C at 2.0A 600, was centrifugated at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 70 ml of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication and addition of 1% triton, the suspension was centrifuged at 17,000 × gfor 30 min and the supernatant was mixed batchwise with 4 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), gently shaken for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed twice with buffer A and the protein eluted with glutathione (3 mg/ml) was concentrated to 1.5 ml with Aquacide II (Calbiochem) and then to 400 μl on a Centricon-100 (Amicon) at 3,000 × g, diluting several times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl and 28 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein solution, mixed with an identical volume of glycerol, was stable for at least several months when stored at −20 °C. The GST fusion was cleaved by incubation with 0.1 unit of thrombin (Sigma), 1 μg of protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, 7 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol at 30 °C for 30 min. The thrombin was removed by washing on Centricon-100 as above. Dissociation of the p21·nucleotide complexes was determined at 30 °C by the nitrocellulose binding assay. The p21·[3H]GDP and p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS complexes were obtained by incubation of Ha-Ras p21 with a 4-fold excess of [3H]GDP (340 Bq·pmol−1) or [γ-35S]GTPγS (44.8 Bq·pmol−1), respectively, for 10 min at 30 °C in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). MgCl2(final concentration, 3 mm) was then added to stabilize the p21·nucleotide complex. The dissociation was started by addition of a 500-fold excess of cold nucleotide with or without GEF as indicated in the legends to figures. At time intervals, aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn, passed on nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm of Sartorius SM 11 306), and the retained radioactivity measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Pharmacia, model Wallac 1410). The rate constants were calculated as described (13Jacquet E. Baouz S. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12347-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Créchet J.-B. Poullet P. Bernardi A. Fasano O. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For competition assays between C-Sdc25p or CDC25Mm and p120-GAP, the dissociation rate of p21·[3H]GDP or p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS, preincubated or not with various concentrations of p120-GAP, was measured in the absence and in the presence of different concentrations of GEF. For details see legends to figures. The hydrolysis of the p21·[γ-32P]GTP complex was determined by following the disappearance of γ-32P radioactivity of nitrocellulose-bound p21·[γ-32P]GTP at 25 °C. The p21·[γ-32P]GTP complex was formed in buffer B by incubating Ha-Ras p21·GDP with a 4-fold excess of [γ-32P]GTP (227 Bq·pmol−1) for 10 min at 30 °C, as described above for the p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex. The p120-GAP activity was measured at a concentration of 10 nm Ha-Ras p21-bound GTP and the obtained values extrapolated to 1 μm Ha-Ras p21-bound GTP for comparison with the data of the literature. One unit of specific activity of Ha-Ras p21 stimulation by GAP is defined as the amount of GAP inducing the hydrolysis of 1 nmol of Ha-Ras p21·GTP/min at 25 °C (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of p120-GAP (C-terminal 350 amino acid residues) was purified as GST fusion protein with the same method as p120-GAP. C-Sdc25p (C-terminal 550 amino acid residues) was produced and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (12Poullet P. Créchet J.B. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified Ha-Ras p21 (21Parrini M.C. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Jacquet M. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13776-13783Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), full-length CDC25Mm (1262 amino acid residues), its C-terminal half-molecule of 631 residues (C-CDC25Mm631) (8Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the catalytic domain of 285 residues (C-CDC25Mm285) (13Jacquet E. Baouz S. Parmeggiani A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12347-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were obtained as reported. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 7.5% acrylamide gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 225: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using specific antibodies anti-GST produced in rabbit and peroxidase-conjugated antibodies revealed by the diaminobezamidine method. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using BSA as standard, and in the case of p21 also checked by GDP binding. The pGEX system allowed an easy reproducible production and purification of the recombinant human p120-GAP in good yield and, noteworthy, in the absence of proteolytic phenomena (Fig.1 A). As shown by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies anti-GST (Fig. 1 B), virtually 90% of the produced GST-p120-GAP remained in the supernatant fraction, after centrifugation for 30 min at 17,000 ×g. The temperature of induction and the concentration of IPTG were important parameters to obtain high overproduction and solubility. In fact, induction at 24 °C and 0.01 mm IPTG yielded higher production and solubility of GST-p120-GAP than at 37 °C and 0.1 mm IPTG (not shown). No partial translation products of p120-GAP were detectable. After the affinity chromatography and Centricon-100 treatment, the GST-p120-GAP was at least 90% pure and the yield was ∼1 mg/L for cell culture of 2.0A 600 density (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). The contamination essentially consisted of a faster migrating component unreactive to GST antibodies. Purified GST-p120-GAP was stable for several months, when kept at −20 °C in storage buffer. GST-p120-GAP was cleaved by thrombin (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). However, since fused GST-p120-GAP was essentially as active as the unfused product, most experiments were carried out with the fused protein. The specific activity of purified GST-p120-GAP (1510 units/mg) and thrombin-cleaved p120-GAP (1100 units/mg) were comparable to those reported for full-length p120-GAP isolated from the baculovirus/sf9 insect cells system (1100 units/mg) (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,23Halenbeck R. Crosier W.J. Clark R. McCormick F. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21922-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of GAP on the activity of the exchange factor on both active and inactive states of Ras, the complex formed by p21 with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue [γ-35S]GTPγS or with [3H]GDP was used. It is known that p120-GAP and C-GAP have an affinity for GTP-bound p21 much higher (>100 times) than for GDP-bound p21 (9Schaber M.D. Garsky V.M. Boylan D. Hill W.S. Scolnick E.M. Marshall M.S. Sigal L.S. Gibbs J.B. Proteins. 1989; 6: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Antonny B. Chardin P. Roux M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8287-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A illustrates the action of C-Sdc25p on Ha-Ras p21· [γ-35S]GTPγS in the presence and in the absence of p120-GAP or C-GAP. At a concentration of 20 nm C-Sdc25p, the apparent dissociation rate constant (k′−1) of the Ha-Ras·[γ-35S]GTPγS complex was decreased by the presence of 130 nm p120-GAP from 3.5·10−2·min−1 to 1.9·10−2·min−1. Since the apparent dissociation rate constant of p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS is a measure of the GEF activity, this corresponds to a 46% inhibition of the GEF activity in the GTPγS/GTPγS exchange. Most important, this effect was specific for the active form of p21, since no GAP inhibition was detectable if p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS was replaced by p21·[3H]GDP (Fig. 2 B). The inhibition by p120-GAP of the action of C-Sdc25p increased with increasing the concentration of p120-GAP (Figs. 3,A and B). A similar inhibitory effect by p120-GAP was also observed on the the stimulation by C-Sdc25p of the GTPγS/GDP exchange reaction of Ha-Ras (not illustrated). We could estimate that the IC50 of p120-GAP on the C-Sdc25p activity was around 140 nm (Fig.3 B). When we replaced p120-GAP with its isolated catalytic domain C-GAP (350 amino acid), the inhibition of the C-Sdc25p was about 2.5-fold lower (Fig. 3, C and D), the IC50 being approximately 350 nm. This lower effect is in good agreement with the 2-fold lower times affinity observed for a similar catalytic domain of p120-GAP, GAP334, as reported previously (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Figure 3Effect of p120-GAP or C-GAP concentration on the C-Sdc25p activity. In the panels A andC, the dissociation rate constants of p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS complexes (70 nm), in the presence of C-Sdc25p (20 nm) and the given concentrations of p120-GAP (▵) or C-GAP (•), were calculated from 30 min kinetic experiments. In the absence (▪, ▴) of C-Sdc25p, the dissociation rate constants were calculated from 60-min kinetic experiments. In panels B and D, the percentages of inhibition of C-Sdc25p were determined taking the C-Sdc25p-dependent p21 exchange activity in the absence of GAP proteins as 100% activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To our surprise, in the course of these measurements we observed a slight but reproducible stimulation of the intrinsic GTPγS/GTPγS exchange of Ha-Ras by p120-GAP, an effect that increased with increasing the concentration of p120-GAP and was not observed if C-GAP replaced p120-GAP (cf. Fig. 3, A andC). Worth mentioning, no p120-GAP-dependent hydrolysis of [γ-35S]GTPγS could be detected (not shown). In the set of experiments described of Fig.4, we examined the dependence of the GEF activity on the molar ratio C-Sdc25p:p120-GAP, using increasing concentrations of C-Sdc25p and a fixed amount of p120-GAP (136 nm), corresponding to the concentration giving approximately a 50% inhibition in the experiments of Fig. 3. An increase in C-Sdc25p from 10 to 100 nm considerably reduced the inhibition by p120-GAP, as shown by the decrease in the difference between the k′−1 values in the absence and in the presence of p120-GAP (Fig. 4, I–IV). In fact, with the lowest concentration of C-Sdc25p (10 nm) the inhibition by p120-GAP on the dissociation rate constant of p21·[γ-35S]GTPγS was nearly 70%, whereas in the presence of 100 nm C-Sdc25p the inhibition by p120-GAP was practically absent. The interference by GAP on the GEF activity was also tested in a homologous mammalian system by using three forms of the mammalian RasGEF mouse CDC25Mm: the full-length molecule, the C-terminal half-molecule, and the short catalytic domain CDC25Mm285. Noteworthy, the full-length CDC25Mmhas a GEF activity 5 times lower than CDC25Mm631 and 25 times less than CDC25Mm285 (8Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Also in this system, p120-GAP exerted an inhibitory activity, in which specific differences depending on the GEF form could be observed. As shown in Fig.5, in which the concentration of the diverse CDC25Mm forms was chosen to give similar dissociation rates, the inhibition of the stimulation of the Ha-Ras GTPγS/GTPγS exchange in the case of full-length CDC25Mmand C-terminal half-molecule was about 50%. The effect was lower (inhibition, 18%) when the short catalytic domain CDC25Mm285 was used. To evaluate the implication of the inhibitory effect of p120-GAP on GEF in the regeneration of the active form of Ha-Ras and, consequently, to examine the possibility of correlating these observations in vitro with the physiological conditions in the cell, we have investigated the influence of p120-GAP under conditions in which the molar ratio of the free nucleotides GDP and GTP (as GTPγS) corresponded to the range of values estimated to occur in the cell. As shown in Fig. 6, at a GDP to GTPγS ratio of 1 to 10, the addition of 130 nm p120-GAP enhanced the CDC25Mm-dependent stimulation of the GDP/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras. This result supports the possibility that the inhibition by GAP of the GEF activity via sequestration of the active form of Ha-Ras favors the interaction between the exchange factor and Ha-Ras·GDP, its physiological substrate. The increasing number of interactions attributed to Ha-Ras, a central crossing point for the regulation of the signal transmission in the cell, suggests the existence of mechanisms coordinating the complex pattern of interactions of ligands on Ha-Ras (for references, see Wittinghofer and Hermann (16Wittinghofer A. Hermann C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). In an attempt to shed some light on possible mechanisms, we have chosen a system in vitroanalyzing whether GAP can directly affect the activation of Ha-Ras by GEF, since GAP and GEF are both known to affect the GTP-bound Ha-Ras. For this study, it was important to have available the whole molecule of p120-GAP. We therefore developed a simple procedure to isolate highly purified p120-GAP, by defining precise, reproducible conditions for its efficient production in E. coli. Despite the lack of the first 5 residues, the ability of our p120-GAP to stimulate the p21 GTPase was virtually the same as reported for full-length p120-GAP produced and purified from baculovirus/sf9 insect cells (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,23Halenbeck R. Crosier W.J. Clark R. McCormick F. Koths K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21922-21928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No proteolytic phenomena were observed during its preparation and the stability of the purified form was verified over months. This method facilitates the utilization of this regulator of Ras, whose isolation is known to present still considerable difficulties (25Yoder-Hill J. Golubic M. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27615-27621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), avoiding time-consuming and expensive procedures, such as the use of the insect cell system. The good yield of p120-GAP obtained with this method makes possible its use for future structural studies. In the GDP/GTP cycle of Ras proteins, the reversibility of all the partial steps of the nucleotide·p21 interaction, except for the hydrolysis of GTP, could allow the occurrence of unproductive reactions, such as the GTP/GTP exchange. In fact, in the cell the only physiologically significant exchange is the replacement of the Ha-Ras-bound GDP with GTP. Constraints have been proposed for promoting the GDP/GTP exchange on Ha-Ras, such as the higher concentration of GTPversus that of GDP in the cell (11Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16541-16548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Haubzuck H. McCormick F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar) and the somewhat higher affinity of GEF for the GDP- versus the GTP-bound state of Ha-Ras (10Créchet J.B. Poullet P. Mistou M.-Y. Parmeggiani A. Camonis J. Boy-Marcotte E. Damak F. Jacquet M. Science. 1990; 248: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Haney S.A. Broach J.R. J. Biol.

These properties, however, are not sufficient to guarantee alone a physiologically productive nucleotide exchange on Ha-Ras. In this work, we report an additional function of p120-GAP, that might have regulatory significance in the cell. The use of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS, that abolishes the stimulatory effect of p120-GAP on Ha-Ras, allowed us to reveal a new effect associated with the active form of Ha-Ras, the privileged target of GAP; p120-GAP bound to p21·GTPγS can prevent the interaction between GEF and the active form of Ha-Ras, and thus the stimulation of the GTPγS/GTPγS exchange. Also C-GAP inhibited the GEF activity to an extent 2.5-fold as low, in agreement with the lower (∼2-fold) affinity for activated Ha-Ras (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). No inhibition of the GEF-dependent GDP/GDP exchange on p21 was observed. These data suggest a mechanism, by which p120-GAP in the cell would prevent the GEF interaction with Ha-Ras·GTP after accomplishment of the GDP/GTP exchange on Ras. Since the role of GEF is to activate as many as possible molecules of Ras, the interaction with already activated Ras proteins is physiologically useless, delaying the productive GDP/GTP cycle. The p120-GAP protection of Ha-Ras would increase the probability of GEF to interact with its biologically important substrate, the Ras·GDP complex. Indeed, in agreement with this model, under conditions mimicking the cellular GDP:GTP molar ratio of 1:10, the presence of p120-GAP can stimulate the GEF-dependent GDP/GTPγS exchange on Ha-Ras. As enhancer of the GTPase activity of Ras promoting the return to the inactive GDP-bound state, p120-GAP has been considered a negative regulator of Ras. However, inhibitory effects on the ability of this GAP to enhance the GTPase activity of Ha-Ras have been reported as response to extracellular stimuli. For example, stimulation of the T cell receptors in T lymphocytes (2Downward J. Graves P.H. Warne R. Sydonia R. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) or treatment with erythropoietin of human erythroleukemia cells (3Torti M. Marti K.B. Altschuler D. Yamamoto K. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8293-8298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) results in a large increase in Ras·GTP as well as in a decrease in the stimulation of the GTPase activity by GAP in cell lysate. p120-GAP is phosphorylated in vivo upon activation of receptors or nonreceptors tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylated p120-GAP associated with the p190 phosphoprotein was found to have a decreased GTPase activating effect (27Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Mitogenic lipids such as phosphatidic acid and arachidonic acid can inhibit p120-GAP in vitro (28Sermon B.A. Eccleston J.F.

All these data are consistent with the possibility that under specific in vivoconditions the GTPase activating effect of p120-GAP may be inhibited. Evidence also exists that p120-GAP may act as downstream effector (for refs, cf. Pronk and Bos (5Pronk G.I. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar). The dual role of p120-GAP as negative regulator and effector of Ras is far from being fully understood and it is possible that the protective association of p120-GAP with activated p21 is correlated with the function of GAP as transmitter of downstream signals of Ha-Ras. As model GEF we have used for most experiments the highly purified catalytic domain of S. cerevisiae Sdc25p that is the best biochemically characterized exchange factor so far, but we confirmed the competition between GAP and GEF on the active form of Ha-Ras in a homologous mammalian system using the mouse GEF CDC25Mm. The GEF activity of full-length CDC25Mm and of the C-terminal half-molecule, CDC25Mm631, were inhibited by p120-GAP more efficiently than C-Sdc25p, in agreement with their lower affinity for Ha-Ras. The observation that the inhibitory effect on the isolated catalytic domain CDC25Mm285 is weak suggests that noncatalytic domains of GEF are also involved in the interference with GAP. The observed reproducible slight stimulation by p120-GAP of the intrinsic GTPγS exchange of Ha-Ras was not induced by C-GAP. Since the noncatalytic regions of p120-GAP are needed for a fully productive Ras-GAP interaction (20Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it is possible that these regions may induce some destabilization of the Ras-nucleotide interaction, very likely via intramolecular arrangement of the Ras nucleotide binding pocket. We have demonstrated the inhibition by GAP of the GEF activity in vitro. The reciprocal effect, the influence of GEF on the GAP activity is also likely to exist, as suggested by preliminary experiments indicating an inhibition by C-Sdc25p of the p120-GAP-dependent stimulation of the Ha-Ras p21·GTPase. 2C. Giglione, unpublished observations. Since the investigation of this aspect presents several technical difficulties, because the GTP hydrolysis produces the inactive form p21·GDP that is also a substrate of the competitor GEF, other experimental approaches may be necessary to define in an unequivocal manner the reciprocal nature of the constraints induced by GEF on GAP. Since it is known that besides GEF and GAP, the active form of Ha-Ras can bind other ligands, such as c-Raf, Rin, protein kinase C, and P1(3)K (for references, see Wittinghofer and Hermann (16Wittinghofer A. Hermann C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), it is likely that not only GAP but also these effectors contribute to protect p21·GTP, hindering futile reactions by favoring a physiological course of the GEF-dependent GDP/GTP exchange reaction. In the cell the action of these effector molecules could equal that of p120-GAP or be even more relevant. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf was found to compete with p120-GAP for binding to Ha-Ras·GTP (29Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E.

The coordination of these multiple interactions could represent an important mechanism for the regulation of the level of the active and inactive state of Ha-Ras. What is the structural background of the interference of GAP on the GEF binding to Ha-Ras? Does this effect depend: on (i) the overlapping of GAP and GEF binding sites on p21 inducing hindrance phenomena, or on (ii) allosteric long range effects induced by GAP on the GEF binding site? The specificity of the p120-GAP effect suggests that this competition is mediated by the regions of p21 mostly influenced by the active and the inactive states of Ras proteins, namely the switch I (loop L2/N-terminal β2) and switch II regions (loop L4/helix α2). Among the regions of Ras known so far to be essential for the function of GAP, the loop L2 plus the N-terminal strand β2 and the loop L6/N-terminal helix α3 are structural elements implicated in the binding site of GAP (32Polakis P.

As this loop contains a residue (Ala11 in Ha-Ras and Gly18 in Ras2p) important for the specificity toward RasGAP, it can be considered as potential binding site (35Parrini M.C. Bernardi A.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present knowledge of the Ras interaction sites with GAP and GEF indicates that helix α3 represents a secondary element concerning both regulators, GAP interacting with its N-terminal part and GEF with the C-terminal one (Fig. 7). The observation that helix α3 play an important role in the binding of GAP and GEF could explain the interference between these two kinds of regulators. It is also important to mention that helix α3/loop L7 has been shown by three-dimensional studies to be strictly coordinated with helix α2/loop L5 that on its turn is closely associated to the phosphoryl binding loop L2, an important element of the nucleotide binding pocket (48Stouten P.F.W. Sander C. Wittinghofer A. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the tertiary model of Ras, the regions comprising helix α2/loop L5 and helix α3/loop L7 are located on the same surface side of the molecule. In conclusion, the results of this work have enlightened a coordination mechanism between the exchange activity of GEF and a function of p120-GAP distinct from its action as enhancer of the p21 GTPase. This mechanism very probably contributes to determine the physiological course of the GDP/GTP cycle of Ras proteins and thus the function of the Ras pathway in the cell. We have reproduced in a system in vitro some effects that could take place in vivo, even though our system represents a simplified version of possible in vivo situations. The extension of this kind of study to the other ligands of Ras is a prerequisite for building up in vitromodel systems capable of mimicking more faithfully the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms of Ha-Ras activity in the cell. We are grateful to Dr. Davide Baroni and our laboratory colleagues Drs. J. B. Créchet, E. Jacquet, and I. Krab for discussion and advise. We are particularly indebted to J. B. Créchet for the preparation of highly purified S. cerevisiae catalytic domain of Sdc25p."

To study the transcriptional mechanisms specifying sMtCK gene expression to the heart, transgenic mice were created carrying the 5′-flanking sequences of the human sMtCK gene ligated upstream of the human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene. RNA blot hybridization demonstrated that the human sMtCK sequence, −485 to +6 base pair (bp), did not activate reporter gene expression to a detectable level. However, the human sMtCK sequence, −921 to +6 bp, expressed the hGH reporter gene at a high level in heart and skeletal muscle and at a very low level in esophagus and kidney, and it did not express the hGH gene in other organs tested (brain, lung, liver, spleen, bladder, uterus, and stomach). In situhybridization revealed that reporter gene transcription was specified to cardiac and skeletal myocytes, recapitulating precisely the expression pattern of the endogenous gene. Sequence analysis identified several consensus binding sites between −921 and −757 bp, including four GATT motifs, one E box, and one MEF2 site. Further analysis of a third transgenic mouse strain demonstrated that the human sMtCK sequence, −757 to +6 bp, did not direct detectable expression of the hGH reporter gene. We conclude that this 160-bp genomic sequence, from −921 to −757 bp, is necessary in specifying expression of the human sMtCK gene to the oxidative and highly metabolically active heart tissue.

ATP is the universal carrier of metabolic energy. In nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic cells, ATP is predominantly synthesized in mitochondria, where most of the energy-yielding oxidative reactions are localized.

To study the transcriptional mechanisms specifying energy metabolism-related gene expression to the heart, we isolated and characterized the human sMtCK gene and 4.6 kb of its 5′-flanking sequence (4Klein S.C. Haas R.C. Perryman M.B. Billadello J.J. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18058-18065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This gene is located on chromosome 5, spans 37 kb of the genome, and encodes a single polypeptide of 419 amino acids. The 5′-flanking region of the human sMtCK gene possesses features of a highly regulated gene: a TATAA box at nucleotide −36, three CCAAT sequence homologues at positions −134, −155, and −175, and a non-GC-rich promoter region prior to the transcription start point. Because no permanent cell line faithfully represents mature, beating cardiomyocytes, we generated two transgenic mouse lines to study the transcriptional regulatory activity of human sMtCK gene 5′-flanking region. Our results demonstrated that the 5′-flanking region of the human sMtCK gene contains elements specifying gene expression to heart and skeletal muscle and that the sequence between −921 and −485 bp (relative to the transcription start point) is essential for a high level, myocyte-specific gene expression. Further studies in transgenic mice narrowed the region to between −921 and −757 bp and pointed to the potential importance of several consensus binding sites within this region, including one MEF2 consensus, one E box, and four GATT binding sites. To make 5′-nested deletion constructs, DNA fragments with varied 5′-ends and a common 3′-end (+6 relative to the transcription start point) of the human sMtCK gene 5′-flanking sequence were generated using convenient restriction sites (Fig. 1). The insert for one construct (psMtCK80CAT) was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction. These genomic DNA fragments were subsequently placed at the HindIII/XbaI site in the vector pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) (Fig. 1). Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated based on the method of Chienet al. (27Chien K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1770-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cardiac myocytes were plated at 2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and incubated in serum-free PC-1 media (Ventrex, Portland, ME) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. Transfection was performed by a liposome-mediated method (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim) with 20 μg of test DNA and 5 μg of the control plasmid, pMSV β-gal, which contains the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the Maloney murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. The medium was changed to PC-1/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 (1:2) the day after transfection, and cells were harvested 48 h later. C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts, myotubes, and NIH/3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts were plated, maintained, transfected, and harvested as described previously (4Klein S.C. Haas R.C. Perryman M.B. Billadello J.J. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18058-18065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freezing and thawing in 150 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. β-Galactosidase assay was performed, and the amounts of cell extract required for CAT assays were calculated accordingly. CAT assays were performed with 24 μm of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Corp.). Acetylated chloramphenicol was separated by three rounds of xylene extraction and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Results were expressed as -fold induction over that of the promoterless and enhancerless vector, pCAT-Basic. The 2.15-kb human growth hormone (hGH) gene beginning at nucleotide +3 (relative to the transcription start point) (28Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1982; 1: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was inserted into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene) (pBShGH). AHinfI/PvuII restriction fragment of the human sMtCK gene 5′-flanking sequence, −921/+6 bp (relative to the transcription start point), was placed into the EcoRV site of pBShGH. This construct was designated as psMtCK921hGH. A second construct, psMtCK485hGH, was created by placing theEcoRV/PvuII restriction fragment of human sMtCK gene 5′-flanking sequence, −485/+6 bp, into the EcoRV site of pBShGH. The transgenes were subsequently released from the cloning vector, pBSII SK+, by HindIII and ScaI as 3.1- (sMtCK921hGH) and 2.68-kb fragments (sMtCK485hGH), respectively (Fig.2). The transgene sequences were verified by the dideoxynucleotide method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) at both ends and through the junction regions between the 3′-end of the sMtCK sequence and the 5′-end of the hGH gene. The linear transgene fragments were suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 mm EDTA and injected into the pronuclei of the fertilized eggs of the C57BL/6 × SJL F2 hybrid mice in collaboration with DNX (Princeton, NJ). Mice carrying the transgenes (founders) and their transgenic offspring were first screened by the polymerase chain reaction to confirm the presence of the hGH gene and analyzed by Southern blot detecting the whole transgene. Transgenic lines were maintained by mating transgenic offspring with nontransgenic littermates. Use of the hGH gene as a reporter allows a quick screen of mice expressing the transgene by a radioimmunoassay detecting serum hGH obtained from tail bleeding. Genomic DNA was isolated from a short segment of excised mouse tail and digested with EcoRV, which cuts once within the sMtCK921hGH transgene (at −485 of the human sMtCK 5′-flanking sequence). Two μg of DNA was loaded onto each lane, separated on a 1.0% agarose gel, transferred onto an uncharged nylon membrane, and hybridized at 65 °C overnight with a random-primed,32P-labeled probe derived from the whole sMtCK921hGH construct. The filter was washed under high stringency (0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mmNa3-citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, 65 °C) and exposed overnight at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. To determine the number of copies of the integrated transgene in each founder line, hybridization reactions with known amounts of the transgene were performed on the same filter. The association between transgene copy number per diploid genome and hybridization signal in cpm was analyzed by linear regression. The transgene copy number of a transgenic founder line was ascertained by comparison with this standard curve. Comparable loading of DNA samples between lanes was examined with the hybridized signal of the mouse α-actin gene detected with a 451-bp DNA fragment from intron C of the same gene. The complementary RNA (cRNA) probe for detecting mouse endogenous sMtCK mRNA was synthesized from a 475-bp mouse sMtCK cDNA fragment including exons 6–9 cloned into pGEM-3Z. 2Z. Khuchua and A. W. Strauss, unpublished data. For detecting expressed hGH transgene mRNA, the cRNA probe was synthesized from a 240-bp RsaI/SmaI genomic fragment of the hGH exon V cloned into pGEM-2. Run-off antisense and sense cRNAs were transcribed from the linearized vectors with the SP6 RNA polymerase (antisense probe) or T7 RNA polymerase (sense probe) with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim) included in the reaction to label the cRNA probes. Total tissue RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar), separated through a 1.2% formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gel, and transferred onto a noncharged nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed overnight at 68 °C with 50% formamide. The membrane was washed under high stringency (65 °C, 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS). Hybridization of the labeled probe to corresponding mRNA was detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim). Signal was detected with a standard colorimetric method for alkaline phosphatase (31Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). The cRNA probes for detecting the endogenous mouse sMtCK mRNA and the transgenic hGH mRNA were synthesized as described for RNA blot hybridization but labeled with [α-35S]UTP (Amersham). Mouse organs were fixed at 4 °C for 5 h in 0.9% picric acid, 9.0% formaldehyde, and 5.0% acetic acid. These were then dehydrated and paraffin-embedded according to standard histological procedures. The hybridization reaction contained 50% formamide, 13% dextran sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll 400, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.5 mg/ml yeast total RNA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 105cpm/μl 35S-labeled cRNA (32Brahic M. Ozden S. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992Google Scholar). In situhybridization was performed overnight at 50 °C on 5-μm tissue sections according to the method of Simmons et al. (33Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar). The sections were then exposed for several days to develop the autoradiogram, and subsequently, emulsion autoradiography was performed (NTB-2, Eastman Kodak Co.). Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin/eosin and mounting with Permount. Blood was withdrawn from bleeding of the tail, and sera were collected. Circulating hGH was detected by radioimmunoassay with the 125I-labeled antibody against hGH (Nichols Institute). The detection limit of this assay is 0.5 ng/ml. All DNA sequence analyses were performed through the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, version 7.2 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Previous studies from our laboratory (4Klein S.C. Haas R.C. Perryman M.B. Billadello J.J. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18058-18065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haas R.C. Strauss A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the human sMtCK gene is exclusively transcribed in heart and skeletal muscle. To initially screen genomic regions of the human sMtCK gene responsible for heart and skeletal muscle-specific expression, nested deletion constructs of the human sMtCK gene 5′-flanking sequence were tested in three types of cultured cells: rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, C2C12 mouse skeletal myocytes, and 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts. The plasmid, pCAT-Basic, which does not contain a promoter or enhancer, and the plasmid, pCAT-Control, which possesses both the SV40 promoter and enhancer, were also tested in each experiment. High levels of CAT activities in the pCAT-Control transfected cell lines (C2C12myotubes, 792-fold over that of pCAT-Basic; 3T3 fibroblasts, 181-fold; cardiomyocytes, 161-fold) demonstrated the presence of efficient general transcription/translation machineries in these cells (Fig.1 A). The construct, sMtCK1308CAT, expressed the CAT gene at a high level in myocytes as compared with 3T3 cells (C2C12myotubes, 166-fold over pCAT-Basic; cardiomyocytes, 75-fold; 3T3 cells, 9-fold). As additional 5′-flanking sequence (2271 bp) was included (construct sMtCK3579CAT), CAT activity decreased to about half in both the C2C12 myocytes and the cardiomyocytes, but remained highly active as compared with pCAT-Basic. To examine in greater detail the 5′-flanking sequences in cardiomyocytes, 5′-nested deletion constructs were transfected into rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, with sequences from −80 to −485 bp of the human sMtCK promoter, the corresponding CAT activity did not change from that of the basal promoter. However, when the sequence between −485 and −921 bp was included, a dramatic induction of CAT activity was observed (from 9-fold over that of pCAT-Basic to 52-fold). With more 5′-flanking sequences included (from −921 to −3579 bp), CAT activity decreased about 50%. These results from transient transfection of cultured cells demonstrate that the human sMtCK genomic sequence, −1308/+6 bp, directs a high level expression of the CAT reporter gene in cardiac and skeletal myocytes and that the sequence between −921 and −485 is mainly responsible for this high level expression of the CAT gene in cardiomyocytes. However, sequences necessary to induce high level reporter gene expression were distributed between −921 and −485 bp, as suggested by the reporter gene expression directed by the sMtCK sequence −757 to +4 bp (28-fold over pCAT-Basic). Cells in culture are a convenient model but differ from the in vivo situation in fundamental aspects (34Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 1-7Google Scholar). For example, cultured cells rely heavily on glycolysis to produce energy and less on oxidative phosphorylation. Accordingly, cells in culture express energy metabolism-related genes differently from cells in vivo. We therefore believed it essential to examine the transcriptional regulatory activity of the human sMtCK gene in the intact animal. Based on the preliminary data from our in vitro transient transfection experiments, transgenic mice were generated to examine the role of genomic sequence between −921 and −485 bp. Two constructs, sMtCK921hGH and sMtCK485hGH, were created (Fig. 2 A). Five founder mice were detected carrying the sMtCK921hGH transgene, and 14 founder mice carried the sMtCK485hGH transgene (data not shown). The number of copies of the transgenes among these lines was determined. The regression equation expressing the correlation between transgene copy number and hybridized signal from Southern blot in this experiment was y = 1.0769 + 0.4001x(r = 0.9992, n = 7), in whichy is the copy number and x is the hybridized signal in cpm. The calculated transgene copy numbers of three independent founder lines of the construct, sMtCK921hGH, were 112, 29, and 2, respectively (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3,4, and 5). Comparable loading between lanes was shown with the hybridized signal of the mouse α-actin gene (Fig.2 C). Southern blot analysis also suggested that the transgene, sMtCK921hGH, was organized into a head-to-tail concatemer and integrated independently in host genome among these three founder lines (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–5). The common fragment has the same apparent molecular weight of the transgene itself (lane 1) and is released from the concatemer by EcoRV, which cuts once within the transgene (at −485 of the human sMtCK sequence). The two fragments with novel lengths correspond to the 5′- and 3′-junction fragments between the concatemer and the host genome. We conclude that the three lines result from independent integration events and have different transgene copy numbers. Because the pattern and level of expression of the reporter gene can be influenced by integration site environment and transgene copy number, independent founder lines are essential to control for such effects. Expression of the endogenous mouse sMtCK gene was examined extensively with RNA blot analysis (Fig.3 B). The endogenous sMtCK mRNA was detected exclusively in sarcomeric muscles, namely heart (both atria and ventricles), soleus, and diaphragm. The signal was more intense in diaphragm and ventricles and less in atria and soleus. No signal was detected from all other tissues tested, including brain, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, uterus, esophagus, and stomach. These results demonstrate that the sMtCK gene is highly and exclusively expressed in sarcomeric muscles and suggest that a transcriptional mechanism(s) specifying gene expression to muscle tissues must exist. Fourteen founder mice were created for the construct, sMtCK485hGH, and the transgene was successfully transmitted to their offspring (data not shown). We tested for hGH expression at the protein and mRNA levels by radioimmunoassay for hGH immunoreactivity in sera of progeny of the 14 founder mice (hGH detection limit, 0.5 ng/ml); RNA blot hybridization on total RNA isolated from ventricles and soleus muscles of 12 independent strains; and RNA blot analysis of total RNA from organs of two independent founder mice, including brain, lung, diaphragm, atria, ventricles, soleus, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, uterus, esophagus, and stomach. Expression of the hGH reporter gene was not detected by any of these tests in any of the 14 strains. These results show that the sMtCK sequence, −485/+6 bp, did not direct detectable expression of the hGH reporter gene to the organs examined, including heart and skeletal muscle. Thus, crucial cis-acting, activating elements are not located within this region. Five founder mice carrying the transgene, sMtCK921hGH, were created. They were all noticeably larger in size as compared with their nontransgenic littermates (data not shown). Three adult mice, each of an independent strain as shown in Fig. 2 B, were chosen for detailed analysis. hGH radioimmunoassay detected hGH in their sera (line 1602, 12.3 μg/ml; line 1606, 5.8 μg/ml; line 1609, 0.5 μg/ml; the normal murine serum growth hormone level is 10–100 ng/ml). RNA blot hybridization results from one adult mouse (line 1606, 7 months old, copy number 29) are provided in Fig. 3 A. Abundant hGH mRNA was detected in atria, ventricles, soleus muscle, and diaphragm. Similar to the endogenous sMtCK gene, the signal was more intense in ventricles and diaphragm and less so in atria and soleus. Low level signal was also noted in esophagus and kidney. The two bands of the transgene hGH mRNA detected on RNA blot (Fig.3 A) might be the result of differential polyadenylation or precursor hGH mRNA processing. hGH mRNA was not detected in any other tissues tested, including brain, lung, liver, spleen, bladder, uterus, and stomach. In another founder strain (1602), reporter gene expression was also detected in heart and skeletal muscle, but ectopic expression was observed in brain (data not shown). Ectopic expression may have resulted from the influence of integration site environment, since this differs between founder lines. These results demonstrate that the human sMtCK genomic sequence, −921/+6 bp, can recapitulate precisely the pattern of tissue expression of the endogenous sMtCK gene in sarcomeric muscles. To determine the cell type in sarcomeric muscles that expresses the hGH reporter gene, in situ hybridization was performed. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared and hybridized with cRNA probes labeled with [α-35S]UTP. The autoradiographic images of these tissue sections are shown in Fig.4. Hybridization with sense cRNA probes revealed low level, nonspecific probe binding (panels B,D, F, and H), demonstrating specificity of the antisense probes (panels A, C,E, and G). Abundant hGH mRNA was detected in both cardiac atria and ventricles (panel A) and in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (panel E) with the antisense probe. In cross-sections of the skeletal muscles, some areas showed more intense mRNA localization (panel E). These areas correspond between the hGH mRNA localization (panel E) and the endogenous sMtCK mRNA localization (panel G). Thus, the results from in situ hybridization reveal first that the pattern of expression of the reporter hGH gene recapitulated precisely the tissue and cell type specificity of the endogenous sMtCK gene and, second, that the level of endogenous and transgene expression is comparable. After in situ hybridization was performed, the tissue sections were embedded in and exposed to autoradiographic emulsion, counterstained with eosin and hematoxylin, and examined under both dark field and bright field illumination. The results are assembled in Fig.5. Under dark field examination, the low level, nonspecific sense probe binding permitted the use of a higher illumination level to delineate the contour of cells and nuclei (first column, panels A, D,G, J, M, P, S, and V). For antisense probe hybridization, the intense signal limited the illumination level used (second column,panels B, E, H, K,N, Q, T, and W). To orient cell and nucleus contour, the bright field images of the same viewing area shown in the second column of Fig. 5 were provided in the third column (panels C, F, I,L, O, R, U, andX). Under bright field microscopy, hGH mRNA was detected in and around the nuclei of striated cardiac (panels C and F) and skeletal myocytes (panels O and R). No signal was found for fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, or pericardium. This cell specificity of the hGH transgene expression corresponds t"

ARF domain protein 1 (ARD1) is a member of the ARF family that differs from other ARFs by the presence of a 46-kDa amino-terminal extension. We previously reported that this extension acts as a GTPase-activating protein for the ARF domain of ARD1 (Vitale, N., Moss, J., and Vaughan, M. (1996)Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.93, 1941–1944). Both GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis are necessary for physiological function of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, and the rates of GDP/GTP exchange and GTPase activity are critical in the activation/deactivation cycle. Dissociation of GDP from the ARF domain of ARD1 was faster than from ARD1 itself (both proteins synthesized in Escherichia coli). Using deletion mutations, it was demonstrated that the 15 amino acids directly preceding the ARF domain were responsible for decreasing the rate of GDP dissociation but not guanosine 5-[γ-thio]triphosphate dissociation. By site-specific mutagenesis it was shown that hydrophobic amino acids in this region were particularly important in stabilizing the GDP-bound form of ARD1. It is suggested that, like the amino-terminal segment of ARF, the equivalent region in ARD1, located between the GTPase-activating protein and ARF domains, may act as a GDP dissociation inhibitor.

Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar). When GTP occupies its guanine nucleotide-binding site, the G protein can interact with and modify the activity of a downstream target protein. Hydrolysis of GTP causes the dissociation of the G protein-target complex and thus terminates the “active state” of the G protein. Cells regulate the ratio of active and inactive G proteins by modulating the rates of GDP release and GTP hydrolysis (GTPase activity). ARD1 is a 64-kDa protein that contains a 18-kDa carboxyl-terminal ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) domain (p3) and a 46-kDa amino-terminal domain (p5) (2Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARF proteins have been implicated in vesicular membrane trafficking in several intracellular compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosomes, and nuclear envelope (reviewed in Ref. 3Moss J.

It was recently reported that the ARF domain of ARD1 binds specifically GDP and GTP, whereas the amino-terminal domain does not (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using recombinant proteins, it was shown that the amino-terminal p5 domain of ARD1 stimulates hydrolysis of GTP bound to the ARF domain p3 and consequently appears to be the GAP component of this bifunctional protein (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of the p5 domain on the GTPase activity of p3 was specific, because GTP hydrolysis by other members of the ARF family was not increased (16Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The presence of an intrinsic GAP domain is an apparently unique phenomenon for monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, because GTPase activity of other members of the Ras superfamily is increased by a separate GAP molecule, which interacts with the effector region of the protein (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using chimeric proteins, we demonstrated that the GAP domain of ARD1 similarly interacts with the effector region of the ARF domain of ARD1 and thereby stimulates GTP hydrolysis (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nucleotide hydrolysis and product dissociation are both regulated steps in the GTPase cycle. Because their rates determine when and for how long the G protein is active, it is important to precisely understand these mechanisms. We reported that GDPβS dissociation from p3 was faster than from ARD1 (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the presence of certain phospholipids (i.e. brain phosphatidylcholine plus phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate plus phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine) more GTP was bound to p3 than to ARD1 (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results suggested that p5 may influence GDP dissociation as well as GTP hydrolysis. We report here that 15 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal domain of p5 positioned before the ARF domain p3 inhibit GDP release but not GTPγS release. Results of site-directed mutagenesis suggest that hydrophobic amino acids within this region are critical in reducing the rate of GDP dissociation. This region therefore appears to have a function similar to that of the amino-terminal segment of ARF proteins. Bovine thrombin was purchased from Sigma.

After cleavage by bovine thrombin, glutathioneS-transferase was removed with glutathione-Sepharose beads and thrombin with benzamidine-Sepharose 6B (21Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnson C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar). Proteins were further purified by gel filtration through Ultrogel AcA 54 and then Ultrogel AcA 34 before storage in small portions at −20 °C. Purity estimated by silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was >98%. Amounts of purified proteins were estimated by a dye binding assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar) and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using bovine serum albumin as standard. Fragments of ARD1 with deletions at the 5′ end (EMBL Data Bank 1993, accession number L04510) from pGEX-5G/LIC (2Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR using the forward primers 5′-GATTCAGGTGTCCC GCG G A TGAAA-3′, 5′-TGTCAAACTAGCCCGC GG ATGTCG-3′, 5′-GAAACTCTGTGTCGTCAACCGCGG ATGGCT-3′, and 5′-AATCAGTTGGATGCCCCGCGG ATGGTCACTTTTACAAAG-3′ (differences from the original clones are underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-GAATTCCCGGGGATCCAACTGCG-3′ (italicized sequence is a BamHI restriction site). The forward primers introduced a SacII restriction site (italicized sequences) and/or an initiation codon in frame (bold sequences) in the deleted fragments NΔ88p8, NΔ200p8, NΔ304p8, and NΔ387p8, respectively. The PCR fragments were digested with SacII andBamHI for 1 h at 37 °C, extracted from low melting agarose gel, and purified by phenol/chloroform precipitation. The resulting fragments were then ligated in-frame to the SacII- and BamHI-digested pGEX5G/LIC expression vector. Ultra competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the plasmids pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ88p8, pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ200p8, pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ304p8, and pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ387p8. Sequences of the ARD1 deletion constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, 5′-AGCTGCAGAAGAATCCATT-3′, 5′-ATCAATTTTAGATATGGCT-3′, 5′-ATGATTGTAGAGTTGTCTT-3′, 5′-TTATTACCTCAATACTCAA-3′, and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Mutant ARD1 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described for the nonmutant ARD1 proteins. Three mutants of p5 with deletions at the 5′ end (NΔ88p5, NΔ200p5, and NΔ304p5) were prepared as described for ARD1 using pGEX5G/LIC/p5 (2Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template and cloned in-frame into the pGEX5G/LIC expression vector. Three mutants of p5 with deletions at the 3′ end were amplified by PCR from pGEX-5G/LIC (2Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-CCTCCTCCGGACCAAGGCGCCTAC-3′ (italicized sequence is aSacII restriction site) and the reverse primers 5′-CTGGAGGCAGGCTGCG GATCC TCATGACAA-3′, 5′-CAATACTGAATGCTTGGAT CC TCAGTGCTG-3′, and 5′-AATGGATTCTTCTGCG GATCC TC ACTGACC-3′. The reverse primers introduced a BamHI restriction site (italicized sequences) and a stop codon in-frame (bold sequences) into the mutant sequences, CΔ69p5, CΔ191p5, and CΔ293p5. The PCR products were cloned in-frame into the pGEX5G/LIC expression vector as described above. Sequences of the mutant p5 constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, 5′-AGCTGCAGAAGAATCCATT-3′, 5′-ATCAATTTTAGATATGGCT-3′, 5′-ATGATTGTAGAGTTGTCTT-3′, and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Mutant p5 fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described for ARD1 proteins. Two mutated fragments of NΔ387p8 with deletions at the 5′ end were prepared by PCR using pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ387p8 as template and the following forward primers 5′-AGCATCCCTGTCACTCCGCGG A TGGATAATCGAGTTCAC-3′ and 5′-ACTTTTACAAAGGATAATC CGCGG ATGATTGGACCAAAAATG-3′ (differences from the original clone are underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-GAATTCCCGGGGATCCAACTGCG-3′ (italicized sequence is a BamHI restriction site). The forward primers introduced aSacII restriction site (italicized sequences) and an initiation codon in-frame (bold sequences) in the deleted fragments NΔ393p8 and NΔ398p8. The PCR fragments were cloned in-frame inSacII- and BamHI-digested pGEX5G/LIC expression vector. Ultra competent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with plasmids pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ393p8 or pGEX5G/LIC/NΔ398p8. Sequences of mutated NΔ387 fragments were confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, 5′-ATGATTGTAGAGTTGTCTT-3′, and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described for ARD1 proteins. For site-directed mutagenesis of NΔ387ARD1, a modification of the unique site elimination mutagenesis procedure of Deng and Nickoloff (23Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) was used. 25 pmol of a 5′-phosphorylated selection primer and 25 pmol of a 5′-phosphorylated mutagenic primer were simultaneously annealed to 750 ng of ND387ARD1-pGEX-5G/LIC in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5)/10 mmmagnesium acetate/50 mm potassium acetate by heating for 5 min at 100 °C and cooling 5 min on ice, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The selection primer 5′-CTGTGACTGGTGACGCGTCAACCAAGTC-3′ changed aScaI restriction site in the Ampr gene of pT7 into a MluI restriction site (underlined). The mutagenic primer 5′-GCCAGCATCATGCGTACTTTTACAAAG-3′ changed Val2 to Arg. The mutagenic primer 5′-ATGGTCACTCGTACAAAGGATAATC-3′ changed Phe4 to Arg. The mutagenic primer 5′-ACAAAGGATCTTCGAGTTCAC-3′ changed Asn8 to Leu. The mutagenic primer 5′-AAGGATAATCGACGTCACATTGGCC-3′ changed Val10to Arg. The mutagenic primer 5′-AATCGAGTTCACCGTGGACCAAAAATGG-3′ changed Ile12 to Arg. The mutagenic primer 5′-CACATTGGAGGAAAAATGGAAATTCGG-3′ changed Pro14 to Gly. The mutagenic primer 5′-CACATTGGACCAGCAATGGAAATTCGG-3′ changed Lys15to Ala. The mutagenic primer 5′ATGGTCACTCGTACAAAGGATAATCGACGTCACCGTGGACCAAAAATGG-3′ changed Phe4, Val10, and Ile12 to arginine. Primers were extended with T7 DNA polymerase, and the new strands were ligated with T4 DNA ligase for 1 h at 37 °C (final volume, 30 μl). Plasmids were then digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 20 units of ScaI (final volume, 60 μl). 4-μl samples were used to transform 90 μl of Epicurian coli XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene). Plasmids NΔ387(V2R), NΔ387(F4R), NΔ387(N8L), NΔ387(V10R), NΔ387(I12R), NΔ387(P14G), NΔ387(K15A), and NΔ387(F4R,V10R,I12R) were purified with Miniprep Wizard (Promega) from bacteria grown overnight in 2 ml of 2 × YT (Biofluids) broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Samples (500 ng) of the plasmids were digested with 20 units of ScaI for 3 h at 37 °C. 4-μl samples were used to transform 40 μl of XLmutS competent cells (Stratagene). Colonies were selectively screened by digestion withMluI, and the presence of the mutations was confirmed by automatic sequencing (Applied Biosystems, 373 DNA Sequencer) using the primers 5′-TTATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′. Large scale production of NΔ387(V2R), NΔ387(F4R), NΔ387(N8L), NΔ387(V10R), NΔ387(I12R), NΔ387(P14G), NΔ387(K15A), and NΔ387(F4R,V10R,I12R) was carried out as described for the deleted mutant of ARD1. Samples (300 pmol) were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 450 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, with 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml cardiolipin and then incubated for 40 min in the same medium plus 10 mm MgCl2 and 3 μm of [35S]GDPβS (2 × 107 cpm; total volume, 500 μl) or [3H]GDP (1.5 × 107 cpm; total volume, 500 μl) before the addition of p5 or deleted/mutated-forms (or water) in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm EDTA. After incubation for 5 min at 30 °C, samples (60 μl) were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, which were washed five times with 1 ml of 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0)/5 mm MgCl2/100 mm NaCl before radioassay in a liquid scintillation counter (19Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10820-10825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To calculate zero time values for dissociation curves, radioactivity bound to filters in the absence of protein was subtracted from the total with proteins. The remainders of the mixtures were immediately diluted with an equal volume of reaction buffer containing 2 mm of GDPβS or GDP. Samples (120 μl) were taken after 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min at 30 °C for quantification of bound radioactivity, as described for the zero time samples. Release of [35S]GTPγS was measured as described previously (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of values from triplicate determinations. Errors bars smaller than the symbols are not shown. GTPγS binding to purified recombinant ARD proteins was assessed using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA with 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml cardiolipin and then incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in the same medium plus 10 mmMgCl2 and 3 μm [35S] GTPγS (∼3 × 106 cpm; total volume, 150 μl). Samples (70 μl) were then transferred to nitrocellulose filter for rapid filtration followed by washing six times each with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2). Filters were dissolved in scintillation fluid for radioassay. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of values from triplicate determinations. Purified recombinant ARD proteins were incubated for 30 min in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA with 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mg/ml cardiolipin before the addition of 20 μl of solution to yield final concentrations of 100 μm GTPγS and 10 mm MgCl2. Components needed to quantify ARF stimulation of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylagmatine formation were added as described previously (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to reach a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, samples (70 μl) were transferred to columns of AG1-X2 equilibrated with water and eluted with five 1-ml volumes of water. The eluate containing [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine was collected for radioassay. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of values from quadruplicate determinations. Although there was no significant difference between p8 (ARD1) and p3 (ARF domain of ARD1) in the amount of [β-35S]GDP bound at zero time (Fig. 1 B), [β-35S]GDP release (in the presence of large excess of [βS]GDP) was much slower from p8 than from p3 as seen earlier (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that the ARD1 amino-terminal extension p5 may act to inhibit nucleotide release. To define more precisely the region of p5 involved, we generated four mutants of ARD1 with amino-terminal deletions (Fig. 1 A). GDP[β-35S] dissociation from the four mutants (NΔ88p8, NΔ200p8, NΔ304p8, NΔ387p8) approximated that of the intact p8 (Fig. 1 B). The shortest deletion mutant protein NΔ387p8, which is equivalent to p3 with 15 amino acids from ARD1 added at the amino terminus, retained the dissociation behavior of ARD1. It was concluded that these 15 residues are apparently involved in stabilizing the inactive GDP form of the ARF domain of ARD1. When synthesized separately in Escherichia coli and incubated together, the non-ARF domain of ARD1 p5 reduced the rate of GDPβS release from the ARF domain p3 (Fig.2 B) to approximately that of ARD1 (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Physical interaction between p5 and p3, expressed separately in E. coli, had also been demonstrated by gel filtration and using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (18Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In agreement with the hypothesis that the 15 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of p5 act as an inhibitor of GDPβS dissociation from p3, three carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of p5 (Fig. 2 A) had no effect on GDP release from p3 (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, however, three amino-terminal deletion mutants of p5 (Fig.2 A) were also ineffective in reducing GDPβS dissociation from p3. In large excess (up to 10 times p3), NΔ88p5 or NΔ200p5 had no effect on GDPβS release from the ARF domain of ARD1 (data not shown). There are a number of possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy. A domain involved in interaction with p3 may be located in the amino terminus of p5. Incorrect folding of the deleted mutants may also be an explanation. We favor yet another explanation in which the functional interaction between p3 and the part of p5 that slows nucleotide dissociation requires very precise alignment of the two domains to allow the latter to stabilize the GDP form of p3. Consistent with this possibility is the finding that the deletion mutants p5NΔ88 and p5NΔ200 can physically interact with p3 and also that addition of NΔ200p5 and CΔ191p5 together with p3 did not reproduce the effect of p5 on GDPβS release from p3 (data not shown). Earlier reports suggested a role for the amino terminus of ARF in regulating nucleotide dissociation (24Hong J.-X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Fales H.M. Ferrige A.G. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 3056-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), based on analysis of nucleotide binding and release from amino-terminal deletion mutants of ARF1. We suggest that the carboxyl terminus of p5 corresponding to the amino terminus of ARF may also play this role in ARD1. In favor of this hypothesis are the facts that p5 increased GDPβS release from a chimeric ARF1 protein with an amino-terminal deletion (NΔ15ARF1(39–45p3)), which possesses the binding site for p5, but not from the chimeric protein with the amino terminus intact (ARF1(39–45p3)) (17Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3897-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the carboxyl end of p5 and the amino terminus of ARF may have analogous locations in the molecules and therefore perform analogous functions in regulating nucleotide dissociation. GDPβS release from NΔ393p8 was significantly faster than that from ARD1 or NΔ387p8 but also significantly slower than that from p3 (Fig.3). These results suggested that amino acids 1–6 of the 15 carboxyl-terminal residues of p5 participate in stabilizing the GDPβS-bound form of the ARF domain of ARD1 but also that residues 7–15 have a similar function. Accordingly, removal of 11 residues dramatically affected GDPβS release, because rates of dissociation from NΔ398p8 and p3 were similar (Fig. 3). GDPβS or GDP dissociated faster from p3 than from p8 or NΔ387p8 (Figs. 1 B, 3, and 4). However, GTPγS dissociated slightly faster from p8 or NΔ387p8 than from p3 (Fig. 4). In fact, dissociation curves from NΔ387p"

The accepted model of Kir topology predicts intracellular NH2 and COOH termini, and two membrane-spanning segments, M1 and M2, connected by an intramembranous pore-forming segment, H5. The sequence of H5 is similar in voltage-dependent K+ channels and features a strictly conserved GY/FG in its mid-region, which has been proposed as the selectivity filter of the pore. We have been usingN-glycosylation substitution mutants to map the extracellular topology of ROMK1 biochemically and have described several loci in H5 that were glycosylated. We now report glycosylation at loci Tyr144 and Phe146, which indicates that the signature GYG sequence (143–145) rather than being intramembranous is extracellular. The COOH terminus was predicted to begin at position 178, but contrary to the model, we observed that position 257 was glycosylated and surrounding positions at 199, 222, and 298 were unglycosylated. N-Glycosylation sequon substitution at the latter three positions abolished K+/Na+selectivity. Our results suggest a major revision of the topology of ROMK1 with H5 and the pore signature sequence now completely extracellular. The COOH terminus appears to form two additional membrane-spanning segments and to contribute to the ion conduction pathway.

The topological model of ROMK1 and related members of the Kir gene family was predicted from hydropathy plots and, in the case of H5, from sequence similarity to Kv channels 2The abbreviations used are: Kv channel(s), voltage-gated K+ channel(s); GSM(s),N-glycosylation substitution mutant(s); Sf9, Spodotera frugiderpa; TM, tunicamycin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (Fig.1 A). The NH2 and COOH termini were cytoplasmic, based on the absence of a signal sequence in the open reading frame, and the α-helical transmembrane segments M1 and M2 were separated by a linker containing a 17-residue stretch called H5 (9Hartmann H.A.

In Kv channels, H5 is thought to form an intramembranous hairpin structure with the selectivity filter at the highly conserved GYG, which is at loci 143–145 of ROMK1. Recently, we showed that several H5 loci of ROMK1 could be glycosylated and that one of them, Q139N, in both its glycosylated and unglycosylated forms was nonselective between K+ and Na+ (14Schwalbe R.A.

That H5 is a hotspot for residues that affect the pore is supported by the report that Leu117 and Val121 in ROMK2, corresponding to 136 and 140 in ROMK1, retained K+ selectivity but increased single channel conductance and Ba2+ sensitivity (15Zhou H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggested that H5 and its flanking regions E1 and E2 formed the first extracellular loop (EL1) of Kir's and that the second transmembrane segment (M2) was shifted toward the COOH terminus (Fig. 1 B). The possibility remained that the GYG signature pore sequence was intramembranous, and to test this, we engineeredN-glycosylation substitution mutants (GSMs), which are markers of extracellularity in and around this region. We also targeted the COOH terminus thought to become cytoplasmic at position 178 for this type of evaluation. Glycosylation was demonstrated by gel shift assays and reductions in ROMK1 currents before and after tunicamycin (TM) treatment. Our results show that the present topological model requires major revision. We found that position 144, supposedly forming the intramembranous selectivity filter of the pore, was glycosylated as was its immediate neighbor at locus 146. Thus the signature sequence rather than being intramembranous is extracellular. We found that position 257 was glycosylated, whereas surrounding loci at 199, 222, and 298 were not. However, N-glycosylation site substitution at 199, 222, and 298 rendered ROMK1 nonselective for K+over Na+. It appears that the COOH terminus contributes at least two additional transmembrane segments to Kir topology and may form part of the ion conduction pathway. TNM-FH insect medium was purchased from JRH Biosciences; Sf9 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection; the TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen; the BaculoGold™ transfection kit was from PharMingen; fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin and pluronic F-68 10% solution were from Life Technologies, Inc.; Zwittergent 3–10 was from Calbiochem; Tween 20, tunicamycin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aminobenzamidine, bovine serum albumin, and trypan blue solution were from Sigma; and Qiagen columns were from Qiagen. All ROMK1 mutants were engineered by polymerase chain reaction overlap extension (25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) using FLAG/N117Q cDNA as template (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pCRII for amplification and sequencing and subsequently subcloned into NotI/BamHI double-digested baculovirus transfer vector (pVL 1392). The M2 FLAG epitope was fused to the NH2 terminus of ROMK1 for immunoaffinity purification, Western blots, and immunocytochemistry. Sf9 cells were grown in Hink's TNM-FH insect medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% pluronic F-68 under natural atmosphere at 27 °C. Cells were maintained in monolayer cultures and passaged every 4–10 days. Production of recombinant protein was conducted in suspension cultures at a cell density of 1–1.2 × 106 cells/ml using viral supernatant from suspension culture amplifications. The recombinant baculoviruses were generated by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with baculovirus vectors containing the ROMK1 construct and BaculoGold™ viral DNA (modified AcNPV) according to the accompanying instructions (PharMingen). Viral seed stocks were prepared by amplification using monolayer cultures. High viral titers were generated by infecting suspension cultures (0.5–0.8 × 106 cells/ml) with viral seed stocks. The viral supernatant and/or the infected cells were collected 1–5 days after the infection. Tunicamycin (25 μg/ml) was added to cells 5–15 min after inoculation with viral supernatant. Standard procedures for routine subculturing, cotransfections, and infections were followed (27King L.A. Posse R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System.1st Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1992Crossref Google Scholar). Infected Sf9 cells (4 × 107 to 5 × 107) were harvested 19–28 h postinfection by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in cell lysis buffer (50 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, 0.3 m KCl, 2% Zwittergent 3–10), plus 125 μl of the M2 antibody affinity gel (Eastman Kodak Co.) resuspended in PBS, which recognizes the FLAG epitope attached to the NH2 terminus. The requirement of protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 200 μmaminobenzamidine) in the cell lysis buffer was optional, because degradation was not a problem. The sample was gently rocked overnight. Resin was washed with the solubilization buffer without the detergent (8 ml) and then with PBS. Beads were resuspended in 100–150 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer and heated at 90 °C for 4 min. Immunoaffinity samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with the M2 antibody (mouse monoclonal IgG, that recognizes the FLAG epitope attached to ROMK1 proteins; Eastman Kodak Co.) as described previously by Schwalbeet al. (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M.

The gels were run until carbonic anhydrase migrated off the gel, ensuring separation of the glycosylated proteins. Only the sections of the gels that contain ROMK1 proteins are shown. Suspension cultures infected for 20–28 h were plated in cell wells containing glass coverslips, allowed to attach for at least 15 min, and then washed with PBS. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde (3%) for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were permeabilized, and nonspecific binding was blocked using PBS, containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.03% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were incubated with the primary antibody M2 (1:100) overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with blocking buffer, minus Triton X-100, and incubated with the secondary antibody, rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS. The glass coverslips were mounted with Vectorex medium. Cells were examined with a Noran Instruments Odyssey XL confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Nikon inverted microscope using a 60 × objective lens. The antibodies were suspended in PBS, plus 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were added 20–24 h postinfection to Petri dishes containing glass coverslips, and currents were measured 23–42 h postinfection. Currents were measured at 23–25 °C using an Axoclamp 1B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) with membrane capacitance and resistance compensations. Fire-polished pipette electrodes had tip resistances of 2–5 and 5–10 MΩ for whole-cell and single channel measurements, respectively. Voltage pulse protocols and data acquisition and analysis were carried out using the pClamp suite of programs (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 1 kHz and subsequently digitized at 5 kHz. In our topological model of ROMK1, the H5 segment thought to be intramembranous was proposed as extracellular (Fig.1 B). To address experimentally the extracellularity of both the GYG signature sequence within H5 and the putative intracellular COOH terminus, we usedN-glycosylation tagging. All of the GSMs have the nativeN-glycosylation site removed (NRT, amino acid residues at positions 117–119) and only one introduced N-glycosylation sequon (26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the ROMK1 mutants for expression and characterization (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Proteins were immunoaffinity-purified and detected by Western blotting using the M2 FLAG epitope fused to the NH2 terminus (WT ROMK1, Y144N/F146S, V199N, I222N, N259T, and D298N) or both termini (F146N/F148S). The octapeptide attached to the NH2 terminus (26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or both termini did not interfere with WT ROMK1 function. Previously we have shown that ROMK1 of total Sf9 membranes migrates as a doublet: the upper immunoband (45 kDa) was glycosylated protein and the lower immunoband (43 kDa) was unglycosylated (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These two bands were observed for immunoaffinity samples of WT ROMK1, Y144N/F146S, F146N/F148S, and N259T (Fig. 2 A). The upper band of WT ROMK1, Y144N/F146S, F146N/F148S, and N259T was not detected whenN-glycosylation was inhibited with TM. For V199N, I222N, and D298N, only the lower TM-insensitive band was present (Fig.2 B). The degree of glycosylation was different for each mutant, as well as WT ROMK1 and other GSMs as reported in our previous studies (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), indicating differences in the accessibility of the introduced sites to the oligosaccharyltransferase. Some of the samples showed a slightly faster migrating band that was degradation product, which was also observed in some total membrane samples (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunobands of F146N/F148S migrated slightly slower due to the additional eight residues attached to the COOH terminus. The only prominent bands in uninfected cells or cells infected with a recombinant virus encoding the human ether-a-go-go gene (HERG), a Kv channel construct without the FLAG epitope, were the heavy and light chains of the mouse monoclonal antibody. Bands at positions of glycosylated and unglycosylated ROMK1 protein were not detected. Inward currents for F146N/F148S, V199N, I222N, N259T, and D298N were time-independent, and outward currents showed weak inward rectification (Fig.3). These currents are characteristic of ROMK1 channels expressed in Sf9 cells (26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Xenopusoocytes (1Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V.

Science. 1994; 264: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that inhibition of utilizedN-glycosylation sequons of ROMK1 at native or introduced sites using TM significantly reduced whole-cell currents (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results we found that TM produced a large reduction in the whole-cell currents for F146N/F148S and N259T, while the currents for V199N, I222N, and D298N were not affected. Whole-cell currents for Y144N/F146S were time-independent, like WT ROMK1, but were very small (3% of WT). After TM treatment the currents could not be distinguished from leak current. The effects of TM were invariant with respect to the presence and absence of glycosylation. However the magnitude of the currents expressed by the different GSMs was variable due to differences in viral titers and postinfection times. Therefore whole-cell currents were measured in the presence and absence of TM using the same viral supernatant at similar post-infection times. The reduction in whole-cell currents for WT ROMK1 produced by TM, as well as other glycosylated ROMK1 mutants, was due to a decrease in the opening probability, P o, of the unglycosylated counterpart (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). F146N/F148S and N259T channels have long open times and brief closures, and the closures were very few for the former, while the latter was similar to WT ROMK1 (Fig.4; Ref. 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycosylation of WT ROMK1 and GSMs with TM greatly increased the closing times (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The P o showed a large reduction in the presence of TM. The single channel current amplitudes and the slope conductances for glycosylated and unglycosylated F146N/F148S and N259T were similar to WT ROMK1 (26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For V199N, I222N, and D298N, theP o was low (TableI). The single channel current amplitudes were similar to WT ROMK1; however, openings of larger amplitude with considerable flickering were also observed.Table IROMK1 N-glycosylation mutants and their functionGlycosylationSurface expressionFunctionWhole-cell reduction ± TM (%)Single channelP oΔVI peak/I steady(+BaCl2)−TM+TMmVWT+1-aRef. 26.+1-aRef. 26.+1-aRef. 26.−751-aRef. 26.0.81-aRef. 26.0.251-aRef. 26.61.6 ± 2.33.1 ± 0.7(n = 8)b(n = 6)N117Q−1-aRef. 26.+1-aRef. 26.+1-aRef. 26.6.5 ± .430.22 ± 0.030.22 ± 0.0338.9 ± 2.92.2 ± 0.23(n = 5)1-bRef. 14.(n = 7)1-bRef. 14.(n = 7)1-bRef. 14.(n = 8)1-bRef. 14.(n = 5)Y144N/F146S+++ND1-cND, not determined.ND1-cND, not determined.ND1-cND, not determined.35.5 ± 4.31.26 ± 0.07(n = 3)(n = 3)F146N/F148S+++−89 ± 6.40.93 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.0351 ± 5.52.2 ± 0.3(n = 13)(n = 4)(n = 4)(n = 4)(n = 4)V199N−++9.1 ± 300.04 ± 0.01ND1-cND, not determined.0.5 ± 1.10.96 ± 0.04(n = 6)(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 5)I222N−++6.6 ± 240.03 ± 0.02ND1-cND, not determined.−0.5 ± 0.50.93 ± 0.04(n = 4)(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 5)N259T+++−72.8 ± 7.40.84 ± 0.030.05 ± .0248.3 ± 1.72.2 ± 0.52(n = 20)(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 4)(n = 5)D298N−++2 ± 280.05 ± 0.02ND1-cND, not determined.1.5 ± 0.811 ± 0.03(n = 11)(n = 3)(n = 13)(n = 4)The percent reduction in the whole cell currents was the difference in the currents of GSMs with and without TM, divided by currents of GSMs without TM treatment, at −120 mV.

Disruptions in the primary sequence of the putative pore-forming segment containing the selectivity filter sequence (GYG) may produce nonselective channels and alter the potency of channel blockers. WT ROMK1 currents are highly selective for K+ over Na+ (1Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 16Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Caporaso R. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 264: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). When K+ was replaced with Na+, the currents were significantly reduced, and the current reversal potentials were much more negative for F146N/F148S (Fig. 5 A; Table I), N259T, and Y144N/F146S. For I222N (Fig. 5), V199N and D298N ΔV values were −0.5 ± 0.5 mV, n = 4; 0.5 ± 1.1 mV,n = 6; and 1.5 ± 0.81 mV, n = 13, respectively. These negligible shifts in the current reversal potentials indicated a lack of selectivity between K+ and Na+ (Table I). WT ROMK1 currents were blocked by Ba2+ at millimolar concentration in a time- and voltage-dependent manner (1Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar,16Taglialatela M. Wible B.A. Caporaso R. Brown A.M. Science. 1994; 264: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The time dependence was pronounced for hyperpolarizing pulses and at −120 mV was retained for F146N/F148S (Fig. 5 B;I peak/I steady = 2.2 ± 0.3, n = 4), Y144N/F146S (I peak/I steady = 1.26 ± 0.07, n = 3), and N259T (I peak/I steady = 2.2 ± 0.52, n = 5). The peak and steady-state currents for I222N (Fig. 5;I peak/I steady = 0.93 ± 0.04, n = 5), V199N (I peak/I steady = 0.96 ± 0.04, n = 6), and D298N (I peak/I steady = 1 ± 0.03, n = 4) were similar, indicating that the Ba2+ block was no longer time-dependent (TableI). In addition, the outward currents for V199N, I222N, and D298N were blocked (Fig. 5 B). The small currents for Y144N/F146S suggested that either lower amounts were expressed at the cell surface or fewer channels were in the open state at the cell surface. To distinguish between these possibilities, ROMK1 mutant proteins were localized in Sf9 cells using the M2 monoclonal antibody and fluorescence immunocytochemistry in combination with laser confocal microscopy. The immunofluorescence staining patterns for the mutants were similar, and the protein appeared to be at the cell surface in the majority of the cells. The thin outer immunofluorescence ring for both Y144N/F146S and F146N/F148S indicated that the channel proteins were at the cell surface as we described for WT ROMK1 (Fig.6).2 Immunofluorescence was also observed as a thicker inner ring around the nucleus and patches in between the rings. The immunofluorescence around the nucleus was attributed to protein in the ER and the patches to protein either in the membranes of ER or other cellular organelles. A similar staining pattern was observed in the majority of the TM-treated cells expressing F146N/F148S. On the contrary the immunofluorescence staining was concentrated around the nucleus for the majority of the TM-treated cells expressing Y144N/F146S, and only a few of the cells had the outer immunofluorescence ring. The background signal was negligible in uninfected cells and cells infected with HERG. N-Linked oligosaccharides were detected for GSMs at positions 144, 146, and 257 (Fig. 7). Further evidence of glycosylation was provided by the gel shifts produced by TM. The different amounts of glycosylated monomer for WT ROMK1, Y144N/F146S, F146N/F148S, and N259T, and also GSMs from our previous study (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), reveal differences in the accessibility of the native and novel sites to the oligosaccharyltransferase. Since utilization of an N-glycosylation site depends on the placement of a site in the exoplasmic loop, the distance from the NH2 terminus, and the conformation of a tripeptide sequon (28Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar, 29Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol.

J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the degree of glycosylation may differ. Glycosylation was also consistent with the large reductions in whole-cell currents caused by TM, which correlated with large reductions inP o rather than decreases in channel number as noted previously (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

In addition, no apparent difference in channel density at the cell surface of F146N/F148S in the presence and absence of TM was observed by immunocytochemistry measurements. The present results with TM along with our previous studies (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

In addition, immunocytochemistry of Y144N/F146S and F146N/F148S showed that channels were transported to the plasma membrane. Taken together, we conclude that positions 144, 146, and 257 were glycosylated and assembled as functional channels. We also note that N-linked oligosaccharides positioned anywhere along the ROMK1 sequence stabilized the open state of the channel, consistent with our previous studies (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15336-15340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Positions 199, 222, and 298 were not N-glycosylated, as only the lower TM-insensitive band was observed. The whole-cell currents were not affected by TM, and the P o was low as previously reported for unglycosylated ROMK1 channels (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. J. Biol.

Thus the functional phenotype of the unglycosylated channels was distinct from the glycosylated channels. A possible mechanism of the two distinct phenotypes may be that N-linked carbohydrate is needed to direct correct disulfide bond/s formation and consequently stabilize the open state of the glycosylated channels. The significance ofN-glycosylation in directing disulfide bond formation has been demonstrated for other proteins (31Vidal S. Mottet G. Kolakofsky D. Roux D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 892-900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In any case, our results do indicate that N-linked carbohydrate at residues in E1, H5, E2, and the putative intracellular COOH terminus can stabilize the open state of the channel and therefore suggest that they are in a similar environment. K+ selectivity was retained when residues 144, 146, 148, and 259 were mutated to nonconserved residues and when oligosaccharides were attached to Asn at positions 144, 146, and 257, whereas substitutions at positions 199, 222, and 298 with Asn caused virtually a complete loss of K+ selectivity. These results indicate that neither the side chains at positions 144, 146, 148, and 259 nor the bulk of the carbohydrate at positions 144, 146, and 257 drastically altered the formation of the selectivity filter (GYG; 143–145), while residues 199, 222, and 298 in the putative intracellular COOH terminus influenced selectivity either directly or indirectly by destabilizing the pore structure. WT ROMK currents were blocked by Ba2+, as were currents from all of the GSMs. The time dependence of the block at hyperpolarized pulses was retained when residues in H5, positions 144, 146, and 148, or in the cytoplasmic tail at position 259 were mutated. However, three mutations in the intracellular COOH terminus at positions 199, 222, and 298 produced a time-independent block. This result is consistent with a more accessible binding site or a higher affinity of Ba2+ for the V199N, I222N, and D298N channels. Thus, mutations in the COOH terminus segment of ROMK1 appeared to alter the structure or entrance of the pore. Our results show that the GYG signature pore sequence and part of the putative intracellular COOH terminus are extracellular, suggesting two additional transmembrane segments (Fig. 7). The present results, together with our previous demonstration that positions 117, 128, 133, 139, and 153 could be glycosylated (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), places the signature GYG sequence and the linker between M1 and M2 (EL1) as extracellular (Fig. 7). In contrast to earlier models (Fig. 1), we also provide evidence of glycosylation at position 257, indicating that part of the putative cytoplasmic COOH terminus is extracellular. Furthermore the lack of utilized sites at positions 199, 222, 274, 298, 377, and 384 (14Schwalbe R.A. Wang Z. Bianchi L. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24201-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the presence of protein kinase A phosphorylation sites at positions 219 and 313 (34Xu Z.-C. Yang Y. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) would indicate that there are at least two transmembrane segments in the putative cytoplasmic COOH terminus. Based on these findings and glycosylation studies, which have indicated that a utilizedN-glycosylation sequon is a minimum of 11 residues from the nearest transmembrane segment and in an exofacial loop of at least 30 residues (29Nilsson I. von Heijne G.

Our study has also shown that mutating residues Val199, Ile222, and Asp298 with Asn produced nonselective channels and a time-independent barium block. In our newly revised model these residues are localized in or near the membrane where they may contribute to the selectivity filter. Thus, residue Asp298 may be located near M4. Ile222 may be near the membrane or may be part of M3. In our model Val199is part of IL1, because Ser219 was shown to be phosphorylated. However, this segment may either interact with the membrane or may loop into the cytoplasmic entrance of the pore. Clearly, future studies are needed to determine the exact placement of these residues with respect to the plasma membrane and to determine whether these residues are directly involved in forming the selectivity filter and barium binding site/s or whether they are indirectly involved in stabilizing the pore structure."

Although the exact mechanism by which c-Fos is acting is mostly unknown, these observations clearly indicate that c-Fos expression is required for commitment to the osteoclast lineage. Considering the inducibility of c-Fos expression in various cell types, however, it seems likely that the determination of osteoclast differentiation involves other lineage-specific factors or signals that may function together with or independently of c-Fos.Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) 1The abbreviations used are: HTLV-I, human T cell leukemia virus type I; LTR, long terminal repeat; DR, direct repeat; OCL, osteoclast-like cell; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; VNR, vitronectin receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CRE, cyclic AMP-responsive element; TRE, TPA-responsive element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; ATF, activating transcription factor; AP-1, activator protein-1; bp, base pair(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; bZIP, basic leucine-zipper.1The abbreviations used are: HTLV-I, human T cell leukemia virus type I; LTR, long terminal repeat; DR, direct repeat; OCL, osteoclast-like cell; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; VNR, vitronectin receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CRE, cyclic AMP-responsive element; TRE, TPA-responsive element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; ATF, activating transcription factor; AP-1, activator protein-1; bp, base pair(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; bZIP, basic leucine-zipper. is a retrovirus etiologically linked to adult T cell leukemia and a neurodegenerative disease called tropical spastic paraparesis (7Uchiyama T.

One of the viral products that is crucial to its pathogenicity is Tax, a 40-kDa protein that transactivates its own viral expression from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (9Sodroski J.

Hinrichs S.H. Reynolds R.K. Khoury G. Jay G. Science. 1987; 237: 1324-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 22Hinrichs S.H. Nerenberg M. Reynolds R.K. Khoury G. Jay G.

Li C.-B. Horne W.C. Santiago P. Troiano N. Jay G. Horowitz M. Baron R. Virology. 1993; 197: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). High level of expression of the transgene was observed only in the affected tissues: tumors, bone, and salivary glands. Interestingly, in bone, tax expression is restricted to only two cell types, osteoclasts and spindle-shaped cells within the endosteal myelofibrosis (24Ruddle N.H. Li C.-B. Horne W.C. Santiago P. Troiano N. Jay G. Horowitz M. Baron R. Virology. 1993; 197: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since, in the same animals, bone marrow and tissue macrophages fail to express tax whether in vivo or in vitro, the relatively specific activation of the HTLV-I-LTR promoter in osteoclasts may be related to a transcription factor that would be expressed in this cell type and promote expression of the transgene.To test this hypothesis, we have examined differentiation-dependent expression of tax in the osteoclast lineage in cultures of total bone marrow cells from thetax-transgenic mice. Expression of tax was induced by 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) and occurred mostly in vitronectin receptor (VNR)-positive mononuclear precursors of the osteoclast. Consistent with our hypothesis, a unique nuclear factor was observed in osteoclasts which binds to the 21-bp direct repeat (DR) in the LTR even in the absence of Tax. The factor, designated as NFOC-1 (nuclear factorosteoclast-1), was different from DR-binding factors expressed in the spindle-shaped myelofibrotic cells and was not present in macrophages. Furthermore, NFOC-1 was also present in human and rabbit osteoclasts, suggesting that this nuclear DNA-binding factor may normally be associated with lineage determination in several species.RESULTSTo verify in vitro that the activation of the HTLV-I-LTR is indeed an event associated with the differentiation of cells within the osteoclast lineage, as observed in vivo(24Ruddle N.H. Li C.-B. Horne W.C. Santiago P. Troiano N. Jay G. Horowitz M. Baron R. Virology. 1993; 197: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), bone marrow cells from the tax-transgenic mice that do not express Tax in vivo were cultured in the presence or absence of calcitriol for 7 days, and the expression of both Tax protein and mRNA was monitored. As shown in Fig.1, tax was expressed at a very low level under basal conditions and was markedly induced by calcitriol at the mRNA and protein levels. The fact that the mRNA expression was increased by more than 3-fold indicated that the induction occurred, at least in part, at the message level in these marrow cultures (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, we foundtax expression in mature OCLs purified from vitamin D-treated co-cultures, whereas tax mRNA was barely detectable in the same EDTA-resistant fraction from non-treated co-cultures which for the most part represents a macrophage-enriched population (Fig. 1 B). These results were therefore consistent with our in vivo observation that the expression of tax is associated with osteoclast differentiation (24Ruddle N.H. Li C.-B. Horne W.C. Santiago P. Troiano N. Jay G. Horowitz M. Baron R. Virology. 1993; 197: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This was further confirmed by comparing the time course of Tax expression relative to the appearance of TRAP-positive cells in marrow cultures; as shown in Fig. 2, Tax induction occurred in parallel with the appearance of TRAP-positive cells in the cultures.Figure 2Time-dependent expression of Tax protein in cells of the osteoclast lineage in bone marrow cultures. In the time course experiments (A–D), bone marrow cells from the transgenic animals were cultured on 24-well dishes in the presence of 10 nm calcitriol for 3–7 days. On each indicated day, cells from a single dish were analyzed for Tax or TRAP as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, 10 μg of total cell lysates were analyzed for Tax by Western blots.B, the intensity of the bands were quantitated and expressed as arbitrary units. C and D, cells were stained for TRAP, and the number of the mononuclear (C) and multinuclear osteoclast-like (D) cells positive for TRAP in each well were counted. The data is expressed as mean ± S.E. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. In the cell sorting experiments (E), transgenic marrow cultures on day 6 were lifted from culture dish and vitronectin receptor (VNR)-positive and -negative cells were separated by magnetic beads as described under “Materials and Methods.” 6 μg of total cell lysates from each population was analyzed by Western blot for the expression of integrin β3, Tax, and actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether Tax is expressed in mononuclear osteoclast precursors in these heterogeneous cultures, we selectively enriched for these cells based on their expression of the vitronectin receptor (VNR) (36Chuntharapai A. Bodary S. Horton M.A. Kim K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). VNR-positive cells were isolated by magnetic bead cell sorting from marrow cultures on day 6, a time point at which few mature multinucleated OCLs had been formed (see Fig. 2 D). When lysates from VNR-positive and -negative cells were analyzed by Western blot, we observed that Tax expression was almost entirely restricted to the cells that were positively sorted with the VNR antibody and which, as expected, expressed high levels of the β3 integrin subunit (Fig.2 E). These results indicated not only that Tax is expressed in VNR-positive mononuclear cells, i.e. immediate precursors of the osteoclast, but also that there are few VNR-negative cells that express Tax in the cultured bone marrow. In other words, the expression of Tax is restricted to cells of the osteoclast lineage in these cultures. Thus, the HTLV-I-LTR becomes activated within mononuclear, TRAP-positive, and VNR-positive precursor cells of the osteoclast lineage.Although the expression of Tax may itself transactivate the promoter, the initial activation of the LTR promoter has to occur independently of Tax expression. Previous studies from several groups have demonstrated that three 21-bp direct repeats (DR) present in the LTR promoter region are essential and sufficient for the Tax-dependent HTLV-I transcription from the LTR (33Fujisawa J. Toita M. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3234-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Giam C.-Z. Xu Y.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15236-15241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that a lineage-specific transcription factor in osteoclasts could be responsible for the differentiation-dependent expression of the taxgene, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) utilizing the LTR-DR sequences as a probe. As shown in Fig.3, nuclear extracts from purified wild-type OCLs produced a single prominent protein-DNA complex, designated as NFOC-1 (nuclear factorosteoclast-1). The binding of this complex was specific as it was competed by an excess amount of a cold probe.Figure 3Osteoclast-specific DR-binding nuclear factors. 14 μg of nuclear extracts from wild-type OCLs (lanes 1 and 2), 6 μg of extracts from TXB-1 (lane 3), 10 μg of extracts from macrophage cell lines, P388D1 (lane 4) and IC21 (lane 5), and primary osteoblasts (lane 6) were incubated with a32P-labeled probe corresponding to the second direct repeat and resolved in a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” The position of the dominant complex in OCL (NFOC-1) is indicated by an arrow (lane 1). No extracts were added to the lane F (free). A 70-fold molar excess of cold DNA competitor was added in lane 2 to show the binding specificity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tax expression being restricted to a limited number of cell types, which includes osteoclasts and myelofibrotic spindle-shaped cells in transgenic animals and in vitro, we then determined 1) whether the expression of this nuclear factor was similarly restricted and 2) whether the same factor was responsible for the activation of the LTR in the spindle-shaped cells. As shown in Fig. 3, NFOC-1 was not detected in nuclear extracts from primary osteoblasts or two macrophage cell lines, P388D1 and IC21, compatible with the absence oftax expression in osteoblasts and macrophages in vivo (24Ruddle N.H. Li C.-B. Horne W.C. Santiago P. Troiano N. Jay G. Horowitz M. Baron R. Virology. 1993; 197: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, NFOC-1 mobility was different from that of the DR-binding factor(s) found in the myelofibrotic spindle-shaped cell line, TXB-1 (Fig. 3), the major complex in TXB-1 being recognized by an antibody that is reactive to both CREB and ATF-1 (Fig.4). A similar DNA-protein complex supershifted by the anti-CREB/ATF-1 antibody was also present in nuclear extracts of tumor cells from the transgenic mice (data not shown). These findings are consistent with previous reports on DR-binding factors in other cells including T cells (12Yoshimura T. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Zhao L. Giam C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, none of the antibodies against the members of the CREB/ATF family (38de Groot R.P. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), including CREB, CREB-2, CRE modulator-1, ATF-1, ATF-2, ATF-3, and ATF-4, recognized NFOC-1 (data not shown). These results indicate that the transgene expression from the LTR promoter in a few restricted cell types in the tax transgenic mice correlates with the presence of two different sets of transcription factors as follows: CREB and/or ATF-1, which has been shown to be capable of mediating transactivation by Tax, is found in tumors and the spindle-shaped cells in bone myelofibrosis; and NFOC-1 is restricted to cells of the osteoclast lineage at least among bone cells and may consist of an as yet unidentified member of the CREB/ATF family and/or a novel factor.Figure 4The presence of CREB or ATF-1 in the DR-binding complex in TXB-1. 6 μg of nuclear extracts of TXB-1 was analyzed by EMSA as described under “Materials and Methods.”F, free probe. A hundred-fold molar excess of specific (lane 2) and mutated (lane 3) oligonucleotide competitors was added to show the specificity. In lane 4, the major complex (arrowhead) was supershifted (arrow) by an antibody recognizing both CREB and ATF-1. Inlane 5, an anti-IgG secondary antibody was added together with anti-CREB/ATF-1. The super-supershift is indicated by adouble arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize further the DNA-binding properties of NFOC-1, we examined the effects of various competitors including DR mutants, CRE (34Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), and TRE (35Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar) in EMSA. DR sequences can be divided into three distinct domains named A, B, and C (33Fujisawa J. Toita M. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3234-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, substitutions in the domain A (MBC) or C (ABM) did not affect the competition, whereas mutations in the B domain (AMC) almost completely abolished the ability to compete NFOC-1 binding, indicating that the B domain in the DR which contains CRE-like sequences is critical for NFOC-1 binding. This is consistent with the fact that an authentic CRE was also a potent competitor (Fig. 5). Thus, although antibodies against known members of the CREB/ATF family did not induce a supershift, NFOC-1 has binding properties that resemble members of the CREB/ATF family.Figure 5Competition analysis for NFOC-1. A 60-fold molar excess of various competitors indicated below were added to the standard EMSA reactions containing 16 μg of wild-type mouse OCL nuclear extracts, and DNA-protein complexes were analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Competitors used are as follows: lane 1, no competitors; lane 2, ABC (DR with no mutations); lane 3, MBC; lane 4, AMC;lane 5, ABM; lane 6, CRE; lane 7, TRE. The position of NFOC-1 is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, a somewhat weaker competition was also observed with TRE that contains an authentic AP-1 binding site from the human collagenase gene (Fig. 5). Since c-Fos has been shown to be important for osteoclast differentiation (6Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), we then examined the possibility that NFOC-1 contains members of the Fos and Jun families, i.e.proteins which together form the AP-1 transcription factor complex (39Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 A, a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all the members of the Jun family consistently, albeit moderately, diminished the intensity of the NFOC-1 band, and a clear supershifted complex was observed after longer exposure (Fig. 6 B). When each Jun family member was tested, antibodies against JunD were the only ones that produced an appreciable supershift. In contrast, antibodies against each member of the Fos family had no effects, although an antibody recognizing all the members of the Fos family showed some cross-reactivity. Further analysis showed that this particular antibody cross-reacts with other members of the basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family (data not shown). It is therefore possible that the Fos antibody recognizes a component of NFOC-1 which, although different from the Fos family members, retained the bZIP motif. The ability of the antibodies against c-Fos and JunD to bind to their respective antigens under our experimental conditions was verified in EMSA using the AP-1 probe and Cos-7 cells transfected with mouse c-Fos or JunD expression vectors (data not shown). We also confirmed that the antibodies against all Jun and JunD are not cross-reactive to the DR binding factor found in the spindle-shaped cell line, TXB-1, i.e. CREB and/or ATF-1 (data not shown). These results suggest that c-Fos itself is not present in NFOC-1 but that NFOC-1 may contain JunD or a closely related factor.Figure 6NFOC-1 is immunologically related to JunD. EMSA reactions containing 14 μg of nuclear extracts from wild-type OCLs were incubated with various antibodies indicated for supershift assays as described under “Materials and Methods.”A, short exposure. Intensity of the NFOC-1 band (arrow) was diminished by an antibody recognizing all the known members of the Jun family (All Jun) or Fos family (All Fos). B, long exposure. Clear supershifted complexes were observed with antibodies against all Jun or all Fos (arrowhead) and an antibody specific to Jun-D(double arrow). Similar results were reproduced at least three times using two different batches of antibodies from the same commercial source (Santa Cruz).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the potential importance of this lineage-specific transcription factor, we then determined whether it was present in other species and in authentic osteoclasts. As shown in Fig.7, protein-DNA complexes with the same mobility as mouse NFOC-1 were also detected in assays using nuclear extracts from both human OCLs purified from osteoclastoma and purified authentic rabbit osteoclasts. These results suggest that NFOC-1 is conserved among species and is expressed not only in osteoclast-like cells generated in vitro but also in authentic osteoclasts freshly isolated from bone. Since NFOC-1 appeared to be expressed at the highest levels in human osteoclastoma, we took advantage of this fact and used this abundant source of NFOC-1 for further characterization by cross-linking. For this purpose, DR binding factors present in human osteoclastoma nuclear extracts were UV cross-linked to the BrdUrd-substituted probe and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 8, two major bands were detected; only the lower band was competed by a cold probe and thereby considered specific. These results suggest that human NFOC-1 contains a specific DR binding factor with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa. Since the whole extract was cross-linked in this experiment, however, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the 70-kDa protein is derived from another specific complex.Figure 7Inter-species conservation of NFOC-1 and its enhanced binding by Tax. Nuclear extracts from human OCLs purified from osteoclastoma (A) and rabbit authentic osteoclasts (B) were analyzed for DR-binding factors by EMSA. The position of NFOC-1 is indicated by an arrow. Lane F indicates free probe without extracts. A, in theleft panel, 6 μg of human OCL extracts (lane 1) were shown next to 16 μg of mouse OCL extracts (lane 2) in the same gel for comparison. In the right panel, human OCL extracts were analyzed with a hundred-fold excess of cold competitor DNA (lane 2), 600 ng of GST alone (lane 3), or GST-Tax fusion proteins (lane 4). B, 6 μg of rabbit osteoclast nuclear extracts were analyzed alone (lane 2) or in the presence of 600 ng of GST-Tax fusion proteins (lane 3) or GST alone (lane 4). 12 μg of mouse OCL nuclear extracts are shown in lane 1 for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8UV cross-link analysis of human NFOC-1.10 μg of nuclear extracts of human OCLs from osteoclastoma were cross-linked to a BrdUrd-substituted DR probe and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” No extracts were added in lane 1. Unlabeled DR probe was added in 100-fold excess in lane 3. The arrowindicates the position of a specific DR binding protein with an approximately 70-kDa molecular mass.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although our results clearly show that NFOC-1 can bind to the LTR in the absence of Tax expression, Tax has been shown to enhance DNA binding activities of various transcription factors, especially members of the bZIP protein family (15Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, NFOC-1 may also be involved in subsequent LTR transactivation by Tax. We consequently examined the effects of Tax on the NFOC-1 binding activity using bacterially expressed fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 7, GST-Tax fusion proteins, but not GST alone, enhanced the NFOC-1 binding in human OCLs (Fig.7 A) and in authentic rabbit osteoclasts (Fig.7 B). Densitometric analysis revealed that GST-Tax increased the binding of human NFOC-1 by 6-fold compared with the GST control. These results indicate that the binding of NFOC-1 is enhanced by Tax and further suggest that NFOC-1 plays a role not only in initial activation but also in subsequent Tax-dependent transactivation of the LTR promoter in osteoclasts.DISCUSSIONWe have previously reported that the viral oncogene,tax, when under the control of its natural promoter, HTLV-I-LTR, shows a restricted pattern of cellular expression in transgenic animals which includes cells of the osteoclast lineage (24Ruddle N.H.
