https://openalex.org/W1969969444,"'Brain training', or the goal of improved cognitive function through the regular use of computerized tests, is a multimillion-pound industry, yet in our view scientific evidence to support its efficacy is lacking. Modest effects have been reported in some studies of older individuals and preschool children, and video-game players outperform non-players on some tests of visual attention. However, the widely held belief that commercially available computerized brain-training programs improve general cognitive function in the wider population in our opinion lacks empirical support. The central question is not whether performance on cognitive tests can be improved by training, but rather, whether those benefits transfer to other untrained tasks or lead to any general improvement in the level of cognitive functioning. Here we report the results of a six-week online study in which 11,430 participants trained several times each week on cognitive tasks designed to improve reasoning, memory, planning, visuospatial skills and attention. Although improvements were observed in every one of the cognitive tasks that were trained, no evidence was found for transfer effects to untrained tasks, even when those tasks were cognitively closely related."

The development of a recombinant in vitro transcription system has allowed for a detailed molecular characterization of the individual components and their contribution to transcription initiation. We found that TFAM and TFB2M act synergistically and increase transcription efficiency 100–200-fold as compared with RNA polymerase alone. Both the light-strand promoter (LSP) and the HSP1 promoters displayed maximal levels of in vitro transcription when TFAM was present in an amount equimolar to the DNA template. Importantly, we did not detect any significant transcription activity in the presence of the TFB2M paralog, TFB1M, or when templates containing the putative HSP2 promoter were used. These data confirm previous observations that TFB1M does not function as a bona fide transcription factor and raise questions as to whether HSP2 serves as a functional promoter in vivo. In addition, we did not detect transcription stimulation by the ribosomal protein MRPL12. Thus, only two essential initiation factors, TFAM and TFB2M, and two promoters, LSP and HSP1, are required to drive transcription of the mitochondrial genome.

https://openalex.org/W2059819216,"MicroRNAs are involved in cancer pathogenesis and act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. It has been recently reported that miR-148a expression is down-regulated in several types of cancer. The functional roles and target genes of miR-148a in prostate cancer, however, remain unknown. In this report, we showed that miR-148a expression levels were lower in PC3 and DU145 hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells in comparison to PrEC normal human prostate epithelial cells and LNCaP hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Transfection with miR-148a precursor inhibited cell growth, and cell migration and invasion, and increased the sensitivity to anti-cancer drug paclitaxel in PC3 cells. Computer-aided algorithms predicted mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase, MSK1, as a potential target of miR-148a. Indeed, miR-148a overexpression decreased expression of MSK1. Using luciferase reporter assays, we identified MSK1 as a direct target of miR-148a. Suppression of MSK1 expression by siRNA, however, showed little or no effects on malignant phenotypes of PC3 cells. In PC3PR cells, a paclitaxel-resistant cell line established from PC3 cells, miR-148a inhibited cell growth, and cell migration and invasion, and also attenuated the resistance to paclitaxel. MiR-148a reduced MSK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-UTR in PC3PR cells. Furthermore, MSK1 knockdown reduced paclitaxel-resistance of PC3PR cells, indicating that miR-148a attenuates paclitaxel-resistance of hormone-refractory, drug-resistant PC3PR cells in part by regulating MSK1 expression. Our findings suggest that miR-148a plays multiple roles as a tumor suppressor and can be a promising therapeutic target for hormone-refractory prostate cancer especially for drug-resistant prostate cancer."

Here, we evolved Escherichia coli MG1655 cells to grow at extreme temperatures. We obtained a maximum growth temperature of 48.5 °C, which was not increased further upon continuous cultivation at this temperature for >600 generations. Despite a permanently induced heat shock response in thermoresistant cells, only exquisitely high GroEL/GroES levels are essential for growth at 48.5 °C. They depend on the presence of lysyl-tRNA-synthetase, LysU, because deletion of lysU rendered thermoresistant cells thermosensitive. Our data suggest that GroEL/GroES are especially required for the folding of mutated proteins generated during evolution. GroEL/GroES therefore appear as mediators of evolution of extremely heat-resistant E. coli cells. Evolution depends on the acquisition of genomic mutations that increase cellular fitness.

https://openalex.org/W1965745529,"Envenoming following scorpion sting is a common emergency in many parts of the world. Our aim was to ameliorate the current 100-kDa horse plasma antivenom serum (PAS)-derived Fab′2 to more quickly reach the highly diffusible scorpion toxins (7 kDa). We immunized dromedaries with toxins from Androctonus australis hector (Aah) scorpions and cloned the single-domain antibody fragments or nanobodies (15 kDa) from their B cells. Nanobodies against AahI′ toxin (with AahII the most toxic compound of the venom) were retrieved from the libraries, and their AahI′ -toxin neutralization was monitored in mice. Remarkably, the NbAahI′ F12 fully protected mice against 100 LD50 of AahI′ administered intracerebroventricularly. Moreover, where PAS failed completely to neutralize 2 LD50 of crude venom injected subcutaneously, the designed bispecific NbF12-10 against AahI′/AahII toxins succeeded in neutralizing 5 LD50. Finally, in a challenge assay in which mice were subcutaneously injected with a lethal dose of scorpion venom, the subsequent intravenous injection of 85 μg of NbF12-10 protected all mice, even if the whole procedure was repeated 3 times. Furthermore, the NbF12-10 remained fully protective when mice with severe signs of envenoming were treated a few minutes before the untreated mice died.—Hmila, I., Saerens, D., Ben Abderrazek, R., Vincke, C., Abidi, N., Benlasfar, Z., Govaert, J., El Ayeb, M., Bouhaouala-Zahar, B., Muyldermans, S.

https://openalex.org/W2025984031,"RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and TRIM25 (tripartite motif protein 25) have emerged as key regulatory factors to induce interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune responses to limit viral replication. Upon recognition of viral RNA, TRIM25 E3 ligase binds the first caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I and subsequently induces lysine 172 ubiquitination of the second CARD of RIG-I, which is essential for the interaction with downstream MAVS/IPS-1/CARDIF/VISA and, thereby, IFN-beta mRNA production. Although ubiquitination has emerged as a major factor involved in RIG-I activation, the potential contribution of other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, to the regulation of RIG-I activity has not been addressed. Here, we report the identification of serine 8 phosphorylation at the first CARD of RIG-I as a negative regulatory mechanism of RIG-I-mediated IFN-beta production. Immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific antibody showed that RIG-I serine 8 phosphorylation steady-state levels were decreased upon stimulation of cells with IFN-beta or virus infection. Substitution of serine 8 in the CARD RIG-I functional domain with phosphomimetic aspartate or glutamate results in decreased TRIM25 binding, RIG-I ubiquitination, MAVS binding, and downstream signaling. Finally, sequence comparison reveals that only primate species carry serine 8, whereas other animal species carry an asparagine, indicating that serine 8 phosphorylation may represent a primate-specific regulation of RIG-I activation. Collectively, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of RIG-I serine 8 operates as a negative switch of RIG-I activation by suppressing TRIM25 interaction, further underscoring the importance of RIG-I and TRIM25 connection in type I IFN signal transduction."

Mice fed alcohol develop fatty liver through endocannabinoid activation of hepatic CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), which increases lipogenesis and decreases fatty acid oxidation. Chronic alcohol feeding also up-regulates CB1R in hepatocytes in vivo, which could be replicated in vitro by co-culturing control hepatocytes with hepatic stellate cells (HSC) isolated from ethanol-fed mice, implicating HSC-derived mediator(s) in the regulation of hepatic CB1R (Jeong, W.

HSC being a rich source of retinoic acid (RA), we tested whether RA and its receptors may regulate CB1R expression in cultured mouse hepatocytes. Incubation of hepatocytes with RA or RA receptor (RAR) agonists increased CB1R mRNA and protein, the most efficacious being the RARγ agonist CD437 and the pan-RAR agonist TTNPB. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) also increased hepatic CB1R expression, which was mediated indirectly via RA, because it was absent in hepatocytes from mice lacking retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1, the enzyme catalyzing the generation of RA from retinaldehyde. The binding of RARγ to the CB1R gene 5′ upstream domain in hepatocytes treated with RAR agonists or 2-AG was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody supershift assays. Finally, TTNPB-induced CB1R expression was attenuated by small interfering RNA knockdown of RARγ in hepatocytes. We conclude that RARγ regulates CB1R expression and is thus involved in the control of hepatic fat metabolism by endocannabinoids.

DePetrillo M. Pacher P. Liu J. Radaeva S. Bátkai S. Harvey-White J. Mackie K. Offertáler L. Wang L. Kunos G. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Through these effects, endocannabinoids play a key role in the development of fatty liver in response to high fat diets (4Osei-Hyiaman D. Liu J. Zhou L. Godlewski G. Harvey-White J. Jeong W.I.

In mice fed a liquid alcohol diet, the development of fatty liver was found to involve paracrine activation of hepatic CB1R by hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-derived endocannabinoids. Chronic alcohol feeding also resulted in up-regulation of CB1R in hepatocytes in vivo, which could be replicated in vitro by co-culturing control mouse hepatocytes with HSC isolated from ethanol-fed mice (1Jeong W.I. Osei-Hyiaman D. Park O. Liu J. Bátkai S. Mukhopadhyay P. Horiguchi N. Harvey-White J. Marsicano G. Lutz B. Gao B. Kunos G.

HSC being the richest source of retinoic acid (RA) in the body, we examined the possible role of RA and its receptors in the regulation of CB1R expression in mouse hepatocytes.

RA is generated in vivo by sequential oxidation of retinol (vitamin A), first through the action of alcohol dehydrogenase to yield retinaldehyde and then by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Raldh) to yield RA (5Ziouzenkova O.

RA and its homologs are potent regulators of gene expression and play vital roles in a wide variety of biological functions, including cellular differentiation and proliferation, embryonic development, tissue repair, and immune functions (7Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15399-15402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8de Lera A.R. Bourguet W. Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The cellular effects of RA are mediated by RA receptors (RARs), which are ligand-activated transcription factors. Receptors for RA consist of heterodimers of RAR and retinoid X receptors (RXR). The RAR and RXR each have at least three distinct isoforms encoded by separate genes: RAR-α, -β, and -γ and RXR-α, -β, and -γ, respectively (9Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the appropriate response elements of RA target genes to exert a broad range of biological effects. RXR, whose cognate ligand is 9-cis-RA, also forms heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor α or γ, thyroid hormone receptors, farnesoid X receptor, and liver X receptors (10Desreumaux P. Dubuquoy L. Nutten S. Peuchmaur M. Englaro W. Schoonjans K. Derijard B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Chambon P. Leibowitz M.D. Colombel J.F. Auwerx J. J. Exp.

Particularly relevant to the present study is a recent observation that RA-dependent neuronal differentiation of mouse P19 pluripotent embryonic cancer cells was associated with a strong induction of CB1R but not CB2R. This effect may have been secondary to the process of neuronal differentiation or a direct effect of RA on CB1R gene expression (12Svensson A.C. Johansson M. Persson E. Carchenilla M.S. Jacobsson S.O. J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 83: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To test whether RA is a direct transcriptional regulator of CB1R expression, we have undertaken an analysis of the effect of RA and its analogs on CB1R gene expression in a well differentiated, non-neuronal, primary cultured cell, the mouse hepatocyte. The results indicate that RA up-regulates CB1R gene transcription in hepatocytes via binding to RARγ, which then binds to the 5′ upstream regulatory domain of the CB1R gene to induce its transcription. The results further indicate that autoinduction of the hepatic CB1R by the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is also dependent on activation of this pathway. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Male mice 10–12 weeks of age were used in all experiments. CB1+/+ and CB1−/− littermates were obtained by breeding heterozygotes that had been back-crossed to a C57BL/6J background, as described (13Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Hohmann A.G. Herkenham M. Bonner T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5780-5785Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Mice with hepatocyte-specific knock-out of CB1R (LCB1−/− mice) were generated as described (1Jeong W.I. Osei-Hyiaman D. Park O. Liu J. Bátkai S. Mukhopadhyay P. Horiguchi N. Harvey-White J. Marsicano G. Lutz B. Gao B. Kunos G.

All experiments with knock-out mice used the corresponding homozygous wild-type (+/+) littermates as controls. Genotyping by PCR for the Cre transgene was performed as described previously (15Marsicano G. Goodenough S. Monory K. Hermann H. Eder M. Cannich A. Azad S.C. Cascio M.G.

Individually caged mice were placed on a Lieber-DeCarli low fat liquid diet (Dyets) containing 1 kcal/ml, of which 18% was derived from protein, 12% from fat, and either 70% from carbohydrate (control diet) or 43% from carbohydrate and 27% from ethanol (ethanol diet). Mice had free access to the diet, and food intake and body weight were monitored daily. The mice were on these diets for a total of 30 days; ethanol was introduced gradually by increasing the content by 1% (v/v) each day until the mice were consuming a diet containing 5% (v/v) ethanol, which was then continued for 3 more weeks. For diet-induced obesity studies, a high fat diet with 60% of calories derived from fat (D12492, Research Diets) was fed to the mice for 14–16 weeks as described earlier (3Osei-Hyiaman D. DePetrillo M. Pacher P. Liu J. Radaeva S. Bátkai S. Harvey-White J. Mackie K. Offertáler L. Wang L. Kunos G. J. Clin.

The RARγ agonist CD437 was from Sigma, and the panagonist TTNPB was from Biomol. SR141716 (Rimonabant) had been provided from the National Institute of Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program. 2-AG was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). All-trans-retinoic acid was from Sigma. RARα agonist AM580 was from Biomol. RARβ agonist CD2019 and RARβ antagonist LE135 were from Dr. Kagechika and CIRD Galderma Sophia Antipolis (Valbonne, France), respectively. Antibodies used were anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon), anti-RARγ monoclonal antibody, anti-RARα, and anti-RARβ (Abcam). A polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of the rat CB1R was obtained from Cayman Chemicals. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the last 15 amino acids of the C terminus of CB1R (17Bodor A.L. Katona I. Nyíri G. Mackie K. Ledent C. Hájos N. Freund T.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6845-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was also used to identify CB1R in immunoprecipitates generated with the N-terminal antibody. RARγ protein was purchased from ProteinOne. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of liver and then separated from nonparenchymal cells using Percoll (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation (18Sun R. Jaruga B. Kulkarni S. Sun H. Gao B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were grown in Hepato-Zyme-SFM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, gentamycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. Hepatocytes were freshly isolated and maintained under serum-deprived conditions for 24 h before treatments. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in serum-free medium before being added to cultures. Matched dilutions of DMSO were used as vehicle controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and ethanol levels were assayed using kits from Drew Scientific and BioAssay Systems, respectively. Blood ethanol levels were measured in blood drawn via tail clips at 8 a.m. (1Jeong W.I. Osei-Hyiaman D. Park O. Liu J. Bátkai S. Mukhopadhyay P. Horiguchi N. Harvey-White J. Marsicano G. Lutz B.

For measuring triglyceride and cholesterol levels in liver, mice were sacrificed, and their livers were removed and extracted. Total hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol were measured as described (19You M. Matsumoto M. Pacold C.M. Cho W.K. Crabb D.W. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1798-1808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from liver homogenate or from purified hepatocyte fractions using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion) to remove traces of genomic DNA contamination. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Super-Script II (Invitrogen). The target gene expression was quantified with gene-specific primers and Power SYBR Green master mix (ABI) using a 7500 Realtime PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). Each amplified sample was analyzed for homogeneity using dissociation curve analysis. Relative quantification was performed using the comparative CT method (20Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Nat.

Equal amounts (10 or 25 μg/lane) were fractionated on a Criterion 4–12% BisTris gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blocking was done for 2 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline. The primary antibodies were added as per the manufacturer's recommended dilution in the blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were detected with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and developed using Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Autoradiograms of Western blots were scanned and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). All blots were normalized to the loading control β-actin (21Mukhopadhyay B. Marshall-Batty K.R. Kim B.D. O'Handley D. Nakai H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In some experiments, weak nonspecific bands in Western blots for CB1R could be eliminated by first immunoprecipitating the cell extract using the CB1R N-terminal antibody and then blotting the precipitated proteins using a different, C-terminal CB1R antibody. CB1R immunoprecipitation was carried out using Dynabeads® Protein G magnetic separation according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, Dyna magnetic beads were washed and incubated with CB1R N-terminal polyclonal antibody (Cayman Chemicals) for 3 h at 4 °C. After repeated washing of the Dynabeads-antibody complex, protein lysates from hepatocytes (100 μg for each sample) were added to the complex and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The Dynabeads-antibody-antigen complex was washed three times and eluted in 50 μl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer/NuPAGE reducing agent mix and incubated for 10 min at 70 °C. Samples were loaded onto a Bio-Rad Criterion gel, and Western blotting was performed using the CB1R C-terminal antibody. ChIP assays were performed as described (22Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated hepatocytes were grown to confluence. After treatment as detailed in the figure legend (Fig. 7), cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cross-linking was stopped by adding 0.125 m glycine. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 0.3 ml of Farnham lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 85 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated, followed by centrifugation for 15 min. Supernatants were collected, and immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C. First, the primary monoclonal antibody against RARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was coupled to magnetic beads (Dynal beads, Invitrogen). The magnetic bead slurry was resuspended, washed three times and mixed with primary monoclonal antibody to RARγ in a rotator overnight at 4 °C. After that, coupled antibody was added to each chromatin preparation (after sonication) and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. Beads containing immunobound chromatins were collected by placing the microcentrifuge tubes on the magnet stand. Supernatants were discarded, and beads were washed with LiCl Wash Buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate). The bead pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of IP Elution Buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) by vortexing. Eluates and control lysates without immunoprecipitation (for input DNA) were pooled and heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified with a QIAquick spin kit (Qiagen). For PCR, 1-μl aliquots from a 50-μl DNA extract were subjected to 30–35 cycles of amplification. PCR amplification was carried out for the CB1R promoter sequence. CHIP DNA samples were also analyzed by real-time PCR using the ABI 7500 SYBR Green method and the same set of primers. The data were analyzed using the “-fold enrichment” method and mock IgG (for immunoprecipitation of DNA) as control (23Verdel A. Jia S. Gerber S. Sugiyama T. Gygi S. Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2004; 303: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (20 μg) were extracted with NE-PER nuclear extraction reagents (Pierce), and EMSA was performed with a LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). For EMSA, the binding reactions were performed for 20 min in 1× binding buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, biotin 5′-end-labeled PCR amplicon, and RARγ or nuclear protein extracts, as described in the figure legends (Fig. 6). Purified recombinant RARγ protein was from ProteinOne (Bethesda, MD). RARγ was expressed as a His-tagged protein in the baculovirus system and purified by a combination of affinity and gel filtration chromatography (ProteinOne). Samples were electrophoresed on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer and then transferred to a Biodyne membrane according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The retarded bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit. To confirm the identity of RARγ binding, supershift experiments were performed using the same samples with 1 μg of anti-RARγ antibody. For the competitive binding assay, non-labeled probe was added to the binding reaction at a 200-fold excess over the labeled probe. For knockdown of RARγ, predesigned small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents were obtained using an Accell SMARTpool siRNA kit (Dharmacon), following the manufacturer's recommendations. For each target, predesigned pools of four oligonucleotides were used and validated by Western blot analyses. For transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides, hepatocytes were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well on 6-well culture plates and let sit overnight. The siRNA oligonucleotides were transfected the next day at a final concentration of 100 μm using Accell delivery medium. Three days following transfection, hepatocytes were collected and analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. The Stealth RNAi negative control kit (Dharmacon) was used as a nonspecific transfection control. Results are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance among groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Newman-Keuls analysis using GraphPad Prism 4.3 software. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical significance between two groups was determined by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Correlations were determined by GraphPad Prism 4.3 software. To test whether RA can regulate hepatic CB1R expression, we incubated isolated mouse hepatocytes with all-trans-retinoic acid (24Shimada T. Ross A.C. Muccio D.D. Brouillette W.J. Shealy Y.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and found that CB1R mRNA and protein levels were increased significantly (Fig. 1A). RA can act via two types of retinoic acid receptors, RXR and RAR. We therefore tested the effect of the RXR agonist methoprone and the RAR panagonist TTNPB (25Alique M. Lucio-Cazaña F.J. Moreno V. Xu Q. Konta T. Nakayama K. Furusu A. Sepulveda J.C. Kitamura M. Pharmacology. 2007; 79: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) on hepatocyte CB1R mRNA levels. The RXR agonist was essentially ineffective (not shown), whereas TTNPB caused a robust, ∼30-fold increase in CB1R mRNA associated with a significant, ∼2-fold increase in CB1R protein at both 0.1 and 1 μm (Fig. 1B). To further test which RAR subtype is involved in this effect, we used selective RAR agonists. The RARγ agonist CD437 (26Falanga A. Consonni R. Marchetti M. Locatelli G. Garattini E. Passerini C.G. Gordon S.G. Barbui T. Blood. 1998; 92: 143-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) caused a 14- and 21-fold increase in CB1R mRNA at 1 and 10 μm, respectively, with parallel smaller increases in CB1R protein, whereas the RARα agonist AM580 (24Shimada T. Ross A.C. Muccio D.D. Brouillette W.J. Shealy Y.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) used at 1 μm and the RARβ agonist CD2019 (26Falanga A. Consonni R. Marchetti M. Locatelli G. Garattini E. Passerini C.G. Gordon S.G. Barbui T. Blood. 1998; 92: 143-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 100 nm caused only a 2–3-fold increase in CB1R mRNA (Fig. 1B, right) and no change in CB1R protein (not shown). Moreover, the RARβ antagonist LE135 (27Li Y. Hashimoto Y. Agadir A. Kagechika H. Zhang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15360-15366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) at 1 μm did not affect the increase in CB1R mRNA induced by TTNPB. Also, the combination of TTNPB and CD437 did not produce an additive effect, suggesting that they act via the same target (i.e. RARγ). Purified hepatocytes from liver-specific CB1R knock-out (LCB1−/−) mice were used as negative control for CB1R expression (Fig. 1B, left panels). The weak band observed may reflect trace nonspecific binding of the N-terminal antibody used because it could be eliminated when extracts were first immunoprecipitated and the precipitate was then blotted using another CB1R antibody directed against the C terminus (see Fig. 3A). Parallel increases in CB1R mRNA and protein were induced by CD437 and TTNPB in human primary cultured hepatocytes (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 32-AG induced, CB1R-mediated CB1R expression in mouse hepatocytes is reduced in hepatocytes from Raldh knock-out mice. Hepatocytes from C57BL/6J mice were treated with 2-AG in the presence or absence of CB1R antagonist SR141716 for 24 h. CB1R protein was quantified by Western blotting after immunoprecipitation (A), whereas CB1R mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR (B). Hepatocytes from Raldh+/+ and Raldh−/− mice were treated with 2-AG in the presence or absence of SR141716. CB1R protein expression was analyzed by Western blot (C), and CB1R mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time PCR (D). *, p < 0.05 versus vehicle group, n = 12/group.

Error bars, S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further test the role of RARγ in the effects of various RAR agonists, RARγ expression in mouse hepatocytes was reduced by siRNA knockdown. siRNA treatment resulted in an ∼80% reduction of RARγ mRNA, as verified by real-time PCR (not shown), as well as an ∼75% reduction in RARγ protein levels, as documented by Western blotting (Fig. 2A), with no change in RARα and RARβ protein levels (Fig. 2A). The ability of the RAR panagonist TTNPB (1 μm) to induce CB1R expression was reduced from a ∼30-fold increase in mock-transfected hepatocytes to a 3–4-fold increase in cells with siRNA knockdown of RARγ (Fig. 2B). This indicates that up-regulation of hepatic CB1R expression by RA and its analogs is mediated primarily via RARγ. Ethanol feeding results in increased levels of 2-AG in HSC and an increase in CB1R in hepatocytes, suggesting that 2-AG itself may be involved in regulating the expression of its own receptor. To test this, we have incubated primary cultured mouse hepatocytes with 5–10 μm 2-AG and found a dose-dependent increase in the expression CB1R mRNA and protein, as detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. This effect was largely prevented by simultaneous treatment with the CB1R antagonist rimonabant (SR1; Fig. 3, A and B), indicating “feed-forward”"
https://openalex.org/W2079375310,"Using mouse gene knock-out models, we identify aldehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.2, Akr1a4 (GR)) and aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21, Akr1b3 (AR)) as the enzymes responsible for conversion of D-glucuronate to L-gulonate, a key step in the ascorbate (ASC) synthesis pathway in mice. The gene knock-out (KO) mice show that the two enzymes, GR and AR, provide approximately 85 and approximately 15% of L-gulonate, respectively. GRKO/ARKO double knock-out mice are unable to synthesize ASC (>95% ASC deficit) and develop scurvy. The GRKO mice ( approximately 85% ASC deficit) develop and grow normally when fed regular mouse chow (ASC content = 0) but suffer severe osteopenia and spontaneous fractures with stresses that increase ASC requirements, such as pregnancy or castration. Castration greatly increases osteoclast numbers and activity in GRKO mice and promotes increased bone loss as compared with wild-type controls and additionally induces proliferation of immature dysplastic osteoblasts likely because of an ASC-sensitive block(s) in early differentiation. ASC and the antioxidants pycnogenol and resveratrol block osteoclast proliferation and bone loss, but only ASC feeding restores osteoblast differentiation and prevents their dysplastic proliferation. This is the first in vivo demonstration of two independent roles for ASC as an antioxidant suppressing osteoclast activity and number as well as a cofactor promoting osteoblast differentiation. Although humans have lost the ability to synthesize ASC, our mouse models suggest the mechanisms by which suboptimal ASC availability facilitates the development of osteoporosis, which has important implications for human osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083952846,"The receptor kinase EFR of Arabidopsis thaliana detects the microbe-associated molecular pattern elf18, a peptide that represents the N terminus of bacterial elongation factor Tu. Here, we tested subdomains of EFR for their importance in receptor function. Transient expression of tagged versions of EFR and EFR lacking its cytoplasmic domain in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in functional binding sites for elf18. No binding of ligand was found with the ectodomain lacking the transmembrane domain or with EFR lacking the first 5 of its 21 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). EFR is structurally related to the receptor kinase flagellin-sensing 2 (FLS2) that detects bacterial flagellin. Chimeric receptors with subdomains of FLS2 substituting for corresponding parts of EFR were tested for functionality in ligand binding and receptor activation assays. Substituting the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain resulted in a fully functional receptor for elf18. Replacing also the outer juxtamembrane domain with that of FLS2 led to a receptor with full affinity for elf18 but with a lower efficiency in response activation. Extending the substitution to encompass also the last two of the LRRs abolished binding and receptor activation. Substitution of the N terminus by the first six LRRs from FLS2 reduced binding affinity and strongly affected receptor activation. In summary, chimeric receptors allow mapping of subdomains relevant for ligand binding and receptor activation. The results also show that modular assembly of chimeras from different receptors can be used to form functional receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2162282312,"The eye lens is an encapsulated avascular organ whose function is to focus light on the retina. Lens comprises a single progenitor cell lineage in multiple states of differentiation. Disruption of lens function leading to protein aggregation and opacity results in age-onset cataract. Cataract is a complex disease involving genetic and environmental factors. Here, we report the development of a new 3-stage system that differentiates human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into large quantities of lens progenitor-like cells and differentiated 3-dimensional lentoid bodies. Inhibition of BMP signaling by noggin triggered differentiation of hESCs toward neuroectoderm. Subsequent reactivation of BMP and activation of FGF signaling stimulated formation of lens progenitor cells marked by the expression of PAX6 and alpha-crystallins. The formation of lentoid bodies was most efficient in the presence of FGF2 and Wnt-3a, yielding approximately 1000 lentoid bodies/30-mm well. Lentoid bodies expressed and accumulated lens-specific markers including alphaA-, alphaB-, beta-, and gamma-crystallins, filensin, CP49, and MIP/aquaporin 0. Collectively, these studies identify a novel procedure to generate lens cells from hESCs that can be applied for studies of lens differentiation and cataractogenesis using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from various cataract patients."
https://openalex.org/W2034597340,"Sterol-induced binding to Insigs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) allows for ubiquitination of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. This ubiquitination marks reductase for recognition by the ATPase VCP/p97, which mediates extraction and delivery of reductase from ER membranes to cytosolic 26 S proteasomes for degradation. Here, we report that reductase becomes dislocated from ER membranes into the cytosol of sterol-treated cells. This dislocation exhibits an absolute requirement for the actions of Insigs and VCP/p97. Reductase also appears in a buoyant fraction of sterol-treated cells that co-purifies with lipid droplets, cytosolic organelles traditionally regarded as storage depots for neutral lipids such as triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Genetic, biochemical, and localization studies suggest a model in which reductase is dislodged into the cytosol from an ER subdomain closely associated with lipid droplets."
https://openalex.org/W2042765505,"Protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) provide the backbone for targeted multimolecular signaling complexes that serve to localize the activities of cAMP. Evidence is accumulating of direct associations between AKAPs and specific adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoforms to facilitate the actions of protein kinase A on cAMP production. It happens that some of the AC isoforms (AC1 and AC5/6) that bind specific AKAPs are regulated by submicromolar shifts in intracellular Ca(2+). However, whether AKAPs play a role in the control of AC activity by Ca(2+) is unknown. Using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and high resolution live cell imaging techniques, we reveal an association of the Ca(2+)-stimulable AC8 with AKAP79/150 that limits the sensitivity of AC8 to intracellular Ca(2+) events. This functional interaction between AKAP79/150 and AC8 was observed in HEK293 cells overexpressing the two signaling molecules. Similar findings were made in pancreatic insulin-secreting cells and cultured hippocampal neurons that endogenously express AKAP79/150 and AC8, which suggests important physiological implications for this protein-protein interaction with respect to Ca(2+)-stimulated cAMP production."
https://openalex.org/W2030979689,"The bacterial pathogen Vibrio parahemeolyticus manipulates host signaling pathways during infections by injecting type III effectors into the cytoplasm of the target cell. One of these effectors, VopS, blocks actin assembly by AMPylation of a conserved threonine residue in the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases. The modified GTPases are no longer able to interact with downstream effectors due to steric hindrance by the covalently linked AMP moiety. Herein we analyze the structure of VopS and its evolutionarily conserved catalytic residues. Steady-state analysis of VopS mutants provides kinetic understanding on the functional role of each residue for AMPylation activity by the Fic domain. Further mechanistic analysis of VopS with its two substrates, ATP and Cdc42, demonstrates that VopS utilizes a sequential mechanism to AMPylate Rho GTPases. Discovery of a ternary reaction mechanism along with structural insight provides critical groundwork for future studies for the family of AMPylators that modify hydroxyl-containing residues with AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2161902765,"The propensity of the prion protein (PrP) to adopt different structures is a clue to its pathological behavior. The determination of the region involved in the PrP(C) to PrP(Sc) conversion is fundamental for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process at the molecular level. In this paper, the polymerization of the helical H2H3 domain of ovine PrP (OvPrP) was compared to the full-length construct (using chromatography and light scattering). We show that the oligomerization patterns are identical, although the H2H3 domain has a higher polymerization rate. Furthermore, the depolymerization kinetics of purified H2H3 oligomers compared to those purified from the full-length PrP reveal that regions outside H2H3 do not significantly contribute to the oligomerization process. By combining rational mutagenesis and molecular dynamics to investigate the early stages of H2H3 oligomerization, we observe a conformationally stable beta-sheet structure that we propose as a possible nucleus for oligomerization; we also show that single point mutations in H2 and H3 present structural polymorphisms and oligomerization properties that could constitute the basis of species or strain variability."
https://openalex.org/W2080217584,"The oxazolomycins (OZMs) are a growing family of antibiotics produced by several Streptomyces species that show diverse and important antibacterial, antitumor, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. Oxazolomycin A is a peptide-polyketide hybrid compound containing a unique spiro-linked beta-lactone/gamma-lactam, a 5-substituted oxazole ring. The oxazolomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ozm) was identified from Streptomyces albus JA3453 and localized to 79.5-kb DNA, consisting of 20 open reading frames that encode non-ribosomal peptide synthases, polyketide synthases (PKSs), hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthase-PKS, trans-acyltransferases (trans-ATs), enzymes for methoxymalonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthesis, putative resistance genes, and hypothetical regulation genes. In contrast to classical type I polyketide or fatty acid biosynthases, all 10 PKS modules in the gene cluster lack cognate ATs. Instead, discrete ATs OzmM (with tandem domains OzmM-AT1 and OzmM-AT2) and OzmC were equipped to carry out all of the loading functions of both malonyl-CoA and methoxymalonyl-ACP extender units. Strikingly, only OzmM-AT2 is required for OzmM activity for OZM biosynthesis, whereas OzmM-AT1 seemed to be a cryptic AT domain. The above findings, together with previous results using isotope-labeled precursor feeding assays, are assembled for the OZM biosynthesis model to be proposed. The incorporation of both malonyl-CoA (by OzmM-AT2) and methoxymalonyl-ACP (by OzmC) extender units seemed to be unprecedented for this class of trans-AT type I PKSs, which might be fruitfully manipulated to create structurally diverse novel compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2059325357,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) released by activated neutrophils can initiate and promote carcinogenesis. MPO produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that oxidizes the genomic DNA in inflammatory cells as well as in surrounding epithelial cells. DNA-centered radicals are early intermediates formed during DNA oxidation. Once formed, DNA-centered radicals decay by mechanisms that are not completely understood, producing a number of oxidation products that are studied as markers of DNA oxidation. In this study we employed the 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide-based immuno-spin trapping technique to investigate the MPO-triggered formation of DNA-centered radicals in inflammatory and epithelial cells and to test whether resveratrol blocks HOCl-induced DNA-centered radical formation in these cells. We found that HOCl added exogenously or generated intracellularly by MPO that has been taken up by the cell or by MPO newly synthesized produces DNA-centered radicals inside cells. We also found that resveratrol passed across cell membranes and scavenged HOCl before it reacted with the genomic DNA, thus blocking DNA-centered radical formation. Taken together our results indicate that the formation of DNA-centered radicals by intracellular MPO may be a useful point of therapeutic intervention in inflammation-induced carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056779812,"The recently identified small molecule, 3-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy-4-methylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxylic acid cyclopropylamide (LY2033298), is the first selective allosteric modulator of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) that mediates both receptor activation and positive modulation of the endogenous agonist, acetylcholine (ACh), via the same allosteric site on the M(4) mAChR. We thus utilized this novel chemical tool, as well as ACh, the bitopic (orthosteric/allosteric) agonist, McN-A-343, and the clinically efficacious M(1)/M(4) mAChR-preferring agonist, xanomeline, in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis of four different regions of the M(4) mAChR (extracellular loops 1, 2, and 3, and transmembrane domain 7), to identify regions that govern ligand-specific modes of binding, signaling, and allosteric modulation. In the first extracellular loop (E1), we identified Ile(93) and Lys(95) as key residues that specifically govern the signaling efficacy of LY2033298 and its binding cooperativity with ACh, whereas Phe(186) in the E2 loop was identified as a key contributor to the binding affinity of the modulator for the allosteric site, and Asp(432) in the E3 loop appears to be involved in the functional (activation) cooperativity between the modulator and the endogenous agonist. In contrast, the highly conserved transmembrane domain 7 residues, Tyr(439) and Tyr(443), were identified as contributing to a key activation switch utilized by all classes of agonists. These results provide new insights into the existence of multiple activation switches in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), some of which can be selectively exploited by allosteric agonists, whereas others represent global activation mechanisms for all classes of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1972534190,"Macrophages are essential components of innate immunity, and apoptosis of these cells impairs mucosal defense to microbes. Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that infects half of the world population and causes peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The host inflammatory response fails to eradicate the organism. We have reported that H. pylori induces apoptosis of macrophages by generation of polyamines from ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), which is dependent on c-Myc as a transcriptional enhancer. We have now demonstrated that expression of c-Myc requires phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK, which results in phosphorylation of c-Fos and formation of a specific activator protein (AP)-1 complex. Electromobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation revealed a previously unrecognized complex of phospho-c-Fos (pc-Fos) and c-Jun in the nucleus. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer demonstrated the interaction of pc-Fos and c-Jun. The capacity of this AP-1 complex to bind to putative AP-1 sequences was demonstrated by oligonucleotide pulldown and fluorescence polarization. Binding of the pc-Fos.c-Jun complex to the c-Myc promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. A dominant-negative c-Fos inhibited H. pylori-induced expression of c-Myc and ODC and apoptosis. H. pylori infection of mice induced a rapid infiltration of macrophages into the stomach. Concomitant apoptosis depleted these cells, and this was associated with formation of a pc-Fos.c-Jun complex. Treatment of mice with an inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation attenuated phosphorylation of c-Fos, expression of ODC, and apoptosis in gastric macrophages. A unique AP-1 complex in gastric macrophages contributes to the immune escape of H. pylori."

Rev forms a large organized multimeric protein-protein complex on the Rev response element of these viral mRNA species and transports them from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, exploiting the CRM1-mediated cellular machinery. Here we report the selection of a nanobody, derived from a llama heavy-chain only antibody, that efficiently blocks the assembly of Rev multimers. The nanobody inhibits HIV-1 replication in cells and specifically suppresses the Rev-dependent expression of partially spliced and unspliced HIV-1 RNA. In HIV-susceptible cells, this nanobody thus has potential as an effective anti-HIV agent using genetic immunization strategies. Its binding site was mapped to Rev residues Lys-20 and Tyr-23 located in the N-terminal α-helical multimerization domain. In the presence of this nanobody, we observed an accumulation of dimeric Rev species, supporting a head-to-head/tail-to-tail molecular model for Rev assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2143602075,"Although many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to activate multiple signaling pathways by coupling to different types of G proteins or by promoting G protein-independent events, how this occurs remains unclear. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we provide evidence for protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) forming preassembled complexes with Gαi1 but not Gα12. PAR1 activation appears to rapidly induce transient Gαil activation (t1/2 = 4.13 s) but late and stable recruitment of Gα12 (t1/2 = 8.8 min) in parallel with β-arrestin 1 = 7.5 min). However, there is no significant difference in the potency of the agonist-dependent response between Gαi1, Gα12, and β-arrestin 1 (EC50 values 0.48, 0.30, and 0.15 nM, respectively). Although it seems β-arrestin 1 is recruited to preassembled PAR1-Gαi1 complexes, this appears unlikely with Gα12, suggesting 2 distinct receptor populations. Of note, we observed a different Gα12 association mode with other GPCRs, indicating that preassembly and association dynamics may be specific properties of a receptor-G protein pair. Furthermore, the Gα C terminus appears to play different roles in the distinct association modes. Consequently, G protein preassembly or recruitment may constitute novel mechanisms for controlling the kinetics and multitude of GPCR signaling pathways.—Ayoub, M. A., Trinquet, E., Pfleger K. D.

https://openalex.org/W2074767062,"Scaffolding proteins are major contributors to the spatial and temporal orchestration of signaling cascades and hence cellular functions. RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that plays an important role in the regulation of, and cross-talk between, various signaling pathways. Here we report that RACK1 is a mediator of chromatin remodeling, resulting in an exon-specific expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. Specifically, we found that following the activation of the cAMP pathway, nuclear RACK1 localizes at the promoter IV region of the BDNF gene by its association with histones H3 and H4, leading to the dissociation of the transcription repressor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) from the promoter, resulting in the acetylation of histone H4. These chromatin modifications lead to the activation of the promoter and to the subsequent promoter-controlled transcription of BDNF exon IV. Our findings expand our knowledge regarding the function of scaffolding proteins such as RACK1. Furthermore, this novel mechanism for the regulation of exon-specific expression of the BDNF gene by RACK1 could have implications on the neuronal functions of the growth factor including synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory."

Cellular compartments are the defining feature of a eukaryotic cell. The nucleus allows the separation of the genetic material and transcriptional machinery from the translational and metabolic processes in the cytoplasm. The nucleus is defined by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, and the transport across this barrier occurs through large macromolecular assemblies called the nuclear pore complexes (1Aitchison J.D.

Transport of proteins through this pore is facilitated by nucleocytoplasmic transport factors termed karyopherins.

The monopartite cNLS simply corresponds to the C-terminal basic cluster of a bipartite cNLS. The critical residues in the bipartite cNLS have been termed P1′–P2′ and P2–P5 for the N- and C-terminal clusters, respectively (12Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol.

It is clear, however, that the flanking sequences and the composition of the linker in the bipartite cNLS can further modulate the binding affinity (13Fontes M.R. Teh T. Toth G. John A. Pavo I.

Our understanding of the details of the specificity of cNLS·Impα binding and, therefore, the ability to identify cNLSs in protein sequences remains limited. To address these points, we used an oriented peptide library approach to select the optimal sequences for binding to the major cNLS-binding site in representatives of two different clades of Impα. The oriented peptide library approach has been previously used successfully to determine the optimal sequences recognized by, for example, SH2 domains (35Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M.

We confirmed, using binding assays, that the peptides corresponding to the selected sequences bound to Impα proteins with high affinities, and established the structural basis of their binding to Impα by determining the crystal structure of an Impα·peptide complex. We also demonstrate that these peptides can function as cNLSs, using in vitro nuclear import assays. Thus, linking structural information to an oriented peptide library screening approach for the first time, the results contribute to understanding of the sequence determinants of cNLSs and may help to identify as yet unidentified cNLSs in novel proteins. Hexa-His-tagged recombinant Impα proteins were used for crystallography and nuclear import assays, whereas GST-tagged proteins were used for peptide library screening and ELISA-based binding assays. The cDNAs encoding sequences of human importin-α1/karyopherin-α2 comprising amino acids 67–503 (hImpα167–503; RefSeq accession number NP_002257) and human importin-α5/karyopherin-α1 comprising amino acids 60–511 (hImpα560–511; NP_002255) were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were digested with the endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into similarly digested vector pGex-KG (insert:vector molar ratios of 6:1 or 3:1). The ligated DNA was transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli cells. Colonies were screened by endonuclease digestion and sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the constructs. The pGex-KG-hα1 and pGex-KG-hα5 plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) host cells, and the GST-tagged proteins were expressed by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (all chemicals were from Sigma unless stated otherwise) induction at room temperature (23 °C) for 4 h. Protein degradation was observed for the hImpα5 GST fusion protein after inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, but this was minimized by growing the bacteria at 37 °C to A600 of 0.8 without induction. Bacteria carrying mouse importin-α2 (mImpα2; NP_034785) and mouse importin-β (mImpβ1; NP_032405) GST fusion protein-encoding constructs (38Hu W. Kemp B.E. Jans D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 782-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were grown to A600 of 1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 28 °C. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. They were eluted using 50 mm glutathione, and the glutathione was removed by overnight dialysis. The purity of the proteins was estimated to be >90% by SDS-PAGE. Bacteria carrying the hexa-His-tagged hImpα1, hImpα3 (NP_02259), hImpα5, hImpα7 (NP_036448) (28Köhler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hImpαβ1 (NP_002256) (38Hu W. Kemp B.E. Jans D.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 782-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) protein-encoding constructs were grown to A600 of 1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The highest level of expression was observed when induction was performed at 28 °C for 4 h. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). They were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and the imidazole was removed by dialysis. The purity of the proteins was estimated to be 95% by SDS-PAGE. Hexa-His-tagged mImpα270–529 (comprising amino acids 70–529) was expressed and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (12Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For crystallization experiments, cation-exchange chromatography was also performed to increase purity. The protein was eluted with 200 mm sodium chloride, and salt was removed by dialysis. The purity was estimated to be 98% by SDS-PAGE. Peptides were synthesized according to standard benzatriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole coupling protocol. The synthesized peptides were characterized by reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (125 × 4.6 mm, C18 Zorbax column, linear gradients with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck) over 25 min, flow 1 ml/min) and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The solutions were lyophilized, and the peptides were stored at −80 °C. The sequences of peptides pepTH1, pepTH5, and pepTM are given in Table 1. The peptides were synthesized with a Cys residue at the N terminus to facilitate nuclear import assays.TABLE 1Oriented peptide library screening-derived peptides The peptide library comprised peptides with the sequence GSEFESPXKXXXXEA (Table 1), where X represents any amino acids except for C and W. Cys and Trp were omitted to avoid oxidation and sequencing problems (39Songyang Z. Liu D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The total theoretical degeneracy of this library is 185. An aliquot of each library was sequenced by Edman degradation, to confirm that all 18 amino acids were presented in similar amounts at all degenerate positions. Impα-GST fusion proteins (1 mg) were immobilized on 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads. 300 μl of solution containing 1 mg of the peptide mixture was added to the immobilized Impα-GST and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C to allow for peptide binding to Impα. Unbound peptides were subsequently removed by rapid washing twice with 1 ml of ice-cold HBS (Hepes-buffered saline) buffer, followed by 1 ml HBS buffer without Tween 20. To elute the peptides, the beads were boiled for 5 min causing the proteins to denature and release the peptides. The denatured proteins were then separated from the peptides using a 10-kDa cut-off Microcon (Millipore). The flow-through was collected and sequenced on the protein-sequencing system 785A (Applied Biosystems) using Edman degradation. As a control, the same procedure was performed with GST lacking Impα. The abundance of each amino acid at a given cycle in the sequence of the peptide mixture was divided by the abundance of the same amino acid in the same cycle of the starting mixture. This accounts for variations in the abundance of amino acids at particular residues in the starting library or variations in yield of amino acids during sequencing. Also, the molar percentages of amino acids in each cycle for the sample relative to those in the GST control were normalized. To scale the relative preferences among all amino acids present in the degenerate library, these raw preference values were then summed and normalized to the total number of amino acids in the degenerate position. Selectivity values >2.0 indicate strong selection (37Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the level of background noise in both GST-only and GST-importin fusion proteins necessitated a cycle-based approach to amino acid quantification. Individual amino acid intensities were calculated by comparison with the preceding cycle and tracked in the subsequent cycle. N-terminal Cys-containing peptides (pepTH1, pepTH5, and pepTM) were cross-linked to Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin (fst, Molecular Probes) using the heterobifunctional cross-linker N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (Sigma) in a two-step reaction. 4.2 nmol of Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin in buffer S2 (50 mm Na3PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2) was mixed with 33.6 nmol (8 molar excess of Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin) ethanolic solution of N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate. The mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight. The excess N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate was removed by running the mixture through a PD10 column. To determine the number of N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate molecules cross-linked to Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin, a 5-μl aliquot of the solution was reduced with 5 μl of 0.5 m dithiothreitol and incubated for 1 h, made up to 1 ml with deionized water, and analyzed for pyridine-2-thione production by measuring absorbance at 343 nm. 1.2 mg of peptide (20 molar excess with respect to cross-linked Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin) was added to 33.6 nmol of cross-linked Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin and incubated at 20 °C for 24 h in the dark. To determine the number of peptides conjugated to each molecule of cross-linked Alexa Fluor 488-streptavidin, absorbance was again measured at 343 nm to assess the production of pyridine-2-thione. The final product was buffer-exchanged to HBS buffer using a PD10 column. The conjugates were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C in the dark. The binding of peptides to bacterially expressed GST-tagged importins was analyzed using an ELISA-based binding assay (40Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hübner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Peptides were coated into the wells of polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunclon) in triplicate at 5 pmol/well using 50 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) for 16 h at 4 °C. The wells were blocked by adding 400 μl of 1 × IB buffer (110 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature with shaking (Plateform rocker, Bio-Line), and then washed two times with IB buffer, with the second wash including an incubation for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Serial dilutions of Imp proteins were then added in IB buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1% bovine serum albumin to the microtiter plates and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with shaking. After extensive washing with IB buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1% bovine serum albumin, anti-GST antibody (500 ng/well, Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the plates were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with shaking. Non-specifically bound antibodies were removed by washing 10 times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad). Alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (0.025 unit of enzyme/well, Sigma) was then added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking, and washing was performed as described for the primary antibody. Binding activity was then determined by adding the chromogenic substrate para-nitropheyl phosphate (1 mg/ml, Sigma) dissolved in 10% diethanolamine and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 9.8). The change of absorbance at 405 nm was measured over 90 min using a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Processing of the ELISA data was carried out using Microsoft Excel software (40Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hübner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol.

Binding affinities were evaluated by plotting the corrected absorbance for different concentrations against time using KaleidaGraph 2.13 software. The data in the linear range was used to obtain the absorbance change per min (A/min), which was plotted against the concentration of the protein. Curves obtained were fitted using Equation 1, B(x)=Bmax(1−e−kx)(Eq. 1) where x is the concentration of the protein, B is the level of protein bound, and k is the dissociation constant representing the concentration of the protein yielding half-maximal binding.

https://openalex.org/W2119323848,"Membrane-permeabilizing peptide antibiotics are an underutilized weapon in the battle against drug-resistant microorganisms. This is true, in part, because of the bottleneck caused by the lack of explicit design principles and the paucity of simple high-throughput methods for selection. In this work, we characterize the requirements for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by membrane permeabilization and find that different microbial membranes have very different susceptibilities to permeabilization by individual antimicrobial peptides. Broad-spectrum activity requires only that an AMP have at least a small amount of membrane-permeabilizing activity against multiple classes of microbes, a feature that we show to be rare in a peptide library containing many members with species-specific activity. We compare biological and vesicle-based high-throughput strategies for selecting such broad-spectrum AMPs from combinatorial peptide libraries and demonstrate that a simple in vitro, lipid vesicle-based high-throughput screen is the most effective strategy for rapid discovery of novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2011532795,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily. CFTR is gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis at its two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which dimerize in the presence of ATP to form two ATP-binding pockets (ABP1 and ABP2). Mutations reducing the activity of CFTR result in the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. Two of the most common mutations causing a severe phenotype are G551D and DeltaF508. Previously we found that the ATP analog N(6)-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP (P-ATP) potentiates the activity of G551D by approximately 7-fold. Here we show that 2'-deoxy-ATP (dATP), but not 3'-deoxy-ATP, increases the activity of G551D-CFTR by approximately 8-fold. We custom synthesized N(6)-(2-phenylethyl)-2'-deoxy-ATP (P-dATP), an analog combining the chemical modifications in dATP and P-ATP. This new analog enhances G551D current by 36.2 +/- 5.4-fold suggesting an independent but energetically additive action of these two different chemical modifications. We show that P-dATP binds to ABP1 to potentiate the activity of G551D, and mutations in both sides of ABP1 (W401G and S1347G) decrease its potentiation effect, suggesting that the action of P-dATP takes place at the interface of both NBDs. Interestingly, P-dATP completely rectified the gating abnormality of DeltaF508-CFTR by increasing its activity by 19.5 +/- 3.8-fold through binding to both ABPs. This result highlights the severity of the gating defect associated with DeltaF508, the most prevalent disease-associated mutation. The new analog P-dATP can be not only an invaluable tool to study CFTR gating, but it can also serve as a proof-of-principle that, by combining elements that potentiate the channel activity independently, the increase in chloride transport necessary to reach a therapeutic target is attainable."
https://openalex.org/W2033295792,"Nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) was identified in eukaryotes as the first cytosolic factor that contacts the nascent polypeptide chain emerging from the ribosome. NAC is present as a homodimer in archaea and as a highly conserved heterodimer in eukaryotes. Mutations in NAC cause severe embryonically lethal phenotypes in mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae NAC is quantitatively associated with ribosomes. Here we show that NAC contacts several ribosomal proteins. The N terminus of betaNAC, however, specifically contacts near the tunnel exit ribosomal protein Rpl31, which is unique to eukaryotes and archaea. Moreover, the first 23 amino acids of betaNAC are sufficient to direct an otherwise non-associated protein to the ribosome. In contrast, alphaNAC (Egd2p) contacts Rpl17, the direct neighbor of Rpl31 at the ribosomal tunnel exit site. Rpl31 was also recently identified as a contact site for the SRP receptor and the ribosome-associated complex. Furthermore, in Escherichia coli peptide deformylase (PDF) interacts with the corresponding surface area on the eubacterial ribosome. In addition to the previously identified universal adapter site represented by Rpl25/Rpl35, we therefore refer to Rpl31/Rpl17 as a novel universal docking site for ribosome-associated factors on the eukaryotic ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W2160545539,"Development of bone and adipose tissue are linked processes arising from a common progenitor cell, but having an inverse relationship in disease conditions such as osteoporosis. Cellular differentiation of both tissues relies on growth factor cues, and we focus this study on Sprouty1 (Spry1), an inhibitor of growth factor signaling. We tested whether Spry1 can modify the development of fat cells through its activity in regulating growth factors known to be important for adipogenesis. We utilized conditional expression and genetic-null mouse models of Spry1 in adipocytes using the fatty acid binding promoter (aP2). Conditional deletion of Spry1 results in 10% increased body fat and decreased bone mass. This phenotype was rescued on Spry1 expression, which results in decreased body fat and increased bone mass. Ex vivo bone marrow experiments indicate Spry1 in bone marrow and adipose progenitor cells favors differentiation of osteoblasts at the expense of adipocytes by suppressing CEBP-β and PPARγ while up regulating TAZ. Age and gender-matched littermates expressing only Cre recombinase were used as controls.

https://openalex.org/W1985815625,"The hypothalamic neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in a pulsatile fashion by hypothalamic neurons, and alterations in pulse frequency and amplitude differentially regulate gonadotropin synthesis and release. In this study, we investigated the kinetics of G(s) and G(q) signaling in response to continuous or pulsatile GnRH using fluorescence resonance energy transfer reporters in live mouse LbetaT2 gonadotrope cells. cAMP and protein kinase A-dependent reporters showed a rapid but transient increase in fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal with increasing doses of constant GnRH, and in contrast diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium reporters showed a rapid and sustained signal. Multiple pulses of GnRH caused multiple pulses of cAMP and protein kinase A activation without desensitization, but the DAG and calcium reporters were rapidly desensitized resulting in inhibition of calcium and DAG responses. At the transcriptional level, both a cAMP-dependent cAMP-response element reporter and a DAG/calcium-dependent AP-1 reporter showed a pulse frequency-dependent increase in luciferase activity. However, constant GnRH stimulation gave very little cAMP-response element activation but very strong AP-1 activation. Based on these data, we propose that both the GnRH-R-G(s) and G(q) pathways are responsive to pulses of GnRH, but only the G(q) pathway is responsive to constant GnRH. Furthermore, the G(q) pathway is subject to desensitization with multiple GnRH pulses, but the G(s) pathway is not."
https://openalex.org/W1988332133,"The amyloid deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a critical pathological event in Alzheimer disease (AD). Preventing the formation of amyloid deposits and removing preformed fibrils in tissues are important therapeutic strategies against AD. Previously, we reported the destruction of amyloid fibrils of beta(2)-microglobulin K3 fragments by laser irradiation coupled with the binding of amyloid-specific thioflavin T. Here, we studied the effects of a laser beam on Abeta fibrils. As was the case for K3 fibrils, extensive irradiation destroyed the preformed Abeta fibrils. However, irradiation during spontaneous fibril formation resulted in only the partial destruction of growing fibrils and a subsequent explosive propagation of fibrils. The explosive propagation was caused by an increase in the number of active ends due to breakage. The results not only reveal a case of fragmentation-induced propagation of fibrils but also provide insights into therapeutic strategies for AD."
https://openalex.org/W1993017968,"Five basic tastes (bitter, sweet, umami, salty, and sour) are detected in the four taste areas where taste buds reside. Although molecular mechanisms for detecting bitter, sweet, and umami have been well clarified, those for sour and salty remain poorly understood. Several channels including acid-sensing ion channels have been proposed as candidate sour receptors, but they do not encompass all sour-sensing abilities in vivo. We recently reported a novel candidate for sour sensing, the polycystic kidney disease-2-like 1 (PKD2L1)-PKD1L3 channel complex. This channel is not a traditional ligand-gated channel and is gated open only after removal of an acid stimulus, called an off response. Here we show that off responses upon acid stimulus are clearly observed in native taste cells from circumvallate, but not fungiform papillae, of glutamate decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knock-in mice, from which Type III taste cells can be visualized, using Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp methods. Off responses were detected in most cells where PKD2L1 immunoreactivity was observed. Interestingly, the pH threshold for acid-evoked intracellular Ca2+ increase was around 5.0, a value much higher than that observed in HEK293 cells expressing the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex. Thus, PKD2L1-PKD1L3-mediated acid-evoked off responses occurred both in HEK293 cells and in native taste cells, suggesting the involvement of the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex in acid sensing in vivo.

We sense five basic tastes (bitter, sweet, umami, salty, and sour) on all regions of the tongue where taste buds exist. Taste buds are composed of four distinct morphological types of cells: basal, Type I, Type II, and Type III taste cells. Basal cells are believed to be stem cells or precursors of the other cellular elements of the taste bud, whereas Type I taste cells function similarly to glial cells (1Kataoka S. Yang R. Ishimaru Y.

Although a receptor for salty taste is still not clear, a recent study showed that ENaC worked as the sodium taste receptor and sodium taste was mediated by a population of taste cells that are separate from those mediating sweet, umami, bitter, and sour taste (8Chandrashekar J.

However, the molecular identity of receptors sensing sour taste is still controversial, although acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) (12Ugawa S. Minami Y. Guo W. Saishin Y. Takatsuji K. Yamamoto T.

Dvoryanchikov G.A. Chaudhari N. Roper S.D. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1928-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have been proposed as candidate sour receptors. We recently reported a new candidate receptor for sour sensing, the polycystic kidney disease-2-like 1 (PKD2L1)/PKD1L3 channel complex (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), with PKD2L1 reportedly expressed in Type III taste cells of mice (1Kataoka S. Yang R. Ishimaru Y. Matsunami H. Sévigny J. Kinnamon J.C. Finger T.E. Chem. Senses. 2008; 33: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex functions as a non-selective cation channel with a linear current-voltage (I-V) relationship and relatively high Ca2+ permeability. The apparent activation threshold for the complex by acid was around pH 3.0 in HEK293 cells expressing mouse PKD2L1-PKD1L3 (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex is gated open after the removal of acid stimulus, but not during acid application, a phenomenon called an “off response” (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). There are four taste areas where taste buds reside in mammals: circumvallate papillae, foliate papillae, fungiform papillae, and palate (17Herness M.S. Gilbertson T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 873-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although PKD2L1 mRNA was reported to be expressed in all four of these regions, PKD1L3 mRNA was expressed only in the circumvallate and foliate papillae in mice (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The fact that only the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 channel complex, but not each subunit alone, is properly translocated to the plasma membrane and makes a functional channel (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) suggests that PKD2L1-PKD1L3-mediated sour sensation occurs in the circumvallate and foliate papillae. Because our previous study investigated PKD2L1-PKD1L3 channel complex function only in HEK293 cells heterologously expressing the proteins, we examined whether the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex works as a channel with an off response property in native circumvallate taste cells. glutamate decarboxylase 67 acid-sensing ion channel polycystic kidney disease green fluorescent protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The generation of GAD67-GFP (Δneo) mice has been described (18Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), and these heterozygous mice, used in the present study, were termed GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. These mice specifically express GFP in Type III taste cells, facilitating their identification (3Yoshida R. Miyauchi A. Yasuo T. Jyotaki M. Murata Y. Yasumatsu K. Shigemura N. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Ueno H. Margolskee R.F. Ninomiya Y. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 4425-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mice were maintained with a genetic background of C57BL/6 at our animal facility. Adult mice (>8 weeks) were killed by exposure to 100% CO2 followed by cervical dislocation to minimize distress. All procedures involving the care and use of animals were approved by The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences and carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (27National Institutes of HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1985Google Scholar). Lingual epithelium containing taste papillae was removed from the tongue by injecting a mix solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 mg/ml Dispase II (Roche Applied Science), 0.25 mg/ml Elastase (Worthington), and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Worthington), directly under the epithelium surrounding the taste papillae. The peeled epithelium was bathed in the mix solution for 2 min and 30 s and then in Ca2+-, Mg2+-free solution for 14 min at room temperature. The isolated taste cells were then drawn into fire-polished glass micropipettes with gentle suction. Isolated taste cells were transferred to a shallow recording chamber having a glass coverslip coated with Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences). Ca2+-, Mg2+-free Tyrode's solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm BAPTA (pH 7.4). Because cell conditions deteriorate rapidly following isolation, we performed Ca2+ imaging and patch clamp experiments within a few hours of isolation. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz for analysis using an Axopatch 200B amplifier equipped with pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The standard bath solution used for fura-2-mediated Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell recordings contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaHCO3 10 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). Bath solutions of different pHs contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MES, 5 mm citric acid, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm glucose (pH adjusted with NaOH). To confirm Type III taste cell viability, 50 mm KCl solution consisting of 90 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaHCO3 10 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) was used. In the Ca2+-free bath solution, CaCl2 was removed, and EGTA was added. KCl was replaced with CsCl for voltage ramp-pulse application to obtain current-voltage relationship to inhibit voltage-gated K+ channel activation (19Medler K.F. Margolskee R.F. Kinnamon S.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2608-2617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with mouse PKD1L3 cDNA and/or mouse PKD2L1 cDNA using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). The pDsRed (Clontech) plasmid was used as a PKD expression marker for Ca2+ imaging. For immunostaining, the pGreen Lantern 1 (Invitrogen) plasmid was used instead of pDsRed. HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs and incubated for 30–36 h before the experiments were begun. Isolated taste cells and transfected HEK293 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked with Block Ace, and incubated with anti-PKD2L1 antiserum (1/500 dilution) (a generous gift from H. Matsunami) (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. We calculated changes in the fluorescence emission ratio at 340 and 380 nm (340/380, percentage). Values (ratios) from each experiment were normalized with respect to the response values induced by ionomycin. The ratio was defined using the following formula: change in ratio (percentage) = (maximum off response ratio values) − (ratio values just before the off response occurred)/(maximum ionomycin ratio values) − (ratio values just before the off response occurred). When the difference in the numerator was a negative value, a zero value was used. Statistical significance for pH threshold measurement was evaluated by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni-type multiple t test. Evaluation of the off response current sizes between circumvallate and fungiform papillae was done with Student's t test. To effectively isolate the sour-sensing cells that presumably express the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complexes, we used taste cells from GAD67-GFP knock-in mice because GAD67 is expressed in Type III taste cells (10DeFazio R.A. Dvoryanchikov G. Maruyama Y. Kim J.W. Pereira E. Roper S.D. Chaudhari N. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We stained the circumvallate taste cells with an anti-PKD2L1 antibody after measuring changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) upon acid stimulus. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, a GAD67-GFP- and PKD2L1-positive taste cell showed a small transient during and a large [Ca2+]i increase after acid stimulus (pH 4.0), which corresponds to the on and off responses, respectively. Cell viability was confirmed by their response to 50 mm extracellular KCl. Cells without PKD2L1 expression did not respond to acid stimulus (Fig. 1B). Among GAD67-GFP-positive cells, most of the KCl-responsive cells also responded to acid stimulus (80%, 24 out of 30 cells), and 92.8% (116 out of 125 cells) expressed PKD2L1 protein. Similar on and off responses were observed in 10 circumvallate taste cells (Fig. 1C, left), all of which were GAD67-GFP-positive. On the other hand, such clear on and off responses were not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1D, left), indicating that the observed on and off responses are caused by Ca2+ influx. Some gradual [Ca2+]i increase was, however, observed during acid exposure even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, which suggests the involvement of Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores. Next, we observed two different inward currents during (230.5 ± 117.8 pA, n = 6) and after (267.7 ± 83.7 pA, n = 6) acid (pH 4.0) stimulus in GAD67-GFP-positive taste cells held at −60 mV (Fig. 2A, left, and C), indicating the existence of acid-activated channels, the latter of which could be activated PKD2L1-PKD1L3. The off currents had a linear current-voltage relationship (Fig. 2A, right), as reported for HEK293 cells expressing the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We then examined acid responses in Type III taste cells from fungiform papillae. Acid (pH 4.0) caused gradual [Ca2+]i increases without clear off responses after sharp [Ca2+]i rises (on response) in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, right). The clear on responses disappeared in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, although gradual [Ca2+]i increases were still observed (Fig. 1D, right), suggesting that the on responses were made by Ca2+ influx. Consistent with the Ca2+-imaging results, no clear inward currents were observed upon washout of the pH 4.0 solution (p < 0.05 versus circumvallate taste cells), although some inward currents were recorded during acid stimulus (Fig. 2, B and C). These data suggest that off responses are detected in GAD67-GFP-positive taste cells from circumvallate, but not fungiform papillae, consistent with the notion that acid-evoked off responses are produced by the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex. To check PKD2L1 protein expression in GAD67-GFP-positive taste cells, we stained the GFP-positive cells with an anti-PKD2L1 antibody. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, GAD67-GFP-positive taste cells from both circumvallate and fungiform papillae expressed PKD2L1 protein. In addition, HEK293 cells transfected with PKD2L1 cDNA alone did not show any [Ca2+]i increases upon acid (pH 2.8) stimulus, whereas cells transfected with both PKD2L1 and PKD1L3 cDNAs showed off [Ca2+]i increases in response to acid stimulus (Fig. 3), as reported previously (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Both cell types were confirmed to express PKD2L1 proteins with the antibody. Therefore, loss of acid-evoked off responses in fungiform taste cells could be due to the lack of the PKD2L1 partner protein, PKD1L3 in these cells, which is consistent with earlier studies (15Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine the pH threshold for acid-evoked off responses in native cells, GAD67-GFP-positive taste cells from circumvallate papillae were exposed to acids at various pH values (6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0) for 30 s each and then to pH 4.0 solution to confirm acid-evoked responses. A pH 5.5 solution did not cause an off [Ca2+]i increase, although a clear on [Ca2+]i increase was observed (Fig. 4A). A pH 4.0 solution evoked a large off [Ca2+]i increase in the same cell, suggesting that an acid of pH 5.5 is insufficient to gate open the off channels in circumvallate taste cells. On the other hand, a pH 5.0 solution caused a small off [Ca2+]i increase after removal followed by a larger off [Ca2+]i increase upon washout of a pH 4.0 solution (Fig. 4B). Off responses were induced by acids with a pH value of less than 5.0, and the [Ca2+]i changes (presented as the percentage of ratio normalized to the ionomycin response) increased as the pH decreased (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the pH threshold for acid-evoked off responses in native circumvallate taste cells that is probably mediated through PKD2L1-PKD1L3 activation is around 5.0. We observed both on and off responses to acid stimulus in native mouse taste cells, the latter of which are consistent with our recent data obtained from HEK293 cells expressing the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is the first observation of acid-evoked off responses in mouse taste cells. An RNA interference strategy could not be used to further support the involvement of endogenous PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex in the off responses because only freshly isolated taste cells were of sufficient quality for analysis. This fact, together with a lack of reliable inhibitors, does not allow the link between the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex and the observed off responses in native cells to be firmly established. However, the high incidence of the off response in PKD2L1-positive Type III cells suggests that the off response property can be attributed to PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex expression. Using a specific anti-PKD2L1 antibody, we found that 92.8% of the GAD67-GFP-positive cells, defined as Type III cells, expressed PKD2L1 protein. In addition, almost all taste cells with acid-evoked off responses showed on responses. These results indicate that most of the Type III taste cells expressing GAD67 have an ability to sense acid, consistent with recent reports (3Yoshida R. Miyauchi A. Yasuo T. Jyotaki M. Murata Y. Yasumatsu K. Shigemura N. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Ueno H. Margolskee R.F. Ninomiya Y. J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 4425-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that salt detection can be attributed to cells other than ones expressing gustducin, which is a Type II cell marker (20Yang R. Tabata S. Crowley H.H. Margolskee R.F. Kinnamon J.C. J Comp. Neurol. 2000; 425: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), or expressing GAD67. This notion is also in agreement with the recent report that salt can be detected in cells that are not involved in detecting the other four tastes (8Chandrashekar J. Kuhn C. Oka Y. Yarmolinsky D.A. Hummler E. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S. Nature. 2010; 464: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). There were differences in the magnitude of on responses depending on the measurement methods used, e.g. small on responses in Ca2+ imaging experiments and relatively large inward currents (230.5 ± 117.8 pA) during acid application. However, the on responses disappeared in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1D, left), suggesting that on responses are caused by Ca2+ influx. One explanation for this result is that acid-evoked on currents have relatively low Ca2+ permeability with Na+ as a main charge carrier. These transient inward Na+ currents may cause depolarization that is insufficient to activate the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which are expressed in Type III cells and are thought to cause large [Ca2+]i increases in response to 50 mm KCl application (10DeFazio R.A. Dvoryanchikov G. Maruyama Y. Kim J.W. Pereira E. Roper S.D. Chaudhari N. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Medler K.F. Margolskee R.F. Kinnamon S.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2608-2617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation can be supported by the notion that Na+-permeable ASIC channels could be responsible for the on responses. Indeed, ASIC1 and ASIC3 have been reported to be expressed in mouse circumvallate taste cells (21Richter T.A. Dvoryanchikov G.A. Roper S.D. Chaudhari N. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4088-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and ASIC1a has some Ca2+ permeability (22Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 23Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The pH threshold for acid-evoked [Ca2+]i increases differed between HEK293 cells expressing PKD2L1-PKD1L3 (around 3.0) (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and native mouse circumvallate taste cells (around 5.0) (Fig. 4). This difference might indicate that molecules other than PKD2L1-PKD1L3 are responsible for the off responses in native taste cells, which we think is unlikely, because the cell types showing off responses match well with those expressing the PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex and the linear I-V relation of the acid-evoked currents is similar between HEK293 cells expressing PKD2L1-PKD1L3 (16Inada H. Kawabata F. Ishimaru Y. Fushiki T. Matsunami H. Tominaga M. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and circumvallate taste cells (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Other proteins or regulation systems could be involved in the sour sensation together with PKD2L1-PKD1L3 in native taste cells, but not in HEK293 cells. For example, capsaicin dose dependence is different between native mouse sensory neurons and HEK293 cells expressing mouse transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) because the FAF1 protein that binds to TRPV1 in sensory neurons was reported to reduce the capsaicin sensitivity in native sensory neurons (24Kim S. Kang C. Shin C.Y. Hwang S.W. Yang Y.D. Shim W.S. Park M.Y. Kim E. Kim M. Kim B.M. Cho H. Shin Y. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2403-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that the detection threshold for citric acid is 0.03 mm (corresponding to pH 4.5) in humans (25Stevens J.C. Physiol. Behav. 1997; 62: 1137-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is a value similar to that observed in mice in this study. Thus, PKD2L1-PKD1L3 complex-mediated off responses could work in vivo upon mild acidification in concert with on response molecules. What is the physiological significance of the acid-evoked off responses that are probably mediated by PKD2L1-PKD1L3 in sour sensation? Because sour taste sensation is important for preventing animals from eating harmful foods, there could be plural channels that can be activated during and following acid application. Alternatively, off responses could have specific roles in sour sensation. The existence of multiple acid receptors might make determining whether only one molecule is involved in sour sensation difficult. Recently, the genes for both PKD2L1-PKD1L3 and ASICs were reported to be deficient in two sour ageusia patients (26Huque T. Cowart B.J. Dankulich-Nagrudny L. Pribitkin E.A. Bayley D.L. Spielman A.I. Feldman R.S. Mackler S.A. Brand J.G. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), supporting the importance of PKD2L1-PKD1L3 in sour sensation in humans and suggesting that PKD2L1-PKD1L3 channels and ASICs can work in concert for detecting acid. Thus, PKD2L1-PKD1L3 channel complex would be a promising target for research about sour sensation. We thank R. Yoshida (Kyushu University) and H.

Receptor subtypes, based on isoforms of the ligand-binding subunit GABA<sub>B1</sub>, are thought to involve a differential set of associated proteins. Here, we describe two mouse lines that allow a straightforward biochemical isolation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The transgenic mice express GABA<sub>B1</sub> isoforms that contain sequences for a two-step affinity purification, in addition to their endogenous subunit repertoire. Comparative analyses of purified samples from the transgenic mice and wild-type control animals revealed two novel components of the GABA<sub>B1</sub> complex. One of the identified proteins, potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 12, associates with heterodimeric GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors via the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit. In transfected hippocampal neurons, potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 12 augmented axonal surface targeting of GABA<sub>B2</sub>. The mice equipped with tags on GABA<sub>B1</sub> facilitate validation and identification of native binding partners of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1539934168,"Granzyme M (GzmM) is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease that preferentially cuts its substrates after Met or Leu. GzmM is constitutively expressed in activated innate effector natural killer (NK) cells. GzmM-induced cell death is consistent with the kinetics of cytotoxicity of NK cells. These suggest that GzmM may play an important role in innate immunity. Our previous work demonstrated that GzmM induces caspase-dependent apoptosis. However, it is unknown about how GzmM causes caspase activation. Here, we showed that the inhibitor of the apoptosis gene family member Survivin is a physiological substrate for GzmM. GzmM hydrolyzes Survivin at Leu-138 to remove the last four C-terminal residues. The truncated form (sur-TF) is more rapidly hydrolyzed through proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition, Survivin is in complex with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to inhibit caspase activation as an endogenous inhibitor. Survivin cleavage by GzmM abolishes the stability of the Survivin-XIAP complex and enhances XIAP hydrolysis, which amplifies caspase-9 and 3 activation of target tumor cells. The noncleavable L138A Survivin overexpression can significantly inhibit GzmM-mediated XIAP degradation, caspase activation, and GzmM- and NK cell-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, Survivin silencing promotes XIAP degradation and enhances GzmM-induced caspase activation as well as GzmM- and NK cell-induced cytolysis of target tumor cells."

Hearts of cTnI-ND transgenic mice further exhibited decreased β myosin heavy chain expression compared to age matched non-transgenic mice as well as altered cTnI phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrated cTnI-ND expressed in the heart is not phosphorylated indicating the cTnI N-terminal is necessary for the higher level phosphorylation of cTnI.

Troponin I is encoded by three muscle genes expressing fast skeletal, slow skeletal, and cardiac TnI (cTnI) isoforms (1Perry S.V. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the cTnI gene the most recently evolved (2Chong S.M. Jin J.P. J. Mol.

Unlike the fast and slow skeletal isoforms, the cTnI isoform has evolved to contain a unique 32 amino acid N-terminal extension with the function of modulating cardiac contraction. In response to β-adrenergic-induced stimulatory G-protein (Gsα) activation of protein kinase A (PKA), Ser-23/24 of the cTnI N-terminal extension are bis-phosphorylated (3Solaro R.J. Moir A.J.

The normal heart of all mammals investigated to date, including humans, contains a low abundance of the cardiac TnI N-terminal-deleted (cTnI-ND) molecule incorporated into the myofilament (12Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15753-15760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This cTnI-ND molecule results from the specific proteolytic cleavage of 27 N-terminal amino acid residues from the modulatory cTnI cardiac specific extension. Cardiac remodeling induced by simulated microgravity further up-regulates this specific proteolytic cleavage increasing the cTnI-ND amount (12Yu Z.B. Zhang L.F. Jin J.P. J. Biol.

Transgenic mouse hearts expressing this cTnI-ND core molecule exhibit a normal life span and cardiac morphology in the presence of decreased myofilament activity at submaximal activation levels of Ca2+, increased ex vivo myocardial relaxation and improved ventricular filling suggesting a potentially beneficial effect of the cTnI-ND on heart function (14Barbato J.C.

These findings indicate that specific proteolytic production of the cTnI-ND molecule during cardiac remodeling by removing the cTnI N-terminal extension produces a functional core cTnI molecule to modulate cardiac function.

Our objective was to investigate the potential beneficial hemodynamic, mechanical, and biochemical effects of this specific cTnI proteolytic modification on the development of physiological cardiac dysfunction in aged animals. Our results demonstrate young transgenic mice expressing the cTnI-ND molecule (cTnI-ND Tg) exhibit decreased Ca2+ sensitivity and increased cross-bridge cycling in detergent extracted cardiac fiber bundles prior to the effects of aging. Furthermore, cTnI-ND expression improved in vivo cardiac relaxation in aged animals as assessed by echocardiography. These data provide novel insights into the in vivo effects of regulated cTnI proteolysis as an adaptive modulator of heart function during cardiac remodeling resulting from physiologically relevant cardiac stress.

Animal care and use was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Expression of cTnI and cTnI-ND in cardiac muscle was determined by SDS-PAGE separation of ventricular Triton X-100 permeabilized myofibril (13Biesiadecki B.J. Schneider K.L. Yu Z.B. Chong S.M.

Resultant blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-actin antibody (AC-40, Sigma) to determine equal loading. Resultant films were scanned and quantified using ImageQuant TL (GE). Intact cTnI Ser-23/24 PKA phosphorylation was determined by Western blot as above with the rabbit phosphospecific troponin I (cardiac) (S23/24) antibody (Cell Signaling) and an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (GE). Following detection the resultant blot was striped and re-probed for loading normalization to total intact cTnI with mouse C5 primary antibody and anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody (Sigma) by nitro blue tetraxolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphatase development. This combination of antibodies and differential development methods is critical to avoid carryover of the pTnI Ser-23/24 signal into the total TnI C5 Western. Cardiac myosin heavy chain isoform expression was determined by SDS-PAGE separation of whole ventricle homogenates on 18 × 18 cm gels as previously described. Resultant gels were stained with Gel Code (Pierce) and scanned for quantification using ImageQuant TL (GE) or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for MHC identification by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody FA2 (21Jin J.P.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 0.5–1.5% isoflurane in 100% oxygen, and body temperature was monitored by rectal thermometer and maintained at 36–37 °C with a heating pad. The transducer placed on a layer of acoustic coupling gel applied to the left hemithorax and mice imaged in a shallow left lateral decubitus position. M-mode images of the left ventricle were obtained from the parasternal short axis view at the level of the papillary muscle. Interventricular septal and left ventricular posterior wall thicknesses and left ventricular internal dimensions at the end of diastole and systole were measured by the American Society of Echocardiography leading edge method on the M-mode tracings. Fractional shortening of the left ventricle was calculated from digital images as: left ventricular fractional shortening percentage (LV FS%) = (LVIDd-LVISd)/LVIDd × 100, where LVIDd is the internal diastolic dimension of the left ventricle, and LVISd is the internal systolic dimension of the left ventricle. The mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) was calculated as Vcf = FS/ET, where ET is the ejection time through the aortic valve. Diastolic transmitral inflow recordings were acquired from apical four-chamber views using 7 MHz pulsed Doppler echocardiography as previously described (22Rajan S. Ahmed R.P. Jagatheesan G.

Briefly, The probe was positioned substernally at the xyphoid and the Doppler range gate depth set to 4 mm to obtain optimal signals from the left ventricular inflow and outflow tracts. The sample volume was positioned along the long axis in the middle of the mitral ring at the tips of the opened cusps of the mitral valve to determine Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), the time from the aortic valve closure to the mitral valve opening. Stroke volume (SV) was measured from pulsed Doppler and cardiac output (CO) calculated as SV multiplied by heart rate. M-mode and Doppler tracings were conducted with a paper speed of 200 mm/s. The simultaneous measurement of steady state isometric tension and ATPase activity in left ventricular detergent extracted papillary bundles from 4-month-old mice over a range of free Ca2+ was conducted as previously described (20Biesiadecki B.J.

Papillary bundles were activated over a range of free [Ca2+] to measure steady-state isometric tension and ATPase activity. Measurement of ATP hydrolysis was stoichiometrically coupled to NADH consumption measured by UV absorption (340 nm) in a small chamber (about 25 μl). Only bundles that maintained greater than 80% maximal tension throughout the experimental protocol were included for analysis.

Resultant homogenates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at a temperature of 4 °C and the supernatant fraction removed. The pellet was then washed two times in relax buffer with inhibitors but without Triton X-100. Following washes the pellet was extracted in UTC buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS) with periodic vortexing for 1 h, sonicated with 1 s bursts 3 times at the lowest power and clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 18,000 × g at 4 °C). The resultant soluble fraction was frozen at −80 °C until analysis.

Ventricular myofilament-enriched fractions were labeled with either Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 at 10 pmol/50 μg protein and incubated on ice for 3 h when the reactions were quenched with 10 nmol/liter lysine. In separate experiments labels were reversed to ensure that analysis was not affected by dye affinity or sensitivity.

Following rehydration proteins were focused by a linear method (250 V for 15 min, 10,000 V for 3 h, and 10,000 V for 40,000 V/h). At this time strips were removed and cut into 3 equal sections. The acidic and basic sections were then processed for the second dimension whereas the middle section containing MyBPC was returned to a 7.5-cm focusing tray and further focused at 6,000 V for 45 min. Following focusing strips were reduced by incubation in 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 7% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol for 10 min and then blocked in 6 m urea, 30% v/v glycerol, 7% (w/v) SDS, 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for 10 min prior to secondary separation by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on Laemmli 12% (200:1) gels. Analysis of cTnI was conducted by similar methods except 40 μg of each Cy labeled ventricular myofilament fraction was mixed with UTC buffer containing 0.5% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient (IPG) 7–11 buffer (GE Healthcare), 1% (v/v) Destreak (GE Healthcare), 4 mm tributylphosphine (Sigma), and 1.5% (w/v) dithiothreitol and focused on 18 cm 7–11 IPG strips (GE Healthcare). Immediately following focusing a paper wick saturated with 5% (w/v) dithiothreitol was placed under the negative end of the strip on the electrode and the strip further focused at 10,000 V for 5 min. The strip was then equilibrated and subjected to second dimension separation on Laemmli 12% (29:1) gels. Resultant gels were then imaged using a Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) with Cy2 monitored with a 530-nm BP 40 filter excited with a 488-nm laser; Cy3 with a 580-nm BP 30 filter and 532-nm laser excitation and Cy5 with a 670-nm BP 30 filter and 630-nm laser excitation at 100-μm resolution and the photomultiplier tube set to obtain pixel intensity near 90,000. In a second experiment, NTg and Tg ventricular myofilament fractions labeled with either Cy2 or Cy5 were fractionated for cTnI analysis as above and either stained with ProQ Diamond according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) to identify phosphorylated protein spots or imaged, transferred to nitrocellulose, imaged again, and subjected to Western blot using a monoclonal anti-cTnI antibody (C5, Fitzgerald) to identify cTnI protein spots. Two-dimensional DIGE data were analyzed with DeCyder software (GE Healthcare). Protein spot changes (in percent) were expressed as means ± S.E. and changes with p values of <0.05 considered statistically significant. Based upon our recent finding that expression of the cTnI-ND molecule in the heart compensates for the Gsα-DF induced heart dysfunction (15Feng H.Z. Chen M. Weinstein L.S. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33384-33393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the in vivo functional effects of cTnI-ND expression in the heart to affect physiological aging induced cardiac depression. Representative Western blots using the cTnI specific mAb C5 on ventricular myofilament preparations from 4- and 16-month-old cTnI-ND Tg mice demonstrates cTnI-ND Tg mice express similar levels of cTnI-ND protein at both ages (Fig. 1C). At 16 months of age neither body weight nor heart rate were significantly different between cTnI-ND and NTg mice (Table 1). Doppler echocardiographic analysis demonstrates that 16-month-old cTnI-ND Tg mice exhibit improved systolic function (increased left ventricular fractional shortening and circumferential fiber shortening), trended toward increased cardiac output (p = 0.06) and demonstrated improved diastolic function (decreased isovolumetric relaxation time) compared to similar aged NTg mice (Table 1).TABLE 1Cardiac function of aged NTg and cTnI-ND Tg miceGeneral parametersNTg (n = 3)cTnI-ND (n = 4)Body weight (g)32.9 ± 3.128.3 ± 2.5Heart rate (bpm)484 ± 25532 ± 47IDd (mm)3.61 ± 0.253.43 ± 0.04ISd (mm)2.49 ± 0.431.76 ± 0.13ap < 0.05 vs. NTg.FS (%)31.3 ± 7.548.8 ± 4.0ap < 0.05 vs. NTg.Vcf (circ/sec)7.51 ± 2.1611.97 ± 1.04ap < 0.05 vs. NTg.Stroke volume (ml)0.020 ± 0.0020.036 ± 0.013Cardiac output (ml/min)9.87 ± 1.4319.49 ± 6.73bp = 0.06 vs. NTg.IVRT (msec)23.0 ± 3.413.5 ± 3.8ap < 0.05 vs. NTg.a p < 0.05 vs. NTg.b p = 0.06 vs. NTg. Open table in a new tab To establish the causal effect of the cTnI-ND structural change to modulate contractile function prior to the compensatory effects of aging we investigated the effect of cTnI-ND expression on muscle mechanics from young mice. Calcium-dependent development of force and ATPase activity we simultaneously measured in detergent-extracted papillary fiber bundles from cTnI-ND Tg and NTg mouse hearts at 4 months of age. As illustrated in Fig. 2, fiber bundles isolated from cTnI-ND Tg hearts exhibit a significantly decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development compared with fibers isolated from NTg hearts (pCa50: cTnI-ND = 4.95 ± 0.02; NTg = 5.68 ± 0.07, p < 0.01) in the absence of altered maximal force (Fig. 2 (inset) Fmax: cTnI-ND = 24.19 ± 2.7; NTg = 25.97 ± 3.0, p > 0.05). Furthermore, tension cost, a parameter reflecting the rate of cross-bridge detachment (27de Tombe P.P. Stienen G.J. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), was significantly increased in fibers from cTnI-ND Tg mice (Fig. 3; tension cost, cTnI-ND = 11.39 ± 0.49; NTg = 9.61 ± 0.41, p < 0.05) without a change in the number of cycling myosin cross-bridges as stiffness was not altered (stiffness: cTnI-ND 1.90 ± 0.11; NTg = 1.85 ± 0.08, p > 0.05). The average parameters are summarized in Table 2. These findings demonstrate the structural effects of the cTnI-ND to modulate myofilament function in the young animal prior to the cardiac stress effects of aging.FIGURE 3Detergent-extracted cardiac bundles from cTnI-ND Tg mouse hearts exhibit an altered rate of cross-bridge cycling. Simultaneous tension and ATPase activity were measured in detergent extracted cardiac fiber bundles isolated from cTnI-ND and NTg mouse hearts. The relation between ATPase activity and tension demonstrates that compared with controls, cTnI-ND Tg fibers exhibit increased ATP hydrolysis and tension cost (inset).

Open table in a new tab Previously we demonstrated cardiac specific Tg expression of the slow skeletal isoform of cTnI, also lacking the unique cardiac N-terminal extension, decreased the age-dependent increase of β myosin heavy chain (β-MHC) expression in rodents. To determine if cTnI-ND Tg hearts also exhibit altered β-MHC we separated α-MHC and β-MHC isoforms by SDS-PAGE and quantified MHC expression following Coomassie staining. The results in Fig. 4 demonstrate cardiac myofilament homogenates from 4-month-old NTg and cTnI-ND Tg mice exhibit minimal expression of the β-MHC isoform (Fig. 4A). At 16 months of age, NTg mice exhibit increased expression of β-MHC, however β-MHC expression in the cTnI-ND Tg heart was similar to that expressed at 4 months of age and significantly decreased compared with NTg (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate expression of the cTnI-ND protein in the heart prior to aging diminishes the age-dependent expression of β-MHC observed in the NTg mouse. To further investigate the molecular changes responsible for altered contractile function in Tg mice expressing the cTnI-ND, we quantified myofilament protein post-translational modification status by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing (two-dimensional IEF) SDS-PAGE. Ventricular myofilament post-translational status was evaluated by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional DIGE). Myofilament preparations from NTg and cTnI-ND Tg hearts were differentially minimally labeled with Cydye, the independent samples pooled, separated by two-dimensional IEF SDS-PAGE over a non-linear pH range of 3–11 and the myofilament proteins imaged for each Cydye (NTg or cTnI-ND Tg) independently. Fig. 5 demonstrates representative two-dimensional DIGE images of 4- and 16-month-old NTg and cTnI-ND Tg myofilament preparations following merged overlay of Cy5-labeled NTg (red) and Cy2-labeled cTnI-ND Tg (green) samples. As result of the two-dimensional DIGE merge, spots containing a higher amount of protein from Cy5 NTg are viewed as red, those containing more Cy2 cTnI-ND Tg are green, and protein spots of similar amount are viewed as yellow. Spot quantification of the individual grayscale Cydye myofilament two-dimensional DIGE scans at both 4 and 16 months of age demonstrated no significant difference in the spot amounts of actin, troponin T, myosin light chain 1, myosin light chain 2, or desmin between cTnI-ND Tg and NTg hearts. Tropomyosin and cTnI were not well resolved in this protocol. Unlike these proteins, the spot profile of myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C) distribution was significantly altered in TnI-ND Tg compared with NTg at 16 but not 4 months of age; however total MyBP-C phosphorylation as assessed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels stained with ProQ Diamond was not significantly different (data not shown). These findings demonstrate cTnI-ND expression did not cause significant changes in the majority of the"

We describe here an approach for the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies based on context-dependent attenuation to reduce pathologically high activity while allowing homeostatic signaling in biologically important pathways. Such attenuation is achieved by modulating the kinetics of a ligand binding to its various receptors and regulatory proteins rather than by complete blockade of signaling pathways. The anti-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) antibody XOMA 052 is a potent inhibitor of IL-1β activity that reduces the affinity of IL-1β for its signaling receptor and co-receptor but not for its decoy and soluble inhibitory receptors. This mechanism shifts the effective dose response of the cytokine so that the potency of IL-1β bound by XOMA 052 is 20–100-fold lower than that of IL-1β in the absence of antibody in a variety of in vitro cell-based assays. We propose that by decreasing potency of IL-1β while allowing binding to its clearance and inhibitory receptors, XOMA 052 treatment will attenuate IL-1β activity in concert with endogenous regulatory mechanisms. Furthermore, the ability to bind the decoy receptor may reduce the potential for accumulation of antibody·target complexes.

Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 1960-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). IL-1β signaling activity is mediated by a single receptor, IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) (21Curtis B.M. Gallis B.

Immunol. 1998; 16: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The complexity of this receptor-ligand system presents a challenge for the selection of therapeutic anti-IL-1β antibodies. The optimal antibody would selectively attenuate systemic high-level IL-1β signaling to lower, beneficial levels while allowing very high local concentrations of IL-1β to initiate protective inflammatory responses (in response to infection, for instance). At the same time, the antibody should not interfere with neutralization of IL-1β by soluble receptors, clearance of IL-1β by receptor-mediated pathways, IL-1α signaling, or IL-1Ra activity. We propose that using an antibody to selectively reduce the affinity of a ligand for its signaling receptor will have the effect of reducing signaling output by reducing receptor occupancy by ligand. Kinetic modulation of a receptor-ligand interaction with an antibody can be described by the following equation (for derivation, see supplemental Fig. S1)KRL′=KRL(1+AKAR)(1+AKAL)(1+AKRLA)(Eq. 1) where the receptor-ligand equilibrium binding constant in the presence of antibody (K′RL) is a function of receptor-ligand equilibrium constant (KRL), antibody concentration (A), antibody affinity for the complex (KRLA), and antibody affinity for either the receptor (KAR) or the ligand (KAL). A regulatory antibody would bind its target (either the receptor or the ligand) in such a manner that the affinity of the ligand for its receptor is reduced, but not completely eliminated. We refer to antibodies with these characteristics as “regulatory antibodies” to distinguish them from previously described antagonist, agonist, and catalytic antibodies. One important implication of this model is that the degree of signaling attenuation is constant and is independent of antibody concentration once all target is bound by antibody. At that point, signaling will depend on the concentration of the ligand, its signaling receptor, and other endogenous regulatory mechanisms. In contrast, a traditional blocking antibody will reduce signaling in a concentration-dependent manner until reaching complete neutralization when the target is saturated. As the degree of attenuation by the regulatory antibody depends instead on the ratio of K′RL to KRL, which is an inherent property of the attenuating antibody, it is possible to produce multiple antibodies that provide various degrees of attenuation of a particular interaction. The theory behind this model is generally applicable to any biological effect that is mediated by interaction of two or more components, independent of target class. We have generated a number of regulatory antibodies to multiple targets, 4J. A. Corbin, S. Watson, D. H. Bedinger, M. K. Roell, and M. L. White, manuscript in preparation. demonstrating that this class of antibodies is not limited to a single target or system. Here we describe XOMA 052, a recombinant monoclonal antibody with long circulating half-life (28Donath M. Diabetologia. 2008; 51: S7Google Scholar), high affinity (29Masat L. Haak-Frendscho M.

Patent 7,531,166. 2009; (5 12)Google Scholar), and high specificity for IL-1β (supplemental Fig. S2), that simultaneously reduces the affinity of IL-1β for IL-1RI (K′RL > KRL) while leaving affinity for IL-1RII and the soluble inhibitory receptors largely unaffected by antibody binding. XOMA 052 is a potent inhibitor of IL-1β activity both in vitro and in vivo (30Owyang A. Gross L. Yin J. Lee S. Shu L. Beergemann J. Jadhav J. Esposito L. Maedler K. Kantak S.

Control blocking antibodies 5 and 6 were an IgG1 lambda and IgG2 kappa, respectively, synthesized by fusing the variable region sequences reported for receptor blocking antibodies (33Green L.

Patent Application 20040063913. 2004; (4 1)Google Scholar) to the appropriate human constant regions. The IL-1 receptor-blocking activities of the control blocking antibodies were verified by SPR analysis (not shown). The isotype control antibody was an anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) human IgG2 lambda antibody (clone KLH8.G2, generated at XOMA). Recombinant human IL-1Ra (catalog number 280-RA), sRI (catalog number 269-1R-100/CF), sRII (catalog number 263-2R-050/CF), and sRAcP·Fc chimera (catalog number 676-CP-100) were purchased from R&D Systems. Recombinant human IL-1β was purchased from Peprotech (catalog number 200-001B) or R&D Systems (catalog number 201-LB). Stepwise formation of the sRI·IL-1β·RAcP ternary complex bound to XOMA 052 was performed on a multi-SPR array system (ProteOn XPR 36TM, Bio-Rad) at 25 °C using HEPES-buffered saline running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.05% surfactant P20). A ProteOn GLM sensor chip (Bio-Rad, catalog number 176-5012) was prepared by amine coupling NeutrAvidin (Thermo Scientific, catalog number 31000) in 0.01 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) to an activated sensor chip surface at high density (≥10,000 response units (RU)). XOMA 052 and Blocking Ab 5 were biotinylated by reacting with 5–10 molar excess of NHS-PEO12-Biotin reagent (Thermo Scientific, catalog number 21329) according to the vendor's instructions. Excess free biotin was removed by centrifugation of proteins through a desalting column (Thermo Scientific, ZebaTM desalting spin column, catalog number 89882). Biotinylated antibodies were captured on different channels of the NeutrAvidin-coated sensor chip at densities of 500–600 RU. A reference channel was prepared in the same manner without injection of antibody. Binding to captured antibodies was tested by successive injections of 50 nm IL-1β, 100 nm sRI, and 200 nm sRAcP·Fc. The SPR binding responses were double-referenced using the ProteOn data manager program to subtract buffer injections and signal from reference surfaces. The affinities of IL-1β ± XOMA 052 binding to soluble IL-1 receptors sRI and sRII were determined in solution using KinExA technology (Sapidyne, Inc.). Equilibrium experiments were conducted by serially diluting soluble receptors from 150 nm to 4 pm in PBS (0.01 m phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% azide) with 1% bovine serum albumin sample buffer into a constant binding site concentration of IL-1β alone or mixed with XOMA 052. To obtain KD-controlled data, the binding site concentration was no more than 2-fold above the KD (IL-1β = 1 nm and IL-1β + XOMA 052 = 5 nm). For all experiments in which XOMA 052 was present, the antibody concentration was maintained at a 100-fold molar excess over IL-1β to ensure that all of the cytokine was bound by XOMA 052. The IL-1β ± XOMA 052 plus receptor mixtures were incubated at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 12–24 h prior to assay initiation to allow complex formation to reach equilibrium. Following the incubation period, the IL-1β receptor complexes were drawn through a solid phase, consisting of receptor-blocking anti-IL-1β antibody-coupled beads, to capture unbound IL-1β ± XOMA 052. The captured IL-1β ± XOMA 052 was detected using a polyclonal anti-IL-1β antibody (R&D Systems) followed by a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The bound signals were converted into relative values as a proportion of control in the absence of receptors. Two replicates of each sample were measured for all equilibrium experiments. The equilibrium titration data were fit to a 1:1 binding model using KinExA software (Version 2.4; Sapidyne Inc.). These measurements were repeated a total of five times for sRI and two times for sRII. Results from experiments using SPR (see Table 1 and data not shown) 5H. Issafras, J. A. Corbin, and M. K. Roell, manuscript in preparation. are consistent with KinExA results.TABLE 1Effect of XOMA 052 on affinities of IL-1β interactionsInteraction by SPRImmobilized on SPR chipInjectedNo Antibody+XOMA 052nnmnmIL-1β + sRI ↔ IL-1β·sRIsRIIL-1β ± XOMA 0520.7 ± 0.16.1 ± 0.25sRI·biotinIL-1β ± XOMA 0520.5 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.33sRI·Fc chimeraIL-1β0.5 ± 0.2NA3XOMA 052·biotin + IL-1βsRINA10 ± 45IL-1β + sRII ↔ IL-1β·sRIIsRIIIL-1β ± XOMA 0527 ± 28 ± 35sRII·biotinIL-1β ± XOMA 0527.3 ± 0.66 ± 15XOMA 052·biotin + IL-1βsRIINA2 ± 13IL-1β·sRI + sRAcP-Fc ↔ IL-1β·sRI·sRAcP-FcsRAcP·Fc·biotinsRI/IL-1β ± XOMA 05225 ± 470 ± 203IL-1β·sRII + sRAcP-Fc ↔ IL1β·sRII·sRAcP-FcsRII·biotin + IL-1β ± XOMA 052sRAcP·Fc28 ± 1222 ± 62 Open table in a new tab A NeutrAvidin-coated sensor chip was prepared as described above. Soluble RAcP·Fc was biotinylated as described above and captured on different flow channels of the sensor chip (400 RU). Reference channels (NeutrAvidin only) were prepared similarly except that no sRAcP·Fc was captured. Using the Co-inject mode, sRI (1:3 dilution series of sRI starting from 100 nm in a buffer containing 500 nm of either IL-1β or IL-1β precomplexed with a 4-fold molar excess of XOMA 052) was injected for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min followed by a second analyte injection of either 500 nm IL-1β or 500 nm IL-1β precomplexed with a 4-fold molar excess of XOMA 052. Injection of cytokine ± XOMA 052 during the dissociation phase was required to maintain saturation of receptor with cytokine. This allows measurement of the dissociation of the sRI·cytokine complex from the immobilized sRAcP·Fc independently from dissociation of the cytokine from sRI. Reference sensorgrams were subtracted from binding sensorgrams using the Scrubber analysis program. Kinetic parameters were obtained by global fitting of the data to 1:1 interaction model. IL-1β binding to full-length IL-1RI and IL-1RAcP was measured on human embryonic kidney cells expressing the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (293-EBNA, Invitrogen, catalog number R620-07) maintained in Hyclone SFM4Tx (catalog number SH30860.02), 1% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone catalog number SH30070.03), 0.25 mg/ml Geneticin® (Invitrogen, catalog number 10131), 4 mm l-glutamine, and transiently transfected with genes encoding IL-1RI and RAcP (Origene, catalog numbers TC119624 and SC109339). IL-1β was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 microscale protein labeling kit (Invitrogen, catalog number A30009) according to the manufacturer's procedure. The binding of the labeled IL-1β to sRI and XOMA 052 was tested by SPR and did not appear to be significantly altered by the label (data not shown). 293-EBNA cells were transfected using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, catalog number 11668-019) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were collected after 4 days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 on a shaker, and both transgene expression and IL-1β binding were verified by flow cytometry (data not shown). Growth medium supernatants were removed and replaced with binding buffer (0.01 m phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% azide) containing increasing amounts of either IL-1β Alexa Fluor 647 or IL-1β Alexa Fluor 647 plus 20-fold molar excess of XOMA 052 at the concentrations indicated. After three washes with binding buffer, the cells were analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the mean fluorescence was calculated for each sample. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded into a sterile 96-well tissue culture plate at 5000 cells/well in minimal essential medium, Earle's (Invitrogen, catalog number 10370-021) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). After an overnight incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, supernatants were removed and replaced with growth medium containing recombinant human IL-1β plus control Blocking Ab 6, anti-KLH isotype control antibody, or XOMA 052 at the concentrations indicated. For the antibody potency assay, IL-1β was preincubated with the indicated antibody for 1 h at 37 °C prior to addition to the cells and added at a final concentration of 100 pg/ml IL-1β. For the IL-1β dose-response assay, increasing amounts of IL-1β were preincubated overnight at room temperature with a 100-fold molar excess of antibody prior to addition to the MRC-5 cells. Following a 20-h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, cell supernatants were removed and diluted according to estimated IL-6 concentration and assayed for human IL-6 by ELISA (Quantikine human IL-6 ELISA, R&D Systems, catalog number D6050) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All samples were set up and assayed in duplicate or triplicate. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas VA) were stably transfected with an NFκB-luciferase reporter plasmid (Biomyx, catalog number P2120), and a tumor necrosis factor α-responsive clonal derivative was selected. The reporter cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 11330-032) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 0.25 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). One day prior to treatment, cells were transferred into opaque white 96-well plates (Corning, catalog number 3917) at 20,000 cells/well in hygromycin-free growth medium. For the IL-1β titration assay, increasing amounts of IL-1β were preincubated overnight at room temperature with a 1000-fold molar excess of antibody prior to addition to the reporter cells. For the antibody potency assay, recombinant human IL-1β was preincubated with increasing concentrations of antibody for 1 h at 37 °C prior to addition to the cells and added at a final IL-1β concentration of 25 pg/ml. IL-1β plus antibody was incubated with the HeLa reporter cells for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To assess luciferase expression levels, Bright-Glo (Promega) was added to the cells according to manufacturer's instructions, and samples were read on a FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices). All samples were set up and assayed in duplicate or triplicate. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). A549 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in minimal essential medium, Earle's (Invitrogen, catalog number 10370-021) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Subconfluent monolayers were washed twice with room temperature PBS and then incubated overnight at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. XOMA 052 at a 100-fold molar excess was incubated with the diluted IL-1β overnight at 4 °C in serum-free medium. Following 18 h in serum-free medium, the cells were incubated for 15 min in prewarmed serum-free media containing IL-1β with or without 100-fold molar excess of XOMA 052. Cells were cooled on ice, rinsed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and then lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Pierce, catalog number 89901) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce, catalog number 78429) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Pierce, catalog number 78426). The monolayer was scraped and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, incubated for 15–45 min on ice, and then spun at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 15,000 relative centrifugal force to clear. Total protein concentration was measured by a BCA assay (Pierce, catalog number 23227). This study was carried out twice, and samples were analyzed in duplicate. Phosphorylation of p38, ERK, JNK kinases, and total IκB was assessed by Western blotting (n = 2). An equal amount of protein in each sample (25 μg of whole cell lysate/well) was separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin and probed with mouse anti-p-ERK-1, anti-p-JNK-1, anti-p-p38, and anti-IκB or anti-ERK, anti-JNK, and anti-p38 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). Following incubation with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, catalog number NA931V and catalog number NA934V, respectively), proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence detection system. Phosphorylated ERK and JNK were quantified using the MULTI-SPOT assay system (MesoScale Discovery, MAP kinase whole cell lysate kit, MSD number K11101D-1) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). For this study, we used control Blocking Ab 5, which completely blocks IL-1β binding to IL-1 sRI and sRII (not shown). Complexes of IL-1β with XOMA 052 or the control blocking antibody were prepared by mixing 0.4 μg/ml rhIL-1β with a 100-fold molar excess of antibody and incubating overnight at 25 °C. A third solution was prepared using anti-KLH-IgG2 as a non-binding isotype control antibody. All proteins were formulated in sterile PBS. rhIL-1β either complexed or mixed with the isotype control antibody was diluted 2-fold with PBS and administered intravenously to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice at a dose volume of 100 μl to give a dosage of 1 mg/kg (20 ng of rhIL-1β/mouse). In two independent experiments, four mice per group were dosed, and blood was collected from all mice by postmortem cardiac puncture at 48 h after intravenous injection. Samples were frozen at −70 °C for subsequent analysis. Human IL-1β levels were measured by ELISA (BD OptEIATM human IL-1β ELISA set, BD Biosciences, catalog number 557953) as per kit instructions. The non-interference of the capture and detection antibodies by XOMA 052 and control Blocking Ab 5 were verified both by ELISA and by SPR (not shown). In brief, ELISA plates (Corning Costar, catalog number 9018) were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human IL-1β capture antibody provided (BD Biosciences, catalog number 51-9002512) in 0.1 m NaHCO3. The following day, the plates were washed with PBS-Tween 20 and blocked for 2 h with blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine serum in PBS). Samples were prepared in duplicate with eight serial 2-fold dilutions. Samples and standards (recombinant human IL-1β standard, BD Biosciences catalog number 51-9004477) were prepared in 10% mouse serum in PBS, added to the wells, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed four times with PBS. Detection antibody was added (anti-human IL-1β-biotin, BD Biosciences, catalog number 51-9002516), and plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were subsequently washed six times with PBS-Tween 20. Streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences, catalog number 51-90002813) was added and incubated for 30 min. Plates were washed six times, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Calbiochem, catalog number 613544) was added"
https://openalex.org/W2083519509,"Calcium-dependent lectin I from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-IL) binds specifically to oligosaccharides presenting an alpha-galactose residue at their nonreducing end, such as the disaccharides alphaGal1-2betaGalOMe, alphaGal1-3betaGalOMe, and alphaGal1-4betaGalOMe. This provides a unique model for studying the effect of the glycosidic linkage of the ligands on structure and thermodynamics of the complexes by means of experimental and theoretical tools. The structural features of PA-IL in complex with the three disaccharides were established by docking and molecular dynamics simulations and compared with those observed in available crystal structures, including PA-IL.alphaGal1-2betaGalOMe complex, which was solved at 2.4 A resolution and reported herein. The role of a structural bridge water molecule in the binding site of PA-IL was also elucidated through molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. This water molecule establishes three very stable hydrogen bonds with O6 of nonreducing galactose, oxygen from Pro-51 main chain, and nitrogen from Gln-53 main chain of the lectin binding site. Binding free energies for PA-IL in complex with the three disaccharides were investigated, and the results were compared with the experimental data determined by titration microcalorimetry. When the bridge water molecule was included in the free energy calculations, the simulations predicted the correct binding affinity trends with the 1-2-linked disaccharide presenting three times stronger affinity ligand than the other two. These results highlight the role of the water molecule in the binding site of PA-IL and indicate that it should be taken into account when designing glycoderivatives active against P. aeruginosa adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2076057925,"NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2) is an important cytosolic pattern recognition receptor that activates NF-κB and other immune effector pathways such as autophagy and antigen presentation. Despite its intracellular localization, NOD2 participates in sensing of extracellular microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus. NOD2 ligands similar to the minimal synthetic ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) are generated by internalization and processing of bacteria in hydrolytic phagolysosomes. However, how these derived ligands exit this organelle and access the cytosol to activate NOD2 is poorly understood. Here, we address how phagosome-derived NOD2 ligands access the cytosol in human phagocytes. Drawing on data from Drosophila phagosomes, we identify an evolutionarily conserved role of SLC15A transporters, Drosophila Yin and PEPT2, as MDP transporters in fly and human phagocytes, respectively. We show that PEPT2 is highly expressed by human myeloid cells. Ectopic expression of both Yin and PEPT2 increases the sensitivity of NOD2-dependent NF-κB activation. Additionally, we show that PEPT2 associates with phagosome membranes. Together, these data identify Drosophila Yin and PEPT2 as evolutionarily conserved phagosome-associated transporters that are likely to be of particular importance in delivery of bacteria-derived ligands generated in phagosomes to cytosolic sensors recruited to the vicinity of these organelles.

The components of the innate immune system, including cellular defenses and inflammatory pathways, mount a rapid and tightly orchestrated response to pathogen invasion (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Central to this is the activation of proinflammatory signals that are triggered by the simultaneous ligation of multiple pattern recognition receptors by ligands that are components of microbes and absent from the healthy host (2Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). The archetypal pattern recognition receptors are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 2The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorNLRNOD-like receptorMDPmuramyl dipeptideILinterleukinPBSphosphate-buffered salineIFNγinterferon γYFPyellow fluorescent proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinTNFtumor necrosis factorCFPcyan fluorescent proteinRT-PCRreal-time PCR. transmembrane proteins found on the cell surface and in endosomal compartments (3Takeda K.

Despite the TLRs and NLRs surveying two discrete cellular compartments (the extracellular space and the cytosol), these receptors collaborate for optimal host response to many pathogens. However, how this collaboration is coordinated is poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that maximal activation of TLR and NOD2-dependent signaling in response to Gram-positive microbes is possible only after delivery into a phagosome and that this event is intimately associated with inflammatory cytokine induction (6Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 7Underhill D.M.

These observations reflect the multifunctional role of the phagosome during innate immune sensing of Gram-positive microbes. An emerging theme is that during maturation, the phagosome enzymatically modifies the cargo to liberate cryptic pattern recognition receptor ligands (8Herskovits A.A. Auerbuch V. Portnoy D.A.

Isberg R.R. Portnoy D.A. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 10-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) include ligands for a wide variety of innate immune pattern recognition receptors including NOD2, the focus of this work. NOD2 was identified less than a decade ago as a NF-κB activating protein (11Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Subsequent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in NOD2 are linked to increased risk of development of Crohn's disease (12Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R.

NOD2 is a multidomain protein containing two CARD domains, a central NOD domain and a C-terminal LRR domain that is thought to be the ligand-binding domain. Peptidoglycan-derived fragments, including the well characterized synthetic ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP), are known ligands that activate NOD2 signaling pathways. Activation of NOD2 induces the production of multiple NF-kB dependent cytokines, including IL-8 and IL-6, and antimicrobial peptides (15Franchi L. Warner N. Viani K. Nuñez G. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 106-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Because of the association with inflammatory bowel disease, a major focus of work on NOD2 has been in understanding its role and regulation in epithelial cells. However, it is evident that NOD2 is important not only in epithelial immunity but also in other cell types, including phagocytic antigen presenting cells. Supporting this, NOD2 is expressed predominantly in myeloid cells (11Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), and macrophages derived from both Nod2-deficient mice and from Crohn's disease patients carrying mutations in NOD2 are unable to activate NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways after MDP stimulation while retaining their capacity to respond to TLR ligands (16Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nuñez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Additionally, NOD2 is also involved in microbial sensing in a number of other systems, including a recently described role in sensing of viral pathogens (17Sabbah A. Chang T.H. Harnack R. Frohlich V. Tominaga K. Dube P.H. Xiang Y. Bose S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), autophagy (18Travassos L.H. Carneiro L.A. Ramjeet M. Hussey S. Kim Y.G.

Jewell D. Simmons A. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, despite being a cytosolic sensor, NOD2 participates not only in sensing cytoinvasive microbes but also in the sensing of extracellular pathogens. This fact raises the question of how the NOD2 ligands derived from extracellular microbes access intracellular compartments, and suggest that transport mechanisms must exist to translocate them across membranes to enter the cytosol surveilled by NOD2. As the ligands from extracellular pathogens appear to be generated by digestion and modification in phagolysosomes, we have focused on these organelles and set out to understand MDP transport in phagocytic cells. Specifically, we have addressed how phagosome-derived ligands access the cytosol. Drawing on data from Drosophila phagosomes, we identify an evolutionarily conserved role of SLC15 transporters, Drosophila Yin and PEPT2, as MDP transporters in fly and human phagocytes, respectively. Importantly, we show that these transporters associate with phagosome membranes and hence are likely to be of particular importance in delivery of ligands generated in this compartment to NOD2 recruited to the vicinity of these organelles. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Nod2−/− mice generated by K. Kobayashi. All mice were kept and handled under a protocol approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated by 7 days culture of bone marrow cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 20% L929 cell-conditioned medium and primed with IFNγ for 16 h prior to use. THP-1 and HEK293T cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained according to ATCC's recommendations. Before use, THP-1 cells were differentiated using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 5 ng/ml as described previously (20Park E.K. Jung H.S. Yang H.I. Yoo M.C. Kim C. Kim K.S. Inflamm Res. 2007; 56: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transfected with different constructs by using Lipofectamine 2000 and following Invitrogen's recommendations. Staphylococcus aureus (strain Reynolds capsular serotype 5; provided by Dr. J. C. Lee, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) were grown as described previously (21Ip W.K. Takahashi K. Moore K.J. Stuart L.M. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The bacteria grown to the midexponential phase were heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min, washed twice (10,000 × g for 10 min), resuspended in PBS, and stored in aliquots at −20 °C before use for cell stimulation in vitro. MDP was from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). YFP-tagged TLR2 (pcDNA3.1-TLR2-YFP) and CFP-tagged TLR6 (pcDNA3.1-TLR6-CFP) expression vectors were kindly provided by D. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). GFP-tagged (pEGFPC1-NOD2) NOD2 and nontagged NOD2 mammalian expression vectors were described previously (22Barnich N.

Full-length human SLC15A2 (PEPT2) from THP-1 cells and Drosophila OpT1/Yin from S2 cells were cloned into a Gateway entry vector (Invitrogen) by PCR using primers designed according to the manufacturer's instructions. These entry clones were sequence verified and transferred into a Gateway mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) by recombination. Human SLC15A1 was subcloned into Gateway vectors from a verified clone purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Mammalian expression vector containing full-length human SLC15A3 coding sequence was purchased from Open Biosystems (clone ID, 5213632). Macrophages in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal calf serum were stimulated with heat-inactivated bacteria at a multiplicity of infection of 25:1, or MDP at the indicated concentrations, at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 to 4 h for macrophages and 6 h for differentiated THP1 cells, after which culture supernatants were harvested. Cytokine secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DuoSet Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Development System; R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Macrophages in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal calf serum were incubated with heat-inactivated bacteria, labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), at a multiplicity of infection of 25:1 for 30 min on ice, allowing the synchronization of bacteria binding onto the cell. In all cases, before incubation with macrophages, bacterial clusters were disrupted by passing the bacteria through a 30-gauge needle. After 30 min on ice, the cells were further incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in the presence of GolgiStop (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA) to accumulate intracellular TNF-α. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA (PBS/EDTA), detached with scrappers, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized and stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse TNF-α or Il-6 antibody (BD Bioscience) diluted in PBS with 0.2% saponin. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry performed on FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson); analysis was performed with CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson) to determine phagocytosis and intracellular TNF-α production at the single cell level. Dual luciferase reporter assays for NF-κB activation were performed in HEK293T cells as described previously (23Stuart L.M. Deng J. Silver J.M. Takahashi K. Tseng A.A. Hennessy E.J. Ezekowitz R.A. Moore K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with the indicated expression constructs together with NF-κB luciferase (Firefly) and control luciferase (Renilla) reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Before assays, the cells were washed with PBS and cultured in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% fetal calf serum. The cells were stimulated with heat-inactivated bacteria or bacterial ligands as described under “Cell Stimulations and Treatments.” Reporter gene activity was measured using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Data were normalized for transfection efficiency with the control reporter activity from the same sample and presented as mean NF-κB fold induction of triplicate samples. Expression of SLC15 transporters was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR using a Mastercycler ep realplex thermocyler (Eppendorf). Expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expressed as a percent of expression in kidney, which was used as a positive control for transporter expression. RT-PCR primers used to estimate relative expression of the different transporters are as follows: SLC15A1-F, 5′-GTTGCTTCTGGTCGTCTGTG-3′; SLC15A1-R, 5′-GCCCCTGACATGAAATATGG-3′; SLC15A2-F, 5′-GCCCTGTCTTGAAGCATTTT-3′; SLC15A2-R, 5′-AGAGTCTCTGGGGCCTTGTT-3′; SLC15A3-F, 5′-GCTTAAGCTCGCTCTCCAAA-3′; SLC15A3-R, 5′-GGCAAGATCTTCACCAGCAC-3′; SLC15A4-F, 5′-AGCGATCCTGTCGTTAGGTG-3′; SLC15A4-R, 5′-AGGAGGCTTGGTGATGAAAA-3′. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pDEST53-PEPT2 to allow expression of a GFP-PEPT2 fusion protein. The cells were than incubated for 2 h with red fluorescent 1 μm diameter latex beads (Estapore, Paris, France) to allow engulfment. Immunofluorescence studies were performed on cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) or methanol (for anti-PEPT2 and anti-NOD2 staining) and imaged with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad/Zeiss Radiance 2000 or Nikon TiE with a Perkin Elmer spinning disc). Nonconfocal images were acquired using a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a CoolSnap camera. Post-acquisition image analysis was performed with Adobe Photoshop, Openlab, or Velocity software (Improvision). All experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times independently. Statistical significance was determined by using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. NF-κB driven responses to S. aureus are mediated primarily by membrane-bound TLRs that respond to immunostimulatory components of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall that include lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, and lipopeptides (24Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). However, a second family of pattern recognition receptors, the cytosolic NLRs, has also been suggested to participate in response to these primarily extracellular microbes. Specifically, it is believed that NOD2 senses a peptidoglycan derivative, similar to MDP that is released from the bacterial cell wall (25Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Hervé M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). To further define the role of NOD2 in the response to S. aureus, we isolated macrophages from Nod2−/− mice and measured TNF-α and IL-6. Resting Nod2−/− macrophages showed no defect in response to S. aureus, but when primed with IFNγ, showed impaired response compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1a). To determine the relative contributions of the TLR and NOD2 pathways to S. aureus sensing, we next used HEK293T transfected with TLR2/6 and/or NOD2 and measured NF-κB activation. Transfection of NOD2 alone was unable to render HEK293T cells responsive to S. aureus (Fig. 1b). However, when coexpressed with TLR2/6, NOD2 enhanced NFkB activation, indicating that although NOD2 is insufficient for full activation, it synergized with TLR2/6 to increase cytokine response. Thus, the collaboration of TLRs with NOD2 is necessary for optimal response to S. aureus in both the mouse and human systems. NOD2 is normally distributed in the cytosol and weakly associated with the plasma membrane in resting cells (22Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J.

However, for signaling to occur, NOD2 must be recruited and tethered to membranes along with its signaling adaptor, RIP2 (26Lécine P. Esmiol S. Métais J.Y. Nicoletti C. Nourry C. McDonald C. Nunez G.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that, like other components of the S. aureus sensing machinery, NOD2 may also be recruited to phagosome membranes. Consistent with this possibility, ectopically expressed GFP-NOD2 concentrated in close proximity to phagosomes generated in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1c). Similarly, endogenous NOD2 was also found associated with phagosomes in THP1 human macrophages (Fig. 1d). As NOD2 is recruited to phagosomes, which also generate the NOD2 ligand (8Herskovits A.A. Auerbuch V. Portnoy D.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we next tested whether these organelles were the origin of NOD2 activation after internalization of S. aureus. Our previous work (21Ip W.K. Takahashi K. Moore K.J. Stuart L.M. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) has shown that TNF-α and IL-6 response to S. aureus is triggered primarily from phagosomes, and, hence, response to these bacteria can be used as a surrogate for phagosome-dependent signaling. Therefore, using a single cell fluorescence-activated cell sorter-based assay in which cytokine production and phagocytosis can be monitored simultaneously (21Ip W.K. Takahashi K. Moore K.J. Stuart L.M. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we tested whether NOD2-dependent TNF-α and IL-6 production in response to internalized S. aureus was impaired in macrophages from Nod2−/− mice (Fig. 1e). Phagosome-triggered cytokine production, particularly IL-6, was markedly impaired in Nod2−/− macrophages. Together with our data that NOD2 is recruited to phagosomes, these observations support the hypothesis that NOD2 activation occurs primarily from these organelles (27Kapetanovic R. Nahori M.A. Balloy V. Fitting C. Philpott D.J. Cavaillon J.M. Adib-Conquy M. Infect Immun. 2007; 75: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, despite recruitment to phagosomes, NOD2 remains on the cytosolic aspect of the membrane. This observation raises the question of how cytosolic NOD2 participates in S. aureus response, as it is an extracellular pathogen that does not normally access the cytosol. We therefore set out to establish how ligands derived from extracellular bacteria such as S. aureus access NOD2, a cytosolic sensor in human cells. For NOD2 to be activated, the bacteria-derived ligands (such as MDP and other glycopeptides) must first be transported out of the phagosome into the cytosol. To identify potential phagosome-associated transporters, we took advantage of a database of phagosome-associated proteins derived from proteomic analysis of Drosophila phagosomes (23Stuart L.M. Deng J. Silver J.M. Takahashi K. Tseng A.A. Hennessy E.J. Ezekowitz R.A. Moore K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interrogation of that database identified a number of candidate transporters (Fig. 2a). One particular protein, Yin (found in the 30 min and 2 h Drosophila phagosome proteome), was identified as a particularly promising candidate. Yin is related to a family of SLC15A transporters that are best known for their role in nutrient acquisition in the gastrointestinal tract and are considered as a promising drug delivery target in colonic and kidney epithelial cells. One member of this family, PEPT1, has been implicated in MDP transport (28Vavricka S.R. Musch M.W. Chang J.E. Nakagawa Y. Phanvijhitsiri K. Waypa T.S. Merlin D. Schneewind O. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1401-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Ismair M.G. Vavricka S.R. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Fried M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Girardin S.E. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and another (SLC15A4) in Nod1-activating muramyl peptides (Tri-DAP and iE-DAP) sensing in epithelial cells (30Lee J. Tattoli I. Wojtal K.A. Vavricka S.R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To determine whether Yin was able to transport MDP and hence function as a phagosome-associated MDP exporter, we cloned Drosophila Yin and expressed it along with NOD2 and a NF-κB reporter in mammalian HEK293T cells. Co-transfection of Drosophila Yin and NOD2 increased the sensitivity of HEK293T NF-κB reporter cells to MDP added exogenously to the media (Fig. 2b). These data indicate that Yin is able to transport MDP and suggested that this family of transporters might also be involved in export of MDP from phagosomes in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Yin is related to the four human SLC15A transporters with a common ancestor and that Yin shares the highest amino acid sequence similarity with PEPT2 (35% identity) and PEPT1 (33% identity) but less similarity with SLC15A3 and SLC15A4 (18 and 17% identity, respectively) (Fig. 3a). To determine the predominant transporter in human phagocytic cells, expression of the four mammalian oligopeptide transporters, PEPT1 (SLC15A1), PEPT2 (SLC15A2), SLC15A3, and SLC15A4, was determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 3b). Semiquantitative RT-PCR shows that human monocytes/macrophages expressed high levels of PEPT2 but negligible PEPT1 and also expressed the other two family members SLC15A3 and SLC15A4 (Fig. 3c). The close homology with Yin, along with its high expression in human phagocytes, led us to reason that PEPT2 might be a candidate phagosome-associated MDP transporter in human cells. To test whether PEPT2 could transport MDP, we next expressed PEPT2 along with NOD2 and a NF-κB reporter in mammalian HEK293T cells. Similar to Yin, co-transfection of PEPT2 with NOD2 greatly increased the sensitivity of HEK293T NF-kB reporter cells to exogenous MDP (Fig. 4a). Importantly, PEPT2 was as efficient at increasing the sensitivity of HEK cells to MDP as PEPT1, a bona fide MDP transporter expressed by colonic epithelial cells (28Vavricka S.R. Musch M.W. Chang J.E. Nakagawa Y. Phanvijhitsiri K. Waypa T.S. Merlin D. Schneewind O. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1401-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, the more distantly related transporter, SLC15A3, weakly modified NOD2 activation in the same system (Fig. 4b). Thus, similar to PEPT1 and Yin, PEPT2 is also a MDP transporter. SLC15A transporters symport di- and tripeptides with H+ using energy provided by the proton gradient. In vivo, the proton gradients across epithelial cells are maintained by the existence of tight junctions between the cells in monolayers such as the gut. Our observed role for PEPT2 in transporting MDP in nonpolarized, nonconfluent HEK293T cells suggested that an adequate proton gradient for PEPT2 to function could be achieved in the absence of monolayer formation. Recent reports indicate that MDP enters HEK293T cells through the endocytic pathway) (30Lee J. Tattoli I. Wojtal K.A. Vavricka S.R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Marina-García N. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. Hu Y. Smith D.E. Boons G.J. Núñez G. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and it is possible that in nonconfluent HEK293T cells, acidification of the endolysosomal compartment might be sufficient to provide the energy for MDP transport by PEPT2. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether modifying vesicular acidification in HEK293T cells could perturb PEPT2-dependent activation of NOD2 by MDP. In PEPT2-expressing cells, NOD2-dependent NFkB activation by MDP was blocked with NH4Cl (a weak base) (Fig. 5a) and Baflomycin A, a specific vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor (Fig. 5b), both of which neutralize the endolysosomal pH. These results indicate that the vacuolar proton concentration, established by the vacuolar-ATPase, facilitates PEPT2-mediated transport of MDP out of vesicles such as endosomes or phagosomes to activate NOD2 in the cytosol. As Drosophila Yin was identified because of its association with phagosomes, we next tested whether PEPT2 also associated with these organelles and thus might locally deliver NOD2 ligands to their receptor. To test this, GFP-PEPT2 was expressed in HEK293T cells and localization determined after phagocytosis. GFP-PEPT2 could be found localized not only to the plasma membrane but also enriched on phagosome membranes (Fig. 6a). Using an anti-PEPT2 antibody, we next determined the localization of endogenous PEPT2 in the human THP1 monocyte-derived cell line during phagocytosis (Fig. 6b). Similar to the localization of GFP-PEPT2 in HEK293T cells, PEPT2 was found associated with the plasma membrane in resting macrophages and also enriched in phagocytic cups and phagosomes after particle internalization. Thus, the high levels of PEPT2 expression in human macrophages, the ability of PEPT2 to increase NOD2 response, and its association with phagosome membranes suggest this as a likely phagosome-associated MDP transporter in human phagocytes. NOD2 is a cytosolic sensor and thus does not readily access extracellular bacteria. For this reason, a number of studies have focused on identifying the mechanism by which NOD2 ligands access the cytosol. Because of the association of NOD2 mutations and gastrointestinal inflammation, these studies have been performed primarily in epithelial cells of the colon or kidney. The consensus is that both NOD1 and NOD2 ligands enter these epithelial cells by endocytosis (30Lee J. Tattoli I. Wojtal K.A. Vavricka S.R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Marina-García N. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. Miller D. McDonald C. Boons G.J. Núñez G. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Additionally, these studies have converged on a family of SLC15A transporters as potential mechanisms to translocate NOD1 and NOD2 ligands across membranes; PEPT1 has been shown to transport MDP across the plasma membrane of colonic epithelial cells to activate cytosolic NOD2, whereas SLC15A4 has been implicated in transport of NOD1 ligands (28Vavricka S.R. Musch M.W. Chang J.E. Nakagawa Y. Phanvijhitsiri K. Waypa T.S. Merlin D. Schneewind O. Chang E.B. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 1401-1409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Ismair M.G. Vavricka S.R. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Fried M. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Girardin S.E.

Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, studies of NLR ligand transport using nonepithelial cells have been limited. One study addressing this in macrophages has shown that NOD2-dependent signaling is unimpaired in PEPT1 deficient macrophages, suggesting that this is not an important transporter in these cells (31Marina-García N. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. Hu Y. Smith D.E. Boons G.J. Núñez G. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Pannexin-1, a P2X7-interacting hemichannel, has been shown to be an NLR ligand transporter in macrophages and required for MDP to trigger NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion (32Marina-García N. Franchi L. Kim Y.G. Miller D. McDonald C. Boons G.J. Núñez G. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 4050-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33Kanneganti T.D. Lamkanfi M. Kim Y.G. Chen G. Park J.H. Franchi L. Vandenabeele P. Núñez G. Immunity. 2007; 26: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, pannexin-1 does not transport MDP for activation of NFkB by NOD2. Thus, although it has been shown that purified MDP is endocytosed by macrophages or that NOD2 ligands can be derived from bacteria in the phagolysosome (8Herskovits A.A. Auerbuch V. Portnoy D.A. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the mechanisms of membrane translocation of MDP in professional phagocytes remains to be fully defined. Here, we identify Yin and PEPT2 as evolutionarily conserved transporters of MDP. Importantly, these transporters are highly expressed by professional phagocytes, where they are recruited to phagosomes. These observations lead us to suggest that Yin and PEPT2 may be of particular importance in transporting ligands derived from internalized bacteria to activate the cytosolic sensors recruited to the vicinity of the phagosome. The study of these transporters in different organisms has been informative. We originally identified PEPT2 as a candidate MDP transporter using proteomic data derived from phagosomes isolated from Drosophila cells. The organelles expressed a number of transporters, including Yin, whose closest mammalian homolog is PEPT2. The functional ability of Yin to transport MDP is notable as flies do not have NOD-like receptors nor do they respond to MDP. However, tracheal cytotoxin, a molecule structurally related to MDP has been shown to be a ligand for peptidoglycan recognition protein-LE, a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor in flies (34Kaneko T. Yano T. Aggarwal K. Lim J.H. Ueda K. Oshima Y. Peach C. Erturk-Hasdemir D. Goldman W.E. Oh B.H. Kurata S. Silverman N. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to see whether Yin plays a role in transporting tracheal cytotoxin to activate peptidoglycan recognition protein-LE in a manner analogous to the role we propose for PEPT2 in NOD2 activation in human cells. Additionally, our work studying these transporters in mouse macrophages is also of interest. Despite being sensitive to MDP, we were unable to detect significant levels of either Pept1 or Pept2 in both J774 and elicited peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). These data indicate that mouse phagocytes may use different mechanisms of MDP transport from humans. Of note, these cells did express Slc15a3 and a4, and it is possible that these or other transporters are also able to function as phagosome-associated MDP transporters and partially compensate for the lack of Pept2 in these cells. Intriguingly, when considered with the Drosophila data, these observations suggest that mice have selectively lost expression of this transporter in phagocytes. It is tempting to speculate that the lack of Pept2 might decrease the efficiency of MDP translocation in mouse macrophages and contribute to the relative resistance of these animals to septic shock (35Warren H.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2009; 86: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), thus providing them with a survival advantage during certain infectious challenges. Consistent with redundancy of these transport mechanisms, our gain-of-function experiments clearly show a role of PEPT2 in NOD2 ligand delivery in human cells, whereas our loss of function RNA interference experiments, in which we have attempted to silence PEPT2, have been inconclusive (data not shown). PEPT2 is not the only member of the SLC15 transporter family expressed by phagocytes, and the observed redundancy is most likely due to compensation by other SLC15A transporters. We find that although PEPT1 is expressed only at very low levels it may nonetheless be sufficient to compensate and transport MDP in the absence of PEPT2. Macrophages also express SLC15A3 and A4. However, ectopic expression of SLC15A3 did not increase sensitivity of HEK293T cells to the NOD2 ligand in our system. Although we have not formally tested the role of SLC15A4 in MDP transport, work by Lee et al. (30Lee J. Tattoli I. Wojtal K.A. Vavricka S.R. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23818-23829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) has shown that SLC15A4 is a transporter for NOD1 ligands such as M-Tri-DAP but does not have a clear role in transport of MDP. Therefore, it is not clear which of the SLC15A transporters may be compensating for PEPT2 in macrophages. SLC15A transporters have broad substrate specificity for di- and tripeptides and can transport a variety of molecules with varying efficiency. This pleiotropism raises the question of whether PEPT2 functions only to transport MDP or might have additional roles in transport of other innate immune agonists. Work by Swaan et al. (36Swaan P.W. Bensman T. Bahadduri P.M. Hall M.W. Sarkar A. Bao S. Khantwal C.M. Ekins S. Knoell D.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 39: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) compared the relative efficiency of PEPT2 in transport of γ-iE-DAP and MDP and showed that γ-iE-DAP was a better substrate for ectopically expressed PEPT2 in CHO-K1 cells than MDP. Because of our focus on NOD2 we have not tested the role of PEPT2 in transport of γ-iE-DAP but, considering these observations, it is likely that this transporter may also transports NOD1 ligands from the phagosome. In summary, we identify here Drosophila Yin and human PEPT2 as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the transport of MDP into the cytosol of professional phagocytes, where it is recognized by NOD2. PEPT2 transport is pH-dependent and hence is likely to rely on proton gradients generated either in the endolysosomal compartment or during maturation of phagosomes. Importantly, we show that along with NOD2, PEPT2 is enriched around phagosomes. Our results emphasize the importance of considering not only the affinity of the transporters for their substrates but also the patterns of gene expression and the subcellular localization of these proteins when trying to understand how SLC15A transporters function to translocate NOD ligands into cells. The delivery of NOD ligands appears to be mediated by dedicated transporters such as PEPT2, which, therefore, represent potential therapeutic targets to decrease the detrimental effects of MDP and other agonistic fragments derived from bacteria during septic shock. These data indicate that the phagosome compartmentalizes liberation of ligands with the delivery to signaling receptors recruited to the vicinity of the organelle. Moreover, these data show that most of the machinery required for optimal microbial sensing of S. aureus is recruited to the vicinity of this highly hydrolytic organelle, greatly increasing the efficiency of signaling after bacterial internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2045780278,"S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is an important methyl group donor that plays a central role in many essential biochemical processes. The parasite Leishmania can both synthesize and transport AdoMet. Leishmania cells resistant to the antifolate methotrexate due to a rearrangement in folate biopterin transporter (FBT) genes were cross-resistant to sinefungin, an AdoMet analogue. FBT gene rearrangements were also observed in Leishmania major cells selected for sinefungin resistance. One of the rearranged FBT genes corresponded to the main AdoMet transporter (AdoMetT1) of Leishmania as determined by gene transfection and gene inactivation experiments. AdoMetT1 was determined to be a high affinity plasma membrane transporter expressed constitutively throughout the growth phases of the parasite. Leishmania cells selected for resistance or naturally insensitive to sinefungin had lower expression of AdoMetT1. A new function in one carbon metabolism, also a pathway of interest for chemotherapeutic interventions, is described for a novel class of membrane proteins found in diverse organisms."

In contrast to PrP monomers and fibrils, these oligomers activate the classical complement pathway, the smallest species containing 8–15 PrP protomers being the most efficient. We used Thioflavine T fluorescence to monitor PrP aggregation and showed that, when added to the reaction, C1q has a cooperative effect on PrP aggregation and leads to the formation of C1q-PrP complexes. In these complexes, C1q interacts through its globular domains preferentially with the smallest oligomers, as shown by electron microscopy, and retains the ability to activate the classical complement pathway. Using two cell lines, we also provide evidence that C1q inhibits the cytotoxicity induced by the smallest PrP oligomers. The cooperative interaction between C1q and PrP could represent an early step in the disease, where it prevents elimination of the prion seed, leading to further aggregation. A growing number of studies have investigated the interaction between C1q and PrP, but the oligomeric form of PrP involved in this interaction remains to be determined.

IntroductionPrion diseases represent a group of singular transmissible neurodegenerative disorders that affect mammals and occur when the cellular prion protein (PrPc) 2The abbreviations used are: PrPccellular prion proteinPrPScscrapie prion proteinCLFcollagen-like fragmentSECsize-exclusion chromatographyThTthioflavin TGHglobular heads of C1qELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayMALLSmulti-angle laser light scattering. is converted into an abnormal aggregated isoform called PrPSc (1Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). The host PrPc is an α-helix-rich 30–35-kDa glycoprotein expressed mainly in neuronal tissues in humans and other animals (2Bailly Y. Haeberlé A.M. Blanquet-Grossard F. Chasserot-Golaz S. Grant N. Schulze T. Bombarde G. Grassi J. Cesbron J.Y. Lemaire-Vieille C. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 473: 244-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Its expression and membrane attachment through a glycosylphosphatidyl anchor are crucial for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy susceptibility (3Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The widely supported protein-only hypothesis stipulates that the infectious agent can replicate by converting the natively folded prion protein (PrPc). During the disease, changes occur in the secondary and tertiary structure of PrPc, resulting in an increased content of the β-sheet, which leads to the formation of aggregates that display a dramatic shift in their physicochemical properties compared with those of the original protein (4Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). These β-sheet-rich aggregates are resistant to degradation by proteases and tend to form oligomers that can further assemble into amyloid fibrils. Recent investigations support the hypothesis that in protein misfolding and aggregation pathologies like Alzheimer disease, smaller subfibrillar particles may be much more pathological than larger amyloid fibrils or plaques (5Caughey B. Baron G.S. Chesebro B. Jeffrey M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In line with this hypothesis, Silveira and colleagues have reported that the smallest aggregate able to initiate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies pathology is equivalent to ∼14–28 PrP molecules (6Silveira J.R. Raymond G.J. Hughson A.G. Race R.E. Sim V.L. Hayes S.F. Caughey B. Nature. 2005; 437: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In the past, several in vitro recombinant models have been used to investigate the biochemical and biophysical properties of such oligomeric intermediates (7Jain S. Udgaonkar J.B. J. Mol.

These include microorganisms, immune complexes, apoptotic and necrotic cells and their breakdown products, and amyloids. C1q binding to amyloid fibrils found as extracellular deposits in tissues, and subsequent complement activation are involved in the pathology of several amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (11Velazquez P. Cribbs D.H. Poulos T.L. Tenner A.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).C1q is also expressed in the developing and adult nervous system. The efficient and selective removal of apoptotic cells is an important feature of tissue development, homeostasis, and pathology. In the nervous system, synapses and distal axons are selectively eliminated as part of the remodeling that underpins development and pathology through a process that has some features in common with apoptotic cell removal (12Boulanger L.M.

Recent evidence suggests that the complement components C1q have a role in the selective tagging of supernumerary synapses in the developing visual system and in their efficient removal by as yet unidentified cells (14Fourgeaud L.

A recent time course transcriptomic and phenotypic study of mouse prion diseases has shown that the three genes coding for C1q are among the top 10 genes up-regulated in the brain (18Gehlenborg N.

Cesbron J.Y. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 2870-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we have characterized the interaction between C1q and several oligomeric PrP species formed in vitro. Our data indicated that this interaction occurs through the globular heads of C1q and only occurs when PrP is converted into β-sheet-rich oligomers. Moreover, this interaction has biological relevance, as it triggers activation of the classical pathway of complement. However, the size of the oligomer, which was the most efficient in complement activation, was unresolved.In the present work, we identified small sized oligomers as the preferential partners for C1q. These are composed of 8–15 PrP molecules and display the highest complement activation potential. Also, for the first time, we show that C1q can participate to the aggregation of PrP leading to the formation of a complex able to promote complement activation. This outlines a novel role for C1q in prion disease, as a cooperative partner in the PrP aggregation process. We assessed the cytotoxicity potential of PrP oligomers of several sizes using two cell culture models and found that the smaller oligomers trigger cell death. Interestingly, this effect is inhibited through formation of C1q-PrP complexes.CONCLUSIONOur findings support the notion that the C1q-PrP interaction could have a broader biological significance in addition to complement activation. Small cytotoxic oligomers such as type II oligomers are transient, thermodynamically unstable species and thus are unable to enter the fibrillization pathway (34Eghiaian F. Daubenfeld T. Quenet Y. van Audenhaege M. Bouin A.P. van der Rest G. Grosclaude J. Rezaei H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7414-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). C1q could act as a stabilizer of these species, allowing them to interact with each other to form larger non cytotoxic aggregates. C1q has a broad range of ligands, including non-self-pathogenic motifs and altered self-structures. It is mostly found in serum and is largely expressed by neurons where its role is not fully established. The cooperative interaction between C1q and PrP could represent an early step in the disease where it prevents elimination of the prion seed, leading to further aggregation. It would also be of interest to verify whether our findings on the prion protein could be extended to other oligomers formed by amyloidogenic proteins (42Sörgjerd K. Klingstedt T. Lindgren M.

Our data indicated that this interaction occurs through the globular heads of C1q and only occurs when PrP is converted into β-sheet-rich oligomers. Moreover, this interaction has biological relevance, as it triggers activation of the classical pathway of complement. However, the size of the oligomer, which was the most efficient in complement activation, was unresolved. In the present work, we identified small sized oligomers as the preferential partners for C1q. These are composed of 8–15 PrP molecules and display the highest complement activation potential. Also, for the first time, we show that C1q can participate to the aggregation of PrP leading to the formation of a complex able to promote complement activation. This outlines a novel role for C1q in prion disease, as a cooperative partner in the PrP aggregation process. We assessed the cytotoxicity potential of PrP oligomers of several sizes using two cell culture models and found that the smaller oligomers trigger cell death. Interestingly, this effect is inhibited through formation of C1q-PrP complexes. CONCLUSIONOur findings support the notion that the C1q-PrP interaction could have a broader biological significance in addition to complement activation. Small cytotoxic oligomers such as type II oligomers are transient, thermodynamically unstable species and thus are unable to enter the fibrillization pathway (34Eghiaian F. Daubenfeld T.

C1q could act as a stabilizer of these species, allowing them to interact with each other to form larger non cytotoxic aggregates. C1q has a broad range of ligands, including non-self-pathogenic motifs and altered self-structures. It is mostly found in serum and is largely expressed by neurons where its role is not fully established. The cooperative interaction between C1q and PrP could represent an early step in the disease where it prevents elimination of the prion seed, leading to further aggregation.

Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a crucial molecule in the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative disorders. We report here that VCP was specifically modified in neuronal cells with abnormal protein accumulation; this modification caused the translocation of VCP into the nucleus. Modification-mimic forms of VCP induced transcriptional suppression with deacetylation of core histones, leading to cell atrophy and the decrease of de novo protein synthesis. Preventing VCP nuclear translocation in polyglutamine-expressing neuronal cells and Drosophila eyes mitigated neurite retraction and eye degenerations, respectively, concomitant with the recovery of core histone acetylation. This represents a novel feedback mechanism that regulates abnormal protein levels in the cytoplasm during physiological processes, as well as in pathological conditions such as abnormal protein accumulation in neurodegenerations.

IntroductionHomeostasis is a fundamental property of organisms and cells that allows them to remain healthy in the face of changes in the environment. Feedback mechanisms are the core machinery for maintaining homeostasis. One example of feedback mechanism is end-product inhibition in enzyme reactions, and another is unfolded protein response (UPR) 2The abbreviations used are: UPRunfolded protein responseVCPvalosin-containing proteinERendoplasmic reticulumADAlzheimer diseasePDParkinson diseaseALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisHDHuntington diseaseMJDMachado-Joseph diseaseSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaDLBdementia with Lewy bodiesTDPTAR DNA-binding proteinHAThistone acetyltransferaseAAAATPase associated with various cellular activitiesERADER-associated degradationSODsuperoxide dismutaseIBMPFDinclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementiaGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLC/MS/MSliquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometryNLSnuclear localization signalNESnuclear exclusion signalNInuclear inclusionEFelongation factorHAhemagglutininCMVcytomegalovirus. in ER (1Kaufman R.J.

Although there have been a number of studies of the elegant feedback mechanisms employed for ER quality control, it is currently unknown whether similar mechanisms exist to reduce the cytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. polyglutamine diseases, AD, PD, and ALS) share pathological features such as accumulation of abnormal proteins, neural cell atrophy, or degeneration, and neuronal cell death (4Kakizuka A.

Indeed polyglutamine expansions have been identified in aggregated proteins in nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including HD and MJD (also called SCA3), α-synuclein in PD, DLB, and multisystem atrophy, and TDP-43 in certain types of front-temporal dementia, PD without Lewy bodies, and ALS (4Kakizuka A.

Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar).Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is often accompanied by histone modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation (14Hassig C.A.

Among these, acetylation of core histones (such as H3 and H4) reflects the open chromatin configuration that allows the transcriptional machinery to easily access target genes and thus promote transcription (14Hassig C.A.

Several groups have reported that polyglutamine aggregates suppress cellular functions at the transcription level, and that this suppression is accompanied by decreased acetylation of core histones. It has been argued that sequestration of major HATs (e.g. CBP, PCAF, and TAFII130) underlies this transcriptional suppression (12Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S.

It is notable that decreased acetylation of core histones and transcriptional dysregulation has been observed not only in polyglutamine disease models, but also in PD, ALS, and AD models (20Rouaux C.

Unlike polyglutamine disease models, sequestration of transcription factors has not been observed in the PD, ALS, and AD disease models, suggesting that an as-yet unknown mechanism may underlie transcriptional dysregulation in these disorders.Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a member of the AAA protein family. VCP has been proposed to function in a variety of physiological processes such as cell cycle regulation, membrane fusion, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (23Whiteheart S.W. Matveeva E.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Braun R.J. Zischka H. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, VCP has been shown to colocalize not only with polyglutamine aggregates, but also with Lewy bodies in PD and DLB, SOD1 aggregates in ALS, and dystrophic neurites in AD (25Hirabayashi M.

Several lines of evidence have shown that VCP can mediate both aggregate formation and clearance, which is reminiscent of yeast Hsp104, another AAA protein (see references in 29Kobayashi T. Manno A.

In addition, by genetic screening using Drosophila models of polyglutamine disease, we identified ter94, the Drosophila homolog of VCP, as a genetic modifier of eye degeneration phenotypes induced by expanded polyglutamine tracts (30Higashiyama H.

Although it is now known that VCP is critically involved in the pathogenesis of several types of human disorders, including neurodegeneration, the detailed molecular mechanisms mediated by VCP in neurodegenerative disorders remain to be elucidated.DISCUSSIONSeveral reports have shown that expanded polyglutamine expression decreases the acetylation of core histones such as H3 and H4 (12Shimohata T.

Genet. 2003; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We first confirmed this observation in our cell culture model of polyglutamine disease (40Yasuda S. Inoue K. Hirabayashi M. Higashiyama H. Yamamoto Y. Fuyuhiro H. Komure O. Tanaka F. Sobue G. Tsuchiya K. Hamada K. Sasaki H. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Kakizuka A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, the experiments presented here using anti-acetylated H3 (for acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14) and H4 (for acetylated Lys-5) antibodies clearly demonstrate a Q79-dependent decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation. In our mouse model of polyglutamine disease (Q64 mice), clear decreases in H4 acetylation were also observed. Addition of butyrate, an inhibitor of HDAC, dramatically recovered or even enhanced the acetylated levels of histones H3 and H4 in PC12 cells, so that cells with or without expanded polyglutamine expression indistinguishable. These observations fit well with the idea that expanded polyglutamine tracts contribute to enhancement of histone deacetylation rather than to diminishment of histone acetylation.Sequestration of major transcription factors such as CBP within polyglutamine aggregates has been proposed to be the main mechanism underlying transcriptional suppression in aggregate-containing cells (17Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A.

Cell. 2004; 15: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Because these transcription factors, either by themselves or by physical interactions, contribute to HAT activation, this putative mechanism would lead to a diminishment of histone acetylation rather than to an enhancement of histone deacetylation, and was in direct contrast with our observations. Furthermore, irrespective of the intracellular localization of polyglutamine aggregates, we observed clear decreases in the acetylated levels of histones H3 and H4. More surprisingly, NES-tagged Q79 could induce stronger histone deacetylation than could NLS-tagged Q79. These observations strongly suggest the existence of a mechanism other than sequestration of transcription factors, in which expanded polyglutamine expression, even in the cytoplasm, leads to H3 and H4 deacetylation, probably via HDAC activation.In cells expressing expanded polyglutamines, three sequential amino acids in VCP, Ser-612, Thr-613, and Lys-614, were modified by phosphorylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation, respectively. We then examined the biological significance of these modifications by creating and expressing several modification-mimic forms of VCPs, such as VCP(DEQ) and VCP(DEK), in PC12 cells. We also created several control substitutions with alanine, e.g. VCP(DEA) and VCP (AAA). Although these substitutions may not perfectly represent modified or non-modified protein configurations, this method has been well-used in elucidating biological functions of the modified or non-modified proteins, respectively, such as kinases, kinase substrates, tubulin, histones etc (45Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 46Gaertig J. Wloga D. Curr. Top. Dev.

In contrast, in more than 60% of transfected cells, exogenously expressed VCP(DEQ) was translocated to the nucleus, followed by VCP(DEA)(∼50%) and VCP(DEK)(∼25%). In accordance with this, FLAG-tagged VCP(DEQ), but not wtVCP, could co-precipitate endogenous importins (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that sequential modifications of Ser-612, Thr-613, and Lys-614 were responsible for the nuclear translocation of VCP. Unexpectedly, these modifications also induced neurite retraction and shrinkage in PC12 cells (∼30% of cells), which was also observed in PC12 cells expressing expanded polyglutamine tracts. This atrophic phenotype was not induced by forced expression of NLS-tagged wtVCP in the nucleus or by forced expression of NES-tagged VCP(DEQ) in the cytoplasm. In agreement with these results, forced expression of NLS-tagged VCP(DEQ) in the nucleus further increased the atrophic phenotype in cells (∼60% of cells).The above characteristics of VCP suggest that it might be a mediator of histone deacetylation in response to expanded polyglutamines. Indeed, expression of VCP(DEQ), but not wtVCP or VCP(AAA), induced deacetylation of H3 and H4. More importantly, in mammalian cells NES-wtVCP and NES-VCP(AAA), but not VCP(AAA), inhibited the nuclear translocation of endogenous VCP in cells expressing expanded polyglutamines, and thus could block expanded polyglutamine-induced deacetylation of H3 and H4, as well as the atrophic phenotype. In Drosophila, however, wtVCP but not ter94 could prevent ter94 nuclear translocation in a way similar to NES-wtVCP or NES-VCP(AAA) in mammalian cells. Since VCP forms hexameric structure, the observed three sequential modifications of VCP in mammalian cells would not occur so frequently. However, once such modifications occur even in a single or double protomers, the VCP hexamer may be transported into the nucleus. Thus, VCP(AAA) could not suppress the nuclear translocation of the VCP hexamer. In Drosophila cells, however, the presence of the unmodified mammalian VCP in the ter94 hexamer did prevent the nuclear translocation of the hexamer even in the presence of polyglutamine aggregates. This might be due to the creation of certain conformations unfavorable for the nuclear translocation of the hexamer by the incorporation of unmodified mammalian VCP. This idea remains to be clarified. In contrast, expression of VCP(DEQ) itself in fly eyes induced eye degenerations, with decreased core histone acetylations. These results demonstrate that VCP is indeed a major mediator of histone deacetylation, as well as a major molecule causative for the atrophic phenotype or eye degenerations in cells expressing expanded polyglutamines. In our mouse model of polyglutamine disease (Q64C mouse), Purkinje cells with nuclear polyglutamine aggregates clearly showed nuclear VCP localization and decrease of acetylation of histone H4. Recently, Reina et al. demonstrated that MJD protein/ataxin 3 translocated into the nucleus immediately after the heat shock. In this condition, VCP appeared to stay in the cytoplasm (48Reina C.P. Zhong X. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It would also be interesting to see whether histone deacetylation could be observed after the heat shock.Until now, at least 14 different VCP mutants have been reported to cause IBMPFD. The mutated amino acids include R93C, R95C R95G, R155C, R155H, R155P, G157R, R159H, R159C, R191Q, L198W, A232E, T262A, and N387H (35Watts G.D. Wymer J. Kovach M.J. Mehta S.G. Mumm S. Darvish D.

Since alanine substitution cannot mimick phosphorylation, all these mutations are not able to be mimicked by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylations or acetylations. It is notable that all mutations relatively reside at N-terminal portion of VCP. Indeed, these mutant VCPs not only showed enhanced binding abilities to VCP cofactors (e.g. Ufd1 and Npl4) and ubiquitinated proteins, but also showed enhanced aggregate-forming activities (Refs. 28Kakizuka A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 49Ju J.S. Miller S.E. Hanson P.I. Weihl C.C. J. Biol.

Regarding with these characteristics, we could not observe clear difference between wild-type VCP and VCP(DEQ). 4K. Yasuda and A. Kakizuka, unpublished observations. Thus, VCP(DEQ) did not appear to be involved in aggregate formation more positively than wild-type VCP or IBMPFD-causing VCPs.Treatment of cells expressing expanded polyglutamine or VCP(DEQ) by butyrate did result in a recovery from the H3 and H4 deacetylated state to highly acetylated states. However, this treatment only marginally increased transcription from the CMV promoter and several other promoters, such as the EF-1α promoter. These results clearly indicate that the observed transcriptional suppression was mostly mediated by as-yet unknown HDAC inhibitor-insensitive mechanisms.Based on the results of this study, we propose a novel feedback mechanism linking the accumulation of cytoplasmic misfolded proteins and transcriptional suppression, in which VCP performs an essential role. Intracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins such as expanded polyglutamines induces VCP modification at Ser-612, Thr-613, and Lys-614, which allows VCP to translocate to the nucleus. Following nuclear VCP translocation, general transcription is suppressed by as-yet unknown mechanisms, resulting in the inhibition of de novo protein synthesis. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the production of new misfolded proteins, and thus allows to cells to dissolve or degrade the accumulated misfolded proteins by cellular mechanisms such as chaperones, proteasomes, and autophagies. This mechanism would work well when misfolded protein accumulation is transient. However, when misfolded proteins are continuously provided, as in the case of neurodegenerative disorders, inhibition of de novo protein synthesis continues for many years or even decades, leading to a gradual decrease in cell mass or shrinkage of affected neurons. Indeed, overexpression of VCP(DEQ) in fly eyes could induce late-onset rough-eye phenotypes. This VCP-mediated feedback mechanism may be a common mechanism underlying neurodegenerative disorders in which there is an intracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins such as polyglutamines, α-synuclein etc. IntroductionHomeostasis is a fundamental property of organisms and cells that allows them to remain healthy in the face of changes in the environment. Feedback mechanisms are the core machinery for maintaining homeostasis. One example of feedback mechanism is end-product inhibition in enzyme reactions, and another is unfolded protein response (UPR) 2The abbreviations used are: UPRunfolded protein responseVCPvalosin-containing proteinERendoplasmic reticulumADAlzheimer diseasePDParkinson diseaseALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosisHDHuntington diseaseMJDMachado-Joseph diseaseSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaDLBdementia with Lewy bodiesTDPTAR DNA-binding proteinHAThistone acetyltransferaseAAAATPase associated with various cellular activitiesERADER-associated degradationSODsuperoxide dismutaseIBMPFDinclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementiaGFPgreen fluorescent proteinLC/MS/MSliquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometryNLSnuclear localization signalNESnuclear exclusion signalNInuclear inclusionEFelongation factorHAhemagglutininCMVcytomegalovirus. in ER (1Kaufman R.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The goal of UPR is to reduce the amount of accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER (3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4770) Google Scholar). Although there have been a number of studies of the elegant feedback mechanisms employed for ER quality control, it is currently unknown whether similar mechanisms exist to reduce the cytoplasmic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. polyglutamine diseases, AD, PD, and ALS) share pathological features such as accumulation of abnormal proteins, neural cell atrophy, or degeneration, and neuronal cell death (4Kakizuka A.

Genome Res. 2003; 100: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that common molecular mechanisms underlie these disorders. Indeed polyglutamine expansions have been identified in aggregated proteins in nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including HD and MJD (also called SCA3), α-synuclein in PD, DLB, and multisystem atrophy, and TDP-43 in certain types of front-temporal dementia, PD without Lewy bodies, and ALS (4Kakizuka A.

Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar).Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is often accompanied by histone modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation (14Hassig C.A.

Among these, acetylation of core histones (such as H3 and H4) reflects the open chromatin configuration that allows the transcriptional machinery to easily access target genes and thus promote transcription (14Hassig C.A.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that polyglutamine aggregates suppress cellular functions at the transcription level, and that this suppression is accompanied by decreased acetylation of core histones. It has been argued that sequestration of major HATs (e.g. CBP, PCAF, and TAFII130) underlies this transcriptional suppression (12Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S.

It is notable that decreased acetylation of core histones and transcriptional dysregulation has been observed not only in polyglutamine disease models, but also in PD, ALS, and AD models (20Rouaux C.

Unlike polyglutamine disease models, sequestration of transcription factors has not been observed in the PD, ALS, and AD disease models, suggesting that an as-yet unknown mechanism may underlie transcriptional dysregulation in these disorders.Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a member of the AAA protein family. VCP has been proposed to function in a variety of physiological processes such as cell cycle regulation, membrane fusion, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (23Whiteheart S.W. Matveeva E.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Braun R.J. Zischka H. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, VCP has been shown to colocalize not only with polyglutamine aggregates, but also with Lewy bodies in PD and DLB, SOD1 aggregates in ALS, and dystrophic neurites in AD (25Hirabayashi M.

https://openalex.org/W2052335522,"D-galactan I is a polysaccharide with the disaccharide repeat unit structure [-->3-beta-D-Galf-(1-->3)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->]. This glycan represents the lipopolysaccharide O antigen found in many Gram-negative bacteria, including several Klebsiella pneumoniae O serotypes. The polysaccharide is synthesized in the cytoplasm prior to its export via an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Sequence analysis predicts three galactosyltransferases in the D-galactan I genetic locus. They are WbbO (belonging to glycosyltransferase (GT) family 4), WbbM (GT-family 8), and WbbN (GT-family 2). The WbbO and WbbM proteins are each predicted to contain two domains, with the GT modules located toward their C termini. The N-terminal domains of WbbO and WbbM exhibit no similarity to proteins with known function. In vivo complementation assays suggest that all three glycosyltransferases are required for D-galactan I biosynthesis. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system and confirmatory co-purification strategies, evidence is provided for protein-protein interactions among the glycosyltransferases, creating a membrane-located enzyme complex dedicated to d-galactan I biosynthesis."

Although partial crystal structures of human immunodeficiency virus IN alone and its complex with the integrase binding domain of the host factor PSIP1/lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 are available, many questions remain regarding the properties and structures of LEDGF-bound IN oligomers. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, multiangle light scattering, and small angle x-ray scattering, we have established the oligomeric state, stoichiometry, and molecular shapes of IN.LEDGF complexes in solution. Analyses of intact IN tetramers bound to two different LEDGF truncations allow for placement of the integrase binding domain by difference analysis. Modeling of the small angle x-ray scattering envelopes using existing structural data suggests domain arrangements in the IN oligomers that support and extend existing biochemical data for IN.LEDGF complexes and lend new insights into the quaternary structure of LEDGF-bound IN tetramers. These IN oligomers may be involved in stages of the viral life cycle other than integration, including assembly, budding, and early replication."

This work reports the solution structure of a Cdc42 binding module of Bem1 comprising the second SH3 domain (SH3b) and its C-terminal flanking region termed Cdc42 interacting (CI). First, the structure of Bem1 SH3b-CI was determined by NMR spectroscopy, which shows that Bem1 SH3b-CI is a structurally and functionally related domain that binds Cdc42. Next, the solution structure of Bem1 SH3b-CI in complex with the proline-rich region of p21-activated kinase Ste20 (Ste20 PRR) was determined. Finally, the interaction surface of Bem1 SH3b-CI with Cdc42 was identified based on chemical shift perturbation studies which reveals that Bem1 SH3b-CI interacts simultaneously with both Ste20 PRR and Cdc42 using the opposite surfaces. Thus, Bem1 can tether Cdc42 and Ste20 in close proximity so that Cdc42 can efficiently interact with Ste20 Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB).

It is well established that Bem1 interacts with Cdc24, Ste20, Cla4, and Cdc42, which facilitates efficient cell signaling (6Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H.

The Bem1 PB1 domain binds to the Cdc24 PB1 domain through electrostatic interaction (9Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F.

Biochem. 2009; 146: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As a disruption of this PB1-PB1 interaction leads to defects in budding and mating, the Bem1 PB1 domain is considered to be crucial for the cell polarity establishment (6Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The second SH3 domain (SH3b) of Bem1 interacts with the Ste20 proline-rich region (Ste20 PRR) and this interaction contributes to the localization of both Ste20 and Cdc42 in mating (7Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Cla4 proline-rich region (Cla4 PRR) was also reported to bind to SH3b in budding (8Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7176-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound form of Cdc42 was reported to bind Bem1 in vivo and in vitro (8Bose I. Irazoqui J.E. Moskow J.J. Bardes E.S. Zyla T.R. Lew D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7176-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Butty A.C. Perrinjaquet N. Petit A. Jaquenoud M. Segall J.E. Hofmann K. Zwahlen C. Peter M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1565-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, the Cdc42 binding region of Bem1 has been identified, that interacts directly with GTP-bound Cdc42 (7Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Endo M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This region is comprised of the second SH3 domain (SH3b), and its flanking C-terminal sequence, named CI (Cdc42 interacting) (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because SH3b alone was insoluble and CI alone did not interact with Cdc42, both regions appear to be required to form a stable structural and functional domain. Therefore, this Cdc42 binding region was designated as SH3b-CI (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Considering that the sequence of the CI region in Bem1 homologues is well conserved but exhibits no similarity to CRIB, SH3b-CI appears to be a novel Cdc42 binding module. Mutational studies using in vitro binding assays have verified that the N253D mutation in the CI moiety blocks Cdc42 binding, but it does not block the Ste20 PRR binding. Whereas the W192K mutation in the SH3b moiety inhibits the Ste20 PRR binding, it does not inhibit the Cdc42 binding, indicating that the binding surfaces of Bem1for Ste20 PRR and Cdc42 are distinct (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The biological role of the Bem1-Cdc42 interaction has been studied in vivo using Bem1 mutants; although Bem1 N253D exhibits slight mating defects around 50%, the W192K mutant is highly defective in mating (less than 5%), whereas the Bem1 W192K/N253D double mutant completely loses mating activity. These results indicate that to conduct efficient mating signaling, SH3b anchors Ste20 and Cdc42 in collaboration with CI (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the three-dimensional structures of Bem1 SH3b-CI and its complex with Ste20 PRR using NMR. The Bem1 SH3b-CI has a SH3 domain that has a canonical SH3 structure (22Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the CI region comprising of two α-helices and a flexible tail. Because a number of hydrophobic interactions between SH3b and CI are observed, it is possible to conclude that Bem1 SH3b and CI are structurally and functionally related to each other. In addition, the structure of the Bem1 SH3b-CI/Ste20 PRR complex and the chemical shift perturbation study of Bem1 SH3b-CI with Cdc42 showed that Bem1 SH3b-CI can bind both Ste20 PRR and Cdc42 simultaneously. These results provide insights into the signal transduction mechanism mediated by Bem1. The Bem1 SH3b-CI-(156–260) was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare), expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The GST tag was removed with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). Finally, Bem1 SH3b-CI was purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The Ste20 PRR (463–486) was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector and expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The Ste20 PRR was first purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and the GST tag was removed with PreScission protease. Finally, Ste20 PRR was purified by reverse phase chromatography on a Resource RPC column (GE Healthcare). For NMR samples, the purified 13C/15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI was concentrated to 0.3 mm in 20 mm MOPS buffer in 90% H2O/10% D2O with 150 mm NaCl at pH 6.5. In addition, the purified 13C/15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with unlabeled Ste20 PRR and 13C/15N-labeled Ste20 PRR complexed with unlabeled Bem1 SH3b-CI were prepared, and separately concentrated to 0.3 mm in 20 mm MOPS buffer in 90% H2O/10% D2O, with 150 mm NaCl at pH 6.5. All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on Unity Inova 800 and 600 spectrometers (Varian) each equipped with three radiofrequency channels and a triple resonance pulsed filed gradient probe. The 15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI was used for the steady state heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiments. The sequential assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N were carried out using the following spectra: HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HBHA(CO)NH, CCH-TOCSY, HC(C)H-TOCSY, HBCBCGCDHD, and HBCBCGCDCEHE (14Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Interproton distance information for structure calculations was obtained from 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra recorded with a 100 ms mixing time (14Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). These spectra were processed using the NMRPipe program (15Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu W. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11563) Google Scholar), and the data analysis was made using the Sparky program (16Kneller D.G. Goddard T.D. SPARKY. 3.105 Ed. University of California, San Francisco, CA1997Google Scholar). The NOE peak assignments and the structure calculations were made using the CYANA 2.1 program (17Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). The dihedral angle restraints were estimated by the TALOS program (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). A total of 100 structures were calculated by simulated annealing and the mean structure was obtained by averaging the coordinates of the 20 lowest CYANA energy structures. The overlay of the 20 lowest energy structures were generated using the MOLMOL program (19Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), and a ribbon diagram of the mean structure was generated using the PyMOL program. The Bem1 SH3b-CI and Cdc42 (1–179, Q61L) were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector and expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as GST fusion proteins. The 13C/15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI and unlabeled Cdc42 were first purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After these GST-fusion proteins were mixed and the GST tag was removed with PreScission protease, Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with Cdc42 was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare), and then Cdc42 was activated by loading GTPγS. Finally, the complex was purified by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). The purified 13C/15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with unlabeled Cdc42 was concentrated to 0.3 mm in 20 mm MOPS buffer in 90% H2O/10% D2O, with 150 mm NaCl at pH 6.5. The sequential assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N of Bem1 SH3b-CI were carried out as was described in NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbations in Bem1 SH3b-CI upon complex formation with Cdc42 were monitored in the HSQC spectra. Normalized chemical shift changes were calculated using the equation, Δδ = [(ΔδHN)2 + (ΔδN/5)2]1/2. The Bem1 SH3b-CI, Ste20 PRR, and Ste20 CRIB domain (328–375) were cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector and expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as GST fusion proteins. The Cdc42 (1–179, Q61L) were cloned into a modified pET-28a (Novagen) where the thrombin protease cleavage site was changed to the PreScission protease cleavage site and were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a His-tagged protein. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B and the His-tagged protein was purified using Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen). For in vitro pull down binding assays, the GST fusion and His-tagged proteins were mixed in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) or TBS containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After the glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or TBS containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100, bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluates were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or immunoblotting using anti-GST and anti-His antibodies. For the structure determination, we first expressed a construct of Bem1-(140–271) in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells as a GST fusion protein, which was originally reported as a Cdc42-binding region and has been named SH3b-CI (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, an HSQC spectrum showed that this construct was not suitable for the structure determination because of the presence of a highly disordered region (data not shown). Therefore, we prepared several constructs based on the sequence alignment of other SH3 domains and the secondary structure prediction. Here, Tyr-159 was found to be the N terminus of SH3b (data not shown) and Ala-251 was estimated to be the C terminus of CI from the secondary structure prediction using the PSIPRED program (23Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4465) Google Scholar). Consequently, we expressed a construct of Bem1-(156–260) in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells as a GST fusion protein. The HSQC spectrum of Bem1-(156–260) was highly dispersed, showing that this construct corresponds to a structural domain (Fig. 1A). Further, Bem1-(156–260) could interact with Cdc42 to an extent similar to Bem1-(140–271) in in vitro pull-down binding assays (Fig. 1B). We concluded that Bem1-(156–260) is a structurally and functionally related domain, and it is designated as SH3b-CI in the following. The assignments of 1H, 15N, and 13C nuclei in Bem1 SH3b-CI were made using a suite of NMR spectra as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solution structure of SH3b-CI was determined on the basis of 1553 distance and 95 dihedral angle restraints. A total of 100 structures were calculated, and the 20 lowest CYANA energy structures were selected (Table 1). The residues 158–196, 204–214, and 227–246, are well defined with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the mean structure of 0.40 Å for the backbone atoms as illustrated in Fig. 2A, while residues 156–157, 197–203, 215–226, and 247–260 in SH3b-CI were not well defined due to a lack of long range NOEs.TABLE 1Structural statistics of Bem1 SH3b-CINOE distance constraints1553Short range (intra-residue and sequential)823Medium range (2 ≤ i-j ≤ 4)249Long range (i-j > 4)481Structural coordinates rmsd (158–196, 204–214, 227–246) Backbone atoms0.40 Å All heavy atoms0.91 ÅRamachandran plot Most favored regions75.1% Additionally allowed regions24.3% Generously allowed regions0.7% Disallowed regions0.0% Open table in a new tab The solution structure of Bem1 SH3b-CI is comprised of two α-helices (αA:227–234, αB:239–246), one 310helix (209–211), and five β-strands (βA:160–162, βB:180–188, βC:192–195, βD:205–208, and βE:212–214) (Fig. 2B). The structure of the SH3b moiety is similar to those of the canonical SH3 domains (22Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), composed of five antiparallel β-strands and a single 310 helix. The CI moiety contains two α-helices, αA and αB, but has a flexible C-terminal tail (247–260) as can be deduced from the small or negative {1H}-15N heteronuclear steady-state NOEs (Fig. 2C), including Asn-253, an important residue for Cdc42 binding (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The flexible C-terminal tail of the CI moiety appears to form an ordered structure only when Cdc42 binds Bem1. A number of interactions between SH3b and CI were observed, suggesting that SH3b-CI is a structural unit, and it is a novel Cdc42 binding domain. The interface between SH3b and CI, has an extensive hydrophobic core which is formed by Leu-158, Ile-184, His-187, His-188, Phe-193, and Ile-214 of SH3b together with Val-227, Asp-230, Ile-231, Val-234, Leu-236, Thr-238, and Val-239 of CI (Fig. 2D). These residues are conserved or type-conserved among Bem1 homologs implying that CI in Bem1 homologs also interacts with SH3b in a manner similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bem1 (Fig. 2E). This is consistent with the previous reports (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Endo M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that the SH3b domain alone in the Bem1 homologs was insoluble (data not shown), and Bem1 CI-(214–260) failed to interact with Cdc42, indicating that SH3b and CI are structurally and functionally related and synergistically bind Cdc42. In contrast, the linker between SH3 and CI were not assigned because of broadening, and were not defined in the structure. The assignment of 1H, 15N, and 13C nuclei in Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with Ste20 PRR-(463–486) was made using a suite of NMR spectra as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solution structure of the complex was determined on the basis of 1558 distance and 90 dihedral angle restraints. A total of 100 structures were calculated, and the 20 lowest CYANA energy structures were selected (Table 2). The residues 158–196, 204–214, and 227–246 had a r.m.s.d. from the mean structure of 0.48 Å for the backbone atoms, indicating that the backbone Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with Ste20 PRR is well defined, while residues 156–157, 197–203, 215–226, and 247–260 in Bem1 are not well defined due to a lack of long range NOEs as illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B. There are no appreciable backbone structure differences in Bem1 SH3b-CI between the free and complexed forms.TABLE 2Structural statistics of Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR complexNOE distance constraints1509Short range (intraresidue and sequential)821Medium range (2 ≤ i-j ≤ 4)214Long range (i-j > 4) 474(Intermolecular NOEs)(104)Structural coordinates rmsd (158–196, 204–214, 227–246) Backbone atoms0.46 Å All heavy atoms0.89 ÅRamachandran plot Most favored regions66.7% Additionally allowed regions32.0% Generously allowed regions1.4% Disallowed regions0.0% Open table in a new tab The detailed molecular interactions observed between Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR-(463–486) are shown in Fig. 3C. The 470–480 residues in Ste20 PRR were well defined, although the flanking residues 463–469 and 481–486 were disordered. In a manner similar to other SH3 domains, Arg-474 interacts with an acidic residue in the RT loop, and this interaction determines the ligand orientation as Class I (22Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ala-476—Pro-480 interact with the hydrophobic pockets formed by the conserved residues in Bem1 SH3b. The Pro-475–Pro-480 forms a PPII helix: the side-chains of Pro-475 and Lys-478 are exposed, whereas Ala-476, Pro-477, Pro-479, and Pro-480 fit into hydrophobic pockets of Bem1SH3b-CI. The Pro-479 and Pro-480 in PPII are surrounded by Tyr-164 and Phe-211, while Ala-476 and Pro-477 fit into the pocket lined with Phe-166, Trp-192, Pro-208, and Phe-211. These interactions between Bem1 and Ste20 PRR are very similar to those observed in the canonical SH3-PRR complex (22Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Ser-473 has no intermolecular NOEs with Bem1 SH3b-CI, Phe-470, Ile-471, and Pro-472 form a hydrophobic cluster together with His-188, Trp-192, Ile-194, Pro-204, and Leu-206 in the SH3b moiety and Val-239, Gln-240, and Lys-243 in the CI moiety. These results are consistent with the previous mutation study using the yeast two-hybrid assay (7Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), showing that the mutations of F470G, I471G, and P472A in Ste20 inhibit the binding between Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR, whereas the S473A mutation retains its binding activity. To identify the residues critical to the interaction between Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR in vitro, we performed pull-down binding assays (Fig. 3D). The I471A mutant was bound to Bem1 SH3b-CI but the F470A mutant completely lost binding affinity to Bem1 SH3b-CI, although the core PRR sequence of Ste20 remained intact. These results together with the conserved phenylalanine at this position among Bem1 SH3b-CI binding proteins (Ste20, Cla4, Boi1, and Boi2) indicate that Phe-470 is critical for the interaction between Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR (Fig. 3, D and E). Thus, Phe-470 located at the N-terminally flanking region of Ste20 PRR is essential for the binding to Bem1 SH3b-CI. Because of the high affinity binding of Cdc42 to Bem1 SH3b-CI, Cdc42 was mixed with excess amounts of 13C/15N-labeled SH3b-CI and the complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The backbone signals of 13C/15N labeled SH3b-CI complexed with unlabeled Cdc42 were assigned and the chemical shift difference between Cdc42 bound and unbound forms of Bem1 SH3b-CI was obtained as is plotted in Fig. 4A. Chemical shift changes of more than 0.20 ppm upon Cdc42 binding were observed for seventeen residues (Gly-156, Ser-157, Val-162, Asn-181, Ala-186, Lys-196, Arg-200, Gly-203, Lys-243, Ser-244, Asn-245, Ala-247, Arg-248, Tyr-249, Lys-250, Ala-251, and Ser-255). In addition, four residues (Ile-161, Ser-252, Asn-253, and Ile-254) disappeared upon complex formation. The residues with disappearing peaks or appreciable chemical shift changes were mapped on the surface of SH3b-CI (Fig. 4B). It is to be noted that the residues on the C-terminal flexible region of CI were highly affected, suggesting that this region is critical for the Cdc42 binding. This is consistent with the result that the N253D mutation in CI inhibited the Cdc42 binding in vivo and in vitro (13Yamaguchi Y. Ota K. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the C-terminal region is disordered in the free state, this region may form an ordered structure upon complex formation with Cdc42. To confirm that the C-terminal region of CI is critical for Cdc42 binding, mutation studies using an in vitro pull-down binding assay was performed using S252A, N253D, and I254A mutants. Compared with wild-type Bem1 SH3b-CI, these mutants completely lost binding affinity with Cdc42 (Fig. 4C). Thus, the C-terminal region of CI plays a critical role for complex formation with Cdc42. Next, the mutation analyses using in vitro pull-down binding assay were performed to elucidate whether the SH3b moiety contributes to the binding to Cdc42. The residues that showed considerable chemical shift changes upon complex formation with Cdc42 were mutated to Ala or Asp and these mutants were applied for the pull-down binding assay with Cdc42. The G156A, N181D, and G203A mutants showed binding affinity similar to that of the wild type, supporting that these residues were not involved in the interaction with Cdc42, but the binding affinity to Cdc42 decreased for the Ser-157, Ile-161, Lys-196, and Arg-200 mutants. Interestingly, these residues are located on the particular surface (Fig. 4B, right), but the opposite surface (Fig. 4B, left) has no residues involved in the interaction. Therefore, Bem1 SH3b-CI uses both this particular SH3b surface and the C-terminal region of CI for the interaction with Cdc42. It should be noted that the Ste20 PRR binding surface (dotted circle in Fig. 4B, left) is opposite to this expected Cdc42 binding surface, facilitating the possible formation of the ternary complex, Bem1 SH3b-CI, Cdc42, and Ste20 PRR. To investigate the possibility of a ternary complex formation among Bem1 SH3b-CI, Cdc42, and Ste20 PRR, we performed the in vitro pull-down binding assay, using these proteins (Fig. 5A). The GST-Ste20 PRR was bound to Bem1 SH3b-CI (Fig. 5A, mid) but not to Cdc42 (Fig. 5A, right). However, Cdc42 was pulled-down with GST-Ste20 PRR only in the presence of Bem1 SH3b-CI (Fig. 5A, left), indicating that the ternary complex formation is mediated by Bem1 SH3b-CI. Thus, Bem1 SH3b-CI appears to serve as a scaffold tethering both Ste20 and Cdc42 simultaneously. This is consistent with the NMR observations (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5B shows the overlay of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI in the presence of Cdc42 (blue), in the presence of Ste20 PRR (red), and in the presence of both Cdc42 and Ste20 PRR (green). In the presence of the three proteins, Asp-172 located on the Ste20 PRR binding surface of Bem1 SH3b-CI showed the chemical shift characteristic to a complex with Ste20 PRR, while, Lys-250 located on the C-terminal region of the CI moiety exhibited a chemical shift similar to that of the complex with Cdc42. The in vitro pull-down binding assay and the NMR study taken together support that Bem1 SH3b-CI, Cdc42, and Ste20 PRR are able to form a ternary complex. Next, we performed an in vitro pull-down binding assay using GST-Bem1 SH3b-CI, His-Cdc42, and Ste20 CRIB (Fig. 6A). It is to be noted that Bem1 SH3b-CI binds Cdc42 (Fig. 6A, the third and fourth lanes) but cannot bind Cdc42 in the presence of Ste20 CRIB (Fig. 6A, the first and second lanes). An NMR titration experiment with Ste20 CRIB showed that cross peaks in the HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with Cdc42 (blue) shifted to those of free Bem1 SH3b-CI (red) upon addition of 1.0 eq. molar ratio of Ste20 CRIB to Bem1 SH3b-CI (green) (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that Ste20 CRIB deprives Bem1 SH3b-CI of Cdc42 because Cdc42 has a much higher binding affinity to Ste20 CRIB than to Bem1 SH3b-CI. Based on the present experimental results, we propose the following model for the Ste20 activation mechanism mediated by Bem1 and Cdc42. First, GTP-bound Cdc42 binds Bem1 through SH3b-CI. Next, Ste20 binds to the Bem1-Cdc42 complex through interaction between the Ste20 PRR moiety and Bem1 SH3b-CI. Now, Ste20 CRIB is located in close proximity to Cdc42 because of the ternary complex formation and thus Ste20 CRIB can interact with Cdc42 and deprive Bem1 SH3B-CI of Cdc42. Because Ste20 CRIB interacts with the Ste20 kinase domain to repress its enzymatic activity (4Lamson R.E. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the interaction between Cdc42 and Ste20 CRIB can release this repression and enhance the Ste20 kinase activity, essential for the cell polarity establishment. In order to verify the last step in the model for the Ste20 kinase activation in vitro, we expressed intact Ste20, constructs including CRIB and the kinase domain and only the kinase domain, respectively, using wheat germ cell-free system. Although we confirmed the expression of these constructs, we could not detect kinase activity even for the kinase only construct using myelin basic protein as a substrate. We could not verify the last step for the Ste20 activation in the present study. However, in in vivo assay, the relief of auto-inhibition of Ste20 kinase activity has been already demonstrated that is mediated through interaction of Cdc42 with Ste20 CRIB (4Lamson R.E. Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Winters M.J. Pryciak P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2177-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the present NMR evidence together with the previous in vivo experiments indicated that Bem1 is a scaffold protein which binds both Cdc42 and Ste20 to facilitate efficient binding of Cdc42 with Ste20 CRIB, leading to Ste20 kinase activation. We determined the solution structure of a novel Cdc42 binding domain, Bem1 SH3b-CI. The study shows that Bem1 SH3b and CI are structurally and functionally related. Further, we determined the solution structure of Bem1 SH3b-CI complexed with Ste20 PRR. In addition to the core region of Ste20 PRR, its N-terminally flanking region participates in the interaction with Bem1. This enhances the binding affinity between Bem1 SH3b-CI and Ste20 PRR. The chemical shift perturbation study determined the Cdc42 binding surface of Bem1 SH3b-CI. In vitro pull-down binding assay together with the NMR titration study shows that Bem1, SH3b-CI, Ste20 PRR, and Cdc42 forms a ternary complex but Ste20 CRIB disrupts the ternary complex by removing Cdc42 from Bem1 SH3b-CI. This suggests the activation mechanism of Ste20 mediated by Bem1, which facilitates an efficient interaction of Ste20 CRIB and Cdc42 to release auto inhibition of Ste20 kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022859590,"Exocytosis from synaptic vesicles is driven by stepwise formation of a tight alpha-helical complex between the fusing membranes. The complex is composed of the three SNAREs: synaptobrevin 2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin 1a. An important step in complex formation is fast binding of vesicular synaptobrevin to the preformed syntaxin 1.SNAP-25 dimer. Exactly how this step relates to neurotransmitter release is not well understood. Here, we combined different approaches to gain insights into this reaction. Using computational methods, we identified a stretch in synaptobrevin 2 that may function as a coiled coil ""trigger site."" This site is also present in many synaptobrevin homologs functioning in other trafficking steps. Point mutations in this stretch inhibited binding to the syntaxin 1.SNAP-25 dimer and slowed fusion of liposomes. Moreover, the point mutations severely inhibited secretion from chromaffin cells. Altogether, this demonstrates that the trigger site in synaptobrevin is crucial for productive SNARE zippering."
https://openalex.org/W2046613788,"Apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF) is the RNA binding subunit of a core complex that mediates C to U RNA editing of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA. Targeted deletion of the murine Acf gene is early embryonic lethal and Acf(-/-) blastocysts fail to implant and proliferate, suggesting that ACF plays a key role in cell growth and differentiation. Here we demonstrate that heterozygous Acf(+/-) mice exhibit decreased proliferation and impaired liver mass restitution following partial hepatectomy (PH). To pursue the mechanism of impaired liver regeneration we examined activation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) a key cytokine required for induction of hepatocyte proliferation following PH. Peak induction of hepatic IL-6 mRNA abundance post PH was attenuated >80% in heterozygous Acf(+/-) mice, along with decreased serum IL-6 levels. IL-6 secretion from isolated Kupffer cells (KC) was 2-fold greater in wild-type compared with heterozygous Acf(+/-) mice. Recombinant ACF bound an AU-rich region in the IL-6 3'-untranslated region with high affinity and IL-6 mRNA half-life was significantly shorter in KC isolated from Acf(+/-) mice compared with wild-type controls. These findings suggest that ACF regulates liver regeneration following PH at least in part by controlling the stability of IL-6 mRNA. The results further suggest a new RNA target and an unanticipated physiological function for ACF beyond apoB RNA editing."
https://openalex.org/W2146502853,"hBVR is a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase/scaffold protein/transcription factor/intracellular transporter of regulators. hBVR is an upstream activator of the insulin/IGF-1/MAPK/PI3K signaling pathway, and of NF-κB. As a reductase, it converts biliverdin to the antioxidant, bilirubin. hBVR gene has 8 exons; exon 1 is not translated. We report the characterization of hBVR promoter and its negative and positive regulation, respectively, by TNF-α and hypoxia. The 5′ end of exon 1 was defined by primer extension analyses; deletion of an inhibitor sequence 350–425 bp upstream of this exon enhanced the promoter activity. One of two NF-κB binding sites in the 836-bp promoter was functional; the P65 subunit of NF-κB and TNF-α acted as inhibitors. On the basis of EMSA and ChIP assays, TNF-α treatment increases binding of NF-κB to its regulatory element. Overexpression of IκB increased hBVR mRNA. Biliverdin, but not bilirubin, was as effective as TNF-α in inhibiting hBVR promoter activity. Only one of 4 hypoxia responsive elements (HREs) bound to HIF-1α and ARNT expressed in HEK293A cells. An abasic site was introduced at the 3′ G of the HRE. This element bound HIF-1 in the gel shift and in in-cell luciferase assays. hBVR was detected in the nucleus at 1, 2, and 4 h after hypoxia (1% O2), at which times its kinase and reductase activities were increased. Because hypoxia positively influences hBVR promoter and phosphorylation and TNF-α activated NF-κB inhibits the promoter, while biliverdin inhibits both NF-κB activity and hBVR promoter, we propose a regulatory mechanism for NF-κB by hypoxia and TNF-α centered on hBVR/biliverdin.—Gibbs, P.

Ki values for each analog were calculated from the Cheng and Prusoff equation Ki = IC50/(1+(L/Km)) (where L is the permeant concentration and Km is the value obtained for this permeant), assuming a simple model of competitive inhibition with the binding site of the transporter (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition has been shown with certain analogs (1-methyl, 2-thio, and 8-methylxanthine) by assaying their effect on Km and Vmax for wild type and selected mutants and showing that Vmax remains unaltered (8Karatza P.

RSO membrane vesicles or membrane fractions of E. coli T184 harboring given plasmids were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12%), as described (7Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-PVDF; Pall Corp.). YgfO-BAD was probed with avidin-HRP. YgfO-His10 was probed with either anti-OGM antibody followed by protein A-HRP or penta-His antibody-HRP (7Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Signals were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). RSO membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli T184 expressing His10-tagged versions of the indicated permeases (0.2 mg of total protein in 50 μl of potassium Pi buffer) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with NEM (1 μm−1 mm) or MTSES− (50 μm or 0.2 mm), in the absence or presence of xanthine (1 mm); reactions were stopped by the addition of a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol followed by washing in potassium Pi buffer to remove excess reagents and ligands and extraction of the membrane proteins with n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (2% w/v) for 15 min, 25 °C. The YgfO-His10 permease was then purified with nickel-affinity chromatography using Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid beads (ProBond resin) and labeled with OGM, essentially as described (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with the protein extract, the beads were washed with equilibration buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and resuspended in 0.1 ml of denaturation buffer (containing 6 m urea and 0.5%, w/v, SDS); OGM was added at a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, with rotation. The OGM reaction was stopped by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (5 mm), and the bound proteins were extracted from the beads in Laemmli buffer containing 0.07 m Na2EDTA at 30 °C for 10 min, prior to SDS-PAGE (12%) and immunoblotting. Protein concentrations were determined with the micro-BCA method (Pierce). Comparative sequence analysis of NAT/NCS2 homologs was based on BLAST-p search and ClustalW alignment; the most recent genome annotations were used for retrieving sequence data. Based on the functional (7Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and phylogenetic data, 4K. Rudd, personal communication. the YgfO permease has been recently renamed also as XanQ (by the EcoGene Database of E. coli sequence and function). Initial analysis of transmembrane topology was performed using the program TMHMM (20Granseth E. Daley D.O. Rapp M. Melén K. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the context of our work, extensive homology searches in conjunction with the functional data led us to extend the consensus sequence of the NAT motif, originally defined as (Q/E/P)NXGXXXXT(R/K/G) (3Diallinas G. Valdez J. Sophianopoulou V. Rosa A. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3827-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), by one amino acid residue (Ala-323 in YgfO); we thus refer to the NAT motif as an 11-amino acid sequence with consensus (A/G/S)(Q/E/P)NXGXXXXT(R/K/G). Our Cys-scanning analysis of the NAT motif of YgfO permease (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has identified a stripe of residues, including Ala-323, Asn-326, Gly-327, Val-328, Ile-329, Thr-332, Gly-333, and Ser-336, which tolerate replacement with Cys but undergo strong inhibition upon further modification by NEM; some of these residues form a short α-helical face of TM9b (Fig. 1). Our previous work 5G. Mermelekas and S. Frillingos, manuscript in preparation. has also identified two irreplaceable residues of the motif, Gln-324 and Asn-325, where the sensitivity to NEM could not be tested with accuracy (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis (supplemental Tables S2 and S3) shows that all these inhibition-sensitive residues of YgfO correspond to positions of high side chain conservation among members of the NAT family (Fig. 2). As shown with other transporters (21Frillingos S. Kaback H.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S.

Biol. 2008; 376: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), such inhibition-sensitive and conserved residues are expected to be at conformationally active faces or to line the substrate translocation pathway and be important for the transport mechanism. To address these possibilities further, we have analyzed the effect of substrate (xanthine) on the sensitivity (extent of inactivation) and reactivity (extent of site-directed alkylation) of single-Cys mutants with NEM and MTSES−. Each active single-Cys mutant in the sequence region 321–339 of YgfO was assayed for the effect of NEM, a membrane-permeable sulfhydryl reagent, on the initial rate of xanthine transport after preincubation with NEM in the presence or absence of substrate (Fig. 3). Initial assays of sensitive mutants were performed with NEM concentrations yielding half-maximal inhibition of activity (IC50) in the absence of substrate (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the effect of substrate on the extent of inhibition was tested (Fig. 3A); then, a range of appropriate concentrations was applied to determine the effect of substrate on IC50 for each mutant (Table 1). Our data show that of the 15 single-Cys mutants, A323C responds to substrate by significant enhancement in sensitivity, yielding a shift of IC50 from 34 to 14 μm (Fig. 3B), and sensitivity of the other mutants is essentially unaffected by substrate (Fig. 3 and Table 1). For Phe-322, Asn-325, and Asn-326, where a single-Cys mutant is inactive, assays were performed with Cys replacement mutants in the wild-type background, F322C(wt) and N326C(wt), which are highly active (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and N325C(wt), which has very low but detectable activity (8Karatza P. Panos P. Georgopoulou E. Frillingos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39881-39890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These three mutants are sensitive to inactivation by NEM, whereas the wild-type YgfO, despite the presence of the five native Cys residues (7Karatza P. Frillingos S. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is insensitive; in the presence of substrate, sensitivity of N325C(wt) decreases dramatically, and sensitivity of F322C(wt) or N326C(wt) remains unaffected (Fig. 3 and Table 1).TABLE 1Effect of substrate on the sensitivity of mutants to N-ethylmaleimidePermeaseIC50Exposure to NEM in the absence of substrateExposure to NEM in the presence of 1 mm xanthineμmYgfO(wt)InsensitiveInsensitiveYgfO(Cys-less)InsensitiveInsensitiveT321C1,0001,500F322C(wt)400450A323C3414Q324C or Q324C(wt)NDNDN325C(wt)891,000N326C(wt)5050G327C1210V328C9680I329C5050Q330CInsensitiveInsensitiveM331CInsensitiveInsensitiveT332C4035G333C3538V334C210230A335CInsensitiveInsensitiveS336C6055R337CInsensitiveInsensitiveY338CInsensitiveInsensitiveV339C400410 Open table in a new tab Single-Cys mutants Q324C, N325C, and N326C, which are inactive (8Karatza P.

Our data show that the Cys residue in each one of the four mutants is reactive with NEM and that reactivity of single-Cys N325C is blocked in the presence of substrate, either completely (0.2–0.5 mm NEM) or partially (1 mm NEM) (Fig. 4A); using a range of NEM concentrations, we find that the xanthine substrate shifts the EC50 of N325C from 0.19 to 2.04 mm, as determined by Prism4 analysis (Fig. 4B). The reactivity of the other three mutants was not altered significantly by substrate, either at high (Fig. 4A) or at lower concentrations of NEM (10–200 μm) (data not shown). Finally, the relative reactivity of single-Cys mutants in the sequence region 323–334 was examined at a low NEM concentration (50 μm), in the presence or absence of xanthine substrate (Fig. 5); it is found that reactivity of mutants in this sequence region follows a pattern that is distinct from the NEM sensitivity profile (Fig. 5B) and that substrate exerts minor or no effect at these conditions.FIGURE 5Profile of the NEM reactivity of single-Cys mutants. RSO membrane vesicles were prepared from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cultures of E. coli T184 harboring pT7-5/ygfO(C-less-His10) with given mutations and subjected to sulfhydryl alkylation assay using NEM (50 μm) in the absence or presence of xanthine (1 mm). YgfO-His10 was extracted, affinity-purified, and labeled with OGM, exactly as described in the legend for Fig. 4; samples were analyzed with SDS-PAGE (12%) and immunoblotting using anti-OGM antibody (panel A, upper blots) and HRP-conjugated penta-His antibody (panel A, lower blots).

https://openalex.org/W2057645365,"Galactitol 2-dehydrogenase (GatDH) belongs to the protein superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases. As an enzyme capable of the stereo- and regioselective modification of carbohydrates, it exhibits a high potential for application in biotechnology as a biocatalyst. We have determined the crystal structure of the binary form of GatDH in complex with its cofactor NAD(H) and of the ternary form in complex with NAD(H) and three different substrates. The active form of GatDH constitutes a homo-tetramer with two magnesium-ion binding sites each formed by two opposing C termini. The catalytic tetrad is formed by Asn116, Ser144, Tyr159, and Lys163. GatDH structurally aligns well with related members of the short-chain dehydrogenase family. The substrate binding pocket can be divided into two parts of different size and polarity. In the smaller part, the side chains of amino acids Ser144, Ser146, and Asn151 are important determinants for the binding specificity and the orientation of (pro-) chiral compounds. The larger part of the pocket is elongated and flanked by polar and non-polar residues, enabling a rather broad substrate spectrum. The presented structures provide valuable information for a rational design of this enzyme to improve its stability against pH, temperature, or solvent concentration and to optimize product yield in bioreactors.

Dehydrogenases represent an important class of enzymes in biotechnological processes increasingly used in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry due to their enantio- and stereoselective oxidative and reductive catalytic properties (1Panke S.

A dehydrogenase with a promising catalytic potential is galactitol dehydrogenase (galactitol:NAD+ 5-oxidoreductase (GatDH) 3The abbreviations used are: GatDHgalactitol 2-dehydrogenaseBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPEGpolyethylene glycolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSDRshort-chain dehydrogenase.), an enzyme originally isolated from a galactitol-utilizing mutant of the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). GatDH is a homotetrameric protein that requires Mg2+ for maintenance of its quaternary structure and enzymatic activity. It catalyzes the dehydrogenation of a variety of polyvalent aliphatic alcohols and polyols to the corresponding ketones and ketoses, respectively, and in the reverse reaction it reduces prochiral ketones with high stereoselectivity yielding the corresponding S-configured secondary alcohols (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Huwig A. Emmel S. Jäkel G. Giffhorn F. Carbohydr.

Based on these catalytic capabilities, GatDH was used with cofactor recycling (8Lee L.G. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6999-7008Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Schüte H. Flossdorf J. Sahm H. Kula M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) for several preparative conversions. Oxidation at C5 of galactitol gave the rare sugar l-tagatose in almost quantitative yields (6Huwig A. Emmel S. Jäkel G. Giffhorn F. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 305: 337-339Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). l-Tagatose is a precursor for the synthesis of the glycosidase inhibitor 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (10Furneaux R.H. Tyler P.C. Whitehouse L.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1993; 34: 3609-3612Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is a substrate of pyranose 2-oxidase yielding the interesting synthon 5-keto-psicose (11Freimund S. Huwig A. Carbohydr. Lett. 2000; 3: 1585-1587Google Scholar). Similarly, xylitol is oxidized at C4 to give l-xylulose (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated the preparation of several (R)-1,2-diols by racemic resolution with GatDH as well as the synthesis of several S-configured aliphatic alcohols by reducing corresponding prochiral ketones (7Kohring G.W. Wiehr P. Jeworski M. Giffhorn F. Commun. Agric. Appl. Biol. Sci. 2003; 68: 309-312PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the suitability of GatDH for conversions with electrochemical cofactor regeneration was demonstrated with GatDH-bound covalently to the surface of a gold electrode (12Kornberger P. Gajdzik J. Natter H. Wenz G. Giffhorn F. Kohring G.W. Hempelmann R. Langmuir. 2009; 25: 12380-12386Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These examples indicate that GatDH has a considerable application potential, which is only limited because of intrinsic deficiencies of the enzyme such as low thermal and operational stability and restricted pH tolerance (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A question that has not been addressed so far is its tolerance toward organic solvents in the case of alcohol conversions. There are also open questions concerning the region- and stereoselectivity of GatDH which, apparently, are influenced by the chain length and position of the carbonyl group of the substrate. With regard to polyol conversions, the starting materials for rare sugar syntheses, it seems that GatDH preferentially accepts polyvalent alcohols with d-threo-configuration adjacent to the primary alcohol group (Fig. 1). Thus, GatDH is not only an attractive biocatalyst for the synthesis of certain rare ketoses but also for asymmetric synthesis of enantiomerically pure diols (7Kohring G.W. Wiehr P. Jeworski M. Giffhorn F. Commun. Agric. Appl. Biol. Sci. 2003; 68: 309-312PubMed Google Scholar). To provide a basis for a thorough understanding of the enzymatic properties of GatDH, structure determination of the substrate-free and substrate-bound enzyme in complex with its cofactor was performed. The presented structures provide insight into the properties of the active site of the enzyme and represent the prerequisite for optimization of this and similar dehydrogenases (13Stein M.A. Schäfer A.

For production of recombinant GatDH from R. sphaeorides strain D, the respective gene was cloned into the vector pET24a (Novagen Inc.) with an N-terminal (His)6 affinity tag. For removal of the affinity tag, a cassette coding for the tobacco etch virus-protease cleavage site was ligated into the plasmid. The new plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)gold (Novagen). A 6-liter culture was grown in lysogeny broth (LB) medium supplemented with the antibiotic kanamycin (50 μg ml−1) at 310 K until an A600 of 1.5 was reached. The production of (His)6-tagged GatDH was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) and expressed for 5 h at 303 K. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 6,000 × g, 277 K), washed in buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 193 K. For purification, cells were thawed, resuspended in 120 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted at 16,000 p.s.i. by a cell homogenizer (Avestin Inc.). To digest the DNA, small amounts of DNase were added. After centrifugation (120 min, 75,000 × g, 277 K) the supernatant was applied onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-superflow matrix (Qiagen), and the column was washed to baseline with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged proteins were eluted in the same buffer in multiple gradient steps from 20 mm to 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing (His)6-GatDH (identified by SDS-PAGE analysis, stained with Coomassie-Blue) were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm EDTA. The affinity tag was removed with tobacco etch virus-protease S219V in a molar ratio of 1:10 (protease to protein). For the removal of uncleaved (His)6-GatDH and (His)6-tagged tobacco etch virus-protease, the cleavage reaction mixture was treated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-matrix (Qiagen Inc.), equilibrated with 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 1 mm imidazole. The supernatant, containing pure GatDH without the affinity tag (SDS-PAGE analysis, staining with Coomassie Blue) was dialyzed against 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and concentrated to 12 mg ml−1 (0.45 mm). The homogeneity of the purified protein was further verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. The activity of GatDH toward the used polyols was determined with an assay described by Schneider et al. (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For protein separation, the asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation technique (AFFF, Eclipse, Wyatt Technology) with a spacer of 490 nm and a cellulose membrane with 5-kDa cut-off was used. The system was connected to a UV-detector (Agilent), a multi-angle light-scattering detector (miniDAWN, λ = 690 nm, Wyatt Technology) and a refractive index detector (Agilent). The mobile phase was 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 6.5, with and without 1 mm MgCl2, respectively. The analysis was carried out at a cross flow rate of 1.5–3 ml/min at room temperature (∼298 K). The protein concentration was 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, with or without 1 mm MgCl, and with or without 1 mm NAD+ or NADH, respectively. Finally, the molecular weight was calculated using the ASTRA® software (Wyatt Technology). All crystallization setups were performed at 291 K using the vapor-diffusion method with hanging drops. For crystallization of the holoenzyme, 1 mm NAD+ or NADH was added to the protein solution (0.45 mm) prior to crystallization. 1 μl of protein solution (in 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. Crystal screening was carried out using Crystal ScreenTM, Crystal Screen 2TM, and PEG/Ion ScreenTM (Hampton Research). The best crystallization condition identified was used for further optimization using additive screens 1–3TM (Hampton Research). The first crystallization condition contained 200 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 30% (w/v) PEG 8000. Under this condition crystals in space group P41212 (with unit cell dimensions a = b = 109 Å, c = 125 Å) grew within 1 week. Adding 4% (v/v) 2-propanol to the reservoir solution improved the crystal quality in respect to x-ray diffraction and resulted in crystals grown in the orthorhombic space group P212121 (with unit cell dimensions a = 98 Å, b = 107 Å, and c = 109 Å). These crystals were used for an initial crystal structure determination. For soaking and co-crystallization experiments, a second crystallization condition was optimized containing 100 mm MES, pH 5.5–5.9, 200 mm MgCl2, and 10–20% (w/v) methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) 5000. Crystals produced under these conditions grew in the orthorhombic space group P212121 (with unit cell dimensions a = 65 Å, b = 115 Å, and c = 124 Å). Structures of GatDH with bound substrate were obtained utilizing two different strategies: co-crystallization with excess of substrate as well as soaking of protein crystals. For soaking of crystals, the reservoir solution from the second crystallization condition was supplemented with 1 mm NAD+ as well as with the substrate or putative inhibitor in concentrations in the range of 10–100 mm. Crystals were soaked in increasing concentrations of MPEG 5000 (until 30–35% (w/v)) within ∼60 min. For co-crystallization the substrate was added to the protein solution in a final concentration of 5–50 mm prior to crystallization. To identify potential binding sites for bivalent metal ions, a protein solution containing 0.75 mm GatDH was dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm EDTA to remove Mg2+. In the corresponding crystallization setups, MgCl2 was replaced by 200 mm CoCl2 in the protein and reservoir solution. Data collection was performed at cryogenic temperatures (100 K) after flash cooling of the crystals in liquid nitrogen. Depending on the crystallization condition either PEG 8000 or MPEG 5000 up to a final concentration of 30% (w/v) were used as cryoprotectants. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected on a sealed tube X-ray generator (IμS, Incoatec Inc.) attached to a MARdtb goniostat and a MAR345 image plate detector (MAR Research, Norderstedt, Germany) or at various synchrotron beamlines (see Table 1). All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the program package XDS/XSCALE (20Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 21Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar) or Mosflm/Scala (22Leslie A.G. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar). The parameters for data collection and data processing are summarized in Table 1. For the phase determination of the first data set the molecular replacement method was used. Multiple sequence alignments with related proteins from the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases family were performed with ClustalW (23Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). A homology model was generated as a starting search structure using the Swiss Model internet server (24Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar). The modeling was based on the structure of gluconate 5-dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (TM0441) (PDB entry 1VL8). The rotational and translational searches were performed with the program MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). This first refined structure of GatDH was used as a search model to solve all subsequent structures of GatDH by molecular replacement. All structures were inspected and manually adjusted with the programs O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed with REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Omit maps were generated by using the randomized omit map procedure (29McRee D.E. Practical Protein Crystallography. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 223-226Google Scholar). The coordinates of the questioned peptide regions were removed from the model, and each of the remaining coordinates was randomly translated up to 0.2 Å. This altered model was subjected to 10 rounds of restrained refinement with REFMAC5, and omit electron density maps with coefficients 2Fobs − 1Fcalc were calculated. The quality of the refined structure was verified with the programs PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and SFCHECK (31Vaguine A.A. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics for all structures are given in Table 1. Assignment of secondary structure elements was performed with DSSP (32Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar). Identification of structurally related proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (33Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

Graphical representations were designed in PyMOL (36DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2004Google Scholar).TABLE 1Diffraction data collection and refinement statistics The gene of GatDH extended by an N-terminal (His)6 affinity tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site was heterologously expressed in E. coli, and the produced protein was purified to homogeneity via affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. The final amount of pure (His)6-GatDH was 80 mg/liter cell culture. The structure of GatDH with its cofactor NAD(H), but without substrate, was solved to 1.25-Å resolution (Table 1). All 254 amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain and the cofactor NAD+ in the cofactor binding site were well defined in the electron-density maps. GatDH consists of a seven-stranded β-sheet, surrounded by three α-helices on either side (Fig. 2). In its core it displays a Rossmann fold (37Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), built of two βαβαβ motifs (βA-αB-βB-αC-βC and βD-αE-βE-αF-βF). The cofactor is bound in a deep cleft above the β-sheets. This central motif is C-terminally extended through a seventh β-sheet (βG) and one α-helix (αG), separated from the Rossmann motif through a left-handed helix-turn-helix motif built out of two small helices (αFG1 und αFG2). A search for structurally related proteins in the PDB (33Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

Proteins. 2008; 70: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) from Bacillus anthracis (with root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å (242 of 254 Cα atoms), 33% sequence identity, and a Z-score of 37.2) as the closest structural homologues of GatDH (supplemental Fig. 1). Independent from the bound cofactor or the concentration of MgCl2, GatDH was found to be tetrameric in solution, as analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography as well as by static (dynamic light scattering) and dynamic (multiple-angle laser light scattering) light scattering (data not shown). In line with this finding, GatDH crystals displayed a homo-tetramer with point-group symmetry D2 formed by a dimer of two homo-dimers (Fig. 2C). The interaction interfaces between monomer A1/A2 and B1/B2, coordinated through the helices αE and αF, are 1581 Å2, between monomer A1/B1 and A2/B2, coordinated through αF, αG, βF, the N terminus, and αB, are 1786 Å2. The contact area between A1/B2 and A2/B1 (452 Å2) is formed through the last four amino acids of the C terminus and the loop preceding helix αF. One element of this interface is one magnesium ion binding site per dimer. Each magnesium ion is complexed by the two carboxyl groups of the C termini of two opposing peptide chains. Therefore, the homo-tetramer contains two magnesium binding sites not associated with the bound cofactor (Fig. 3). The cofactor binding site in SDR enzymes is characterized by the conserved TGXXXGXG cofactor binding motif. In GatDH the corresponding TGAGSGIG segment (residues 18–24) is located between the first β-strand (βA) and the first α-helix (αB) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A). This sequence is identical to the one in human estradiol 17-β-dehydrogenase type 8 (PDB entry 2PD6) (40Rotinen M. Celay J. Alonso M.M. Arrazola A. Encio I. Villar J. J. Endocrinol. 2009; 200: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further fingerprints are the motifs NNAG (at position 86–89) and PG (at position 189–190), both involved in cofactor binding at the active site (reviewed in Refs. 41Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J.

Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzàlez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). In 70% of the cases, SDR enzymes with NAD(H) dependence comprise an aspartate residue at the C terminus of the second β-strand, and SDRs with NADP(H) dependence comprise an arginine residue (43Duax W.L. Pletnev V. Addlagatta A. Bruenn J. Weeks C.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GatDH contains at this end of βB the sequence Asp42-Arg43. SDR enzymes containing this rare sequence are NAD-dependent (43Duax W.L. Pletnev V. Addlagatta A. Bruenn J. Weeks C.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is in accordance with the observed NAD(H) dependence of GatDH (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Kohring G.W. Wiehr P. Jeworski M. Giffhorn F. Commun. Agric. Appl. Biol. Sci. 2003; 68: 309-312PubMed Google Scholar). Asp42 of GatDH discriminates against a phosphate group attached to the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide cofactor, whereas the side chain of Arg43 interacts via π-interactions with the adenine base NAD(H). The cofactor is bound in a deep cleft and is protected against the environment through the helix αFG1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A). The cofactor binds via 22 H-bonds directly and via six well coordinated water molecules with the protein. One of these water molecules is hydrogen bonded to the first and to the last conserved glycine residues within the TGXXXGXG signature motif and to the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser92 at the end of β-strand βD. An equivalent water molecule is described as highly conserved in dinucleotide-binding proteins (44Bottoms C.A. Smith P.E. Tanner J.J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The active site in SDR enzymes is characterized by the sequence motif Tyr-X-X-X-Lys, with tyrosine as the most frequently conserved and the lysine second highly conserved residue in all members of the SDR family (45Kavanagh K.L. Jörnvall H. Persson B. Oppermann U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3895-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In GatDH, Tyr159 and Lys-163 form the catalytic tetrad together with Ser144 and Asn116, which superimpose very well with the catalytic tetrad of human 3β/17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, suggesting a similar kind of reaction mechanism (41Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T. Nordling E. Ladenstein R. Jörnvall H. Oppermann U. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14659-14668Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The putative active site in GatDH is formed by a pocket at the end of the deep cleft in which the cofactor is bound. This cleft is predominantly shielded against the environment via helix αFG1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A). In GatDH without bound substrate, one large cavity next to the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor could be identified (Fig. 4 (B and C) and supplemental Fig. 3). This cavity has a volume of ∼250 Å3, a length of ∼14 Å, and a diameter of ∼8–10 Å with a small oval opening to the solvent environment of a diameter of ∼2–5 Å. It is formed by residues 96–98, 144–146, 151, 154–156, 159–160, 189–191, 196–197, 200, 210, and the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. It displays mostly an apolar surface. Aliphatic molecules with up to eight carbon atoms and even cyclic compounds might fit within this cavity. In crystals grown under crystallization condition I, a nearly tetragon-shaped electron density was found within the putative substrate binding pocket next to the nicotinamide ring. The interpretation of this electron density was ambiguous. One possible interpretation of this electron density is the two different binding modes of one acetate molecule averaged over the sampled crystal volume. Based on this interpretation, the carbonyl group of the acetate molecule is strongly bound via five H-bonds to side chains in the active site pocket (Ser144, Ser146, Asn151, and Tyr159). To gain further insight into the mode of substrate binding we tried to map the substrate binding pocket with different substances. Because bound acetate might prevent potential substrates and/or inhibitors from binding, a second crystallization condition was optimized, which does not contain acetate or similar negatively charged substances. Based on the kinetic studies and identified substrates (5Schneider K.H. Jäkel G. Hoffmann R. Giffhorn F. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we have performed soaking and co-crystallization experiments with 20 different compounds. In co-crystallization experiments with a racemic (R,S)-mixture of 1,2-pentanediol (Km = 1.2 mm) the electron density was of sufficient quality to verify that only the S-enantiomer bound to the active site (Fig. 4). Forming a hydrogen-bonding network, Ser144 of the catalytic tetrad together with the side chains of Ser146 and Asn151 stabilize the primary, non-transformed hydroxyl-group of 1,2-(S)-pentanediol (Fig. 5). The secondary, to be oxidized hydroxyl-group, forms two hydrogen bonds with Tyr159-OH and the amide group of the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. The aliphatic tail is positioned within the larger part of the binding pocket. A second binding site for 1,2-pentanediol could be identified within the crystal-packing interface between two GatDH tetramers. This binding induced a small relative rotation of the protein molecules causing a small change in the overall crystal packing and as a consequence a different unit cell compared with th"

Treatment of cells with 0.5 nm rapamycin induced a similar trend. These results suggest that, under basal conditions, PLD2 expression and concomitant activity is negatively regulated by the mTOR/S6K signaling pathway. Down-regulation of PLD2 was confirmed in differentiated HL-60 leukocytes overexpressing an mTOR-wild type, but not an mTOR kinase-dead construct. At the cellular level, overexpression of mTOR-wild type resulted in lower basal cell migration, which was reversed by treatment with IL-8.

IntroductionUnsaturated fatty acids are found in the membranes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids is a key variable in maintaining membrane fluidity. Postsynthetic desaturation of fatty acids is mediated by desaturase enzymes (1Bloch K.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The reactions require iron cofactors, molecular oxygen, and reducing equivalents and are both inhibited by azide and cyanide but are insensitive to carbon monoxide. All desaturases investigated to date show remarkable stereo-selectivity in abstracting pro(R) hydrogens from adjacent carbons in the fatty acid substrate (8Behrouzian B. Buist P.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As noted by Bloch (1Bloch K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 193-202Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), desaturase selectivity “would seem to approach the limits of the discriminatory power of enzymes” by a mechanism(s) that remain to be determined almost 40 years later.Ole1p is a bifunctional 53-kDa protein (7Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal 42-kDa desaturase domain that has 36% homology to the rat stearoyl-CoA desaturase and a C-terminal 11-kDa domain that has strong homology to cytochromes b5 (9Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Although integral membrane desaturases, like many membrane proteins, have proved difficult overexpress and purify, sequence analysis has provided important information regarding the structure of the enzyme. For example, Martin and co-workers (7Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed hydropathy analysis to predict that the yeast desaturase consists of four transmembrane domains with the N and C termini facing the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Under their model, all three elements of a tripartite motif composed of 8 conserved histidine residues (10Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) would also be located on the cytoplasmic face. Experimental support for this model came from topology analysis of the closely related mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase with the use of SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) fused with epitope tags at various positions along the its sequence, in which the N and C termini, along with the histidine-containing regions, are located on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the enzyme is anchored by four transmembrane helices connected by two short hydrophilic loops within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (11Man W.C. Miyazaki M. Chu K. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar analysis was performed on the distantly related (11% homology with Ole1) Bacillus subtilis Δ5-desaturase, and although the equivalent structural elements were found on the inner membrane face, six rather than four transmembrane-spanning domains were proposed (12Diaz A.R.

Delta Nine Stearoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK2001: 725-737Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the castor and ivy acyl-ACP desaturases confirmed their dimeric structure with deep interdigitation between the monomers adjacent to four helix bundles in which the diiron active site is located (14Lindqvist Y.

A half-of-the-sites mechanism was hypothesized for desaturase function, in which the energy released upon substrate binding is transferred to the second subunit to facilitate product release (16Broadwater J.A. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14664-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).To date, no information is available concerning the oligomeric state of the integral membrane class of enzymes. Here we present evidence from co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and analysis of the co-expression wild type (WT) along with catalytically inactive Ole1p that is consistent with the hypothesis that Ole1p forms dimers in vivo.DISCUSSIONIn contrast to the soluble desaturases, integral membrane desaturases are notoriously recalcitrant to overexpression in heterologous systems and with several notable exceptions (23Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 24Schmidt H. Dresselhaus T. Buck F. Heinz E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have been very difficult to purify. Several crystal structures of soluble desaturases have been determined, which show that the enzyme exists as a dimer with a deeply interdigitated interface (14Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 15Guy J.E. Whittle E. Kumaran D. Lindqvist Y. Shanklin J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25072-25080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the integral membrane desaturases await detailed biophysical characterization, and whether they are active as monomers, dimers, or higher oligomers has yet to be reported. We therefore employed a series of in vitro and in vivo approaches to establish that Ole1p exists as a dimer in vivo.Several lines of evidence presented here support the hypothesis that Ole1p self-associates, including the following. 1) Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in which a Myc tag was used to precipitate Myc-Ole1p and a FLAG tag was used to visualize a co-expressed FLAG-Ole1p monomer; the experiment yielded equivalent results when either anti-Myc antibodies were used for capture and anti-FLAG was used for visualization or vice versa. 2) Two independent bimolecular complementation approaches, one employing the split ubiquitin and the other employing the split luciferase system, provided evidence for self association. 3) Co-expression of active and inactive Ole1p subunits showed a reduction in activity consistent with a dominant negative effect in which one defective subunit inactivated the oligomer. Equal expression of both subunits gave rise to an ∼75% decrease of the palmitoleic acid accumulation phenotype, consistent with a dimeric organization. The magnitude of the decrease is inconsistent with the formation of higher oligomers because subunit poisoning of the most simple of these (i.e. a tetramer) would be expected to produce an ∼94% decrease in product accumulation (i.e. a level ∼5-fold lower than the experimental observation).The observed subunit poisoning of Ole1p is consistent with the proposed dominant negative effect as an explanation for the reduction in linoleic acid and accompanying increase in oleic acid upon the expression of a nonfunctional Brassica oleate desaturase (mutant Bnfad2) in the seeds of transgenic cotton (26Chapman K.D. Austin-Brown S. Sparace S.A. Kinney A.J. Ripp K.G. Pirtle I.L. Rirtle R.M. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 2001; 78: 941-947Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Chapman K.D. Neogi P.B. Hake K.D. Stawska A.A.

The Brassica data also suggest that dimerization of the yeast Ole1p presented herein represents a general structural organization for integral membrane desaturases because the Brassica desaturase lacks the C-terminal cytochrome b5 domain of Ole1p.It is intriguing that the evolutionarily distinct soluble desaturases and the integral membrane desaturases, typified by the castor Δ9-desaturase and the yeast Ole1p, respectively, have apparently evolved convergently, arriving at similar iron active sites and dimeric organization. This suggests a possible common imperative for this organization with respect to desaturase function. However, a dimeric organization is also common among many enzyme families and may provide several selective advantages (e.g. reducing the genome size for the production of homodimeric proteins and stabilizing proteins because smaller protomers can fold readily prior to assembly into larger oligomeric active structures) (28Marianayagam N.J. Sunde M. Matthews J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition to these selective advantages, dimeric organization allows for the biochemical regulation of heterodimers. This can be achieved by the formation of heterodimers from distinct pools of oligomers. It is unknown whether desaturase enzymes form heterodimers in vivo, but it is possible that such a mechanism exists for plants, such as Arabidopsis, in which the soluble desaturase family consists of seven members, each with distinct kinetics and substrate specificities (29Kachroo A. Shanklin J. Whittle E. Lapchyk L. Hildebrand D. Kachroo P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2007; 63: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), or the ω-3 desaturase family, comprising three enzymes that are evolutionarily related to Ole1. However, such a regulatory role is unlikely for yeast Ole1p because it is encoded by a single gene.A dimeric organization can also play an important role for homodimers in that the state of component protomers can influence each others' biochemical properties. For instance, the soluble desaturase dimer exhibits high affinity binding for one acyl-ACP substrate, but the affinity for binding a second substrate becomes much reduced, implying that a signal is transmitted from the substrate-bound protomer to the unoccupied protomer that reduces its substrate binding affinity (30Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14472-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This may have implications for coordinating desaturase-substrate interactions. A half-of-the-sites mechanism was proposed for the soluble desaturase (16Broadwater J.A. Ai J. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14664-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) in which the energy of desolvation released upon binding of the hydrophobic substrate to one protomer is transferred to the second protomer, providing a driving force to facilitate the energy-demanding release of the hydrophobic product into the aqueous phase. Binding of substrate to only one of the two protomers would facilitate an unbound substrate that would be available for substrate binding, facilitating the coordination of substrate binding with product release. This is an appealing scenario for the soluble desaturase and acyl-CoA desaturases, such as Ole1p, because the substrates and products exist in the aqueous phase. However, it is not clear if this mechanism would apply to desaturases in which the substrates are lipid-bound acyl chains for which binding of substrate is unlikely to be coordinated with product release.An alternate imperative for the dimeric organization of desaturases could relate to their requirement for two-electron reduction of the active site iron center for catalysis. In both the soluble and membrane desaturases, electrons are supplied singly by interaction of the desaturase with ferredoxin and cytochrome b5, respectively. In vitro redox titration of the soluble desaturase at ambient temperatures failed to reveal the presence of a meta (Fe2+-Fe3+) state of the iron center that is observed upon reduction at low temperatures (77 K), suggesting that the meta state is unstable at ambient temperatures (31Davydov R. Behrouzian B. Smoukov S. Stubbe J. Hoffman B.M. Shanklin J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A dimeric structure of the desaturase would potentially allow for concerted reduction of the iron centers within each protomer to produce two meta state iron centers. These could undergo disproportionation to produce one reduced, Fe2+-Fe2+, and one oxidized, Fe3+-Fe3+, site.At this time, it is unknown whether the formation of desaturase dimers is related to the general economies associated with the formation of homodimers (described above) or whether it relates to desaturase chemistry-specific imperatives imposed by the energetics of product release or requirement for two-electron reduction. It may be possible to test the desaturase-specific hypotheses empirically. This approach would be analogous to the subunit poisoning experiments presented herein; the activities of heterodimers composed of wild type protomers paired with protomers impaired in either substrate- or redox-partner binding could be evaluated. Inactivation of wild type activity upon pairing of wild type protomers with protomers disrupted in substrate or redox-partner binding would provide empirical support for these hypotheses.The expression of Ole1p is highly regulated, responding to factors such as carbon source, metal ions, and the availability of oxygen (32Martin C.E. Oh C.S. Jiang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Multiple levels of regulation have been reported, including at the transcriptional, RNA stability, and translational levels. It remains to be determined whether the formation of dimers is a dynamic process that could potentially contribute to this process. IntroductionUnsaturated fatty acids are found in the membranes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids is a key variable in maintaining membrane fluidity. Postsynthetic desaturation of fatty acids is mediated by desaturase enzymes (1Bloch K.

Fatty acid desaturases are derived from two evolutionary lineages, the soluble acyl-ACP desaturases found primarily in the plastids of higher plants (e.g. the castor Δ9-18:0-acyl 2Fatty acid nomenclature is as follows. X:Y indicates that the fatty acid contains X numbers of carbon atoms and Y numbers of double bonds; Δz indicates that a double bond is positioned at the zth carbon atom from the C terminus. carrier protein (ACP) 3The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinWTwild typeRLUCRenilla split luciferaseX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideCubC-terminal ubiquitin fragmentNubN-terminal ubiquitin fragment. desaturase (6Shanklin J. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2510-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the integral membrane desaturases typified by the yeast Ole1 Δ9-desaturase (Ole1p) (7Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The reactions require iron cofactors, molecular oxygen, and reducing equivalents and are both inhibited by azide and cyanide but are insensitive to carbon monoxide. All desaturases investigated to date show remarkable stereo-selectivity in abstracting pro(R) hydrogens from adjacent carbons in the fatty acid substrate (8Behrouzian B. Buist P.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As noted by Bloch (1Bloch K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1969; 2: 193-202Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), desaturase selectivity “would seem to approach the limits of the discriminatory power of enzymes” by a mechanism(s) that remain to be determined almost 40 years later.Ole1p is a bifunctional 53-kDa protein (7Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal 42-kDa desaturase domain that has 36% homology to the rat stearoyl-CoA desaturase and a C-terminal 11-kDa domain that has strong homology to cytochromes b5 (9Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Although integral membrane desaturases, like many membrane proteins, have proved difficult overexpress and purify, sequence analysis has provided important information regarding the structure of the enzyme. For example, Martin and co-workers (7Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employed hydropathy analysis to predict that the yeast desaturase consists of four transmembrane domains with the N and C termini facing the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Under their model, all three elements of a tripartite motif composed of 8 conserved histidine residues (10Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) would also be located on the cytoplasmic face. Experimental support for this model came from topology analysis of the closely related mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase with the use of SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) fused with epitope tags at various positions along the its sequence, in which the N and C termini, along with the histidine-containing regions, are located on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the enzyme is anchored by four transmembrane helices connected by two short hydrophilic loops within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (11Man W.C. Miyazaki M. Chu K. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar analysis was performed on the distantly related (11% homology with Ole1) Bacillus subtilis Δ5-desaturase, and although the equivalent structural elements were found on the inner membrane face, six rather than four transmembrane-spanning domains were proposed (12Diaz A.R. Mansilla M.C. Vila A.J. de Mendoza D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48099-48106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Much of what we know about the structure and function of desaturase enzymes comes from studies on the soluble acyl-ACP desaturases, which are readily expressible in Eschericha coli in quantities sufficient for biochemical investigation (13Lindqvist Y. Delta Nine Stearoyl-acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK2001: 725-737Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the castor and ivy acyl-ACP desaturases confirmed their dimeric structure with deep interdigitation between the monomers adjacent to four helix bundles in which the diiron active site is located (14Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 15Guy J.E. Whittle E. Kumaran D. Lindqvist Y. Shanklin J. J. Biol.

Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements showed that l-lactate binds to dodecameric and heterohexameric Hc and to the CaeSS3 homohexamer but not to the CaeSS2 monomer. The binding of lactate caused no change in the optical absorption and x-ray absorption spectra of either oxy- or deoxy-Hc, suggesting that no structural rearrangement of the active site occurred. At pH 6.5, the oxygen binding rate constant kobs obtained by flash photolysis showed a significant increase upon addition of l-lactate, whereas l-lactate addition had little effect at pH 8.3. Lactate binding caused a concentration-dependent shift in the interhexameric distances at pH 6.5 based on small angle x-ray scattering measurements. These results show that l-lactate affects oxygen affinity at pH 6.5 by modulating the global structure of Hc without affecting its binuclear copper center (the active site). In contrast to this, the active site structure of deoxy-Hc is affected by changes in pH (Hirota, S., Kawahara, T., Beltramini, M., Di Muro, P., Magliozzo, R. S., Peisach, J., Powers, L. S., Tanaka, N., Nagao, S., and Bubacco, L. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 31941–31948). Upon addiction of lactate, the kinetic behavior of oxygen rebinding for Hc was heterogeneous under low oxygen concentrations at pH 6.5 due to changes in the T and R state populations, and the equilibrium was found to shift from the T toward the R state with addition of lactate.
