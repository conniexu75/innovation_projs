We expressed fluorescent TLR4 in cell lines and found that TLR4 densely localized to the surface and the Golgi. Similar distributions were observed in human monocytes. Confocal imaging revealed rapid recycling of TLR4-CD14-MD-2 complexes between the Golgi and the plasma membrane. Fluorescent LPS followed these trafficking pathways in CD14-positive cells. The TLR4- adapter protein, MyD88, translocated to the cell surface upon LPS exposure, and cross-linking of surface TLR4 with antibody induced signaling. Golgi-associated TLR4 expression was disrupted by brefeldin A, yet LPS signaling was preserved. We conclude that LPS signaling may be initiated by surface aggregation of TLR4 and is not dependent upon LPS trafficking to the Golgi.

The first line defense of multicellular organisms against bacterial pathogens relies upon germ line-encoded receptors that recognize a variety of conserved molecular structures on microorganisms (1Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Google Scholar, 2Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-53Google Scholar, 3Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Google Scholar). One family of such pattern recognition receptors is the type I transmembrane signaling receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALP-2, M. fermentans-derived membrane lipopeptide macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FRAP, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; GM1, monosialo ganglioside GM1; APC, allophycocyanin; BODIPY, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-5-indacene; rLBP, recombinant lipopolysaccharide binding protein 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MALP-2, M. fermentans-derived membrane lipopeptide macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FRAP, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; GM1, monosialo ganglioside GM1; APC, allophycocyanin; BODIPY, 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-5-indacene; rLBP, recombinant lipopolysaccharide binding protein These receptors are all characterized by an intracellular signaling domain that is homologous to that of the IL-1 receptor and an extracellular domain with leucine-rich repeats (4Rock F.L.

Cytokine Netw. 2000; 11: 362-371Google Scholar). The most extensively studied microbial product known to engage TLRs is lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin), a complex glycolipid that comprises the major portion of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (6Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Google Scholar). A potent immune response is orchestrated upon the recognition of LPS by mammalian cells, including the production and release of cytokines, activation of complement, and various other effects that result in the killing and clearance of the pathogen. Uncontrolled hyperinflammatory host responses to LPS may lead to life-threatening complications such as septic shock, multiorgan failure, and death (7Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Google Scholar). Toll-like receptor 4 is the signaling receptor for LPS and requires the small glycosylated protein MD-2 for optimal signaling (8Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Google Scholar, 9Hoshino K. Takeuchi O.

Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T. Kosugi A. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 667-672Google Scholar). We have recently observed that a mutant form of MD-2 (C95Y) completely abrogated LPS responses and that wild-type MD-2 was able to confer LPS responsiveness in TLR4-positive cells lacking MD-2 expression (11Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Google Scholar, 12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar). Whereas there is widespread agreement that CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 expression are necessary for optimal responses to LPS, the mechanism of cellular activation remains in doubt. Wright and co-workers (14Thieblemont N. Thieringer R. Wright S.D. Immunity. 1998; 8: 771-777Google Scholar,25Thieblemont N. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 523-534Google Scholar) observed that LPS is internalized and trafficked to the Golgi apparatus. Indeed, they reported that in the absence of internalization and movement of LPS to the Golgi, LPS did not activate mammalian cells (14Thieblemont N. Thieringer R. Wright S.D. Immunity. 1998; 8: 771-777Google Scholar). Wright proposed these events to be the critical initiators of signal transduction. TLR4 has now been reported to be localized to the Golgi in certain epithelial cells (15Hornef M.W. Frisan T. Vandewalle A. Normark S. Richter-Dahlfors A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 559-570Google Scholar). Together, these data suggested that LPS stimulates innate immune responses by activating an internal receptor, TLR4, that normally resides in the Golgi apparatus. Since the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein (GFP), the subcellular localization, trafficking, and fate of proteins can be studied in living cells using the fluorescent protein as a fusion tag (16Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Google Scholar, 17Lippincott-Schwartz J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 97-107Google Scholar, 18Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Google Scholar). Moreover, spectral variants of GFP, such as yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), have been developed. These GFP variants can be exploited for simultaneous visualization of two or more different proteins. We have engineered a TLR-fluorescent protein chimera with CFP or YFP fused in frame to the C terminus of TLR2 and TLR4 and, as a control, fused to the TNF receptor p60. These cDNA constructs were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. HEK293 cells lack TLR2 or TLR4 expression, and expression of the fluorescent chimeric Toll receptors enabled these cells to respond to the appropriate TLR ligand. We defined the subcellular localization, trafficking, and reorganization of TLR4, CD14, MD-2, and LPS in living cells by employing time lapse confocal microscopy of monocolor- and dual and triple color-labeled cells as well as fluorescent photobleaching techniques. We confirmed that LPS traffics to the Golgi and found that TLR4 is expressed in the Golgi of transfected HEK cells as well as native monocytes. However, TLR4 is also surface-expressed. Furthermore, LPS continued to traffic between the cell surface and the Golgi under experimental conditions where signal transduction does not occur. Conversely, TLR4 expression in the Golgi was not necessary for cells to respond to LPS. In addition, antibody cross-linking of surface TLR4 was able to trigger strong signaling both in TLR4-transfected cells and human monocytes. These findings provide strong evidence that LPS signaling is initiated on the plasma membrane. Localization of TLR4 in an intact Golgi network and the movement of LPS to this internal pool of TLR4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for signaling to occur. Reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. PBS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, G418, and trypsin/versene mixture were from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Low endotoxin fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Ciprofloxacin was a gift from Miles Pharmaceuticals (West Haven, CT). LPS derived from Escherichia coli strain 0111:B4 was purchased from Sigma and re-extracted by phenol chloroform as described (19Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Google Scholar). Human IL-1b and TNF-α were purchased from Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). The Mycoplasma fermentans-derived membrane macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa (MALP-2) was obtained from Dr. G. Rawadi (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The cDNA for human TLR4 was provided in the vector pcDNA3 by Drs. C. Janeway and R. Medzhitov (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The expression plasmid pRK7-TLR2 was obtained from Dr. C. Kirschning (Technical University of Munich). The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was previously modified to include either CFP or YFP as C-terminal epitope tags in frame with a cloning site; these vectors were provided by Drs. F. Chan and M. Lenardo (20Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Google Scholar). The same investigators also provided epitope-tagged p60 TNFR (20Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction of TLR2 and TLR4 was performed on pRK7-TLR2 and on pcDNA3-TLR4 in order to construct chimeric fluorescent cDNAs. The upper and lower primers for TLR2 were 5′-GAAGCAGGATCCATGCCACATACTTTGT-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGGGACTTTATCGCAGCTCTCAGA-3′. The upper and lower primers for TLR4 were 5′-GATGATGGATCCATGATGTCTGCCTCGC-3′ and 5′-ATTTTTGGCTCGAGGATAGATGTTGCTTCC-3′. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in frame into pcDNA3-CFP and pcDNA3-YFP. The hMD-2 mammalian expression plasmid pEFBOS containing C-terminal FLAG and His epitopes was a gift of Dr. K. Miyake (University of Tokyo). The Golgi subcelluluar localization vector consisting of the targeting sequence of human β-galactosyltransferase fused to CFP was purchased from CLONTECH. The fluorescent MyD88 constructs were made by PCR of MyD88 in pRK7 (provided by Dr. H. Wesche, Tularik, Inc., San Francisco, CA) using the following upper and lower primers for MyD88: 5′-CCACGGGGATCCATGGCTGCAGGAGGTC-3′ and 5′-GAACAGGTCGACGGGCAGGGACAAGGC-3′. The PCR fragments were trimmed withBamHI and SalI and cloned in frame into pcDNA3-CFP or pcDNA3-YFP, respectively. Stable cell lines of HEK293 cells expressing the fluorescent protein TLR constructs were engineered by calcium phosphate transfection (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar), selection of bulk populations of cells in the neomycin analog G418 (1 mg of total drug/ml), and positive selection by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD Vantage, Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry). Clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. The fluorescent HEK293 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 in a 5% saturated CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. A cell line stably expressing both TLR4 and MD-2 was generated by retroviral transduction of HEK-TLR4YFPcells as described with a retrovirus encoding human MD-2 (12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation as previously described (12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar). Briefly, MD-2-transduced HEK-TLR4YFP or HEK-TLR2YFP cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and washed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution, and surface proteins were labeled at 4 °C for 30 min in 5 ml of a solution of sulfosuccinimidobiotin (1 mg/ml; Pierce) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were washed and then incubated in 1 mglycine, pH 9, for 5 min, washed again, and lysed in 1 ml of buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 60 mm n-octylglucoside, 25 mm iodoacetamide, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged, precleared for 1 h in 40 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of a GFP polyclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) per ml and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed four times in lysis buffer, resolved by 4–15% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were blocked in 5% powdered milk (Difco) and blotted with either the M2-HRP mAb (Sigma), anti-GFP mAb (CLONTECH), or Avidin-HRP (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated with HRP substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence substrate; Amersham Biosciences) and developed by exposure to film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells that stably express TLR4YFP, TLR2YFP, TNFRYFP, or empty vector (pcDNA) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter genes using Genejuice (Novagen) per the manufacturer's recommendations. In order to assess NF-κB activation, an NF-κB-luciferase reporter gene consisting of an artificial promoter composed of a multimer of five NF-κB sites driving the firefly luciferase gene, was co-transfected with a constitutively active Renilla-luciferase reporter gene (Promega, Madison, WI). The following day, the cells were stimulated as indicated. When necessary, HEK-TLR4YFP cells were either co-transfected with MD-2, stimulated in the presence of soluble MD-2 in conditioned medium, or retrovirally transduced with the cDNA for MD-2 (12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar). Note that we have established that all three of these methodologies for expressing MD-2 comparably enhance TLR4-mediated responses to LPS. 2E. Latz and A. Visintin, unpublished data. After 4–6 h of stimulation, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega), and reporter gene activity was measured using a plate reader luminometer (Victor2; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Dual-Luciferase Assay Reporter System (Promega) and normalized for transfection efficiency. In all cases, the data shown represent one of three separate experiments and are presented as the mean values ± S.D. of triplicate samples. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser-scanning unit. A Zeiss 40× and a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture plan Apochromat oil immersion objective (Zeiss) was used. Cells were seeded on 35-mm glass bottom γ-irradiated tissue culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). CFP-tagged proteins were visualized using the 453-nm argon laser line; for YFP and GFP, the 514- or 488-nm line of a 25-milliwatt argon laser was used. Red fluorophores were excited with a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm. Alexa 647 or Cy5-LPS were excited with a helium/neon laser emitting at 633 nm. Band pass or long pass filters were chosen to optimally separate the fluorescence emissions between the different photomultipliers using single-labeled samples of the probes as controls. When crossover of the fluorescence signal was measured to be more than 5%, two or more tracks were scanned alternately with only one laser active per scan and the respective detector channel active at each time. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed by selecting an area of interest and rapidly applying 99 consecutive scans using the 514-nm line of a 25-milliwatt argon laser at full laser power. Fluorescence recovery was observed under low illumination over time as indicated in the figures. Additional FRAP experiments were done after pretreatment with 200 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) in complete tissue culture medium for 2 h. Live cell images and confocal time lapse fluorescence imaging were performed at 37 °C using a warm stage apparatus (Zeiss). Indirect immunofluorescence staining for FACS was done using purified mouse monoclonal antibodies (TLR4, HTA125; TLR2, TL2.1; CD14, 3C10) and isotype-matched control antibodies (Sigma) as primary antibodies. Cells were counterstained with APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Caltag). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson LSR) using the argon laser at 488 nm for excitation of YFP fluorescence and the helium/neon laser emitting at 633 nm to excite APC. Under these conditions, no spectral overlap of the fluorophores was observed. Transient transfection of cells observed with confocal microscopy was done on cells plated in 35-mm glass bottom tissue culture dishes using Effectene™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Golgi stain by BODIPY-TR-conjugated ceramide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was done per the manufacturer's recommendations. MD-2 was stained for confocal analysis by use of M2 (Sigma) as a primary antibody and Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse as the secondary antibody (Molecular Probes); mCD14 was stained by Tricolor-conjugated anti-CD14 antibody (Caltag). Monocytes were isolated by plastic adherence of PBMCs in confocal Petri dishes (MatTek) and cultivated in RPMI1640 with 5% human A+ serum (University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway) for 48 h before they were washed three times in Hanks' solution and fixed in 2% formaldehyde (Merck) in PBS for 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice in PBS with 1% A+ serum (PBS/A+) before they were treated with acetone (−20 °C) for 10 min followed by a careful wash with PBS/A+. Nonspecific binding was blocked by adding PBS with 20% A+ on ice for 20 min. The cells were then stained for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg/ml HTA125 conjugated with Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes) or a control murine IgG (Caltag) also conjugated with Alexa 546. After three washes with PBS/A+, the cells were examined in the confocal microscope with a 543-nm excitation. Membrane expression of TLR4 and TLR2 in monocytes was measured by flow cytometry (BD LSR). Freshly isolated PBMCs were surface-stained with an APC-labeled anti-CD14 antibody (Caltag) together with biotinylated anti-TLR4, anti-TLR2, or isotype control antibodies (all from eBiosciences) after preincubation in 20% human serum for 20 min. Biotinylated antibodies were developed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin (Sigma), and CD14-positive cells (gated according to their forward and sideward scatter characteristics) were analyzed for TLR expression. E. coli 0111:B4 LPS was subjected to a second phenol extraction to remove minor contaminants and labeled with the amine-reactive Cy5-fluorochrome (AmershamBiosciences) per the manufacturer's recommendations. Free dye was separated from labeled LPS by passage through a sizing column (PD-10 column; Amersham Biosciences). The bioreactivity of the labeled LPS preparations was comparable with unlabeled LPS. Labeled LPS was preincubated in PBS plus 5% human serum (Sigma), human rsCD14 (5 μg/ml), and human rLBP (1 μg/ml) for 10 min prior to use. Adherent HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and incubated with Cy5-conjugated LPS for the indicated times at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, and suspended in cold growth medium, washed twice by centrifugation at 200 × g in ice-cold PBS, and analyzed by FACS at an excitation frequency of 633 nm. Antibodies were bound to sterile 96-well high protein binding plates (Costar) by overnight incubation at 4 °C in PBS. After extensive washing with PBS, 4 × 105 (HEK) or 7 × 105 cells (PBMCs) were plated in each well and incubated for 5–12 h. Supernatants were analyzed for IL-8 (DuoSet; R&D) or TNF-α (Diaclone) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells are deficient in all of the known members of the LPS signaling receptor, including TLR4, MD-2, and CD14. Thus, HEK293 cells are normally unresponsive to LPS. Additionally, HEK293 cells do not express TLR2 or TLR9 and likewise are unresponsive to the respective stimulatory molecules known to activate these receptors. We and others have observed that HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4 gain LPS responsiveness if they are either co-transfected with MD-2 or stimulated in the presence of conditioned medium rich in recombinant soluble MD-2 (11Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Google Scholar, 12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar, 22Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Google Scholar). HEK293 cells that stably express TLR4YFP, TLR2YFP, or control cDNA (TNFRYFP or empty vector-pcDNA) were established. The stable cell lines were transiently co-transfected with a reporter construct in that firefly luciferase is under the control of the transcription factor NF-κB and stimulated with the microbial cell wall components LPS and the Mycoplasma fermentans-derived membrane lipopeptide MALP-2. LPS conferred responsiveness to cells expressing TLR4YFP, whereas MALP-2 selectively activated TLR2YFP-expressing cells (Fig.1 A). The responses observed were indistinguishable from responses observed in transfected HEK293 cells using TLR constructs that do not include an epitope tag (data not shown). Proper cellular responses to TLR2 or TLR4 engaging stimuli by the chimeric constructs were further illustrated by a time-dependent decrease of total IκB-a and nuclear translocation of NF-κB as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay or immunofluorescence and confocal imaging (not shown). All of the various stable cell lines were tested and were equally reactive to IL-1b, TNF-α, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 1 Aand data not shown). The responsiveness was similar in each of several clones tested regardless of which C-terminal tag (CFP, GFP, or YFP) was used. Unlike prior observations with N-terminally FLAG-tagged constructs, expression of these chimeric proteins at the C terminus did not result in appreciable constitutive NF-κB activation (data not shown). Thus, fusion proteins of TLR4 and TLR2 with fluorescent tags at the C terminus are functional signaling receptors that confer both specific and sensitive recognition of their cognate ligands in HEK293 cells. The use of GFP or the spectral variants CFP and YFP as a protein tag allows protein function and dynamics to be investigated within the environment of the living cell. The tagged constructs were designed so that the subcellular localization of the TLR receptors remained directed by their native signal sequences rather than by a signal sequence contained in the vector, as is commonly done when employing FLAG-tagged proteins. Cells were grown on glass bottom tissue culture dishes and observed at 37 °C. TLR4YFP was primarily expressed in two different subcellular localizations. We observed plasma membrane expression and localization in a defined juxtanuclear area. Surface staining for TLR4 using a monoclonal antibody (HTA125) revealed a clear surface expression of the protein independently of the fluorescent protein tag used (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, human monocytes expressed significant levels of both TLR4 and TLR2. Surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody, followed by Western blot with avidin-HRP, revealed that only the heavily glycosylated mature forms of TLR4 and MD-2 (Fig.2 B) are expressed on the cell surface. We tested whether TLR2 would bind to MD-2 or whether TLR4 would bind MD-1 under identical experimental conditions but failed to observe co-localization of these protein pairs (data not shown) (12Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.A. Segal D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12156-12161Google Scholar). These results suggest that both TLR4 and MD-2 follow the trans-Golgi secretory pathway and reside on the cell surface as a mature protein complex. We next sought to identify the intracellular compartment that is enriched in TLR4. A fluorescent subcellular localization marker for the Golgi complex consisting of the Golgi-targeting sequence of human β-galactosyltransferase fused to CFP co-localized with the juxtanuclear compartment positive for TLR4 (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, fluorescent ceramide, which is known to enrich in Golgi membranes (23Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Science. 1985; 228: 745-747Google Scholar), also co-localized with juxtanuclear TLR4YFP(Fig. 2 B). These studies identify the juxtanuclear region enriched in TLR4 as the Golgi apparatus. To determine whether the localization pattern of TLR4 was an artifact of transfection and overexpression or reasonably reflected the distribution of TLR4 in native cells, we stained human monocytes with a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody. FACS analysis of monocytes revealed detectable TLR4 on the surface of these cells (Fig. 1 C). Intracellular staining of purified monocytes clearly showed that TLR4 is also expressed in a defined juxtanuclear region (Fig.2 C), consistent with the conclusion that TLR4 resides both on the cell surface and in the Golgi. The Golgi complex is an intracellular compartment that is specialized for secretory traffic. Newly synthesized proteins and lipids are received from the ER by the Golgi complex and are covalently modified in preparation for delivery to their final destination (such as plasma membrane, lysosomes, secretory granules) or to be recycled back to the ER. In addition to these sorting and filtering capabilities, the Golgi complex recycles plasma membrane components that are retrieved by endocytosis (17Lippincott-Schwartz J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 97-107Google Scholar, 24Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Google Scholar). The physical properties of GFP allow the GFP chimera to be used in a technique known as FRAP. After GFP or its spectral variants are excited with very high illumination, these fluorophores are readily photobleached, a process that irreversibly extinguishes the fluorescence. When performing FRAP, a small area of interest in the cell is rapidly photobleached by applying scans with a high powered laser beam. Thereafter, the movement of nonbleached fluorophores into the photobleached area can be recorded at low illumination. Fluorescence recovery gives insights in the diffusional properties of the reporter chimera. We employed FRAP to investigate whether membrane-expressed TLR4YFP would cycle back to the Golgi complex after photobleaching of Golgi-associated TLR4YFP. Application of repetitive scans with full laser power to the Golgi almost completely extinguished the Golgi-localized fluorescence, whereas neither the surrounding areas nor the neighboring cells were affected (Fig.3 A). Observation of fluorescence recovery revealed a fast and complete recovery of Golgi fluorescence. Over 90% of the Golgi-associated fluorescence was recovered within 4 min after photobleaching, indicating rapid lateral movement of TLR4YFP between cell compartments. We next questioned whether the recovery of Golgi fluorescence after FRAP is primarily due to new protein synthesis or represents the recycling of TLR4YFP from the membrane pool to the Golgi apparatus. To address this question, cells were preincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for 2 h prior to FRAP. The recovery of Golgi fluorescence observed in the cycloheximide-treated cells was nearly identical to that seen in untreated cells, indicating that rapid transport of TLR4 from the plasma membrane replenished T"
https://openalex.org/W1562919767,"Abstract Infrared absorption spectra of poly-l-lysine, poly-l-glutamic acid, β-lactoglobulin, myoglobin, and αs-casein in the region of absorption of the amide I band have been observed in H2O solution, D2O solution, and in the solid state. The results indicate that characteristic frequencies exhibited by specific conformations of the investigated synthetic polypeptides are not transferable to corresponding conformations of globular proteins. The frequencies obtained for different conformations of globular proteins in H2O and D2O solution are internally consistent, in general agreement with corresponding values of fibrous proteins and with the limited data available in the literature concerning deuterated proteins in D2O solution. Dissolution in aqueous environment by itself does not noticeably alter the amide I frequencies. A tentative set of characteristic frequencies and interaction constants is obtained for the amide I' modes of N-deuterated proteins. These modes are easily observed in D2O solution and show sufficient variations in frequency to permit a distinction between the α-helical, the antiparallel-chain pleated sheet, and the solvated random configurations of globular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1536730092,"Abstract Several pieces of evidence have been established which indicate that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate is the intracellular mediator of the action of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on the adrenal cortex. 1. Increases in adrenal cyclic AMP concentrations induced by ACTH occurred before increases in the rate of adrenal steroidogenesis. 2. Increasing doses of ACTH produced increasing concentrations of adrenal cyclic AMP as steroidogenesis was progressively stimulated, and adrenal concentrations of cyclic AMP remained elevated while the rate of steroidogenesis was maintained. 3. The potency of analogues of ACTH in producing stimulation of adrenal steroidogenesis was reflected in their potency in producing increases in adrenal cyclic AMP concentration. 4. ACTH increased cyclic AMP levels not only in adrenal quarters in vitro and in intact adrenals in vivo but also in adrenal homogenates under conditions which suggested that ACTH was acting to increase adenyl cyclase activity. In addition, cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, although known to inhibit the steroidogenic effects of ACTH or exogenous cyclic AMP did not antagonize the increase in cyclic AMP concentration induced by ACTH. Thus, cycloheximide and, by inference, the newly synthesized protein thought to be involved in steroidogenesis would appear to act at a site past adenyl cyclase. NADPH, which stimulates steroidogenesis but is not antagonized by cycloheximide, had no effect on cyclic AMP levels. This suggests that NADPH acts either at a point distal to both the mechanism producing increased cyclic AMP and past that at which inhibitors of protein synthesis interfere with the reactions leading to stimulation of steroidogenesis, or by a different mechanism. Finally, at a time after hypophysectomy when adrenal weight had fallen and the acute adrenal steroidogenic response to ACTH had disappeared, the sensitivity of the adrenal cyclic AMP response to ACTH was undiminished. The ability of the atropic adrenal to accumulate cyclic AMP in response to ACTH was compatible with the hypothesis that cyclic AMP is involved in the mechanism for the restitution of adrenal growth and steroidogenic capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1503117575,"Abstract α-Mannosidase was purified approximately 500-fold from jack bean meal. This enzyme was able to hydrolyze α-1,6', α-1,2'-, and α-1,3'-linked oligomannosides, but not phenyl-β-d-mannoside and β-1,4'-linked mannobiose. Approximately 5% of the total mannose present in the yeast mannan was set free by α-mannosidase after prolonged incubation. The fact that no sugars other than mannose were detected in the mannan digests indicates that this enzyme is not a polysaccharidase (endoenzyme) in nature. The enzyme hydrolyzes mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannotetraose derived from yeast mannan. The Km values obtained were: p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannoside, 2.5 x 10-3 m; benzyl-α-d-mannoside, 3.1 x 10-2 m; methyl-α-d-mannoside, 1.2 x 10-1 m. The enzyme was competitively inhibited by mannono-(1 → 4)- and (1 → 5)-lactone. With p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannoside as substrate, Ki values for (1 → 4)- and (1 → 5)-lactone were 1.0 x 10-2 m and 1.2 x 10-4 m, respectively. α-Mannosidase catalyzes hydrolysis, glycosyl transfer, and synthesis. One of the two disaccharides synthesized from mannose by α-mannosidase was identified as α-1,6'-linked mannobiose."

The observation that assembly intermediates comprising αγ or αβ dimers displayed some benzodiazepine or agonist binding, respectively (29Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), supported conclusions drawn from the former mutation studies. From the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (30Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar), a protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the other members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, we can deduce the absolute position of the amino acid residues involved in the formation of agonist and drug-binding sites in a subunit in the pentamer. However, this acetylcholine-binding protein is a homopentamer and gives no information about the arrangement of the heteromeric GABAA receptors. In a former study (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) we expressed α-β and β-α tandem constructs in combination with single γ subunits inXenopus oocytes and investigated the function of the formed receptors. The results suggested a possible arrangement γβαβα; however, some uncertainty remained. From this work it also was not clear whether exclusively one or several arrangements of a given set of subunits is possible. In the present study we aimed to express GABAA receptors from various combinations of linked constructs containing two and three subunits. A single pentameric arrangement made of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits was found to result in functional ion channels. We describe its properties toward the agonist GABA, the competitive antagonist bicuculline, and the positive allosteric modulator diazepam. The described techniques will allow forced assembly and functional study of GABAA and related receptors of defined subunit arrangements. For simplicity, we use the following: α for modified rat α1, β for rat β2, and γ for rat γ2. The modified rat α subunit differs from the rat α by one amino acid residue, which confers the subunit-specific bd24 antibody recognition (32Ewert M. Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The antibody only reacts if the N-terminal of the α subunit is free. Therefore, the same test was not feasible for most of the present constructs. Other evidence was used to make proteolysis unlikely (see below). Tandem constructs for γ-β, β-γ, γ-α, and α-γ with various linker lengths were made similar as described in Baumannet al. (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the following, numbers between two subunit symbols describe the length of the introduced synthetic linker. Triple constructs were prepared from tandem constructs as exemplified for the γ-26-β-23-α (γ-β-α) construct. The γ-26-β (γ-β) tandem construct was cut by HindIII in the β subunit and the vector behind the gene to yield a 7-kb fragment containing the sequence of the vector, the γ2 subunit, the linker, and the beginning of the β2 subunit. This vector fragment was dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mmMgCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C. The β-23-α (β-α) (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) tandem construct was cut by HindIII in the β subunit and the vector behind the gene to yield a 2-kb fragment containing the sequence of the second half of the β subunit, the linker, and the α subunit. The two fragments were ligated, and proper ligation was checked by restriction analysis. The construct α-10-β-23-α (α-β-α) was made accordingly from α-10-β (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and β-23-α. The triple constructs β-23-α-10-γ (β-α-γ, from β-23-α and α-10-γ), γ-23-α-10-β (γ-α-β, from γ-23-α and α-10-β), and β-23-α-10-β (β-α-β from β-23-α and α-10-β) were prepared similarly using BamHI. The following linkers have been introduced: γ-26-β: Q5A3PAQ2(QA)2A2PA2Q5, α-10-γ: Q10, γ-23-α: Q3(Q2A3PA)2AQ5. Capped cRNAs were synthesized (Ambion, Austin, TX) from the linearized pCMV vectors containing the different tandem or triple constructs or the single α1, β2, and γ2subunits, respectively, and from the vector pVA2580 (34Kuhn F.J. Greeff N.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 167-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) encoding a neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (Na). A poly-A tail of about 400 residues was added to each transcript using yeast poly-A polymerase (USB, Cleveland, OH). The concentration of the cRNA was quantified on a formaldehyde gel using Radiant Red stain (Bio-Rad) for visualization of the RNA and known concentrations of RNA ladder (Invitrogen) as standard on the same gel. cRNA combinations of triple/Na, triple/α/Na, triple/β/Na, triple/α-β/Na, triple/β-α/Na (triple = γ-β-α, γ-α-β, or β-α-γ), β-α/γ2/Na, β-α-β/α-γ/Na, and α-β-α/γ-β/Na were precipitated in ethanol/isoamylalcohol (19:1) and stored at −20 °C. For injection, the alcohol was removed and the cRNAs were dissolved in water. Isolation of oocytes from the frogs, culturing of the oocytes, injection of cRNA, and defolliculation were done as described earlier (35Sigel E. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of the cRNA solution. For cRNA combinations of the γ2-containing triple constructs with the tandem construct, ratios of 50:10 nm and 10:10 nm were investigated. The combination of single α1, β2, and γ2 subunits was expressed at 10:10:50 nm. To allow standardization of expressed GABA currents cRNA coding for the voltage-gated sodium channel was always added to a concentration of 40 nm. The injected oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 18 °C for 2 days before the measurements. All measurements were done in medium containing 90 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at a holding potential of −80 mV. For the determination of maximal current amplitudes 1 mm GABA (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was applied for 20 s. Voltage-dependent sodium currents were determined by a potential jump from a holding potential of −100 to −15 mV. As the modes of activation of the GABA receptor channel and the voltage-dependent sodium channel differ, the measurements of the two channels do not interfere with each other. The GABA-evoked peak current amplitude was standardized to the co-expressed sodium current amplitude of the same oocyte. The mean standardized current amplitude of at least 3 oocytes per subunit combination was then compared with the mean standardized wild type current amplitude. GABA-evoked currents (at 8–12% of the maximal current amplitude) were inhibited by varying concentrations of bicuculline methiodide (RBI). Relative current stimulation by diazepam was determined at a GABA concentration evoking 2–5% of the maximal current amplitude in combination with varying concentrations of diazepam (DZ) (Roche) and expressed as ((I(GABA+DZ)/I(GABA))−1)×100%. We have shown previously (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that it is feasible to covalently link α and β subunits of the GABAA receptor while retaining full receptor function (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These linked constructs allowed us to propose a possible arrangement of subunits in the α1β2γ2 receptor. However, some uncertainty remained due to a possible rearrangement of dual subunit constructs. We now have linked three subunits in different sequence and expressed them in combination with tandem constructs. Triple subunit constructs unlike dual subunit constructs cannot rearrange for topological reasons. In the following, the sequence of subunits in multiple subunit constructs is always described as the C-terminal of the first subunit linked to the N-terminal of the second subunit. To link the γ subunit to either side of the existing tandem constructs α-10-β and β-23-α, linker lengths for the new connections had to be established. To test functionality of these linkers, dual constructs α-γ, γ-α, β-γ, or γ-β were co-expressed with α-β or β-α constructs and single α or β subunits to yield receptors of the composition 2α2β1γ, e.g.γ-β/α-β/α (data not shown). The required linker lengths for functional expression were found to be 26 amino acid residues for γ-β, 10 amino acid residues for α-γ, and 23 residues for γ-α. For a β-γ tandem construct, linkers up to 25 amino acid residues in length were tested but were found to result only in very small functional channel expression. In the following, the triple constructs γ-β-α, β-α-γ, γ-α-β, β-α-β, and α-β-α were prepared. If the presence of 2α, 2β, and 1γ subunit(s) in a pentamer is assumed, six different arrangements of α, β, and γ subunits are possible (Fig. 1). Of this stoichiometry we tested first arrangements containing one γ and two each of α and β in an alternating fashion. Assembly studies of Tretter et al. (15Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest such an alternating arrangement because expression of either α and γ or β and γ leads to dimers only. In these cases either a β or α subunit is missing, respectively, to continue assembly. Expression of α and β, in contrast, leads to the formation of tetra- and pentamers. Two alternating arrangements are possible, namely γβαβα and γαβαβ. They are the most probable arrangements as they seem to contain the inferred two αβ and αγ subunit interfaces required for the formation of two GABA- and one benzodiazepine-binding sites. As the subunits are not symmetrical, only one of these two alternating arrangements is predicted to form the correct subunit interfaces for establishing binding sites. With our triple construct γ-α-β we show that the arrangement γαβαβ is not functional (Fig.2, second column). This was not unexpected after the earlier finding, which showed that expression of the α-β construct with single γ subunits resulted in decreased current amplitudes as compared with wild type receptors. γ-β-α did not result in functional channels upon expression in combination with γ, α-β, or γ-α, or very tiny currents in combination with α or β (Fig. 2, columns 4–8). In contrast, γ-β-α could be complemented with β-α (Fig.3). Similarly, β-α-γ cannot be complemented by α, β, or α-β (Fig. 2, columns 9–11) but by β-α (Fig. 3).Figure 3Maximal current amplitudes evoked by 1 mm GABA for several combinations of triple constructs with tandem constructs shown to result in the functional expression.The GABA-evoked current amplitudes were standardized to the current amplitude of the voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in the same oocyte. Measurements were in each case done in 5–6 oocytes from two different batches of oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These observations all pointed to a channel with the subunit arrangement γβαβα. Fig. 3 shows indeed the successful functional expression of channels from different combinations of triple and dual subunit constructs. All these combinations (γ-β-α/β-α, β-α-γ/β-α, β-α-β/α-γ, and α-β-α/γ-β) actually result in the identical arrangement of subunits around the pore, and they can be seen as permutations of the positions of the linkers around the five subunits (Fig.4). When β-α-γ was expressed in combination with β-α at a stoichiometry of 1:1, currents amounted only to about 25% (10 oocytes, 2 batches of oocytes) of the amplitude observed upon expression of loose subunits α, β, and γ at 1:1:5. Normal expression levels were observed for β-α-γ and β-α expressed at 5:1 (Fig. 3). The reason for this increased requirement for β-α-γ is not clear. As mentioned before, receptors with a different stoichiometry and/or arrangement from the one discussed above were also tested for functional expression. Triple constructs γ-α-β and β-α-γ and dual constructs α-β and β-α (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) when expressed alone did not result in functional channel expression. From the measurements of maximal current amplitudes evoked by application of GABA (Fig. 2) we can also exclude the arrangements γβααα, γβαββ, γβααβ, γααβα, γβββα, γαββα, γαβγγ, γβαγγ, and γβαγα. These results make it very likely that γβαβα is indeed the functional arrangement of the α1β2γ2receptor. The fact that no or very small currents were observed during linker length optimization and for many of the above mentioned subunit combinations indicates that proteolysis in the linker regions is not occurring to a significant extent. Small currents as observed, for example, for γ-β-α/α and γ-β-α/β can be thought to reflect mis-assembled channels. These channels are not necessarily silent, but are not formed to a significant extent. To characterize receptors with the subunit arrangement γβαβα made from linked constructs we investigated their response properties to the agonist GABA and the competitive antagonist bicuculline. First, we studied the GABA concentration-response properties of the tandem construct β-α in combination with single γ2 subunits. Compared with receptors made from single subunits (wild type) we observed a slight rightward shift (2.4-fold; Fig. 5 B). A similar 2-fold shift had already been observed for the combination of β-α with single β subunits (31Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36275-36280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Next, three of four combinations of triple constructs with tandem constructs that were proven functional before (Fig. 3) were characterized in their GABA concentration-response properties. Fig. 5 A shows representative current traces obtained with the subunit combination. All of them behaved very similarly, showing properties similar to wild type receptors regarding EC50 values (Fig. 5 and TableI). β-α-β/α-γ was only analyzed twice and had an average EC50 of 124 μm in these experiments.Table IAgonist, competitive antagonist, and benzodiazepine modulatory properties of identically arranged γβαβα receptors but made from different combinations of triple and dual subunit constructs.

The obtained bicuculline concentration-response curves were very similar to those of the receptor made from single subunits. Table I summarizes the agonist and competitive antagonist properties of the different constructs. From these results we can conclude that the linkers used here between the subunits have little influence on the apparent affinity for GABA induced channel opening and the inhibition by bicuculline. It has earlier been observed that stimulation by diazepam of currents elicited by GABA in oocytes expressing α:β:γ = 1:1:1 is smaller and more variable than in oocytes expressing α:β:γ = 1:1:5 (36Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was interesting to examine receptors formed from triple and tandem constructs in this respect. The response to increasing concentrations of diazepam did not markedly differ from receptors containing loose subunits (Fig.7) regarding the concentration-dependence of current stimulation. However, there was a difference regarding maximal stimulation and variability in different oocytes of this value. Although stimulation by diazepam of currents elicited by GABA in oocytes expressing α:β:γ = 1:1:5 centered at about 170% and was quite variable in different oocytes, a value of about 270% with little variation was observed, provided the γ2 subunit was covalently linked to other subunits to give γ-β-α/β-α. Fig. 8 documents this by comparing diazepam stimulation in oocytes either expressing α:β:γ = 1:1:5 or covalently linked constructs γ-β-α:β-α = 1:1. The combinations β-α-γ/β-α, α-β-α/γ-β, and β-α/γ also showed values for maximal stimulation, which were higher than those found for wild type receptors and had small variations (data not shown). It has been observed earlier that the stimulation by diazepam decreases in oocytes injected with cRNA coding for α, β, and γ during expression time (36Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This phenomenon seemed not to occur in oocytes expressing linked subunits (not shown).Figure 8Comparison in extent and variability of the relative current stimulation by diazepam in α/β/γ GABAAreceptors and covalently linked γ-β-α/β-α receptors.

We examined receptors made from combinations of triple and dual subunit constructs containing α1, β2, and/or γ2subunits in different orders. We present direct evidence that α1β2γ2 receptors have a subunit composition and relative arrangement of γβαβα from N-terminal to C-terminal. It should be stated that we restricted ourselves to looking at the ability of the subunit combinations to form functional ion channels. For combinations that did not result in function, we cannot say at present whether this is due to insufficient stability of constructs, or due to assembly problems, or whether the receptors reach the surface membrane and are unable to open. The majority of GABAA receptors contains α, β, and γ subunits (9Benke D. Fritschy J.M. Trzeciak A. Bannwarth W. Möhler H. J. Biol.

This subunit composition can be reached by combining either three subunits of one type with one subunit each of the other two types or two subunits each from two types with one subunit of the third type. The former stoichiometry has been excluded for α3β2γ2 and α1β2γ2 receptors by electrophysiological characterization of mutant receptors (13Backus K.H. Arigoni M. Drescher U. Scheurer L. Malherbe P. Möhler H. Benson J.A. Neuroreport. 1993; 5: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the latter stoichiometry both receptors with 2α2β1γ and 2α1β2γ have been suggested. A 2α2β1γ stoichiometry is favored by electrophysiological data (14Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), investigations using immunoprecipitation (15Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that also two γ subunits can occur within the same pentamer. This possibility has been suggested on the basis of co-occurrence of isoforms of the γ subunit within the same receptor molecule, where γ2γ3 and γ2Sγ2L pairings have been detected in immunoprecipitation experiments (41Khan Z.U. Gutierrez A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Quirk K. Gillard N.P. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. McKernan R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). We found that only combinations of triple and dual constructs, which resulted in the arrangement γβαβα, therefore containing 2α, 2β, and 1γ subunit(s), were functionally expressed with properties very similar to receptors made from single subunits. Combinations of subunits and/or linked subunit constructs that would result in a different stoichiometry or a different arrangement were not functional. Our study is limited to α1, β2, and γ2containing receptors. It is not clear whether receptors containing different isoforms of these subunit types have the same stoichiometry and arrangement as the α1β2γ2receptor. Taking into account that for the formation of GABA-binding sites defined interfaces must be formed, it is likely that all αβγ, αβδ, and αβε (4Whiting P.J. McAllister G. Vassilatis D. Bonnert T.P.

Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) receptors follow the same building plan. When we expressed triple constructs in combination with tandem constructs to form γβαβα receptors we observed concentration-response properties of the resulting receptors very similar to receptors made from single, individual subunits. The linkers between the subunits do not strongly affect function. Only in one case did we observe a slight decrease in the Hill coefficient. This coefficient is 1.0 in the case of γ-β-α/β-α as compared with 1.2–1.4 for all other receptors (Table I). This observation might indicate a slightly altered gating behavior of the receptor channel. Horenstein et al. (44Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) suggested an asymmetric turning of the subunits upon channel opening. They investigated αβ receptors and proposed that 4 subunits (2α and 2β) turn in the same direction, whereas 1β subunit turns in the opposite direction. This β subunit can be thought to be replaced by the γ subunit in the αβγ receptor. In this case the linker between γ and β in the γ-β-α construct could impair the suggested movement of the linked subunits, which could lead to the observed decrease of the Hill coefficient. This movement, however, did not seem to be disturbed in the γ-β dual construct when expressed in combination with the α-β-α triple construct (not shown). A dual subunit construct might be more flexible than a triple construct. Introduction of a shorter linker into the triple construct could confirm the above hypothesis. For all receptors formed from linked subunits we observed a 2.0–3.5-fold shift to the right in the GABA concentration-response curves compared with receptors made from single subunits. On one hand this shift could be due to changed binding or gating properties of the receptor pentamers by linkage. On the other hand it has been observed frequently that expression of single α, β, and γ subunits in oocytes or HEK cells leads to a mixed population of αβγ and αβ receptors (36Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The EC50 of αβ receptors is about 8 μm, that of αβγ receptors about 41 μm (45Sigel E. Baur R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2590-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Expression of linked constructs does not allow the formation of pentameric αβ receptors, and the 2.0–3.5-fold shift of the concentration-response curve further to the right could at least be partly due to expression of pure αβγ receptors. This view is supported by the markedly higher stimulation of GABA-induced currents by diazepam of receptors made from linked subunits. Presence of αβ in αβγ receptors decreases apparent diazepam stimulation (36Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our approach leads to the relative sequence of subunits in the receptor only, and does not allow a statement about the absolute arrangement,e.g. the sequence when viewed from the synaptic cleft. The determination of the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (30Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) leads to an insight into the absolute configuration of the extracellular parts of the subunits and interfaces of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The acetylcholine-binding protein is a bacterial protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of higher organisms. The GABAA receptor belongs to the same superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels and is therefore structurally homologous to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The knowledge of amino acid residues that form agonist and benzodiazepine-binding sites, respectively (for review see Ref. 27Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) allows us to conclude on which side of the α subunit γ and β subunits are positioned when viewed from the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the absolute arrangement of the α1β2γ2 receptor is very likely γβαβα from the N terminus to the C terminus, read in anti-clockwise direction when viewed from the synaptic cleft (Fig. 9). This work will allow the study of the roles of any individual site located on an α or β subunit, which was impossible thus far because there were always two sites on the two subunits affected by a mutation in 2α2β1γ GABAA receptors. The possibility of a forced subunit assembly will enable targeted introduction of a mutation in only one subunit. This will, for example, allow dissection of the two low affinity agonist sites located at the αβ subunit interface. Forced subunit assembly will have further impact on the characterization of receptor forms containing different isoforms of the same subunit subtypes. Receptors that are made of 4 or 5 different subunits cannot be analyzed by recombinant expression of the mixture of the single subunits because many different receptor subtypes can be formed. Expression of predefined sequences of subunits in triple and tandem constructs will allow the study of pharmacological properties of defined receptor isoforms. As the GABAA receptor belongs to a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, methods described here are applicable to neuronal and non-neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine receptors, and 5HT3 receptors. We thank Heleen van Hees for help in preparing the linked subunit constructs and Dr. V. Niggli for carefully reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1510972791,"Abstract Collagen extracted from the diaphyseal region of the tibiae of normal and lathyritic chicks with 0.5 m acetic acid and 5 m guanidine hydrochloride at neutral pH has been studied with regard to chain organization and amino acid composition. Decalcification by dialysis against large quantities of 0.5 m acetic acid and subsequent exposure of the decalcified bones to fresh 0.5 m acetic acid followed by 5 m guanidine resulted in the solubilization of 85% of the total collagen in the bones from lathyritic animals. Collagen in the bones of control animals was almost entirely resistant to extraction with 0.5 m acetic acid, and less than 20% of the total collagen could be extracted in 5 m guanidine. These observations suggest a high degree of intermolecular cross-linking. Chromatography of the collagen extracted by both solvents from the bones of lathyritic animals on columns of carboxymethyl cellulose indicated that the extracts were composed almost entirely of single- and double-chain components. Carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography of the collagen extracted with 5 m guanidine from the bones of normal chicks revealed that only 30% of the dissolved collagen (5% of the total collagen) could be recovered as these components. Chromatography on an agarose molecular sieve column showed that the remainder could be accounted for in part by high molecular weight aggregates and in part by low molecular weight, degraded material. These results suggest that bone collagen fibrils are stabilized through the formation of intra- and intermolecular cross-links and that lathyrogens exert their effects by inhibiting cross-link formation, as previously shown for soft tissue collagens. The extractability of normal bone collagen in guanidine appears to result from degradation in the presence of the denaturing agent to yield a highly heterogeneous mixture. Carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography of acid-extracted collagen from the bones of lathyritic animals indicated that the bone collagen molecule contains two chains (α1) that are identical or similar and one chain (α2) that is unlike the other two. Their compositions are analogous to those of other vertebrate collagens. Amino acid analyses of the chromatographically separated α chains in successive extracts of collagen from the lathyritic bones indicated that during development there was a progressive decrease in hydroxylysine content, accompanied by an equivalent increase in lysine content, with no significant change in the content of any other amino acid. This observation was verified by amino acid analyses of the total bone collagen of normal chicks of various ages. The hydroxylysine content decreased by nearly one-half, from 11 to 6 residues per 1000, between the 1st and the 49th day after hatching. This result suggests that the hydroxylation of bone collagen lysyl residues is dependent in part upon factors extrinsic to the collagen molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1546257885,"Abstract 1. A peroxidase was purified from the particulate fraction of hog thyroid tissue by solubilization with trypsin, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, and filtration through Biogel P-100. The final product, although not homogeneous, represented about a 400-fold purification over the starting particulate fraction. 2. The molecular weight of thyroid peroxidase was estimated by gel filtration studies. Elution volumes of proteins of known molecular weight were compared with the elution volume of the peroxidase, the latter being localized by its enzyme activity. The average molecular weight in three determinations was 64,000. 3. An absorption maximum was observed at 410 mµ, suggestive of a hemoprotein. The progressive increase in A410:A280 during the purification procedure suggested that the enzyme activity was associated with a hemoprotein. Inhibitor studies provided further support for this view. 4. When supplemented with H2O2 or, more effectively, with the H2O2-generating system, glucose-glucose oxidase, purified thyroid peroxidase readily catalyzed the iodination of protein, free tyrosine, or free monoiodotyrosine. Iodination was catalyzed over a wide range of iodide concentrations, from l10-7 m to g5 x 10-3 m. In an incubation system containing 1.2 µg of peroxidase, 0.5 mg of purified thyroglobulin, 1.0 mg of glucose, 0.83 µg of glucose oxidase, and I- varying from 50 µm to 4 mm, in 1.0 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, Vmax was 1.2 mµmoles of I- per min per µg of enzyme protein and Km was 2.5 x 10-4 m I-. 5. No consistent effect of pH on iodination was observed in the range, pH 5 to 7 (the only range tested). Iodination occurred about as readily at pH 5 as at pH 7. 6. During the peroxidase-catalyzed iodination of thyroglobulin or other protein, iodide was rapidly bound as 3-monoiodotyrosine, 3,5-diiodotyrosine, and thyroxine. The best yields of thyroxine were obtained with thyroglobulin as acceptor. The formation of 3',3,5-triiodothyronine was not observed. 7. The iodination of protein by thyroid peroxidase was markedly inhibited by low concentrations of antithyroid drugs. This was true for compounds of the aromatic inhibitor group—resorcinol, p-aminobenzoic acid, sulfathiazole, and others—as well as those of the thioamide group—thiourea, thiouracil, and 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole. Glutathione and thiocyanate were also effective inhibitors, but perchlorate was not. Inhibition by 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole and by thiocyanate was competitive with iodide under certain conditions. 8. Cyanides, and especially azide, were potent inhibitors of thyroid peroxidase, supporting the view that enzyme activity was associated with a hemoprotein. 9. At pH 5.0, iodination of thyroglobulin or of bovine serum albumin with thyroid peroxidase was inhibited at concentrations of I- greater than 1 x 10-4 m. This suggests a possible mechanism for the antithyroid action of excess iodide. However, for reasons which are not yet clear, this inhibition was not observed at pH 7.0. 10. Results obtained with purified thyroid peroxidase support the view that it is unnecessary to postulate the existence of a separate tyrosine iodinase in the thyroid gland. Moreover, the findings suggest that a peroxidase may be involved in the coupling reaction as well as in iodination of protein in the thyroid. 11. No evidence was obtained that 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid is an intermediate in thyroxine formation during the iodination of thyroglobulin with thyroid peroxidase. The results of this study favor the view that the coupling of diiodotyrosine to form thyroxine occurs within the matrix of the protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1610778995,"Abstract Polylysyl transfer ribonucleic acid, free of lysyl-tRNA, has been isolated and its characteristics in an Escherichia coli polypeptide-synthesizing system in vitro have been studied. Ribosomes obtained from frozen E. coli cells were washed in 0.5 m NH4Cl and assayed at MgCl2 concentrations of at least 0.01 m. Binding of this peptidyl-tRNA to ribosomes occurs in the presence of templates containing 3 or more adenylic acid residues. p-Chloromercuriphenylsulfonate or lysyl-tRNA prevents this attachment. Binding occurs most effectively when both 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subparticles are present. Unlike lysyl-tRNA, bound polylysyl-tRNA reacts with puromycin in the absence of added GTP and supernatant factors. The product of this reaction was shown to be polylysylpuromycin. Under analogous conditions, a limited incorporation of lysine into bound polylysyl-tRNA can be shown. In this limited addition reaction, a polyadenylate template longer than three nucleotides is required. Chlortetracycline is a strong inhibitor of the limited addition of lysine to polylysyl-tRNA, but is without effect on the cleavage of polylysyl-tRNA by puromycin. Chloramphenicol, on the other hand, inhibits the reaction between polylysyl-tRNA and puromycin, but has little influence on the limited addition reaction. Gougerotin, a puromycin-like antibiotic, inhibits the puromycin reaction. Phenylalanyl-tRNA reacts poorly with puromycin in the presence of ribosomes and oligouridylate, whereas N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA is cleaved extensively, forming N-acetylphenylalanylpuromycin. Phenyllactyl-tRNA, although capable of binding to ribosomes, displays no detectable reactivity with puromycin. Chloramphenicol completely inhibits the cleavage of N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA by puromycin."

https://openalex.org/W1866192246,"Abstract Homogeneous preparations of apotryptophanase from Escherichia coli required pyridoxal phosphate and K+ or NH4+ ions for activity. The hydrodynamic properties of the apoenzyme vary greatly with the ionic environment and the temperature, and differ markedly from those of holotryptophanase derived from the apoenzyme by interaction with pyridoxal-P. At room temperature and pH 8.0 apotryptophanase exists as a tetramer (mol wt 220,000; s020,w 9.5 S), which dissociates reversibly at low temperature and protein concentration to a dimer (mol wt 110,000; s020,w 6.0 S) when K+ or Na+ is present, but not when these cations are replaced by imidazole. Reversible dissociation to the dimer also occurs at room temperature in the presence of very low concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate or when the pH is increased moderately; at higher pH values or sodium dodecyl sulfate concentrations, irreversible dissociation to a monomer (s020,w 3.0 to 3.3 S; mol wt 55,000) occurs. On addition of pyridoxal-P to tetrameric apotryptophanase at 20° in the presence of K+ a major conformational change occurs, as indicated by an increase in s020,w from 9.5 to 10.5 S and a decrease in intrinsic viscosity from 5.55 to 3.80 ml per g without any change in the molecular weight. In contrast to the apoenzyme, the resulting tetrameric holoenzyme does not dissociate to dimer at low temperature and high dilutions; irreversible dissociation to an enzymatically inactive monomer is produced by sodium dodecyl sulfate, but only at concentrations much higher than those required to dissociate the apoenzyme. The equilibrium constant for dissociation of tetrameric to dimeric apotryptophanase increases with decreases in temperature, but the free energy change remains positive at 4°. The enthalpy and entropy changes were calculated to be -50 kcal and -198 e.u., respectively, per mole of tetramer, suggesting the predominantly hydrophobic nature of the bonds between the two dimeric subunits in the tetrameric apoenzyme. On addition of pyridoxal-P to dimeric apoenzyme at 5°, tetrameric holoenzyme is formed. The combination of apoenzyme with pyridoxal-P, measured spectrophotometrically, is a linear function of pyridoxal-P concentration, whereas association of dimer to tetramer shows a sigmoidal relation to the concentration of pyridoxal-P, suggesting a coordinative association of dimeric subunits after their partial saturation with coenzyme. By either criterion, the reaction is complete when 4 moles of coenzyme per mole of tetramer are added. At higher molar ratios pyridoxine-P, pyridoxamine-P, and 5'-phosphopyridoxyltryptophan also promote conversion of dimer to tetramer, indicating that azomethine formation between pyridoxal-P and apotryptophanase is not required to produce the pronounced conformational change that occurs upon holoenzyme formation. The magnitude of this change depends also upon the ionic environment. In the presence of K+, Na+, or imidazole under otherwise identical conditions, tetrameric holotryptophanase shows values for s020,w of 10.5, 10.1, and 9.5 S, respectively, the corresponding value for tetrameric apotryptophanase is 9.5 in each case. The conformational change which results from substitution of Na+ for K+ in the ionic environment is also evidenced at room temperature by a marked change in the spectrum of the holoenzyme, by a marked decrease in the rate of combination of coenzyme with apoenzyme, and, at low temperatures, by a marked reduction in the affinity of the apoenzyme for pyridoxal-P. The four-subunit model of holotryptophanase arrived at from hydrodynamic considerations is confirmed by electron micrographs, which show four subunits apparently arranged in a planar square configuration. The molecular weight calculated by use of the measured diameter of the spherical subunits and the density of the protein agrees well with the value obtained by sedimentation equilibrium measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1562975897,"1. The amino acid sequence of peptide (1–24) obtained from limited peptic digestion of bovine serum albumin has been determined from characterization of its tryptic and chymotryptic peptides. The 3 histidyl residues have been shown to occupy positions 3, 9, and 18. 2. Hydrogen ion titration of this peptide with and without copper(II) ions indicates that at neutral pH there are two copper(II)-binding sites of appreciable strength on the peptide. Of these, one site binds copper(II) ions strongly while the other binds copper(II) ions more weakly. In addition to the differences observed by titration, marked differences between the sites are apparent from absorption spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and optical rotatory dispersion spectra. 3. Since the peptide binds only 2 copper(II) ions strongly, all 3 histidyl residues do not act with comparable effect in separate binding sites. 4. The site which binds the 1st copper(II) ion has been shown by hydrogen ion titration, absorption spectra, circular dichroism spectra, and optical rotatory dispersion spectra to have properties compatible with previous suggestions that it is composed of the α-amino nitrogen, the imidazole nitrogen from the histidine in position 3, and the 2 intervening peptide bond nitrogen atoms. 5. Occupancy of either site by copper(II) leads to absorption in several circular dichroic bands. In addition to the several bands in the visible and near ultraviolet that have some similarities to those observed previously with complexes of small peptides, it has been possible to resolve two bands of opposite sign centered near 300 to 308 mµ and 270 to 275 mµ. The high stability of the complexes permitted measurements at sufficiently low concentrations to avoid excessive total absorption. In some cases optical rotatory dispersion results were obtained at shorter wave lengths, and it was observed that values of [m']233 changed with pH."

https://openalex.org/W1570348665,"Abstract The α2-macroglobulin of human plasma was isolated from Cohn Fraction III-0 by ultracentrifugation at a density of 1.065, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation between 34 and 50% saturation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. Precipitation with zinc ions was an additional step for some preparations. The average yield of the purified α2-macroglobulin was 39% of that present in Fraction III-0. The purity of the final preparation was shown to be approximately 98% on the basis of immunochemical determination. The only impurity detected was the γ1a-immunoglobulin, which represented 1 to 3% of the total protein. On paper electrophoresis only a single component was observed. Starch gel electrophoresis revealed a major band corresponding to the S α2 of Smithies, and, in addition, a faint, slower band was observed. In the ultracentrifuge 94% of the protein sedimented with an s020,w of 20.6, and the remaining 6% of the protein was present in a peak with an s020,w of 30.8. The presence in these preparations of a component sedimenting more rapidly in the ultracentrifuge and migrating more slowly on starch gel electrophoresis suggests the occurrence of an additional physical form of the α2-macroglobulin, which may be an aggregate. The carbohydrate composition of the purified protein, in percentage of the dry weight of the molecule, was galactose, 1.36; mannose, 2.07; N-acetylglucosamine, 3.94; N-acetylneuraminic acid, 1.80; and fucose, 0.26. From acetyl analyses on the native and sialic acid-free protein, it was found that all of the hexosamine occurred in the N-acetyl form and that there was approximately one acetyl group for each sialic acid residue. Amino acid and amide analyses indicated that all of the amino acids common to globular proteins were present in the α2-macroglobulin. The combined monosaccharide and amino acid residue weights accounted for 96.6% of the weight of the protein. In 1 molecule of the α2-macroglobulin (mol wt 820,000), there are approximately 363 monosaccharide residues and 6,463 amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1660246127,"Abstract The bacteriolytic enzyme from the fungus, Chalaropsis species, has been purified and crystallized in high yield. The needle-shaped crystals were approximately 10 µ long. The crystalline protein exhibited a single band in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH values of 9.3, 7.5, and 4.3. A single amino acid, threonine, was obtained by conventional NH2-terminal analysis. The specificity of the enzyme was confirmed to be an N,O-diacetylmuramidase."
https://openalex.org/W2006114412,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a complex of eight proteins first identified as a repressor of plant photomorphogenesis. A protein kinase activity associated with the COP9 signalosome has been reported but not identified; we present evidence for inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase (5/6-kinase) as a protein kinase associated with the COP9 signalosome. We have shown that 5/6-kinase exists in a complex with the eight-component COP9 signalosome both when purified from bovine brain and when transfected into HEK 293 cells. 5/6-kinase phosphorylates the same substrates as those of the COP9 signalosome, including IκBα, p53, and c-Jun but fails to phosphorylate several other substrates, including c-Jun 1–79, which are not substrates for the COP9-associated kinase. Both the COP9 signalosome- associated kinase and 5/6-kinase are inhibited by curcumin. The association of 5/6-kinase with the COP9 signalosome is through an interaction with CSN1, which immunoprecipitates with 5/6-kinase. In addition, the inositol kinase activity of 5/6-kinase is inhibited when in a complex with CSN1. We propose that 5/6-kinase is the previously described COP9 signalosome-associated kinase.

The most abundant soluble inositol phosphates found in eukaryotic cells are inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) 1The abbreviations used for: InsP5, 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; InsP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; 5/6-kinase, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase; CSN, COP9 signalosome; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FH-5/6-kinase, FLAG-His-5/6-kinase. and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) (1York J.D.

Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M206134200. 5/6-kinase utilizes inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate as a substrate and generates two distinct products, inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, in the ratio of 3:1 (5Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, inositol 3,4,5,6 tetrakisphosphate can be phosphorylated by 5/6-kinase to produce InsP5 (7Yang X. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 5/6-kinase, purified from calf brain or expressed recombinantly from Escherichia coli, preferentially generates Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 (5Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is a precursor for the synthesis of InsP5 (6Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y.

The enzyme is conserved from plants to humans and is found even in Entamoeba histolytica (8Field J. Wilson M.P. Mai Z. Majerus P.W. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem.

During the purification of 5/6-kinase from calf brain, a large complex of proteins was noted to co-purify with 5/6-kinase (5Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); this complex was identified as the COP9 signalosome (CSN) by amino-terminal sequence analysis of the largest subunit (CSN1) and Western blot analysis of the fifth subunit (CSN5) (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome is composed of eight distinct proteins (CSN1 to CSN8) and was first identified in plants defective for photomorphogenesis (11Wei N. Deng X.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The COP9 mutants develop a light-induced phenotype when grown in the dark; the molecular defect appears to result from decreased degradation of HY5, a positive regulator of light signaling (12Wei N. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The largest subunit of the COP9 signalosome (CSN1), also known as G-protein suppressor 1 (GPS1), was first identified in an extragenic suppressor screen inSaccharomyces cerevisiae for its ability to rescue mutants defective for the Gα subunit (20Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Staub S.F. Koo D. Chang C.Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Overexpression of full-length CSN1 inhibits c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) activity as well as Jun-dependent promoter activation (21Schwechheimer C. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 420-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of CSN1 has been shown to be responsible for incorporating CSN1 into the CSN complex, whereas the amino-terminal domain has been shown to suppress Fos transcription activation (22Tsuge T. Matsui M. Wei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Two known functions associated with the COP9 signalosome are deneddylation and phosphorylation (14Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Nedd8 is a member of the ubiquitin family that may modulate the ubiquitination machinery (15Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,16Ohh M.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); deneddylation has been postulated to control ubiquitin E3 ligase functions. The COP9 signalosome also exhibits a serine/threonine protein kinase activity toward c-Jun, IκBα, p105, and p53 (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar); however, when expressed alone, none of the eight CSN subunits exhibits protein kinase activity, and the enzyme responsible for this kinase activity has not been identified. Because no intrinsic kinase activity was found with the complex, the unknown enzyme was referred to as a COP9 signalosome-associated kinase. We have previously shown that 5/6-kinase purified from bovine brain and expressed recombinantly in Sf21 cells exhibit in vitro protein kinase activity toward c-Jun and ATF-2 (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because the COP9 signalosome was found to co-purify with 5/6-kinase, we postulated that 5/6-kinase may be the enzyme responsible for the protein kinase activity associated with the COP9 signalosome (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We now report that 5/6-kinase associates with the COP9 signalosome. A purified fraction of bovine COP9 signalosome and 5/6-kinase co-migrate upon gel filtration. Of the eight subunits of the complex, only CSN1 co-immunoprecipitates with Myc-tagged 5/6-kinase. Consistent with the reported activity of the protein kinase associated with the COP9 signalosome, 5/6-kinase phosphorylates IκBα, c-Jun, and p53 but not c-Jun 1–79 or NF-κB p52 subunit. Curcumin, a potent anti-tumor agent, was shown to inhibit the COP9-associated kinase activityin vitro and in vivo (19Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We show that curcumin inhibits both 5/6-kinase protein and inositol kinase activities. In HEK 293 cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase, the level of CSN5/Jab1 increases, suggesting that 5/6-kinase can modulate the levels of at least one component of the COP9 signalosome. In addition, overexpression of CSN1 inhibited 5/6-kinase activity, suggesting that interaction with the COP9 signalosome can alter this activity. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Goat polyclonal antibody against human CSN5, mouse monoclonal antibody against human α-tubulin, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human p53 and IκBα, purified GST·p53, GST·c-Jun 1–79, JNK1, and NFκB p52 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CSN1 to CSN8 were obtained from Affinity Research Products (Devon, United Kingdom). Recombinant His-tagged, full-length c-Jun was obtained from Promega. Curcumin was obtained from Sigma and dissolved at 0.2% in Me2SO. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Myc-tagged human 5/6-kinase containing six repeats of the Myc epitope at the amino terminus was generated as follows. Full-length 5/6-kinase was excised from pBAKPAK6–5/6-kinase (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and EcoRV and inserted into pCS-MT2 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Greg Longmore) containing the Myc6 epitope with EcoRI andSmaI. A carboxyl-terminally tagged His6-5/6-kinase was constructed in pTrcHis2B (Invitrogen) by excising full-length human 5/6-kinase with EcoRI from pIND-5/6kinase (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A human expressed sequence tag clone containing CSN1, GenBankTM accession number BG831861 (American Type Culture Collection) was used as a template for amplifying the CSN1 open reading frame. CSN1 was subcloned into pCMV5-HA (kindly provided by Dr. Yasuhiro Mochizuki). Each DNA construct was sequenced using ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator version 3.0 cycle sequencing reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant human GST-IκBα (a gift from Dr. Yunfeng Feng) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (Stratagene). After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) induction for 4 h, cells were harvested, and recombinant protein was purified using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Amino-terminus-tagged human 5/6-kinase with FLAG and His6epitopes was expressed in Sf21 cells as reported previously (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was purified on a TALON resin column (Clontech) followed by an M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody column (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A His6-tagged 5/6-kinase construct was transformed into BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) and inoculated in 2× YT medium (170 mm NaCl, 10 g of yeast extract, and 16 g/liter tryptone) overnight. Cells were harvested and incubated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg lysozyme/ml, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was sonicated, and the supernatant was purified on a 1-ml TALON resin column. In vitro protein kinase assays using recombinant 5/6-kinase purified from Sf21 cells were performed as described (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ng of enzyme was added to 1 μg of substrate in the presence of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals) in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol). Ten-microliter reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes for autoradiography. Curcumin inhibition of 5/6-kinase protein kinase activity was performed by preincubation of purified enzyme with curcumin (50 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of substrates. Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase assays were performed as described (5Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Curcumin was preincubated with purified 5/6-kinase for 10 min at 37 °C before assaying for inositol kinase activity. A fraction of the preparation of bovine brain 5/6-kinase (5Wilson M.P. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11904-11910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) containing both the signalosome and 5/6-kinase was used for gel filtration. A 600 × 7.5 mm Bio-Sil SEC-250 high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) was run at 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The molecular mass standards thyroglobulin (700 kDa), IgG (150 kDa), myoglobin (50 kDa), and cytochrome c (13.4 kDa) were applied to the Bio-Sil column prior to each sample run. Twenty μg of COP9 signalosome and 1 mg of carrier cytochrome c were applied to the Bio-Sil high performance liquid chromatography column. One-fifth of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using the indicated antibodies. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide consisting of amino acids 124–311 of human 5/6-kinase was used for detecting bovine 5/6-kinase (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody used to detect His-tagged human 5/6-kinase was generated using a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids (401–414) (QHCVASLATKASSQ). HEK 293 cells (1.5 × 107) were lysed in Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm microcystin, and Complete™ protease inhibitor tablets from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subjected to density gradient centrifugation as described (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cell lysates were separated on 10–40% glycerol gradients, and 2-ml fractions were collected. Eluted proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies to CSN1 and CSN8. HeLa or HEK 293 cells (2 × 105 cells) were plated on 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for each transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, followed by lysis in Buffer B and brief sonication. For immunoprecipitation, total lysate was first precleared using protein A-agarose, and 300 μg of lysate was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of anti-Myc antibody-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-CSN1 antibody-protein A-agarose (Sigma). Agarose beads were washed four times with Buffer C (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm NaCl), boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. HEK 293 cells stably expressing 5/6-kinase were grown to confluence in a 60-mm plate and washed twice with phosphate-free media. Orthophosphate 32P (1 mCi) in phosphate-free and serum-free media was added to cells for 4 h before harvesting in Buffer B. Anti-5/6-kinase antibody (2 μg) was added to cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by 40 μl of a 50% suspension of Protein A-agarose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 300 mm NaCl and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the labeled protein was detected by autoradiography. The 5/6-kinase was excised from the gel, electroeluted, and prepared for phospho-amino acid analysis as described previously (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that two subunits of the COP9 signalosome, CSN1 and CSN5, co-purify with calf-brain 5/6-kinase (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We now show that all eight subunits of the COP9 signalosome and 5/6-kinase were readily detected in the complex (Fig.1 A). A Coomassie Blue stain of this fraction demonstrated that the COP9 signalosome subunits are the major proteins present (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the COP9 signalosome subunits existed as an intact complex by using gel filtration to separate any dissociated subunits from the complex. Free His-5/6-kinase eluted in fraction 35 with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa. All eight subunits of the COP9 signalosome were observed to elute together in fractions 17–23 when stained with Coomassie Blue (data not shown). Western blot analysis using antibodies against CSN1 and CSN8 showed that the elution position of the COP9 signalosome corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 600 kDa (Fig. 1 B), similar to the plant COP9 signalosome (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Free subunits of the COP9 signalosome were not detected in the gel filtration experiment. 5/6-kinase was also detected in fraction 19 (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, purified bovine COP9 signalosome and 5/6-kinase co-migrated on a gel filtration. We sought to determine which subunit(s) of the COP9 signalosome interacts with 5/6-kinase by using HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with Myc-tagged human 5/6-kinase. Endogenous CSN1 was detected bound to the myc-5/6-kinase agarose as shown (Fig.2 A), whereas protein A-agarose alone did not bind CSN1. Furthermore, neither CSN8 nor CSN5 was detected bound to Myc-5/6-kinase, indicating that 5/6-kinase preferentially interacted with CSN1. The interaction between 5/6-kinase and CSN1 was confirmed using an anti-CSN1 antibody for the immunoprecipitation in HeLa cells. Anti-CSN1 antibody was added to the lysates of HeLa cells, transiently transfected with a plasmid containing 5/6-kinase, and followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. Myc-tagged-5/6-kinase was detected bound to CSN1 as shown in Fig. 2 B; 10% of the Myc-immunoprecipitate and 50% of the CSN1-immunoprecipitate were loaded on the gel. All eight subunits of the COP9 signalosome were bound to anti-CSN1 antibody-agarose as determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Protein A agarose alone did not bind any Myc-tagged 5/6-kinase (Fig. 2 B). In addition, anti-Myc-agarose also failed to bind any 5/6-kinase in untransfected HeLa cells (data not shown). These results show that, in HeLa cells, Myc-tagged human 5/6-kinase can interact with endogenous CSN1 within the COP9 signalosome. Because endogenous CSN1 can co-immunoprecipitate 5/6-kinase, we attempted to confirm the interaction between CSN1 and 5/6-kinase by co-transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids containing HA-tagged CSN1 and Myc-tagged 5/6-kinase. Immunoprecipitation using HeLa cell lysates indicates that anti-HA monoclonal antibody-agarose pulled down CSN1 (Fig. 2 C). Western blot analysis using anti-CSN8 antibody demonstrated that another COP9 signalosome subunit was also isolated using the anti-HA antibody-agarose. Because CSN8 is found predominantly with the signalosome, the isolation of CSN8 indicates that the entire COP9 signalosome was isolated with HA-tagged CSN1. Anti-Myc antibody detected 5/6-kinase in the immune complex, indicating that 5/6-kinase interacts with CSN1. A discrepancy was noted in that, whereas CSN1 was able to pull down 5/6-kinase and the entire complex, 5/6-kinase apparently only pulled down CSN1 but not CSN5 and CSN8. To address this question, a glycerol gradient was performed on HEK 293 cell lysates. CSN1 was also detected in the complex (Fig. 2 D) as well as free subunits, but CSN8 was found predominantly in the complex. Although in plants CSN1 has been reported to exist only in the complex, CSN1 expressed in NIH 3T3 has been shown to exist in the complex as well as free subunits (22Tsuge T. Matsui M. Wei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible for 5/6-kinase to interact with free CSN1 as well as with that in the complex. IκBα, c-Jun, and p53 have been identified as substrates for the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 19Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). FLAG-His-5/6-kinase (FH-5/6-kinase) expressed in Sf21 cells was purified to homogeneity as described previously (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In anin vitro protein kinase assay, purified FH-5/6-kinase was autophosphorylated in the presence of γ-32P-labeled ATP. In addition, FH-5/6-kinase also phosphorylated full-length His-tagged c-Jun, GST-tagged IκBα, and GST-tagged p53 (Fig.3 A), which is consistent with the substrate profile reported for the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). IκBα was the best in vitro substrate for baculovirus-derived FH-5/6-kinase, followed by p53, c-Jun, and ATF2 (data not shown). GST·c-Jun 1–79, a c-Jun amino-terminal fragment that is phosphorylated by JNK but not by the COP9 associated kinase (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), was not a substrate for 5/6-kinase. In addition, neither JNK1 (Fig. 3 A) nor NF-κB p52 subunit (data not shown) was phosphorylated by 5/6-kinase. To demonstrate that 5/6-kinase expressed in mammalian cells behaves similarly to the Sf21 cell-expressed protein, we transiently transfected human 5/6-kinase in HEK 293 cells and assayed for kinase activity toward various substrates. Lysates from transfected HEK 293 cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody-agarose and subjected to inositol kinase (data not shown) and protein kinase assays. The protein kinase activity of immunoprecipitated 5/6-kinase was assayed toward a panel of substrates (Fig. 3 B). GST·IκBα is the best substrate, followed by GST·p53 and His·c-Jun. Thus, Myc-tagged 5/6-kinase expressed in HEK 293 cells shows similar substrate specificity to that observed for 5/6-kinase derived from Sf21 cells. 5/6-kinase purified from Sf21 cells was prominently autophosphorylated (Fig. 3 A), whereas that immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells was autophosphorylated to a much lesser extent (Fig. 3 B). To address this discrepancy, HEK 293 cells stably expressing 5/6-kinase were labeled with [32P]phosphate for 4 h, cells were harvested, and 5/6-kinase was immunoprecipitated as described under “Materials and Methods” and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 4 A). Phospho-amino acid analysis was performed (Fig. 4 B) showing that 5/6-kinase expressed in HEK 293 cells is indeed phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine residues. It is therefore likely that the 5/6-kinase immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells existed in a more phosphorylated state than baculovirus-derived 5/6-kinase. Curcumin has been reported to inhibit the COP9 signalosome protein kinase activity (19Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To test whether curcumin inhibits 5/6-kinase, the protein kinase assays were repeated on c-Jun, p53, and IκBα in the presence of 50 μm curcumin. 5/6-kinase treated with curcumin exhibited 75% inhibition of activity toward all substrates and also showed a reduction in autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 Acompared with Fig. 3 A). Nonspecific bands on the autoradiograph such as the ones present in the lane containing c-Jun 1–79 were not affected by the presence of curcumin. As shown in Fig.5 B, curcumin inhibited 5/6-kinase protein kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C is a graph of the relative intensity of IκBα in Fig. 5 B). The addition of 50 μm curcumin to 5/6-kinase inhibited inositol kinase activity by 25% (not shown). Overexpression of CSN2 increases de novoCOP9 signalosome complex formation (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); therefore, we tested whether 5/6-kinase overexpression would affect the levels of any of the proteins in the complex. Stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing 5/6-kinase or vector were generated (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the levels of endogenous COP9 signalosome subunits were measured by Western blotting. Of the eight subunits tested, only the level of CSN5 was shown to have increased 1.48 + 0.1-fold (average of seven experiments) in cells that overexpress 5/6-kinase (Fig. 6). An increase in the levels of CSN5 was observed in stable cell lines overexpressing 5/6-kinase in the absence of induction with tetracycline. In these cells there is a leak of 5/6-kinase expression corresponding to levels 3-fold over that of endogenous enzyme as measured by inositol kinase activity (data not shown). These results indicate that 5/6-kinase does not affect the levels of COP9 signalosome in cells but does affect the levels of CSN5. We sought to determine the effect of CSN1 binding to 5/6-kinase by co-expression of HA-CSN1 and Myc-5/6-kinase in HeLa cells. 5/6-kinase activity was measured from cells transfected with plasmids containing either vector Myc-5/6-kinase, HA-CSN1, or both. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the first-order rate constant 3S/So = e−kt, where k −1 is the first order rate constant. for 5/6-kinase activity (k −1) is ∼1200 min−1 mg−1. In the presence of CSN1, the rate constant drops to ∼300 min−1 mg−1. The transfection of plasmids containing vector (k −1= 8 min−1 mg−1) or HA-CSN1 (k −1 = 9 min−1 mg−1) alone had negligible effect on 5/6-kinase. The level of expression of Myc-tagged 5/6-kinase and HA-tagged CSN1 in co-transfected cells is equivalent to the cells expressing only 5/6-kinase or CSN1 as shown in Fig. 7 B. The COP9 signalosome complex consists of eight proteins that are highly conserved from plants to mammals (11Wei N. Deng X.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that this signalosome co-purifies with 5/6-kinase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of the higher phosphorylated forms of inositol (2Shears S.B. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this report, we confirm that 5/6-kinase associates with the COP9 signalosome using several criteria. 5/6-kinase co-elutes with the COP9 signalosome upon gel filtration, whereas in the absence of the complex it behaves as a monomer. In addition, of the eight subunits present in the complex, only CSN1 coimmunoprecipitates with 5/6-kinase. The COP9 signalosome has been shown to associate with the 26 S ubiquitin proteasome and may regulate protein stability (25Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Dubiel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 467-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural organization of the COP9 signalosome, as revealed by electron microscopy, resembles the lid of the 19 S regulatory particle of the 26 S proteasome (26Kapelari B. Bech-Otschir D. Hegerl R. Schade R. Dumdey R. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Henke W. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Schade R. Jungblut P. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 29-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The COP9 signalosome has been shown to interact with ubiquitin E3-ligase and exhibit deneddylase activity (28Schwechheimer C. Serino G. Callis J. Crosby W.L. Lyapina S. Deshaies R.J. Gray W.M. Estelle M. Deng X.W. Science. 2001; 292: 1379-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar,30Kawakami T. Chiba T. Suzuki T.

A reported function of the COP9 signalosome is an associated protein kinase activity, which has not been identified. Purified COP9 signalosome was reported to exhibit protein kinase activity toward c-Jun, IκBα, p105 (NF-κB precursor), and p53 (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, none of the eight subunits exhibited protein kinase activity when expressed alone; therefore, the kinase activity has been attributed to a COP9-associated protein kinase (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We reported previously that 5/6-kinase can phosphorylate c-Jun and ATF-2 (10Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40998-41004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We show here that 5/6-kinase can also phosphorylate IκBα and p53, both known substrates for the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase. In addition, 5/6-kinase did not phosphorylate the p52 subunit of NF-κB or an amino-terminal peptide of c-Jun, proteins that are not substrates for the COP9 associated kinase (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). c-Jun phosphorylation by the COP9 signalosome appeared to be independent of the JNK pathway, and the phosphorylation sites on c-Jun were mapped to the amino-terminal residues serine 63 and serine 73 (17, 18). Because c-Jun lacking its carboxyl-terminal (c-Jun 1–79) was not phosphorylated by the purified COP9 signalosome, Seegeret al. (18Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) proposed that the putative kinase only recognizes c-Jun dimers, which require the carboxyl-terminal region for dimerization. 5/6-kinase also exhibited the same specificity, being active only toward full-length c-Jun but not toward c-Jun 1–79. These results implicate 5/6-kinase as a candidate for the protein kinase activity reported to be associated with the COP9 signalosome. The protein kinase activity of the COP9 signalosome has been reported to be inhibited by curcumin (19Bech-Otschir D. Kraft R. Huang X. Henklein P. Kapelari B. Pollmann C. Dubiel W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1630-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Studies using curcumin to inhibit the kinase activity reveal differential regulation of substrate stability. In the presence of curcumin, p53 levels were enhanced, whereas those of c-Jun were suppressed (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 31Pollmann C. Huang X. Mall J. Bech-Otschir D. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8416-8421PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation by the COP9-associated kinase may affect the stability of these transcription factors. These studies, using curcumin as an inhibitor of the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase, led to the hypothesis that the phosphorylation activity of the associated kinase may also modulate the association between the COP9 complex and the ubiquitin machinery (25Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Dubiel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 467-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that both the inositol and protein kinase activities of 5/6-kinase are inhibited by curcumin, consistent with the reported inhibition of the COP9 signalosome-associated kinase. Overexpression of the subunits of the COP9 signalosome has been reported to alter the composition of the signalosome. Transient transfection of CSN2 increases the level of the complex, whereas CSN5 overexpression does not change the level of signalosome subunits (17Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We show that 5/6-kinase expression in HEK 293 cells increases the levels of CSN5, which has been reported to enhance AP-1 activation and mediate the nuclear export and degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (p27Kip1) (6Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M. Tanaka T. Yoshida M. Yoneda-Kato N. Kato J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2302-2310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because CSN5 is known to exist in a complex-bound and a complex-free form (23Chamovitz D.A. Segal D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the increase in CSN5 is likely restricted to the complex-free CSN5. 5/6-kinase induction of CSN5 offers a possible regulatory mechanism for CSN5 activity. In addition to the protein kinase activity of 5/6-kinase, we have shown that 5/6-kinase can interact with the COP9 signalosome. Bovine brain 5/6-kinase was found to be present in the purified COP9 signalosome, and immunoprecipitation studies showed that CSN1 can interact with 5/6-kinase (Figs. 1 and 2). Because the carboxyl-terminal domain of CSN1 has been shown to be sufficient for incorporating CSN1 into the COP9 signalosome (32Wang X. Kang D. Feng S. Serino G. Schwechheimer C. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is likely that 5/6-kinase interacts with the amino-terminal domain of CSN1, which has been shown to inhibit c-Fos expression and suppress activation of an AP-1 promoter (22Tsuge T. Matsui M. Wei N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The association of 5/6-kinase with CSN1 inhibits 5/6-kinase inositol kinase activity. Co-expression of 5/6-kinase and CSN1 resulted in a significant inhibition of 5/6-kinase activity, suggesting that a large portion of 5/6-kinase is associated with CSN1. These results also provide evidence for a link between inositol phosphate metabolism and the COP9 signalosome. The COP9 signalosome has been proposed to act as a scaffold complex for bringing different molecules together (25Bech-Otschir D. Seeger M. Dubiel W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 467-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Chamovitz D.A. Glickman M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid screens and electron microscopy, CSN1 is thought to position next to CSN5 (24Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because 5/6-kinase associates with CSN1, and CSN5 recruits p53, it is conceivable that one subunit of the complex brings different substrates to 5/6-kinase for phosphorylation. In addition, CSN1 can inhibit 5/6-kinase activity, suggesting that the interaction may alter 5/6-kinase enzyme activity under some conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2016643143,"The chaperoning activity of the heat shock protein hsp90 is directed, in part, by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP and also by association with co-chaperone proteins. One co-chaperone, p23, binds to hsp90 only when hsp90 is in a conformation induced by the binding of ATP. Once formed, the p23-hsp90 complex is very stable upon the removal of ATP and dissipates at 30° with a half-life of about 45 min. This was shown to be due to the high stability of the ATP-induced state of hsp90, not to the rate of p23 dissociation. Further stabilization of this ATP-induced state is achieved by including molybdate or by use of the ATP analogue ATPγS. This conformational state of hsp90 is correlated with the tight binding of ADP resulting from hydrolysis of bound ATP. Both p23 and molybdate enhance and stabilize the nucleotide-bound state of hsp90, and this state is maximized by the presence of both agents. These results can be explained in a model where the binding of ATP induces a conformational transition in hsp90 that traps the nucleotide and is committed to ATP hydrolysis. p23 specifically recognizes this state and may also facilitate subsequent steps in the chaperoning cycle.

These hsp90 client proteins include a variety of transcription factors, protein kinases, and cell cycle regulators (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr.

To chaperone the progesterone receptor (PR) to a mature form that can bind hormone, hsp90 and the co-chaperone Hop join hsp70 and hsp40 on the PR to form a multiprotein complex. This intermediate complex can progress in the presence of ATP and additional proteins to a mature complex containing PR with hormone binding activity plus hsp90, p23, and one of several immunophilins. This mature complex is transitory; either the receptor binds hormone and activates or the complex dissociates, allowing the process of chaperoning to begin again (5Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

These domains appear to influence one another and, thus, the dynamics of the nucleotide regulation of hsp90 might be quite complex. p23 was first identified as a component of hsp90 complexes with the PR (23Johnson J.L.

Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a crystal structure for p23 has been resolved showing it to have a globular β-sandwich structure with a flexible tail at the C terminus (28Weaver A.J.

The role of p23 in the hsp90 chaperoning pathway is still not clear. It has been shown to stabilize hsp90 complexes with PR or GR. Although not strictly required for the interaction of these client proteins with hsp90, p23 dramatically increases the proportion of PR or GR in a mature complex able to bind hormone (29Dittmar K.D.

McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol.

Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The role of molybdate is uncertain, but it appears to stabilize this conformational state. It has also recently been indicated that p23 may have a role in the turnover or dissociation of GR-hsp90 complexes (31Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). p23 has the ability to function as a passive chaperone in vitro in that it can prevent the aggregation of denatured proteins (28Weaver A.J.

In addition, cellular studies indicate that it can modulate the activities of nuclear receptors even after they have been activated and presumed to be dissociated from hsp90 (34Freeman B.C.

In this study we examined ATP binding to hsp90 and the effects of sodium molybdate and p23 on this binding. Both of these agents stabilize nucleotide binding at a stage when ATP is tightly bound to hsp90 and committed to hydrolysis. Recombinant human p23 and chicken hsp90α were purified to near homogeneity as described previously (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with or without bound nucleotide, were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After washing by centrifugation and resuspension to remove excess antibody and equilibrate the resin into binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol), the resin was divided into 30-μl aliquots. These were supplemented with 9 μg of hsp90, 3 μg of p23, and, when indicated, 20 mm sodium molybdate (Mo). The ATP label was added last as a 20× stock so that each aliquot contained ∼2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Blue NEG503H, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a final concentration of 0.05 mm in the 100-μl incubation. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The basic binding reaction was concluded by isolation of antibody complexes with four 1-ml washes of binding buffer. After resuspension in 1 ml of binding buffer, one-half of the sample was measured for radioactivity to determine the amount of bound nucleotide, whereas the remainder was examined for resin-bound proteins by SDS-PAGE. Samples were prepared as described for the basic binding assay. Following incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the assay tubes were chilled on ice. Then, 5 mm ATP was added, and the incubation continued at 30 °C for the times indicated. The antibody-bound complexes were washed and analyzed as above. Samples were treated as described for the basic binding assay. Following the incubation at 30 °C, the resins were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer and re-suspended in 1 ml of binding buffer without or with sodium molybdate or nucleotide as indicated. The incubation continued either on ice or at 30 °C for the times specified. Resin-bound complexes were then isolated and analyzed. Samples (200 μl) in binding buffer contained anti-p23 antibody bound to protein A resin, 9 μg of hsp90, 5 μg of p23, 5 mm ATP with or without 20 mmsodium molybdate, and any additions as indicated. Typically, samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to form complexes. The hsp90-p23 complexes were either washed and examined by SDS-PAGE or used in exchange or dissociation studies. The hsp90 exchange assay was similar to the nucleotide exchange assay in that a trace amount of35S-labeled hsp90, prepared by in vitrotranscription and translation, was mixed with 5 μg of hsp90 and 1.5 μg of p23 in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 20m Mo. After complexes were formed, 50 μg of hsp90 (pre-incubated with 5 mm ATP at 30° for 30 min to put it in the active conformation) was added in an increased volume of 1 ml, and the incubation continued at 0° or 30 °C for the times indicated. Samples (100 μl) in binding buffer containing 5 μg of hsp90, 5 mm ATP, and either 10 μg of p23 or 20 mm Mo or both were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then transferred to ice. Each sample was divided into four aliquots to which chymotrypsin (0.1 μg) was added for 0, 3, 10, or 30 min. Digestion was stopped with the addition of SDS sample buffer. Protein digests were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-PAGE. Native hsp90 was quantified using NIH Image version 1.62. We had shown previously that hsp90 in the default state has no affinity for p23 but gains the capacity to bind p23 in vitro when it is incubated at elevated temperature in the presence of ATP (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 36Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This appears to be due to a reversible change in the conformation of hsp90. Optimal conditions for this conformational change include 5 mm ATP, 20 mm Mo, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. It was suggested that Mo functions by replacing the γ-phosphate lost after ATP hydrolysis to maintain hsp90 in a pseudo-ATP-bound state; however, this has not been established. The detergent, Nonidet P-40, stimulates the rate of hsp90 conversion, but its mechanism is unknown. Some additional properties of this interaction are illustrated in Fig.1. Constant amounts of hsp90 and p23 were incubated under various conditions, and protein complexes were isolated by adsorption to an antibody resin to p23. Upon incubation for 30 min at 30°, hsp90 was able to bind to p23 only if ATP was present (lane 3) but not in the absence of nucleotide (lane 1) or in the presence of ADP (lane 2). In the remainder of Fig. 1, the stability of p23-hsp90 complexes was tested under varying conditions using a two-incubation protocol. The resin-bound complexes (lanes 4–8) formed in the presence of ATP and Mo during the first incubation were washed free of the unbound proteins, ATP and Mo. The complexes were then re-suspended in binding buffer with or without additional ATP, ADP, or Mo as indicated and incubated for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. When neither ATP nor Mo was present in this second incubation, there was a reduction of the hsp90-p23 complex by more than 50% (compare lanes 3 and 7). This loss was amplified by the presence of ADP (lane 8), which has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the ATP-dependent transformation of hsp90 (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The complex was most stable in the presence of ATP and Mo (lane 4), but Mo alone (lane 5) was nearly as effective. The presence of ATP alone (lane 6) conferred no increased stability over buffer alone (lane 7). We found previously that the poorly metabolized ATP analogue ATPγS was ∼10 times more potent than ATP at promoting hsp90 binding to p23 (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Even though the concentration of ATPγS used in Fig. 1(lanes 9–12) was 0.5 mm, the amount of hsp90 complexed was about the same as found with 5 mm ATP and Mo. When ATPγS was used as the nucleotide, hsp90 binding to p23 did not require Mo stabilization (lanes 9 and 11), as shown previously (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein complexes were stably maintained even after washing and subsequent incubation in either the presence (lane 10) or absence (lane 12) of Mo. This is consistent with a function of Mo that relates to ATP hydrolysis. The most striking difference when using ATPγS is that the hsp90-p23 complexes show high stability when incubated in buffer alone (lane 12). This indicates that the hsp90 conformation that is produced by ATPγS treatment is not readily reversible. Previous studies have shown that the binding of ATP to hsp90 is of low affinity with rapid rates of association and dissociation (14Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the results in Fig. 1 show that the ATP-dependent conformational state of hsp90 generated in the first incubation dissipates slowly during the second incubation without nucleotide (e.g. lanes 5, 10, and 12). The rate at which hsp90 loses its ability to bind p23 after the removal of ATP from the incubation is shown more clearly in Fig.2. hsp90 was converted to the ATP-induced conformation by incubation at 30° for 30 min in the presence of p23 and either 5 mm ATP alone, 20 mm Mo, or 0.5 mm ATPγS. p23 complexes were then isolated on antibody resin, resuspended in buffer without nucleotide, and incubated at 30° for the times indicated. The complex is very stable over a 90 min period when formed in the presence of ATPγS. Equivalent stability is achieved when the complex is formed in the presence of ATP plus Mo and then incubated without ATP but in the continued presence of Mo. On the other hand, when prepared by ATP treatment and then incubated without ATP or Mo, the p23 binding activity of hsp90 is gradually lost over a 90 min period at 30°. However, this apparent change of hsp90 conformation is still quite slow with a half-time of about 45 min. These results suggest that either the binding of nucleotide or p23 persists with a slow rate of dissociation or that once hsp90 is in the ATP-dependent conformation there is a high energy barrier for reversion to its default conformation. The rate of p23 dissociation from hsp90 was measured as illustrated in Fig. 3. In this experiment, hsp90 labeled with [35S]methionine was bound to p23 for 30 min at 30°. A 10-fold excess of unlabeled hsp90 was then added, and the loss of [35S]hsp90 by exchange was measured with time by adsorbing complexes to the p23 antibody resin. When kept on ice, the rate of exchange was very gradual, with a <30% exchange in 30 min. However, at 30° the complex turned over rapidly with a half-life of about 2 min. Thus, the rate of p23 dissociation from hsp90 is very temperature-dependent and quite rapid at 30°. Therefore, the slow loss of the hsp90-p23 complex during the second incubation depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 cannot be explained by a slow rate of complex dissociation. It is possible that the gradual loss of protein complex shown in Fig. 2 corresponds to the slow dissociation of ATP bound to hsp90, even though tight binding of ATP to hsp90 has not been observed previously (14Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We attempted to measure the binding of radiolabeled ATP to hsp90 using an antibody pull-down assay. This non-equilibrium assay would be successful only if the rate of ATP dissociation from hsp90 were relatively slow under the conditions used. This appears to be the case as shown in Fig.4. An antibody to hsp90 was used to immunoprecipitate complexes with p23 and ATP. Samples containing 1 μm hsp90 and p23 with Mo plus various concentrations of ATP were incubated for 60 min at 30° and then chilled and assessed for bound ATP. Saturable binding was observed within the range of 2–5 mm ATP, with half-maximal binding occurring at about 0.5–1 mm ATP. The specificity of ATP binding was tested using 50 μm[α-32P]ATP plus various competitors (Fig.5). Although this concentration is far below that needed for binding saturation, it provides optimal sensitivity, i.e. a balance between concentration and specific activity. Binding was inhibited by a 10-fold excess (0.5 mm) of ATP and, to a somewhat greater extent, by ADP, whereas GTP, UTP and CTP were ineffective at this concentration. This specificity is similar to that observed previously for nucleotide binding to the N-terminal domain of hsp90 (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). ATP binding was blocked by treatment with geldanamycin but not with cisplatin (data not shown). This, together with the nucleotide specificity, indicates that the binding observed is at the N-terminal domain and not at the ATP binding site described recently (21Söti C. Rácz A. Csermely P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7066-7075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) at the C terminus that is inhibited by cisplatin. Both p23 and molybdate influence the binding of ATP as shown in Fig.6 A. In the absence of p23 and Mo (lane 1), there is little ATP binding above the assay background (lanes 5 and 6). ATP binding is enhanced by either p23 or Mo, but both are required to get optimal binding. The binding of ATP is very temperature-dependent, because no binding above background was observed with incubations on ice (results not shown). This suggests that the binding is not a simple association of components but involves conformational or chemical alterations in hsp90 or both. To address this, the bound nucleotide was extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography. This showed that essentially all of the [32P]ATP had been hydrolyzed to [32P]ADP (Fig. 6 B). When analyzedversus time of incubation at 30°, only bound ADP was observed at the earliest time point of 2 min (data not shown). Thus, either ATP is completely converted to ADP upon binding hsp90, or any bound ATP is readily dissociated and lost during the antibody pull-down assay, leaving only the more tightly bound ADP. Note that, even though ADP is the predominant bound nucleotide, one cannot generate the hsp90-p23 complexes using ADP + Mo (Fig. 1). This apparently requires the process of ATP binding and hydrolysis. The influence of p23 on nucleotide binding is shown in the time-course experiment in Fig. 7. The binding observed using 50 μm ATP progresses very slowly without reaching completion at 60 min. p23 has little influence on the rate of nucleotide binding, but it dramatically increases the yield of the complex. The binding of ATP to hsp90 has been shown to be quite rapid, and the rate of nucleotide binding observed in Fig. 7 is too slow to be considered a simple interaction between hsp90 and ATP. The time course resembles that for achieving p23 binding capacity, which involves a conformational change in hsp90 (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The preceding results indicate that the binding of ATP leads to a conformational change in hsp90 to a state in which the dissociation of nucleotide is slow. To confirm this, the turnover rate of hsp90-ATP complexes was analyzed (Fig. 8). Complexes of hsp90, [32P]ATP, and p23 were first formed for 30 min at 30°. An 80-fold excess of unlabeled ATP was then added for various times at 30° to measure the loss of bound radiolabeled nucleotide (ADP). The half-time for this exchange reaction was about 50 min in the presence of Mo and 10 min in the absence of Mo. Thus, under optimal conditions (plus Mo and p23), the rate of nucleotide dissociation from hsp90 is very slow, and this provides a likely explanation for the slow loss of hsp90-p23 complex in Fig. 2. The influence of p23 on the turnover of bound nucleotide is shown in Fig. 8 B. p23 has a dramatic effect on the conformation of hsp90 and essentially eliminates the exchange of bound nucleotide. Note that the optimal condition, plus Mo and p23, is more stabilizing in Fig. 8 B than in Fig. 8 A. For the experiment in Fig. 8 B, p23 was in excess of the hsp90 and was free in solution rather than bound to antibody resin. At the completion of the 30° incubation, the samples were chilled, supplemented with p23 where needed, and adsorbed to p23 antibody resin. Thus, this experiment should more accurately illustrate the stabilizing influence of p23. The effects of p23 on hsp90 conformation were further explored by comparing the sensitivity of hsp90 to chymotrypsin under various conditions (Fig. 9). hsp90 samples were treated with chymotrypsin for 2, 10, or 30 min and then analyzed for the loss of full-length hsp90. In the presence of ATP alone, almost all of the hsp90 was degraded by chymotrypsin within 30 min. A very similar rate of degradation was observed with treatment in the absence of ATP or other additives (results not shown). However, the addition of ATP plus Mo and p23 produced an hsp90 form that was highly resistant to chymotrypsin treatment. Slightly lower degrees of resistance were obtained when either p23 or Mo was deleted from the mixture. Thus, these conditions produce an hsp90 conformation that is very distinct and apparently more compact than the default conformation of hsp90. The interaction between hsp90 and p23 is not clearly defined, even though it has been studied for several years. Unique features of this interaction are the strict dependence upon ATP binding to hsp90 and the need to have hsp90 in its dimeric state. Also, multiple domains of hsp90 are needed, and p23 binding thus appears to be very sensitive to the conformational state of hsp90 (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 17Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The present study provides some new insights into the relationships between ATP and p23 binding to hsp90. Our initial interest was the high stability of the hsp90 state that binds p23 upon removal of excess nucleotide. This was particularly evident when using the poorly metabolized ATP analogue ATPγS that generated an hsp90 state that was not readily reversible. This could not be explained by a stable interaction between hsp90 and p23, because this interaction is quite dynamic with a half-life of about 2 min at 30°. The stability could, however, be explained by the tight binding of nucleotide to hsp90. Such binding was not anticipated, because previous studies had shown that purified hsp90 has a low affinity for ATP accompanied by rapid on and off rates (14Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The present study shows that hsp90 can exist in a state where the non-metabolized nucleotide (ATPγS) or ADP plus Mo is essentially trapped within its binding site. Although not shown directly, such binding has been proposed by Weikl et al. (14Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) from studies on the kinetics of the ATPase activity of hsp90. Their results indicate a cycle of ATP hydrolysis wherein ATP binds rapidly and reversibly in the first step to promote a change in hsp90 conformation that results in tight ATP binding and a commitment to hydrolysis. The bound ADP from hydrolysis can then be readily dissociated. In their model, the cycle is limited by the slow rate of hydrolysis, not by the commitment step or the dissociation of ADP. Our results are very compatible with the model cited above. Although ATP can bind rapidly to hsp90, our pull-down assay only measures nucleotide that is trapped at the commitment step, which is a much slower process as shown in Fig. 7. The binding of ATPγS results in an accumulation of the committed hsp90 structure that is unable to proceed through the cycle. The result is similar when using ATP plus Mo. However, with ATP alone, hydrolysis and ADP release occur with little or no accumulation of hsp90 in the committed state and a reduced capacity to bind p23. An important aspect of this study is the use of Mo as a stabilizing agent. We had proposed previously that Mo acts by occupying the binding site for the γ-phosphate after ATP hydrolysis (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Thus, hsp90 would remain in the conformation induced by ATP binding. Several observations support this mechanism of Mo action. Effects comparable with Mo have been obtained using other compounds that are known to behave as phosphate analogues such as vanadate, tungstate, berrilium fluoride, and aluminum fluoride (12Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. (1997) J. Biol.

As shown here, the Mo-stabilized hsp90 actually contains bound ADP, not ATP, and Mo has no effect when hsp90 is bound with ATPγS. However, there is some evidence that Mo interacts with hsp90 near its C terminus, because it can alter the structure of hsp90 in that region (39Hartson S.D. Thulasiraman V. Huang W. Whitesell L. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3837-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is possible that Mo interacts near the C terminus, perhaps in relation to nucleotide binding in this region, which has recently been shown to occur (20Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M.

On the other hand, the specificity of nucleotide binding in the present study indicates that this binding is at the site near the N terminus. Also, the N-terminal ATP binding site has been shown to be essential for promoting the p23 binding conformation of hsp90, and this conformation can be obtained with hsp90 fragments that lack the ATP binding site near the C terminus (16Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and it shows five steps in the cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis plus an additional step to illustrate the action of Mo. The reversible binding of ATP (step 1) induces a conformational change in hsp90 (step 2) that locks ATP into its binding site, committed for hydrolysis (step 3). Under natural conditions, hsp90 would be returned to its initial conformation by the dissociation of the phosphate and, then, ADP (steps 4 and 6). However, we have included steps 4 and 5 to describe our in vitro conditions in the presence of Mo. We propose that ATPγS traps hsp90 between steps 2 and 3 in a state that is committed for hydrolysis but is unable to do so. When using ATP and Mo, hsp90 is trapped at step 4, where the leaving phosphate is replaced by the more tightly binding Mo to prevent ADP dissociation (step 4) and to maintain the committed conformation of hsp90 (hsp90*). Thus, with this proposed mechanism of Mo action, phosphate must dissociate from hsp90 before ADP. In this model, p23 binding is confined to the committed state of hsp90. This state is probably the same as the “closed” conformation of hsp90 described recently (13Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wherein ATP binding promotes dimer interactions near the N terminus of hsp90. Also, a dimer arrangement is required for the binding of p23 to hsp90 (17Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. McMahon N. Catelli M.G. Toft D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12524-12529Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This closed, more compact conformation would be consistent with the increased resistance of hsp90 to chymotrypsin shown in our study. In the hsp90 cycle, p23 appears to bind to and stabilize the committed hsp90. It does not accelerate the generation of this form (step 2), but seems to retard the conformational change in hsp90 that would occur at step 5. A shortcoming of this model is that it does not show the transient nature of the p23-hsp90 interaction. With the nucleotide stably bound in the committed conformation of hsp90, p23 is able to bind and contribute to the stability of the committed conformation. However, this interaction is brief compared with the bound nucleotide, and there may be multiple interactions between p23 and hsp90 while the nucleotide is bound. When functioning biologically, hsp90 is thought to undergo this cycle only when it is interacting with a substrate or client protein. With steroid receptors, this first involves binding of hsp40 and hsp70 to the receptor and, then, the recruitment of Hop and hsp90 (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 6Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). hsp90 in this complex would then interact with ATP and p23, and these interactions help to change the receptor to a state that is able to bind hormone. This in vitro chaperoning of steroid receptors does not require Mo stabilization, although Mo can stabilize receptor complexes (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar, 38Nishigori H. Toft D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). p23 promotes the accumulation of “mature” complexes where the receptor is active in hormone binding. Even in the presence of a client protein, i.e. the progesterone receptor, the progression to a mature complex is slow (7Hernández M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Apparently, substantial conformational changes occur in hsp90 and also in the PR. In addition to stabilizing the mature complex, p23 may also facilitate the conformational changes in hsp90, the client protein, or both. This may lead to more efficient production of the mature PR complex. This complex is not static, and the PR appears to continuously cycle through the hsp90 pathway (40Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). By fostering conformational changes, p23 may facilitate steps 5 and 6 as well (Fig.10), and this might explain the recent observation that p23 can enhance dissociation of receptor from hsp90 that occurs after binding hormone (31Young J.C. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2100703699,"Connective tissue cells in mechanically active environments survive applied physical forces by modifying actin cytoskeletal structures that stabilize cell membranes. In fibroblasts, tensile forces induce the expression of filamin-A, a mechanoprotective actin-binding protein, but the mechanisms and protein interactions by which force activates filamin-A transcription are not defined. We found that in fibroblasts, application of tensile forces through collagen-coated magnetite beads to cell surface β1integrins induced filamin-A expression. This induction required actin filaments and selective activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Force promoted the redistribution of p38 to the integrin/bead locus and the nucleus as well as enhanced binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to proximal, regulatory domains of the filamin-A promoter. Force application increased association of Sp1 with p38 and phosphorylation of Sp1. Transcriptional activation of filamin-A in force-treated fibroblasts was subsequently mediated by Sp1-binding sites on the filamin-A promoter. These results provide evidence for a mechanically coupled transcriptional circuit that originates at the magnetite bead/integrin locus, activates p38, tethers p38 to actin filaments, promotes binding of p38 to Sp1 in the nucleus, and induces filamin-A expression."

On the basis of our results and the presently available hydrophobicity profile of many acyl-lipid desaturases, we propose that these enzymes contain a new transmembrane domain that might play a critical role in the desaturation of fatty acids esterified in glycerolipids. The fatty acyl desaturases encompass a family of enzymes, representatives of which are found in all lower eukaryotes, plants and animals (for a review see Ref. 1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar), and some prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria (2Murata N. Wada H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 1-8Google Scholar) and bacilli (3de Mendoza D. Schujman G.S. Aguilar P.S. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Relatives: from Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.2001: 43-55Google Scholar), which have the function of introducing double bonds into fatty acyl chains. Although they all utilize molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents obtained from an electron transport chain, and the basic mechanism of the desaturation reaction may be very similar in all cases (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar), fatty acid desaturases can be classified into three main subfamilies (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar): (i) the soluble acyl carrier protein desaturases that introduce double bonds into fatty acids esterified to acyl carrier protein and are found in the stroma of plant plastids (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar); (ii) the acyl-lipid desaturases, which are membrane-bound enzymes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar), the plant chloroplast membrane (5Ohlroge J. Brownse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic membrane of some bacilli (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar), and the plasmatic and thylacoid membranes of cyanobacteria (7Mustardy L. Los D.A. Gombos Z. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 93: 10524-10527Google Scholar) that desaturate fatty acids esterified in glycerolipids; (iii) the acyl-CoA desaturases, which introduce double bonds into fatty acids esterified to CoA (8Enoch H.G. Catala A. Sttrimatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Google Scholar) and are associated to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of animals and fungi (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar).The soluble and the membrane-bound desaturases show different consensus motifs (for a review, see 4). Database searching for these motifs reveals that they belong to two distinct multifunctional classes of iron-dependent enzymes, each of which includes desaturases, hydroxylases, and epoxidases that act on fatty acids or other hydrophobic substrates (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar, 9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). The soluble class contains a consensus motif consisting of carboxylate and histidine ligands that coordinate an active site di-iron cluster, as revealed by the x-ray structure of the castor Δ9 stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (10Lindquist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Google Scholar). The integral membrane class contains a different consensus motif for the putative active site composed of three histidine-rich regions, which are presumably involved in iron binding (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the structural information on membrane desaturases is scarce because of the technical limitations in obtaining large quantities of purified protein and the intrinsic difficulties in obtaining crystals from membrane proteins.Membrane-bound desaturases belong to a superfamily of membrane iron proteins that share the purported iron ligand substrates (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar, 9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Similar His-rich motifs are present in the bacterial membrane enzymes AlkB 1The abbreviations used are: AlkB, alkane hydroxylase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; TMS, transmembrane segment; XP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt. 1The abbreviations used are: AlkB, alkane hydroxylase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; TMS, transmembrane segment; XP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt. and xylene monooxygenase (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar), which share strikingly similar residue spacings notwithstanding the different catalytic abilities of these enzymes. These residues are uniformly predicted to be located in the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, rather than in membrane-spanning domains (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Because all the substrates for these enzymes are highly hydrophobic, they will likely partition into the lipid bilayer. In contrast, the electron donors for these enzymes are either soluble or peripheral membrane proteins (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar). Overall, these features suggest that an active site assembled from these His-containing sequences may occur at or near the membrane surface.The currently accepted structural model for membrane-bound desaturases was initially proposed by Stukey et al. (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar) based in the sequences of rat and yeast Δ9 stearoyl-CoA desaturases. In this model, two long hydrophobic regions of 50 residues are predicted to span twice the membrane each (see Fig. 1). According to this model, most of the protein (240 of 334 residues for the rat Δ9 desaturase) is located in the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, in two relatively long soluble stretches (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar). This proposal was supported by the experimental determination of the topology of the membrane-bound AlkB fromPseudomonas oleovorans (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Later, Shanklin et al. (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar) identified eight His residues essential for the function of the rat Δ9 desaturase that are expected to bind the two iron ions in the active site. Five of these His residues are located in the cytosolic region flanked by these two transmembrane domains, whereas the remaining three His ligands are found in the soluble C terminal region (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Since this structural model was proposed by Shanklin et al. (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar), many desaturase sequences were identified, but the model has not been challenged or supported directly by the experimental determination of the topology of any membrane-bound fatty acid desaturase.We have reported recently the isolation and characterization of thedes gene encoding the Bacillus subtilis membrane integral desaturase, Δ5-Des (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar), which introduces a cisdouble bond at the Δ5 position of the acyl chain of membrane glycerolipids (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar, 13Grau R. de Mendoza D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 535-542Google Scholar). This temperature-regulated acyl-lipid desaturase (14Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L. Erazo A. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 1681-1691Google Scholar) exhibits relatively low sequence identity (typically about 23%) to membrane desaturases from cyanobacteria and plants (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). The B. subtilis desaturase contains all three histidine clusters found in the known membrane desaturases with the appropriate spacing (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). An additional, fourth His cluster (not found in other known desaturases) is located downstream from the third, conserved one (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Δ5-Des contains many hydrophobic stretches, consistent with the presence of several membrane-spanning domains. The hydropathy profile of the deduced amino acid sequence of the des gene is similar to those of Δ6, Δ12, and ω3 desaturases from cyanobacteria and to almost all known membrane-associated plant desaturases. Moreover, the spacings between each His-containing region and the end of the previous hydrophobic domain are conserved, as well, in the above mentioned acyl-lipid desaturases (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). Instead, the hydropathy plots of Δ5-Des, as well as of membrane-bound desaturases from different sources, show some differences with that of AlkB, which has provided the only experimental model for this superfamily of enzymes (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). For these reasons, we were prompted to study the membrane topology of Δ5-Des through different experimental approaches that are finally aimed to understand the structure and function relationship in this family of enzymes.In this paper we attempted to address the following issues. (i) Are the His regions conserved in all desaturases equally essential in theB. subtilis Δ5-Des? (ii) Which is the topology of B. subtilis Δ5-Des? (iii) Are there different topologies in membrane desaturases and alkane hydroxylases? We present evidence that Δ5-Des is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane- and one membrane-associated domain. In addition, we show that a tripartite motif of His essential for catalysis is located on the cytoplasmic phase of the membrane. Our results and the presently available hydrophobicity profile of membrane-associated desaturases from different sources now permit some discussion of a novel structure for acyl-lipid desaturases.DISCUSSIONThis work provides crucial data for delineating the topology of a membrane-bound desaturase based on experimental grounds. First, we have identified the Δ5-Des essential His clusters involved in iron ligation by site-directed mutagenesis, which are coincident with those already identified in rat Δ9 and cyanobacterial Δ12 desaturases (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar, 26Avelange-Macerel M.H. Macherel D. Wada H. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 111-114Google Scholar). Our data also allow us to discard the possibility that the fourth His-rich region, which is found exclusively in the B. subtilis Δ5-Des, is involved in the active site. However, the C-terminal truncated mutant in which residues 294–352 were eliminated is inactive, indicating that this region is essential either for desaturase activity or for the appropriate protein folding in the cytosol.Second, through the analysis of protein fusion expression with alkaline phosphatase, we have been able to determine the membrane topology of the B. subtilis Δ5-Des. The results obtained with the Δ5-Des-PhoA fusions, as well as the systematic mutagenesis of conserved His residues, are fully consistent with the proposed model shown in Fig. 5. The polypeptide chain of Δ5-Des is oriented such that both the N and C termini face the cytosol, where the putative binuclear iron-active site (defined by the conserved His ligands) is located within several intervening membrane-associated domains.Δ5-Des has six transmembrane domains: I (residues 30–50), II (residues 53–73), IIIa (residues 118–138), IV (residues 153–173), V (residues 191–211), and VI (residues 214–234). The model shown in Fig. 5 thus reveals the presence of two additional transmembrane domains when compared with the proposed topology of membrane desaturases, based on the sequence analysis of Δ9stearoyl-CoA desaturase and the experimental topology of AlkB (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar, 12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Surface Lys biotinylation experiments on Δ5-Des confirmed that the loop located between the putative TMSs IIIa and IV is located in the periplasm, giving further support to the model derived from PhoA fusion experiments. On the other hand, the model shown in Fig. 5 does not fully agree with the hydropathy plot from the deduced amino acid sequence of Δ5-Des discussed in the present work (Fig 2A). This theoretical analysis suggests the existence of TMS IV, but domain IIIa cannot be predicted accurately as a membrane-embedded region. Interestingly, the IIIa domain in Δ5-Des is clearly present in the hydropathy plots of some Δ6 acyl-lipid desaturases, for instance, Borago officinalis (NCBI accession number AAD01410.1) and Mucor circinelloides (NCBI accession number BAB69055.1) (see Supplemental Material). In addition, our experiments show that the segment comprising residues 89–109 is located in a soluble portion of Δ5-Des rather than forming a TMS, as suggested by the hydrophobic plot shown in Fig. 2A. Notably, this segment is located between the two first His clusters and might correspond to a protein region spatially located close to the iron-active site. A closer analysis of the hydropathy plots of several acyl-CoA and acyl-lipid desaturases reveals the presence of such a hydrophobic stretch located between the two firsts His clusters. We therefore feel confident to propose that this region might be involved in substrate recognition. This segment is also present in AlkB (Fig. 2A), which is able to hydroxylate medium-sized alkane molecules (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural features able to shape the activity of similar di-iron-active sites toward double bond formation or hydroxylation of saturated alkyl chains is still a challenging issue that remains to be solved. Another relatively long hydrophobic stretch (residues 256–270) is positioned close in sequence to the third His-rich region, in the long cytoplasmatic C-terminal portion of Δ5-Des (Fig. 2A). The hydrophobic regions in the soluble portion should not be unexpected, because they may indicate protein regions that interact with the acyl chains of membrane lipids. These regions may represent a hydrophobic patch located close to the di-iron-active site, because it involves mostly residues located in the sequence next to the iron ligands.The hydropathy profile of Δ5-Des, as well as those of many glycerolipid desaturases from different sources, predicts five or six transmembrane helical segments (see Supplemental Material). However, alkane hydroxylases (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar) and acyl-CoA Δ9 desaturases involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in yeast (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (27Thiede M.A. Ozols J. Strittmater P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13230-13235Google Scholar) lack the TMS 4 found in acyl-lipid desaturases. Apparently, the topographic difference found among membrane-associated desaturases could also be extended to mammalian desaturases involved in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. The hydropathy plots of murine and human Δ6 desaturase (accession number NP_ 062673, AAD 20018) predict only 4 TMS (28Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Google Scholar), whereas human Δ5 desaturase (NCBI accession number AAF 29378) shows a similar profile to Δ5-Des (29Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37335-37339Google Scholar). It has been reported that the substrate for rat liver microsomal Δ6 desaturase is linoleyl-CoA (30Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Google Scholar), whereas a Δ5 desaturase from a similar origin can directly desaturate 2-eicosatrienoic-phosphatidylcholine and 2-arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (31Pugh E.L. Kates M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 68-73Google Scholar, 32Pugh E.L. Kates M. Lipids. 1979; 14: 159-165Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of additional TMSs might be essential for desaturation of the acyl chains of membrane glycerolipids by stabilizing the structure and/or the activity of acyl-lipid desaturases. This study thus raises an interesting question about the functions of the cytoplasmic hydrophobic segments positioned close to the essential His in all membrane-associated desaturases and the TMS 4 domain found almost exclusively in acyl-lipid desaturases, which will require further experiments. The fatty acyl desaturases encompass a family of enzymes, representatives of which are found in all lower eukaryotes, plants and animals (for a review see Ref. 1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar), and some prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria (2Murata N. Wada H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 1-8Google Scholar) and bacilli (3de Mendoza D. Schujman G.S. Aguilar P.S. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Its Relatives: from Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.2001: 43-55Google Scholar), which have the function of introducing double bonds into fatty acyl chains. Although they all utilize molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents obtained from an electron transport chain, and the basic mechanism of the desaturation reaction may be very similar in all cases (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar), fatty acid desaturases can be classified into three main subfamilies (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar): (i) the soluble acyl carrier protein desaturases that introduce double bonds into fatty acids esterified to acyl carrier protein and are found in the stroma of plant plastids (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar); (ii) the acyl-lipid desaturases, which are membrane-bound enzymes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar), the plant chloroplast membrane (5Ohlroge J. Brownse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic membrane of some bacilli (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar), and the plasmatic and thylacoid membranes of cyanobacteria (7Mustardy L. Los D.A. Gombos Z. Murata N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 93: 10524-10527Google Scholar) that desaturate fatty acids esterified in glycerolipids; (iii) the acyl-CoA desaturases, which introduce double bonds into fatty acids esterified to CoA (8Enoch H.G. Catala A. Sttrimatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Google Scholar) and are associated to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of animals and fungi (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar). The soluble and the membrane-bound desaturases show different consensus motifs (for a review, see 4). Database searching for these motifs reveals that they belong to two distinct multifunctional classes of iron-dependent enzymes, each of which includes desaturases, hydroxylases, and epoxidases that act on fatty acids or other hydrophobic substrates (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar, 9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). The soluble class contains a consensus motif consisting of carboxylate and histidine ligands that coordinate an active site di-iron cluster, as revealed by the x-ray structure of the castor Δ9 stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (10Lindquist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Google Scholar). The integral membrane class contains a different consensus motif for the putative active site composed of three histidine-rich regions, which are presumably involved in iron binding (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the structural information on membrane desaturases is scarce because of the technical limitations in obtaining large quantities of purified protein and the intrinsic difficulties in obtaining crystals from membrane proteins. Membrane-bound desaturases belong to a superfamily of membrane iron proteins that share the purported iron ligand substrates (4Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Google Scholar, 9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Similar His-rich motifs are present in the bacterial membrane enzymes AlkB 1The abbreviations used are: AlkB, alkane hydroxylase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; TMS, transmembrane segment; XP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt. 1The abbreviations used are: AlkB, alkane hydroxylase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NHS-SS-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; TMS, transmembrane segment; XP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt. and xylene monooxygenase (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar), which share strikingly similar residue spacings notwithstanding the different catalytic abilities of these enzymes. These residues are uniformly predicted to be located in the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, rather than in membrane-spanning domains (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar). Because all the substrates for these enzymes are highly hydrophobic, they will likely partition into the lipid bilayer. In contrast, the electron donors for these enzymes are either soluble or peripheral membrane proteins (1Totcher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Progr. Lipid. Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Google Scholar). Overall, these features suggest that an active site assembled from these His-containing sequences may occur at or near the membrane surface. The currently accepted structural model for membrane-bound desaturases was initially proposed by Stukey et al. (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar) based in the sequences of rat and yeast Δ9 stearoyl-CoA desaturases. In this model, two long hydrophobic regions of 50 residues are predicted to span twice the membrane each (see Fig. 1). According to this model, most of the protein (240 of 334 residues for the rat Δ9 desaturase) is located in the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, in two relatively long soluble stretches (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar). This proposal was supported by the experimental determination of the topology of the membrane-bound AlkB fromPseudomonas oleovorans (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Later, Shanklin et al. (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar) identified eight His residues essential for the function of the rat Δ9 desaturase that are expected to bind the two iron ions in the active site. Five of these His residues are located in the cytosolic region flanked by these two transmembrane domains, whereas the remaining three His ligands are found in the soluble C terminal region (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Since this structural model was proposed by Shanklin et al. (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar), many desaturase sequences were identified, but the model has not been challenged or supported directly by the experimental determination of the topology of any membrane-bound fatty acid desaturase. We have reported recently the isolation and characterization of thedes gene encoding the Bacillus subtilis membrane integral desaturase, Δ5-Des (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar), which introduces a cisdouble bond at the Δ5 position of the acyl chain of membrane glycerolipids (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar, 13Grau R. de Mendoza D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 535-542Google Scholar). This temperature-regulated acyl-lipid desaturase (14Aguilar P.S. Hernandez-Arriaga A.M. Cybulski L. Erazo A. de Mendoza D. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 1681-1691Google Scholar) exhibits relatively low sequence identity (typically about 23%) to membrane desaturases from cyanobacteria and plants (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). The B. subtilis desaturase contains all three histidine clusters found in the known membrane desaturases with the appropriate spacing (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). An additional, fourth His cluster (not found in other known desaturases) is located downstream from the third, conserved one (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Δ5-Des contains many hydrophobic stretches, consistent with the presence of several membrane-spanning domains. The hydropathy profile of the deduced amino acid sequence of the des gene is similar to those of Δ6, Δ12, and ω3 desaturases from cyanobacteria and to almost all known membrane-associated plant desaturases. Moreover, the spacings between each His-containing region and the end of the previous hydrophobic domain are conserved, as well, in the above mentioned acyl-lipid desaturases (6Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Google Scholar). Instead, the hydropathy plots of Δ5-Des, as well as of membrane-bound desaturases from different sources, show some differences with that of AlkB, which has provided the only experimental model for this superfamily of enzymes (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). For these reasons, we were prompted to study the membrane topology of Δ5-Des through different experimental approaches that are finally aimed to understand the structure and function relationship in this family of enzymes. In this paper we attempted to address the following issues. (i) Are the His regions conserved in all desaturases equally essential in theB. subtilis Δ5-Des? (ii) Which is the topology of B. subtilis Δ5-Des? (iii) Are there different topologies in membrane desaturases and alkane hydroxylases? We present evidence that Δ5-Des is a polytopic membrane protein with six transmembrane- and one membrane-associated domain. In addition, we show that a tripartite motif of His essential for catalysis is located on the cytoplasmic phase of the membrane. Our results and the presently available hydrophobicity profile of membrane-associated desaturases from different sources now permit some discussion of a novel structure for acyl-lipid desaturases. DISCUSSIONThis work provides crucial data for delineating the topology of a membrane-bound desaturase based on experimental grounds. First, we have identified the Δ5-Des essential His clusters involved in iron ligation by site-directed mutagenesis, which are coincident with those already identified in rat Δ9 and cyanobacterial Δ12 desaturases (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar, 26Avelange-Macerel M.H. Macherel D. Wada H. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 111-114Google Scholar). Our data also allow us to discard the possibility that the fourth His-rich region, which is found exclusively in the B. subtilis Δ5-Des, is involved in the active site. However, the C-terminal truncated mutant in which residues 294–352 were eliminated is inactive, indicating that this region is essential either for desaturase activity or for the appropriate protein folding in the cytosol.Second, through the analysis of protein fusion expression with alkaline phosphatase, we have been able to determine the membrane topology of the B. subtilis Δ5-Des. The results obtained with the Δ5-Des-PhoA fusions, as well as the systematic mutagenesis of conserved His residues, are fully consistent with the proposed model shown in Fig. 5. The polypeptide chain of Δ5-Des is oriented such that both the N and C termini face the cytosol, where the putative binuclear iron-active site (defined by the conserved His ligands) is located within several intervening membrane-associated domains.Δ5-Des has six transmembrane domains: I (residues 30–50), II (residues 53–73), IIIa (residues 118–138), IV (residues 153–173), V (residues 191–211), and VI (residues 214–234). The model shown in Fig. 5 thus reveals the presence of two additional transmembrane domains when compared with the proposed topology of membrane desaturases, based on the sequence analysis of Δ9stearoyl-CoA desaturase and the experimental topology of AlkB (9Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Google Scholar, 12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Surface Lys biotinylation experiments on Δ5-Des confirmed that the loop located between the putative TMSs IIIa and IV is located in the periplasm, giving further support to the model derived from PhoA fusion experiments. On the other hand, the model shown in Fig. 5 does not fully agree with the hydropathy plot from the deduced amino acid sequence of Δ5-Des discussed in the present work (Fig 2A). This theoretical analysis suggests the existence of TMS IV, but domain IIIa cannot be predicted accurately as a membrane-embedded region. Interestingly, the IIIa domain in Δ5-Des is clearly present in the hydropathy plots of some Δ6 acyl-lipid desaturases, for instance, Borago officinalis (NCBI accession number AAD01410.1) and Mucor circinelloides (NCBI accession number BAB69055.1) (see Supplemental Material). In addition, our experiments show that the segment comprising residues 89–109 is located in a soluble portion of Δ5-Des rather than forming a TMS, as suggested by the hydrophobic plot shown in Fig. 2A. Notably, this segment is located between the two first His clusters and might correspond to a protein region spatially located close to the iron-active site. A closer analysis of the hydropathy plots of several acyl-CoA and acyl-lipid desaturases reveals the presence of such a hydrophobic stretch located between the two firsts His clusters. We therefore feel confident to propose that this region might be involved in substrate recognition. This segment is also present in AlkB (Fig. 2A), which is able to hydroxylate medium-sized alkane molecules (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural features able to shape the activity of similar di-iron-active sites toward double bond formation or hydroxylation of saturated alkyl chains is still a challenging issue that remains to be solved. Another relatively long hydrophobic stretch (residues 256–270) is positioned close in sequence to the third His-rich region, in the long cytoplasmatic C-terminal portion of Δ5-Des (Fig. 2A). The hydrophobic regions in the soluble portion should not be unexpected, because they may indicate protein regions that interact with the acyl chains of membrane lipids. These regions may represent a hydrophobic patch located close to the di-iron-active site, because it involves mostly residues located in the sequence next to the iron ligands.The hydropathy profile of Δ5-Des, as well as those of many glycerolipid desaturases from different sources, predicts five or six transmembrane helical segments (see Supplemental Material). However, alkane hydroxylases (12van Beilen J.B. Penning D. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9194-9201Google Scholar) and acyl-CoA Δ9 desaturases involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in yeast (11Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20144-20149Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (27Thiede M.A. Ozols J. Strittmater P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13230-13235Google Scholar) lack the TMS 4 found in acyl-lipid desaturases. Apparently, the topographic difference found among membrane-associated desaturases could also be extended to mammalian desaturases involved in polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. The hydropathy plots of murine and human Δ6 desaturase (accession number NP_ 062673, AAD 20018) predict only 4 TMS (28Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 471-477Google Scholar), whereas human Δ5 desaturase (NCBI accession number AAF 29378) shows a similar profile to Δ5-Des (29Cho H.P. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37335-37339Google Scholar). It has been reported that the substrate for rat liver microsomal Δ6 desaturase is linoleyl-CoA (30Okayasu T. Nagao M. Ishibashi T. Imai Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 21-28Google Scholar), whereas a Δ5 desaturase from a similar origin can directly desaturate 2-eicosatrienoic-phosphatidylcholine and 2-arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (31Pugh E.L. Kates M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 68-73Google Scholar, 32Pugh E.L. Kates M. Lipids. 1979; 14: 159-165Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of additional TMSs might be essential for desaturation of the acyl chains of membrane glycerolipids by stabilizing the structure and/or the activity of acyl-lipid desaturases.

https://openalex.org/W1493414602,"Abstract Protein synthesis in rat intestinal mucosal cells has been studied in slices and subcellular fractions. Intestinal cells incorporated 14C-l-leucine into protein at rates comparable to that of liver. However, homogenates of intestine were inactive in protein synthesis. It was found that polyribosomes could not be isolated from intestinal mucosa without the use of methods to diminish ribonuclease activity. The jejunal mucosa was found to contain more soluble ribonuclease activity than ileal mucosa. This increase in activity could be eliminated by prior ligation of the common bile duct, thereby reducing intraluminal pancreatic enzymes. Tissue slices from the jejunum incorporated less 14C-l-leucine into protein than ileal slices, and this difference appeared to be explained, at least in part, by the difference in mucosal ribonuclease activity. Ribonuclease was found to be absorbed by the intestine into the portal vein in small but nevertheless significant amounts. It is concluded that in the rat ribonuclease can be absorbed by the intact intestine, and can modify the function of intestinal cells in vitro as well as the structure and function of isolated ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1523121597,"Abstract At high pH values or in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 m guanidinium chloride, or 8 m urea, apotryptophanase (mol wt 220,000) dissociates into four subunits of molecular weight near 55,000. Evidence is presented as follows that each of these subunits contains two apparently identical peptide chains joined through a disulfide linkage. (a) Reduced, carboxymethylated and performate-oxidized apoptrytophanase both show molecular weights of 28,000 to 30,000; apotryptophanase in 5 m guanidinium chloride shows a similar molecular weight only after treatment with dithiothreitol at alkaline pH values. (b) Analyses for cysteic acid in hydrolysates of performate-oxidized apotryptophanase and for carboxymethylcysteine in reduced and carboxymethylated apotryptophanase both show the presence of 24 half-cystine residues per molecule, in agreement with the 24 —SH groups titratable with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) in the dithiothreitol-treated, denatured protein. Only 16 —SH groups are found by DTNB titration or by carboxymethylation if reduction with dithiothreitol is omitted. These results indicate that apotryptophanase contains 16 free —SH groups and 4 disulfide bridges per molecule (mol wt 220,000), corresponding to 1 disulfide bridge per subunit. Of the 16 free —SH groups, only 8 react with DTNB in the native enzyme, and these are essential for enzymatic activity. (c) Dinitrophenylation yielded 7.2 moles (corrected) of dinitrophenylmethionine, and catalytic hydrazinolysis yielded 8.4 moles (corrected) of valine, per 220,000 g of apotryptophanase. Digestion of denatured apotryptophanase with carboxypeptidase A yielded 7.3 moles of valine per 220,000 g. These values indicate the presence of eight peptide chains with identical NH2-terminal (methionine) and COOH-terminal (valine) amino acids. (d) Peptide maps of reduced, carboxymethylated apotryptophanase following tryptic digestion showed the presence of 34 to 36 ninhydrin-reactive spots, 15 spots positive to Sakaguchi's reagent, and 1 tryptophan-containing spot. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of cyanogen bromide-treated apotryptophanase showed nine zones. These values are within experimental error of those expected from quantitative amino acid analyses on the assumption that eight identical peptide chains are present per 220,000 g of tryptophanase (i.e. 31 eq of residues of lysine plus arginine, 14 of arginine, 1 of tryptophan, and 8 of methionine per 27,500 g of apotryptophanase). Since tetrameric native apotryptophanase contains only four binding sites for pyridoxal-P per molecule, the coenzyme must bind to only one of the two peptide chains comprising each monomer. The distribution of peptides in maps of tryptic digests of apoenzyme and reduced holoenzyme supports this supposition."

In vitro, these proteins bind to single-stranded nucleic acids and destabilize nucleic acid secondary structures. An unusual surface-exposed patch of 6 evolutionarily conserved aromatic amino acids is thought to be involved in RNA binding by the cold-shock proteins. Here we investigated the functional role of the aromatic patch in E. coli CspE by substituting individual aromatic residues with positively charged Arg residues. These substitutions do not affect the RNA binding activity of the CspE mutants. We show that substitutions of three centrally located aromatic patch amino acid residues, Phe17, Phe30, and His32, abolish the ability of the mutant CspE to acclimatize cells to cold, antiterminate transcription and melt nucleic acids but have no effect on RNA binding. On the other hand, peripherally located Trp10, Phe19, and Phe33 can be substituted with Arg without loss of any of the in vivo and in vitro CspE functions tested. The results thus indicate that these aromatic patch residues have clearly distinct functional roles and further extend the correlation between the essential function of CspA homologues in cold acclimation and their ability to antiterminate transcription.

The results thus indicate that these aromatic patch residues have clearly distinct functional roles and further extend the correlation between the essential function of CspA homologues in cold acclimation and their ability to antiterminate transcription. The cold-shock response is a physiological response of living cells to temperature downshift (1Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). When an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli is shifted from 37 to 15 °C, there is a transient arrest of cell growth characterized by severe inhibition of general protein synthesis. However, synthesis of a number of proteins, the so-called cold-shock proteins, is induced under these conditions. Synthesis of CspA protein is dramatically induced immediately following the temperature downshift, and this protein becomes one of the most abundant proteins in the cell (for a review, see Refs. 2Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 3Phadtare S. Yamanaka K. Inouye M. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2000: 33-45Google Scholar, 4Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Eventually, the synthesis of CspA decreases, cells become acclimated to low temperature, and growth resumes.CspA homologues are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and the cold-shock domain of human Y-box protein YB-1 and of other eukaryotic Y-box proteins is also homologous to CspA (for a review, see Refs.4 and 5). In E. coli, the CspA protein family is represented by nine homologous proteins, from CspA to CspI, of which CspA, CspB, CspG, and CspI are cold-shock-inducible. However, cells harboring double or triple deletions of genes coding for cold-shock-inducible CspA homologues (ΔcspAΔcspB, ΔcspAΔcspG, ΔcspBΔcspG, ΔcspAΔcspI, or ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG) are not cold-sensitive (6Xia B. Ke H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This and the fact that in a triple deletion strain ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG, the CspE protein, which is normally constitutively produced at 37 °C, is overproduced at low temperatures, suggest that the functions of the CspA family members overlap and that they are able to functionally substitute for each other during cold acclimation.The exact mechanism(s) by which CspA family proteins allow cells to acclimate to cold is not known. In vitro, CspA, CspB, CspC, and CspE are able to bind RNA and single-stranded DNA with low sequence specificity and low binding affinity (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Binding of CspA and CspE to RNA destabilizes RNA secondary structures (7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 9Bae W. Xia B. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Known biochemical and physiological properties of CspA homologues appear to stem from either nucleic acid binding or melting activities. For example, purified CspE impedes poly(A)-mediated 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic decay by PNPase and inhibits both internal cleavage and poly(A) tail removal by RNase E (10Feng Y. Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31651-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hanna and Liu (11Hanna M.M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CspE interacted with the nascent RNA in transcription elongation complexes and interfered with Q-mediated transcription antitermination. The link between Csp protein function and transcription regulation was further strengthened by the demonstration that several Csp proteins, including CspA and CspE, can act as transcription antiterminators in vivo and in vitro. During cold shock, the expression of several promoter-distal genes of the metY-rpsO operon whose products themselves are involved in cold acclimation is increased at the level of transcription antitermination. Overproduction of either CspA, CspE, or CspC at high temperature leads to similar increase in promoter-distal metY-rpsO operon gene expression (9Bae W. Xia B. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that CspA homologue function at cold shock is at least partially due to its ability to antiterminate transcription. Nucleic acid melting activity is required for both cold acclimation and transcription antitermination functions of CspE (12Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Additional consequences of overproduction of CspA homologues include (i) up-regulation of rpoS expression, which appears to depend only on Csp RNA binding (13Phadtare S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and (ii) induction of cell resistance to camphor, through undefined mechanisms (14Hu K.H. Liu E. Dean K. Gingras M. DeGraff W. Trun N.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of CspA from E. coli has been solved by both x-ray crystallography and NMR (15Feng W. Tejero R. Zimmerman D.E. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10881-10896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M. Montelione G.T.

Two evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding motifs, RNP1 and RNP2, are located on the β2 and β3 strands. The RNP1 Trp11, Phe18, and Phe20 and the RNP2 Phe31, His33, and Phe34 (the corresponding residues in CspE are Trp10, Phe17, Phe19, Phe30, His32, and Phe33, respectively) form a compact surface-exposed aromatic patch on the CspA three-dimensional structure (Fig.1) (15Feng W. Tejero R. Zimmerman D.E. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10881-10896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M.

A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Presumably, the aromatic patch residues contribute to nucleic acid binding by intercalating between DNA or RNA bases. Several studies involving site-directed mutagenesis of aromatic patch residues have been performed. The results of these studies suggested that substitution of aromatic patch amino acids for leucine or serine residues destabilized Csp proteins and interfered with RNA binding (18Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The results of these analyses extended our understanding of CspE structure and function but did not shed light into physiologically important nucleic acid melting function. We previously reported a mutation in CspE, a substitution of aromatic patch His32 with Arg, which dissected the nucleic acid binding and melting functions of the protein. The mutant protein was stable and bound RNA normally, presumably due to the introduction of an extra positive charge in the RAN-binding surface. However, it was unable to melt nucleic acids (12Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In the present article, the role of aromatic patch residues in nucleic acid melting was systematically investigated by individually substituting every residue with Arg residues. We show that in addition to His32, Phe17 and Phe30 residues are also important for nucleic acid melting by CspE. On the other hand, substitutions of peripheral aromatic patch amino acid residues, Trp10, Phe19, and Phe33, have no effect on nucleic acid melting. Thus, the centrally located aromatic patch triad of Phe17, Phe30, and His32 in CspE appears to initiate nucleic acid melting, which is then extended further to the periphery of the patch. In all cases, the inability to melt nucleic acids in vitro results in the inability of CspE to antiterminate transcription and its function in cold acclimation, further supporting the idea that these two functions are linked.DISCUSSIONThe research into the physiological functions of CspA homologues has been mostly focused on protein stability and folding and RNA binding (18Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ever since the structures of CspA homologues became available, it has been assumed that an unusual surface-exposed patch of 6 evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues participates in nucleic acid binding. Several groups showed that substitutions of aromatic residues in these proteins lead to a loss of the nucleic acid binding ability and also destabilize the structure. In particular, Phe18, Phe20, and Phe31 ofE. coli CspA or corresponding residues inBacillus CspB are critical in this aspect (18Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Vu D.M. Reid K.L. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). General considerations as well as some recent data suggest that it is the ability of CspA homologues to destabilize nucleic acid secondary structures that are critical for their ability to function in cold acclimation. At low temperatures, the secondary structures of RNA are stabilized, slowing down transcription elongation and ribosomal movement on RNA. Csps, acting like “RNA chaperones,” could destabilize the secondary structures in RNA and thus facilitate transcription and translation (5Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).The role of aromatic patch residues in nucleic acid melting was not looked at previously. Mutational analysis of nucleic acid melting by Csp is complicated by the fact that mutant proteins under study should retain their nucleic acid binding ability. Recently, we isolated a mutation in CspE, changing aromatic patch His32 to Arg in an in vivo genetic screen (12Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This mutant did not affect nucleic acid binding but abolished the nucleic acid melting function of the protein. The mutant was defective in cold acclimation and transcription antitermination, supporting the idea that nucleic acid melting is critical for these functions of CspE. Here, we extended the results of our original work by performing systematic substitutions of each of the aromatic patch residues with Arg and studying the effects on in vivo and in vitro CspE functions. The results clearly demonstrate functional specialization within the aromatic patch residues. The 3 central amino acid residues, Phe17, Phe30, and His32,are each required for nucleic acid melting by CspE. On the other hand, the 3 peripheral amino acid residues (Trp10, Phe19, and Phe33) (Fig. 1, indicated in yellow) can be substituted with Arg without loss of nucleic acid melting. The results thus support the following hypothetical scenario of the interaction of CspA homologues with nucleic acids. The primary interaction is probably due to a set of positively charged Lys residues (Lys4, Lys10, Lys16, Lys28, Lys43, and Lys60) that surround the aromatic patch (Fig. 1, indicated in green). This primary electrostatic interaction must position CspE such that Phe17, Phe30, and His32 residues can intercalate between the bases and thus initiate separation of the nucleic acid strands. Substitution of any one of these residues by Arg actually increases RNA binding presumably by electrostatic interactions but completely prevents melting since its side chain containing the guanidino group is unable to intercalate between the bases. Once initiated at the center of the aromatic patch, melting could propagate further outside in both directions, and Trp10, Phe19, Phe33 may help at this stage, although these additional interactions may not be essential in the context of the Arg substitutions studied here. Our data do not allow us to determine whether only one of the central aromatic patch residues, which are all in Van de Waals contact with each other, is particularly important for the initiation of melting, or whether all three residues act in concert. Future analysis of melting intermediates using model substrates and the CspE mutants described here should clarify this issue. The cold-shock response is a physiological response of living cells to temperature downshift (1Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar).

Csps, acting like “RNA chaperones,” could destabilize the secondary structures in RNA and thus facilitate transcription and translation (5Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 7Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar).The role of aromatic patch residues in nucleic acid melting was not looked at previously. Mutational analysis of nucleic acid melting by Csp is complicated by the fact that mutant proteins under study should retain their nucleic acid binding ability. Recently, we isolated a mutation in CspE, changing aromatic patch His32 to Arg in an in vivo genetic screen (12Phadtare S. Inouye M. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7239-7245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This mutant did not affect nucleic acid binding but abolished the nucleic acid melting function of the protein. The mutant was defective in cold acclimation and transcription antitermination, supporting the idea that nucleic acid melting is critical for these functions of CspE. Here, we extended the results of our original work by performing systematic substitutions of each of the aromatic patch residues with Arg and studying the effects on in vivo and in vitro CspE functions. The results clearly demonstrate functional specialization within the aromatic patch residues. The 3 central amino acid residues, Phe17, Phe30, and His32,are each required for nucleic acid melting by CspE. On the other hand, the 3 peripheral amino acid residues (Trp10, Phe19, and Phe33) (Fig. 1, indicated in yellow) can be substituted with Arg without loss of nucleic acid melting. The results thus support the following hypothetical scenario of the interaction of CspA homologues with nucleic acids. The primary interaction is probably due to a set of positively charged Lys residues (Lys4, Lys10, Lys16, Lys28, Lys43, and Lys60) that surround the aromatic patch (Fig. 1, indicated in green). This primary electrostatic interaction must position CspE such that Phe17, Phe30, and His32 residues can intercalate between the bases and thus initiate separation of the nucleic acid strands. Substitution of any one of these residues by Arg actually increases RNA binding presumably by electrostatic interactions but completely prevents melting since its side chain containing the guanidino group is unable to intercalate between the bases. Once initiated at the center of the aromatic patch, melting could propagate further outside in both directions, and Trp10, Phe19, Phe33 may help at this stage, although these additional interactions may not be essential in the context of the Arg substitutions studied here. Our data do not allow us to determine whether only one of the central aromatic patch residues, which are all in Van de Waals contact with each other, is particularly important for the initiation of melting, or whether all three residues act in concert. Future analysis of melting intermediates using model substrates and the CspE mutants described here should clarify this issue. The research into the physiological functions of CspA homologues has been mostly focused on protein stability and folding and RNA binding (18Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M.

Marahiel M.A. Mol Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ever since the structures of CspA homologues became available, it has been assumed that an unusual surface-exposed patch of 6 evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues participates in nucleic acid binding. Several groups showed that substitutions of aromatic residues in these proteins lead to a loss of the nucleic acid binding ability and also destabilize the structure. In particular, Phe18, Phe20, and Phe31 ofE. coli CspA or corresponding residues inBacillus CspB are critical in this aspect (18Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M.

In the present study, two kinds of RyR2 cDNA were constructed, one encoding the wild type mouse RyR2 (RyR2wt) and the other encoding modified RyR2, into which was inserted a cDNA encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP was inserted into the divergent region 1 (DR1) of RyR2, after the Asp-4365 (RyR2D4365-GFP). HEK293 cells expressing both RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFPcDNAs showed caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive calcium release, demonstrating that both wild type and modified RyR2s form functional calcium release channels. Cells expressing the fusion protein, RyR2D4365-GFP, were readily identified by their fluorescence due to the presence of GFP, indicating that the inserted GFP folded properly. Both expressed RyR2s were purified from cell lysates in a single step by affinity chromatography using a GST-FKBP12.6 as the affinity ligand. Cryoelectron microscopy of purified RyR2s showed structurally intact receptors, and three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained by single particle image processing. The three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2wt appeared very similar to that of the native RyR2 purified from dog heart. The location of the inserted GFP, and consequently of DR1, was mapped on the three-dimensional structure of RyR2 to one of the subunit's characteristic domains, domain 3, also known as the “handle” domain. This study describes the first internal fusion of a protein into a ryanodine receptor, and it demonstrates the potential of this technology for localizing functional and structural domains on the three-dimensional structure of RyR.

Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Influx of Ca2+through the cardiac L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel on the plasma membrane triggers RyR2 to release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm (2Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] activates the myofilaments to generate cardiac muscle contraction. Recently, mutations of RyR2 have been implicated in some heart diseases (3Marks A.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 615-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). At least 21 RyR2 mutations are now linked to genetic forms of sudden cardiac death: catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (4Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Tiso N. Memmi M. Vignati G.

In addition, Marx and co-workers have proposed that hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by protein kinase A, which causes dissociation of the regulatory FKBP12.6 subunit from RyR2, affects RyR2 functioning and contributes to the ventricular arrhythmias that often occur during heart failure (8Marx S.O.

Two other mammalian isoforms of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), in addition to RyR2, have been identified and cloned (9Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H.

RyR isoform 1 (RyR1) is the major calcium release channel in skeletal muscle, and RyR isoform 3 (RyR3) is widely expressed in many tissues. These RyR isoforms, encoded by three different genes, share a high degree of sequence homology. For example, the amino acid sequence of rabbit RyR2 is 67 and 70% identical to RyR1 and RyR3, respectively (11Otsu K. Willard H.F. Khanna V.K. Zorzato F. Green N.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13472-13483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, the isoforms are expected to have essentially identical three-dimensional structures, except in a few limited regions corresponding to locations of high primary sequence diversity. Three such regions of high variability have been identified (14Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and named divergent regions 1, 2, and 3 (DR1, DR2, and DR3). DR1 is the largest of the divergent regions, comprising residues 4254–4631 of RyR1 and residues 4210–4562 of RyR2 (14Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). DR1 includes at least one transmembrane domain, one intraluminal loop, and one cytoplasmic loop, according to the predicted transmembrane topologies (9Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H.

In a previous study, we overexpressed RyR3 in HEK293 cells and purified the functional protein for structural studies (15Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study, mouse RyR2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified in a single step by affinity chromatography, and studied by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional reconstruction. As shown by our previous study on RyR3, an advantage of using cloned receptors for quantitative EM is that genetic manipulations can be made that effectively create sequence-specific labels. Here we have explored the utility of insertional gene fusions involving green fluorescent protein (GFP) for this purpose. GFP has been well established as a reporter protein for monitoring gene expression and protein targeting (16Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar), and it appears to be a good choice as an insertional fusion protein, because its characteristic green fluorescence depends on the proper folding of the protein (17Doi N. Yanagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Niwa H. Inouye S. Hirano T. Matsuno T. Kojima S. Kubota M. Ohashi M. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13617-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Indeed, this approach has been shown to be feasible for structural analysis of surface-exposed regions of icosahedral viruses by cryo-EM (19Kratz P.A. Böttcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Proteins of the size of GFP (molecular mass 28 kDa) are easily visualized and mapped by image processing, even at moderate (∼3-nm) resolution. In this study, a modified RyR2, containing GFP inserted after Asp-4365 within DR1, and termed RyR2D4365-GFP, was characterized by cryo-EM and three-dimensional reconstruction. This approach should be generally useful for mapping the RyR2 linear sequence onto the three-dimensional structure of the receptor, thereby providing insights into the structural basis of RyR2 functions. The cloning and construction of the 15-kb cDNA encoding the mouse cardiac muscle RyR2 have been described previously (20Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding GFP flanked by Gly-rich linkers and an AscI site (Fig. 1) was obtained by PCR, using the following primers: 5′-GGG CGC GCC GGT GGA GGT GGA AGT GGA GGT GGA GGT ACT ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG CTG-3′ and 5′-GGC GCG CCC ACC ACC TCC TCC AGA TCC TCC ACC ACC CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC GAG-3′. TheAscI site was introduced into the DR1 of RyR2 after Asp-4365 by overlap-extension PCR, using the following primers: 5′-GAC CTG ACA GAC GGG CGC GCC CTG ACA GAG GAG AGT GAT-3′ and 5′-CTC CTC TGT CAG GGC GCG CCC GTC TGT CAG GTC TTC AGA-3′. Then the AscI fragment containing GFP and linkers was subcloned into full-length RyR2wt after Asp-4365. The sequences of all PCR fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were transfected with RyR2 cDNAs (RyR2wt or RyR2D4365-GFP) using calcium phosphate as described previously (21Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol.

The transfected HEK293 cells were detergent-lysed in buffer (25 mm Na-PIPES, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% egg lecithin, and a protease inhibitor mix (2 mmbenzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.75 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by sedimentation, and sucrose (400 mm, final concentration) and NaCl (400 mm, final concentration) were added to the supernatant. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (100 μl) bound with 400 μg of GST-FKBP12.6 were added to the cell lysate supernatant. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 2 days. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with the lysis buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS and 0.25% egg lecithin. The RyR2s were eluted from the beads by incubation with 100 mm glutathione, in buffer (25 mm Na-PIPES, pH 7.2, 400 mm NaCl, 400 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% CHAPS, 0.16% egg lecithin, 200 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.4, and the protease inhibitor mix) for 15 min. The elution was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −90 °C. Free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the transfected HEK293 cells was measured with the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3 as described previously (21Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The purified RyR2 proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (6%) minigel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 30 V for 15–16 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder, incubated 1–2 h with anti-RyR antibody 34C or anti-GFP antibody PA1–980 (Affinity BioRegents, Golden, CO), and then washed three times for 15 min each with the same buffer. The bound antibodies were visualized by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse (for anti-RyR) or anti-rabbit (for anti-GFP) IgG and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (21Chen S.R.W.

Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysate was carried out as described previously (23Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with some modifications. [3H]ryanodine binding to the whole cell lysate was carried out in a total volume of 300 μl of binding solution containing 30 μl of cell lysate, 500 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.8 mm CaCl2, the protease inhibitor mix, and various concentrations of [3H]ryanodine at 37 °C for 2 h. For the Ca2+ response curve, the binding solution contained 5 nm [3H]ryanodine and various Ca2+ concentrations. The binding mixture was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 250 mm KCl and was filtered immediately through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed three times, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measurement of [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 30 μm unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate. The purified RyR2wt or RyR2D4365-GFP was diluted 5–10-fold with EM dilution buffer (20 mm Na-PIPES, pH 7.2, 400 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin). The cryoelectron microscopy procedures have been previously described in detail (15Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Selected electron micrographs were digitized using a Eurocore Hi-Scan microdensitometer (Saint-Denis, France). Image processing was performed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (24Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). 4-fold symmetry was enforced for all the two-dimensional averages and three-dimensional reconstructions. Three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained by the projection matching procedure (15Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the recombinant RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP, totals of 10,630 and 6,163 particle images were selected from 65 and 40 micrographs, respectively. The final three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP were computed from 4,365 and 3,961 particles, and the resolution in each was estimated by computing two independent reconstructions (from even- and odd-numbered particles) and using the Fourier shell correlation criteria with a cut-off of 0.5 (26Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvilli I.S. Grassucci R.A. Jünemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We designed a chimeric cDNA of RyR2 with the entire 238-amino acid GFP sequence inserted after Asp-4365 in DR1 (Fig. 1). Asp-4365 and nearby amino acids show strong hydrophilicity and are predicted to be surface-exposed on RyR2; hence, the GFP insertion was anticipated to have a minimal effect on the structure and function of RyR2. To further minimize potential disruptive effects of the insertion on folding of both GFP and RyR2, two Gly-rich spacers were added to flank either side of the GFP (19Kratz P.A. Böttcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The cDNAs corresponding to the fusion protein RyR2D4365-GFP and to RyR2wt were expressed in HEK293 cells. Fig. 2 shows phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy images of the HEK293 cells expressing the RyR2D4365-GFP. The green fluorescent color indicates that the inserted GFP folded properly. RyR2wt expressed in HEK293 cells has been shown to function as a Ca2+ release channel (20Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Chen S.R.W. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether RyR2D4365-GFP is functional as well, we measured the Ca2+ release response to ryanodine and caffeine in transfected HEK293 cells using the fluorescence Ca2+indicator dye fluo-3. As shown in Fig.3 A, RyR2D4365-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells that had not been pretreated with ryanodine responded to repeated caffeine stimulations as expected, since caffeine is a known activator of RyR channel activity. In contrast, treatment of HEK293 cells with ryanodine alone did not cause Ca2+ release, but cells pretreated with ryanodine did respond to the first caffeine stimulation, although they did not respond to second and third caffeine stimulations (Fig.3 B). The explanation of this behavior is as follows (27Chen S.R.W. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RyR2s in HEK293 cells should be in a closed or a low activity state at the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations; therefore, they would not be activated by ryanodine, because ryanodine interacts only with the channels in the open state (23Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first caffeine stimulation activated RyR2 channels to open, and these opened channels then became modified by ryanodine, which locked them in a fully open state and depleted the intracellular Ca2+ stores, thereby eliminating additional Ca2+ release with further caffeine stimulations. The drop in fluorescence after the second and third caffeine stimulations was caused by fluorescence quenching by caffeine (22Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Chen S.R.W. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results are similar to those observed with RyR2wt-transfected cells (Fig. 3, C andD). The somewhat greater fluorescence increase that was obtained for RyR2wt can be accounted for by the lower levels of expression routinely obtained for RyR2D4365-GFPrelative to RyR2wt rather than to an effect of the mutation on the receptor's intrinsic Ca2+ releasing activity. No Ca2+ release response to ryanodine and caffeine was detected in nontransfected HEK293 cells or in cells transfected with control (pCDNA3) vector DNA (data not shown). These results indicate that RyR2D4365-GFP functions as a Ca2+release channel, and this Ca2+ release is caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive. Next, we determined whether RyR2D4365-GFP retains high ryanodine binding affinity and whether binding of ryanodine is Ca2+-modulated by carrying out [3H]ryanodine binding assays on solubilized cell lysates. [3H]ryanodine binding has been widely used as a functional assay for RyR channel activity, since ryanodine binds only to the channel in its open state (23Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1740-1747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the binding of ryanodine to RyR is also dependent on Ca2+ concentration (29Pessah I.N. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 30Michalak M. Dupraz P. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, RyR2D4365-GFP shows high ryanodine binding affinity; the K d and B max values are 1.52 ± 0.11 nm (mean ± S.E., n= 3) and 0.28 ± 0.04 pmol/mg protein (n = 3), respectively, which are similar to the values for RyR2wtreported previously (31Li P. Chen S.R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Also as shown in Fig. 4 B, the EC50 values with respect to Ca2+ activation of RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP are 0.23 ± 0.05 μm (n = 4) and 0.25 ± 0.02 μm (n = 4), respectively. No ryanodine binding activity was detected in cell lysates that were transfected with either control (pCDNA3) vector DNA or no DNA. Thus, expressed RyR2D4365-GFP not only retains high binding affinity for ryanodine, but this binding is also dependent on Ca2+concentration, both of which are properties of wild type RyR2. We conclude that the insertion of GFP at Asp-4365 has not significantly altered the calcium release function of RyR2D4365-GFP. The expressed RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP were purified in a single step from detergent-solubilized HEK293 cell lysates by affinity chromatography using GST-FKBP12.6 as the affinity ligand (15Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M. Li P. Chen S.R.W. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows SDS-PAGE of the purified RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP. A high molecular weight band was present in gel lanes for each of the purified proteins, and their content of RyR-derived epitopes was confirmed by Western blotting using a RyR-specific antibody (Fig. 5 B). The protein band corresponding to RyR2D4365-GFP is also recognized by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 5 C), confirming that GFP was indeed present in expressed RyR2D4365-GFP. For three-dimensional reconstruction, purified RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP were preserved in a thin layer of vitreous ice, and images were recorded by cryo-EM. Fig.6 shows typical electron micrographs of frozen-hydrated RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP. Both micrographs show individual channels with apparently intact structure as assessed by comparison with previous work on RyRs isolated from natural sources (32Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 33Sharma M.R. Penczek P. Grassucci R. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18429-18434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows two-dimensional averages of RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP, computed using images of selected particles that were lying with their 4-fold symmetry axes oriented perpendicular to the carbon support film; these images were aligned by cross-correlation methods (34Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 54-125Crossref Google Scholar). By visual inspection, the averaged images of RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFPappear nearly identical to averages determined previously for native RyR2 (not shown; see Ref. 33Sharma M.R. Penczek P. Grassucci R. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18429-18434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) except for the presence of additional regions of diffuse density at high radius and along each of the lateral margins of receptors (+ in Fig. 7, A and B). This extra density is attributed to glutathione S-transferase (GST), which is fused to the FKBP12.6 that binds to RyR2 during the affinity purification. This interpretation is made by analogy to the essentially identical densities that were observed previously in a study of RyR1·GST-FKBP12 complexes (35Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The diffuseness of these densities probably arises because of substantial flexibility in the linkage between the GST and FKBP12.6. Subtraction of the two-dimensional average of RyR2wt (Fig.7 A) from that of RyR2D4365-GFP (Fig.7 B) provides a difference map that should resolve the position of the GFP insertion and perhaps also conformational differences between the two averaged projection structures (Fig.7 C). The brightest white areas shown in Fig. 7 C correspond to the most significant positive densities, and these represent protein mass present in the RyR2D4365-GFP but absent from RyR2wt. These regions (one of which is highlighted by acircle in Fig. 7, B and C) are located within the domains denoted by the numeral 3 (see three-dimensional structures shown in Figs. 8 and 9), also known as the “handle” domains (32Radermacher M.

Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.-B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A statistical analysis (Fig.7 D) of the difference between the two averaged images indicates that these regions show significant differences at a confidence level greater than 99.9% (36Wagenknecht T. Frank J. Boublik M. Nurse K. Ofengand J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These differences almost certainly correspond to the additional mass contributed by the GFP insertion in RyR2D4365-GFP. This interpretation is confirmed and more precisely mapped in the three-dimensional reconstructions as described below.Figure 9Three-dimensional difference map. The three-dimensional difference map shown in green (obtained by subtracting the three-dimensional volume of the RyR2wt from the RyR2D4365-GFP volume) is superimposed on the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2wt (inblue). The difference regions in green correspond to the GFP insertion in the DR1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Fig. 8, A and B, three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR2wt and RyR2D4365-GFP are displayed as surface representation in three principal orientations.

Glycopeptides from these digests were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 and by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. A study of the glycopeptides indicated that the average molecular weight of their carbohydrate portion was 2270. On this basis, there are 31 carbohydrate units per molecule of the α2-macroglobulin, with an average composition of 3 residues of mannose, 2 of galactose, 4.7 of N-acetylglucosamine, 1.5 of sialic acid, and 0.4 of fucose. Analysis of the glycopeptide fractions indicated considerable variation in size and composition of the individual carbohydrate units, with the smallest containing only 3 residues of mannose and 2 of glucosamine. The other units are larger and contain, in addition to these, 3 mannose and 2 glucosamine residues, variable amounts of sialic acid, fucose, and galactose, and additional glucosamine residues. Studies on the monosaccharide sequence indicated that these additional sugars are present in the form of oligosaccharide chains with the sequence sialic acid (or fucose) → galactose → N-acetylglucosamine. Variation in the carbohydrate units appeared to be primarily a function of the number and degree of completion of these oligosaccharide chains present in each carbohydrate unit. The largest carbohydrate unit present in the α2-macroglobulin would contain as many as four such chains attached to the mannose-glucosamine core. Information about the monosaccharide sequence was obtained from graded acid hydrolysis, treatment with neuraminidase, and the isolation of 4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, as well as a mannobiose. A study of the peptide portion of the glycopeptides indicated that the linkage of the carbohydrate units to the protein is of the glycosylamine type, with asparagine being the amino acid involved in most if not all of the 31 linkages of the α2-macroglobulin."

P35 is a 35-kDa protein that can suppress apoptosis induced by virus infection or by diverse stimuli in vertebrates or invertebrates. iaphomologues were identified in insects and mammals. Recently, we have identified sl-p49, a novel apoptosis suppressor gene and the first homologue of p35, in the genome of theSpodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus. Here we show that sl-p49 encodes a 49-kDa protein, confirmed its primary structure that displays 48.8% identity to P35, and performed computer-assisted modeling of P49 based on the structure of P35. We demonstrated that P49 is able to inhibit insect and human effector caspases, which requires P49 cleavage at Asp94. Finally we identified domains important for P49's antiapoptotic function that include a reactive site loop (RSL) protruding from a β-barrel domain. RSL begins at an amphipathic α1 helix, traverses the β-sheet central region, exposing Asp94 at the apex, and rejoins the β-barrel. Our model predicted seven α-helical motifs, three of them unique to P49. α-Helical motifs α1, α2, and α4′ were required for P49 function. The high structural homology between P49 and P35 suggests that these molecules bear a scaffold common to baculovirus “apoptotic suppressor” proteins.

This cell death program plays a critical role during normal development, tissue homeostasis, eliminating from the organism unwanted cells, including damaged and virus-infected cells. Thus, animal viruses have evolved ways to evade, delay, or suppress this important cell defense strategy (for a review, see Ref. 5Teodoro J.G. Branton P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Google Scholar).

Virol. 1994; 68: 7728-7737Google Scholar) by PCR using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTGTGTAATTTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTTAATTGTGTTTAATA-3′ and cloned into NdeI andXhoI sites of pET22b(+). Sequencing confirmed that thep35 clone was correct, and its 3′-end was fused with the His tag of pET. The recombinant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were collected and suspended in ice-cold 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl containing the protease inhibitors E-64 (100 μm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 μm), pepstatin A (1 μm), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After lysis and further clarification, the extracts were mixed with Ni2+-charged resin (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid; Qiagen) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl). Unbound material was washed with 20 mm imidazole-containing binding buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 250 mmimidazole-containing binding buffer and was >95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel analysis. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.B. mori caspase-1 active concentrations were determined by titration with DEVD-CHO as described before (25Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 313-319Google Scholar). sl-p49 was amplified from the plasmid pKS2 (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar) by PCR using the primers 5′-CCGGAATTCATGTGTGTACTGATACCAAC-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTATATCTATGTAAATGTTACG-3′ and subcloned in Bluescript (Stratagene). The obtained plasmid pBlue-49 was subsequently digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into pET22b(+), to provide it with a C-terminal His6 tag. The resultant plasmid was digested with Bpu1102I, and the cohesive end was treated with Klenow. The complete sl-p49-His open reading frame was rescued by subsequent digestion with EcoRI and subcloning intoEcoRI- and StuI-digested pFastBacI (Invitrogen) to get p49 FastBac-His and, after it, the corresponding BACmid bacp49H by following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). bacp49H DNA was transfected to SF9 cells to produce the recombinant baculovirus vAc49H. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of plasmids and viral constructs. 5 × 106 SF9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses (multiplicity of infection of 25) expressing either (a) P49 or (b) P49H were harvested at 48 h after infection in lysis buffer. After cell disruption by freezing and thawing, the clarified lysates were (a) subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (overexpressed P49 was identified by comparing the polypeptides synthesized in extracts from vAcP49- and wild type AcMNPV-infected cells) or (b) mixed with Ni2+-conjugated agarose beads (Qiagen) in binding buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Washing and elution were performed with 30 and 250 mm imidazole, respectively. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and to immunoblot analysis (26Chejanovsky N. Gershburg E. Virology. 1995; 209: 519-525Google Scholar, 27Gershburg E. Rivkin H. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7593-7599Google Scholar) using either anti-P49 (prepared by injection of P49 into rabbits using standard procedures) or mouse monoclonal anti-His antisera (Invitrogen). Computer-assisted modeling of P49 was based on the recently determined structure of P35 (19Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider Ch.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Google Scholar), exploiting the availability of the Swiss-Model and 3D-PSSM Web server Biomolecular Modeling Laboratory at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (28Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 501-522Google Scholar, 29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). The T7 promoter-containing plasmid pBlue-P49-stop was generated by exchanging the C-terminalBglII-SacI fragment of pBlue-P49 with the homologous fragment from pKS2 (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar). Coupled transcription-translation reactions were performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysates and [35S]Met-Cys label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as specified by the TNT manufacturer (Promega Corp.). Apoptotic extracts containing S. frugiperda protease (16Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. Lacount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Google Scholar) or activated caspases were incubated for 30 min with or without inhibitors and then mixed with 35S-labeled in vitro translated P49. Inhibitors utilized included protease inhibitor mixture (described above), and caspase-II group-specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO (10 μm). All reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose. After a 2-h incubation at 30 °C, the samples were terminated by boiling and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 15% acrylamide gel followed by fluorography. Mutations in P49 were generated in pBlue-P49-stop by using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction with complementary primers containing the desired mutation (30Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Google Scholar). The primers utilized were as follows (the mutation sites are underlined, and only one primer of the complementary pair is described for simplicity): C2A, 5′-AACGGCAAAATGGCTGTACTGATACCAACATTC-3′; D28A, 5′-TCGATGCGCGCTCTGATCTATGTG-3′; S55K, 5′-GCGCTAAATATTAAGGGACCCCTCGTGTGCG-3′; R63Q, 5′-CGTGAATAGGGTGTCCATGCACATTGTG-3′; V69K, 5′-CCATGCACATTAAGCACATGTACAGATCG-3′; I76K, 5′-CAGATCGCACAAAGATAGGGTCTTTGATA-3′; I76Y, 5′-ACAGATCGCACTACGATAGGGTC-3′; I76P, 5′-GTACAGATCGCACCCCGATAGGGTCTTTG-3′; F80K, 5′-CGATAGGGTCAAAGATAAATTCAACAAAT-3′; T91A, 5′-ACATATTCGGCGGCCGTGACCGATGGCG-3′; D94A, 5′-CGACCGTGACCGCTGGCGGTGGAGCCGAT-3′; S113A, 5′-TGTCTGCATGGCACGCGGAGATCTTTTAA-3′; L125P, 5′-AATTACAAAAATTGTCCGCTCAACGAAATG-3′; V136P, 5′-TACGACGACCCCGAAAAGTTTAGAAAATAC-3′; Y142A, 5′-GTTTAGAAAAGCCTGTCTCAAACCTTTAA-3′; D159A, 5′-GAGCGGCAGCGCCGTCGGTGTGG-3′; K178A, 5′-GTTGAAACCGGCACTGTTGAATAACAAAAA-3′; I198K, 5′-CGGTCAAGTGAAGGTGCCGCTTATGCAC-3′; I205K, 5′-CTTATGCACGAAAAAAACGAAAACGGAAGCG-3′; M218A, 5′-CGTACGAAGTGGCGGCGATGATCAA-3′; L237P, 5′-TGTGCTGGAACGACCGAAGCGTTCCATGG-3′; L376P, 5′-AGTCTTGGAGAACCGTATTCGTTTGTAAA-3′; and K387A, 5′-TTATCGATTGGGCAACACACGAGACCAAT-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. P49 sequencing was performed at The Protein Research Center (Israel Institute of Technology, Technion, Haifa, Israel). The stained protein band from the SDS-PAGE gel obtained from vAc49-infected Sf9 cell extracts (at 48 h postinfection) was cut with a clean razor blade, and the proteins were reduced with 10 mm DTT and modified with 100 mmiodoacetamide in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The gel piece was treated with 50% acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate to remove the stain from the proteins, dried, and rehydrated with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing about 0.1 g of trypsin/sample followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C, and the resulting peptides were recovered with 60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetate. The tryptic peptides were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography on a 1 × 150-mm Vydac C-18 column. The peptides were eluted using an 80-min linear gradient of 5–95% acetonitrile with 0.025% trifluoroacetate in water at flow rate of about 40 μl/min. The liquid from the column was electrosprayed into an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ; Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using repetitively full mass spectrometry scan followed by collision-induced dissociation of the most dominant ion selected from the first mass spectrometry scan. The mass spectrometry data were compared with simulated proteolysis and collision-induced dissociation of the proteins in the “nr” data base (NCBI) using Sequest software (J. Eng and J. Yates, University of Washington and Finnigan). To learn about the relationship between the structure of P49 structure and its possible function, we performed computer-assisted modeling of P49 based on the recently determined structure of the pancaspase inhibitor P35 (19Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider Ch.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This comparison predicted several domains important for P49-function. (I) P49 domains of high homology to P35 (both polypeptidic chains of 236 and 299 amino acids are depicted in Fig. 1 in blue andgreen, respectively) included the following: (a) the β-core, composed of a β-barrel domain with a large insertion, which forms the reactive site loop (Fig. 1, RSL). The RSL begins at the amphipathic α1-helix (between Val69 and Phe83, Figs. 1 and 7A) and traverses the β-sheet central region, exposing the Asp94residue at the apex, in the context of the putative caspase-cleavable motif 91TVTD94↓G (which corresponds to the P35 caspase-cleavable motif 84DMQD87↓G (19Fisher A.J. Cruz W. Zoog S.J. Schneider Ch.L. Friesen P.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2031-2039Google Scholar)) and follows downwards rejoining the β-barrel; (b) three additional α-helical domains, α2 (between residues Gly115 and Asn127), α3 (between residues Tyr133 and Pro146), and α4 (between residues Ile231 and Arg236) (Fig. 1); (c) a side loop (indicated asloop 3 and L3 in Fig. 1, Aand B, respectively) between amino acids Leu147and Lys167 larger than the correspondent P35 loop (between Lys140 and Asp147). (II) The C terminus of P49 (between Lys346 and Ile446), homologue to the C terminus of P35 (between Lys259 and Ile298), as predicted by secondary structure analysis, is shown in Fig. 1B (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar). (III) α-Helical regions predicted by secondary structure analysis that are not present in P35 (Fig. 1B) are designated α4′ (between residues Leu237 and Asn247), α5 (between residues Asn279 and His298), and α6(between residues Val364 and Ile383).Figure 7Location of mutated amino acid residues in the P49 structure (amino acids 1–236).

Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Google Scholar) and based on P35 coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1P35) (20Zoog S.J. Bertin J. Friesen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25995-26002Google Scholar). The specific mutations performed are indicated in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since P35 was shown as a potent inhibitor of invertebrate and vertebrate caspases, we proceeded to analyze the ability of P49 to inhibit caspase activity. To study P49 function, we engineeredsl-p49 under the control of the strong baculoviral promoter polyhedrin and isolated the correspondent baculovirus (vAcP49). We overexpressed sl-p49 protein in insect cells, identified it by protein-sequence analysis that confirmed the putative P49 sequence (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar), and used it to produce anti-P49 antiserum (see “Experimental Procedures”). The antiserum was able to detect P49 synthesis in vAcP49-infected SF9 cells (Fig. 2,right panel, lane vAcP49). To purify P49, we engineered it with a C-terminal His tag and expressed it using the correspondent recombinant baculovirus vAcP49H (see “Experimental Procedures”). First, we confirmed that the recombinant gene sl-p49H indeed expressed a functional protein (P49H) by using a marker rescue assay in which SF9 cells were co-transfected with vAcΔP35/pol+ and a plasmid bearing sl-p49H under the control of the sl-p49 promoter (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar). Recovery of the polyhedra-positive virus phenotype due to suppression of apoptosis was indicative of a functionalsl-p49 gene (Table I) (21Du Q. Lehavi D. Faktor O. Qi Y. Chejanovsky N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1278-1285Google Scholar). P49H was isolated from extracts of vAcP49H-infected SF9 cells (Fig. 2) by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-conjugated agarose beads. The identity of the isolated protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-P49 antiserum (Fig. 2, right panel, lanes marked P49H; the full-size P49 molecules are indicated by the arrow) and by reacting the vAcP49H-infected cell extract and purified protein with anti-His tag antiserum (Fig. 2, left panel, lanes vAcP49H and P49H, respectively). A smaller polypeptide was detected by the anti-P49 antiserum, but its nature is still under investigation, since it does not bind to the Ni2+ column. Also, a higher nonspecific band (over 65 kDa) that reacted with mock-infected and baculovirus-infected extracts was observed consistently (Fig. 2, right panel).Table IEffect of site-directed mutations on P49 antiapoptotic functionMutationP49 predicted domain affectedApoptosis suppressionaThe antiapoptotic function of the P49 mutants was determined by measuring their ability to recover the replication of AcΔp35/pol+ after co-transfection with the latter DNA to SF9 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab To determine whether P49 is able to inhibit lepidopteran effector caspases, we isolated and expressed caspase-1 of the silkworm B. mori (Fig. 3A), which is homologue to S. frugiperda caspase-1 (Fig. 3B), the main lepidopteran caspase responsible for executing the apoptosis program (14Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Almemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1421-1424Google Scholar, 16Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. Lacount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Google Scholar) (see below). Incubation of B. moricaspase-1 with increasing amounts of affinity chromatography-purified P49-His6 resulted in complete inhibition of caspase activity as monitored by the ability of the caspase to cleave the specific substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide (Fig. 4A). Our P49 model predicted that amino acid residues at positions P1–P4 in the putative caspase recognition motif 91TVTD94could be essential for caspase inhibition by P49. Thus, we mutated Asp94 and Thr91 residues and analyzed the ability of the mutants to inhibit caspase activity. Indeed, the mutant D94A was unable to inhibit B. mori caspase-1, and the mutation T91A affected significantly the ability of P49 to inhibit the caspase (Fig. 4A).Figure 4Inhibition of insect and human effector caspases by P49. Increasing amounts of P49H were incubated withB. mori caspase-1 (purified by affinity chromatography; see “Experimental Procedures”) (A) or with human caspase 3 (Cpp32; Biomol, Inc.) (B). After 30 min, residual caspase activity was determined colorimetrically at 405 nm using the specific peptidic substrate Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate if P49 is able to inhibit a human effector caspase, we performed the same assay using human caspase-3. As can be seen, P49 inhibited the human caspase-3, CPP32, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). The apparent discrepancy in P49's preference for human caspase-3 over B. mori caspase-1 (15 pmol and more than 100 pmol were required to completely inhibit the former and the latter, respectively) was due to different amounts of caspase utilized in each assay (0.3 and 25 pmol for human caspase-3 andB. mori caspase-1, respectively). Caspase-inhibition by P35 requires cleavage of the tetrapeptide motif 84DMQD87. Thus we expected that caspase inhibition by P49 would require cleavage of Asp94 in the 91TVTD94 motif, positioned at the apex of RSL in our model. To test this hypothesis, we incubated in vitro translated 35S-labeled P49 with affinity-purified B. mori caspase-1. As can be"

The theoretical number of hydrogen ions displaced from each mole of bound ligand at several pH values was calculated considering all the possible interactions between Cu(II) and histidine involving (a) amino and carboxyl, (b) amino and imidazole, (c) imidazole and carboxyl, and (d) amino, imidazole, and carboxyl groups. When determined experimentally by discontinuous titration, the number of hydrogen ions coincided with the number consistent with the amino and carboxyl binding and strongly suggested that the imidazole moiety is not involved. Similar studies with Cu(II)-histamine, Cu(II)-alanine, and Cu(II)-imidazole confirmed the accepted views regarding their metal binding sites. No resemblance could be seen in the ultraviolet spectra between Cu(II)-histidine and Cu(II)-imidazole. Samples of Cu(II)-histidine, Cu(II)-histamine, and Cu(II)-alanine showed absorption maxima between 235 and 242 mµ which strongly suggested that the λmax of Cu(II)-histidine in the ultraviolet region is most likely due to Cu(II) binding to amino and not to imidazole. Infrared spectrum of Cu(II)-histidine in D2O solution exhibited a strong shift in the antisymmetric carboxyl stretching frequency which is consistent with the coordination of the carboxyl group."

https://openalex.org/W2115185621,"Abstract Following the administration of 8-azaguanine to rats, a portion of the polyribosomes in regenerating liver are converted to monomers and dimers, with a concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis. Polyribosome breakdown induced by suboptimal doses of the base analogue and the incorporation of 8-azaguanine-14C into RNA are enhanced by pretreating the rats with low doses of 4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide. The dimers are labile, and break down to monomers after a short incubation at 37°. The monomer and dimer pool appears to be nonfunctional in vivo; only the residual polyribosomes are pulse labeled with l-leucine-14C. The latter finding suggests that the former species did not originate from breakdown of the latter species during isolation. The residual polyribosomes incorporated l-leucine-14C in vivo at rates comparable to those of polyribosomes in controls. The data are consistent with the incorporation of 8-azaguanine into certain species of RNA, probably messenger RNA, which are essential to the integrity of the polyribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1549520758,"Abstract 4-Hydroxy-2-ketoglutarate aldolase of rat liver has been purified to near homogeneity. Binding studies, in which glyoxylate or pyruvate is covalently linked to the enzyme by reduction with sodium borohydride, suggest that 1 or 2 moles of each substrate are bound per mole of enzyme inactivated. With the use of minimum effective borohydride, enzyme inactivation requires lower concentrations of pyruvate than of glyoxylate. Pyruvate and glyoxylate appear to exclude each other in direct measurements of binding. In kinetic studies, high ratios of glyoxylate to pyruvate are inhibitory to the condensation reaction and there is a less clear suggestion of pyruvate inhibition competitive with glyoxylate. All of these findings suggest that glyoxylate and pyruvate may be bound by the same lysine residue or residues. There is also nonspecific inhibition by monovalent salts of the condensation reaction, but not of the cleavage reaction. Both glyoxylate and pyruvate tend to reduce the magnitude of inhibition by salt."

Functional analyses revealed that substitution of Ser for Arg-443 (but not substitution of Thr for Ser-331, Leu for Met-370, or Leu for Met-415) virtually abolished basal activity and totally abrogated the activation of the enzyme by l-leucine (1–10 mm) in the absence of other effectors.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F493-F497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nervous system, GDH is enriched in glial cells associated with glutamatergic nerve terminals and thought to be involved in the metabolism of neurotransmitter glutamate (8Zaganas I.

Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 1134-1146Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that GDH activity is regulated in vivo (1Smith E.L. Austin B.M. Blumenthal K.M. Nyc J.F. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 293-367Google Scholar, 6Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J.

Soc. 1979; 123: 73-84Google Scholar, 12Shashidharan P. Clarke D.D. Ahmed N. Moschonas N. Plaitakis A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In pancreatic beta cells, which express the GLUD1-derived GDH, enzyme activity is under tonic inhibition by GTP (6Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Allosteric activators such as ADP andl-leucine can counteract this inhibition leading to an enhanced flux of glutamate through this pathway. This in turn is shown to boost the cellular energy charge (ATP levels) with resultant insulin release (4Sener A. Malaise W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by recent findings, which show that mutations rendering the enzyme resistant to GTP are associated with enhanced insulin release (hyperinsulinism) in children (6Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Human GDH exists in housekeeping and in nerve tissue-specific isoforms encoded by the GLUD1 and GLUD2 genes, respectively (13Mavrothalassitis G. Tzimagiorgis G. Mitsialis A. Zannis V.I. Plaitakis A. Papamatheakis J. Moschonas N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3494-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Shashidharan P. Michaelides T.M. Robakis N.K. Kretsovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although GTP potently inactivates the housekeeping GDH, the brain-specific isoform is resistant to this compound (15Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This may represent an adaptation that permits the enzyme to function in the GTP-rich environment that prevails in the nerve tissue (16Plaitakis A. Zaganas I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Instead of being inhibited by GTP, the brain-specific GDH has evolved to remain largely inactive at its basal state and to be regulated via activation by ADP and l-leucine (12Shashidharan P. Clarke D.D. Ahmed N. Moschonas N. Plaitakis A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These properties may allow the nerve tissue-specific GDH to remain dormant under resting conditions and to be called into action when low energy charge (high ADP levels), associated with intense glutamatergic transmission, prevails. Under these conditions, GDH function may prove essential for enhancing glutamate detoxification and for restoring cellular energy stores (12Shashidharan P. Clarke D.D. Ahmed N. Moschonas N. Plaitakis A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1804-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Plaitakis A. Zaganas I. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). At present, the molecular basis for this adaptation has not been fully understood. Because the functional differences between the housekeeping and the nerve tissue-specific GDH arise from amino acid residues not common between the two isoenzymes, we have sought to identify these critical residues by mutagenizing the GLUD1 gene at sites that differ from the corresponding sites of the GLUD2 gene. Initial studies that explored three such amino acid residues, located in the C-terminal region of this protein (a section of which forms part of the regulatory domain of GDH), revealed that substitution of Ala for Gly-456 rendered the enzyme resistant to GTP inhibition without affecting its base-line activity or its activation by ADP (17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we sought to study further structure-function relationships in this enzyme by performing site-directed mutagenesis on theGLUD1 gene at four amino acid residues (Fig. 1) located just upstream from the C-terminal region we studied previously (17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In each of these sites the amino acid residue present in the GLUD2GDH replaced the corresponding amino acid of the GLUD1enzyme. The mutated cDNAs were expressed in Sf21 cells, and the obtained mutant GDH isoproteins were purified and studied with respect to their kinetic and regulatory characteristics. Results showed that substitution of Ser for Arg at position 443 of theGLUD1 GDH virtually abolished basal enzyme activity (determined in the absence of allosteric activators) and markedly altered the activation of this GDH isoform by ADP andl-leucine. These data provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying enzyme function and the evolutionary processes that resulted in human GDH multiplicity. Sf21 cells and the baculovirus expression vectors were obtained from Invitrogen. The media for the Sf21 insect cells and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies. Modified baculovirus (BaculoGold) was obtained from BD Pharmingen. NADPH, ADP, and GTP (lithium salt) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals . l-Leucine was from AmershamBiosciences. Phenyl-Sepharose High Performance was from AmershamBiosciences, and Hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HT was from Bio-Rad. AGLUD1 cDNA, cloned in pBSKII+ vector, was mutagenized at specific sites (Fig. 1) using the GeneEditor Mutagenesis system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenic oligonucleotides (25–30 bp in length) were phosphorylated and annealed to the GLUD1template by heating the reaction mixture at 75 °C and then slowly cooling it (1.5 °C/min) to 37 °C. The annealing reaction also contained primers (provided by the manufacturer) designed to mutate the beta lactamase gene of the pBSKII+ vector. The plasmid was then amplified by T4 DNA polymerase (nicks were ligated by T4 DNA ligase) and used to transform the BMH 71-18 mutS strain of Escherichia coli (to prevent repair of the newly synthesized strand by the microorganism). The cells were grown in the presence of an appropriate antibiotic selection mix; plasmid DNA was isolated and used to transform the JM109 strain of E. coli. Clones containing plasmids with the desired mutations were selected by restriction digestion analysis and by DNA sequencing. The mutated GLUD1 cDNA was cleaved from the pBSKII+ vector using BamHI andPstI restriction endonucleases and ligated to the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. The ligation products were used to transform the JM109 strain of E. coli. The proper orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing. The subcloned mutated GLUD1 gene was bidirectionally sequenced in its entire length in order to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and exclude incidental DNA alterations induced during the above mutagenesis steps. DNA sequencing was carried out using the LI-COR 4200 system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Mutated GLUD1cDNAs, along with the wild-type GLUD1 cDNA (used here as a control for protein expression and enzymatic analysis), were expressed in Sf21 cells using the baculovirus expression system described previously (14Shashidharan P. Michaelides T.M. Robakis N.K. Kretsovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells of the insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) were co-transfected with the plasmid DNA (pVL1393 vector containing the GLUD1 insert) and modified baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, BD Pharmingen), and incubated at 27 °C for 4–5 days. The virus was amplified by two to three rounds of infection. The cultured cells were harvested 5 days post-infection and used for extracting the recombinant GDH proteins. For this purpose, the cultured cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 m NaCl. The resulting whole homogenate was centrifuged at 7000 × g(4 °C) for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for studies employing crude extracts. Protein determination was done using the Lowry method (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Far A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GDH was purified from Sf21 cell extracts essentially as described previously (17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Hussain M.M. Zannis V. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cultured cells were subjected to two to three cycles of freeze-thawing and homogenized (5–10% w/v) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.1mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A 30–55% ammonium sulfate cut, obtained from these extracts, was re-suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, buffer containing 15% ammonium sulfate, loaded on a hydrophobic interaction column packed with phenyl-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences), and equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a double gradient of decreasing concentration of ammonium sulfate (15–0%) and increasing concentration of ethylene glycol (0–90%). Eluted GDH was precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate and passed again through the same phenyl-Sepharose column. Fractions containing GDH activity were dialyzed (at 4 °C) against several changes of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.15, buffer containing 200 mm KCl and loaded into the hydroxyapatite column (20Colon A. Plaitakis A. Perakis A. Clarke D.D. J. Neurochem. 1986; 46: 1811-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The column was eluted with a gradient of 10–400 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Purified GDH was used for enzyme assays and for studying its electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE. The latter was done using the Laemmli procedure (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically (at 340 nm) in the direction of reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate (15Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture of 1 ml contained 50 mmtriethanolamine (TRA) pH 8.0, buffer (except as indicated), 100 mm ammonium acetate, 100 μm NADPH, 2.6 mm EDTA, and 0.05–0.2 mg of crude extract protein or 0.3–0.5 μg of purified GDH, unless specified otherwise. Enzyme reaction was initiated by adding α-ketoglutarate to 8 mm(except as indicated). Initial rates (enzyme velocity during the first 30 s after initiation of the reaction) were recorded. Wild-type and mutant GLUD1 proteins were studied in parallel. To test the effect of pH and composition of the reaction buffer on the recombinant enzymes, assays were also performed using either 50 mm TRA or 50 mm phosphate. The pH of the reaction buffer was varied between 6.5 and 8.5. In all of these assays, the reaction mixture of 1 ml also contained 100 mm ammonium acetate, 2.6 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADPH, and 8 mm α-ketoglutarate (final concentrations). Kinetic analyses were performed to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) for α-ketoglutarate. Several sets of experiments were performed for each purified enzyme. In each of these experiments, α-ketoglutarate varied from 0.4 to 8.0 mm, whereas ADP concentration was kept constant at 1 mm. Regulation of the human recombinant GDHs by ADP and/orl-leucine was studied essentially as described previously (15Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) by adding this compound to the reaction mixture at various concentrations (ADP = 0.025–1.0 mm,l-leucine = 0.3–10 mm, final concentrations) while keeping the other substrates constant.l-Leucine (0.3–6.0 mm) was added to the reaction mixture that contained ADP at various concentrations (0.025–1.0 mm). In addition, GTP inhibition was studied in the presence of 1 mm ADP (final concentration) as described previously (15Plaitakis A. Metaxari M. Shashidharan P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1862-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). All statistical analyses on the obtained data and plotting were performed using the Origin Program (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA). K m andV max values were calculated by application of the weighted hyperbolic fit method in the Hyper program (Dr. J. S. Easterby, Department of Biochemistry, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK). Differences in specific activities and in kinetic and allosteric properties were evaluated using Student's ttest. IC50 and SC50 values were determined graphically. The Hill plot coefficients for GTP inhibition were calculated according to the method discussed by Cornish-Bowden (22Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Butterworth, London1979: 147-176Crossref Google Scholar). Results were confirmed by the use of the Leonora program (23Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 133-189Google Scholar). Studies of the structural models of bovine GDH were performed with the use of the RasMol (version 2.7.1.1, www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/rasmol), the Swiss-PDBviewer (version 3.7.b2, www.expasy.ch/spdbv), and the RIBBONS programs (24Carlson M. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 277: 493-505Crossref Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Expression of the wild-type GLUD1 gene and the four mutants in Sf21 cells produced recombinant GDH proteins capable of catalyzing the reversible interconversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate in the presence of 1 mm ADP. As described previously (14Shashidharan P. Michaelides T.M. Robakis N.K. Kretsovali A. Papamatheakis J. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16971-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the host insect cells (Sf21) used here to express human GDH contain endogenous GDH that shows an absolute specificity for NADH. Because nontransfected insect cells showed zero GDH activity when NADP(H) was used as a co-factor, all enzyme assays of Sf21 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were done in the presence of NADP(H). This permitted the study of the recombinant human enzymes without the interference of the endogenous insect GDH. Enzymatic assays carried out in crude tissue extracts showed that the S331T, M370L, and M415L mutants exhibited a basal catalytic activity similar to that of the wild-type GLUD1 GDH (data not shown). Additional functional analyses revealed that the S331T, M370L, and M415L mutants exhibited an allosteric regulation pattern by ADP and GTP that was comparable with that of the wild-type GLUD1-derived GDH (TableI). In contrast, the R443S mutant was essentially inactive under base-line conditions and required much higher levels of ADP for its activation (SC50 = 405.6 ± 14.8 μm) than the wild-type (SC50 = 27.4 ± 2.2 μm; p < 0.001) GDH (Table I). On the other hand, the GTP inhibition pattern of the R443S mutant was similar to that of the wild-type GDH (Table I).Table IAllosteric regulation of mutant and wild-type GLUD1-derived GDHs by ADP and GTP in crude extractsGLUD1R443SM415LM370LS331TActivator SC50 (μmADP)27.4 ± 2.2405.6 ± 14.8aSC50 value for the R443S mutant is significantly different (p < 0.001) as compared with that of the wild type GLUD1-derived GDH, the M415L mutant, the M370L mutant, and the S331T mutant.28.1 ± 2.121.0 ± 3.034.6 ± 2.5Inhibitor IC50 (μmGTP)12.2 ± 0.516.2 ± 1.114.7 ± 0.811.3 ± 1.110.8 ± 1.0Hill coefficient (GTP Inhibition)2.5 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.2SC50 values (± S.E.) for ADP activation were determined graphically from the activation curve for each recombinant enzyme based on at least six experimental determinations.

The R443S mutant and the wild-type recombinant GLUD1-derived human GDH were studied further after they were purified from cell extracts. As an additional control, we used the endogenous human enzyme purified from human liver as previously described (17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). About 40–50% of the GDH activity present in the crude tissue extracts was recovered in the purified fractions as previously described (17Zaganas I. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26422-26428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Hussain M.M. Zannis V. Plaitakis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of GDH-positive fractions eluted from the hydroxyapatite column revealed that the enzyme was more than 95% pure (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2, the molecular mass of the R443S mutant was identical to that of the recombinant wild-type GLUD1-derived GDH. Functional analyses of the purified enzymes confirmed that the R443S mutation rendered the enzyme virtually inactive in the absence of allosteric effectors (basal state). In enzyme assays performed here in the presence of 0.3–0.5 μg of purified mutant enzyme/1.0 ml of TRA, pH 8.0, buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), no measurable basal activity was detected. Increasing the mutant enzyme up to 5 μg of purified protein/1 ml of reaction mixture yielded a basal activity (4.1 ± 0.4 μmol mg−1 min−1) that was about 7% that of the wild-type GDH (54.0 ± 4.3 μmol mg−1min−1) (Table II).Table IIEffect of buffer composition and pH on basal and ADP-stimulated enzyme activities of purified recombinant R443S mutant and wild-type GLUD1-derived GDHTRA, pH 8.0TRA, pH 7.5TRA, pH 7.0Phosphate, pH 8.0Phosphate, pH 7.5Phosphate, pH 7.0GLUD1R443SGLUD1R443SGLUD1R443SGLUD1R443SGLUD1R443SGLUD1R443SBasal S.A.54.0 ± 4.3 (6)4.1 ± 0.4 (7)ap < 0.01.54.5 ± 1.7 (5)7.1 ± 0.3 (4)ap < 0.01.(a)48.4 ± 1.2 (5)bp < 0.05.8.9 ± 1.5 (4)ap < 0.01.(a)32.6 ± 0.8 (5)3.8 ± 0.9 (4)ap < 0.01.42.0 ± 1.1 (7)8.1 ± 0.2 (3)ap < 0.01.(a)44.0 ± 2.0 (7)(ap < 0.01.)10.4 ± 0.1 (3)ap < 0.01.(a)Activator SC50 (μm ADP)31.7 ± 4.2 (10)383.9 ± 14.6 (12)ap < 0.01.26.1 ± 4.1 (8)216.6 ± 19.8 (6)ap < 0.01.26.4 ± 4.1 (8)167.2 ± 10.6 (6)ap < 0.01.70.3 ± 7.7 (8)219.8 ± 9.7 (5)ap < 0.01.49.6 ± 6.7 (6)100.9 ± 6.1 (6)ap < 0.01.66.6 ± 10.7 (6)174.1 ± 15.8 (8)ap < 0.01.Basal specific activities (S.A.) were determined in the absence of allosteric effectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TRA (50 mm) or phosphate (50 mm) of different pH values was used as reaction buffer.

The addition of ADP to 1 mm (final concentrations) resulted in full activation of the R443S mutant with the maximal specific activity of this mutant approaching that of the wild-type GDH (Fig. 3). This activation was observed even when no measurable basal activity was detectable (in assays involving 0.3–0.5 μg of purified mutant enzyme). However, study of the ADP stimulatory curves (performed in TRA buffer, pH 8.0) revealed that the mutant enzyme was much less sensitive to ADP than the wild-type GDH (Fig. 3). At 0.1 mm ADP (concentration capable of inducing a near maximal activation of the wild-type GDH), the specific activity of the mutant remained about 13% that of the wild-type GDH (Fig. 3). The SC50 values for the R443S mutant determined in TRA, pH 8.0 buffer were about 10-fold higher than those of the wild-type expressed GDH (Table II) or the endogenous human liver enzyme (data not shown). The addition of l-leucine to the reaction mixture (1–10 mm final concentrations) failed to activate the R443S mutant (Fig. 4). Althoughl-leucine when used alone was totally ineffective in stimulating the activity of the Arg-443 mutant, the presence of low concentrations of ADP (25–100 μm) rendered the mutant enzyme amenable to activation by l-leucine. As shown in Fig. 4, l-leucine induced in the presence of ADP a concentration-dependent activation of the R443S mutant, which was proportionally greater than that of the wild-type GDH. Under these conditions, l-leucine was capable of maximally activating the mutant enzyme (enhancement of the mutant enzyme activity by >2000%). The basal activities of the R443S mutant remained markedly decreased when assayed at different pH values in either TRA or phosphate buffer.

Preparations of prothrombin with activities of 2,000 to 2,400 National Institutes of Health units per mg of protein were obtained, corresponding to a 1,500- to 1,900-fold purification from rat plasma. The purified prothrombin was homogeneous when analyzed by ultracentrifugation. On acrylamide gel disc electrophoresis, a major band with two minor bands was observed. By enzymatic assays, it was devoid of contaminating fibrinogen, thrombin, and Factor X. It was not activated to thrombin by 25% sodium citrate. Rat prothrombin has an s20,w of 5.0 S, a diffusion coefficient of 4.93 x 10-7 cm2 per sec, and a molecular weight of 86,000 ± 1,000 by several methods. Amino acid analysis of rat prothrombin revealed a profile of the usual amino acids with a high percentage of glutamic and aspartic acids and a low content of S-amino acids. Our preparation contained 3.7% total hexose and 0.1% total hexosamine. An antibody against rat prothrombin (anti-rat prothrombin) was prepared in rabbits. On double diffusion, the antibody gave a single precipitin band against rat plasma as well as against rat prothrombin. Anti-rat prothrombin effectively precipitated prothrombin from rat plasma. It did not cross-react with prothrombins from human, bovine, or avian species."
https://openalex.org/W1998807178,"Celiac Sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is an inheritable human disease of the small intestine that is triggered by the dietary intake of gluten. Recently, several Pro- and Gln-rich peptide sequences (most notably PQPQLPY and analogs) have been identified from gluten with potent immunogenic activity toward CD4+ T cells from small intestinal biopsies of Celiac Sprue patients. These peptides have three unusual properties. First, they are relatively stable toward further proteolysis by gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal enzymes. Second, they are recognized and deamidated by human tissue transglutaminase (tTGase) with high selectivity. Third, tTGase-catalyzed deamidation enhances their affinity for HLA-DQ2, the disease-specific class II major histocompatibility complex heterodimer. In an attempt to seek a mechanistic explanation for these properties, we undertook secondary structural studies on PQPQLPY and its analogs. Circular dichroism studies on a series of monomeric and dimeric analogs revealed a strong polyproline II helical propensity in a subset of them. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis confirmed a polyproline II conformation of PQPQLPY, and was also used to elucidate the secondary structure of the most helical variant, (d-P)QPQLPY. Remarkably, a strong correlation was observed between polyproline II content of naturally occurring gluten peptides and the specificity of human tTGase toward these substrates. Analogs with up to two d-amino acid residues retained both polyproline II helical content and transglutaminase affinity. Since the Michaelis constant (K m) is the principal determinant of tTGase specificity for naturally occurring gluten peptides and their analogs, our results suggest that the tTGase binding site may have a preference for polyproline II helical substrates. If so, these insights could be exploited for the design of selective small molecule inhibitors of this pharmacologically important enzyme.

If so, these insights could be exploited for the design of selective small molecule inhibitors of this pharmacologically important enzyme. Celiac Sprue (a.k.a. celiac disease, coeliac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is a widely prevalent immune disorder of the small intestine that is triggered by the dietary intake of gluten from sources such as wheat, rye, and barley (2Sollid L.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 53-81Google Scholar). Like many autoimmune diseases, this inheritable disease is strongly linked to a particular allele of the class II major histocompatibility complex HLA-DQ2 (3Sollid L.M. Markussen G.E.J. Gierde H. Vartdal F. Thorsby E. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 345-350Google Scholar). Within the past few years several studies have succeeded in mapping epitopes in gluten that specifically stimulate CD4+ T cells from Celiac Sprue patients (but not control subjects) in an HLA-DQ2-dependent manner. Most of these epitopes are Pro- and Gln-rich peptides. A particular sequence, PQPQLPY, is found in gluten peptides that potently stimulate T cells from nearly all patients and is therefore considered “immunodominant” (4Anderson R.P. Degano P. Godkin A.J. Jewell D.P. Hill A.V.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 337-342Google Scholar, 5Arentz-Hansen H. Korner R. Molberg O. Quarsten H. Vader W. Kooy Y.M.C. Lundin K.E.A. Koning F. Roepstorff P. Sollid L. McAdam S.N.

First, they are relatively stable toward further proteolysis by gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal enzymes (6Hausch F. Shan L. Santiago N.A. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Am. J.

Therefore, understanding the structural features that underlie these properties could provide new insights into the pathogenicity of Celiac Sprue. We therefore undertook the task of characterizing PQPQLPY and selected analogs using a combination of circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Earlier secondary structure studies on peptides from wheat gluten have suggested the predominant existence of β-turn content (10Tatham A.S. Marsh M.N. Wieser H. Shewry P.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 313-318Google Scholar, 11Alfonso P. Soto C. Albar J.P. Camafeita E. Escobar H. Suarez L. Rico M. Bruix M. Mendez E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 36-40Google Scholar), although some polyproline II character has also been observed in longer (recombinant) polypeptides (12Gilbert S.M. Wellner N. Belton P.S. Greenfield J.A. Siligardi G. Shewry P.R. Tatham A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; : 135-146Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that immunogenic gliadin 2Gluten is a complex mixture of storage proteins found in a variety of food grains. These proteins can be fractionated into an alcohol-insoluble fraction and an alcohol-soluble fraction. The latter fraction from wheat, rye, and barley is especially toxic to Celiac Sprue patients and includes a family of closely related proteins called gliadins (in wheat), secalins (in rye), and hordeins (in barley). For more information on the chemistry of cereal proteins, see Ref. 1Wieser H. Acta Paedriatr. Suppl. 1996; 412: 3-9Google Scholar.2Gluten is a complex mixture of storage proteins found in a variety of food grains.

Moreover, the PPII content of these peptide correlates well with the specificity of human tTGase toward them. We also show that incorporation of d-amino acid residues can increase their PPII character as well as the specificity of tTGase toward them. The polyproline peptide used as a reference was purchased from Sigma (poly-l-proline,M r 1,000–10,000) and purified via preparative HPLC. Other peptides, synthesized at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, were purified via preparative HPLC and verified to be >90% pure by analytical HPLC and mass spectrometry. The following gradient was used on a Econosphere C18 reverse phase column for all HPLC experiments: 0–25% of buffer B (acetonitrile:H2O 80:20:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 5 min, 25–40% of buffer B over 40 min, 40–100% of buffer B over 1 min, 100% of buffer B for 8 min, 100–0% of buffer B over 1 min, and 0% of buffer B for 7 min. In each instance, the remainder of the percentage was made up of a solution A (H2O:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Monomer 1, monomer 2, and monomer 3 correspond tod-modified analogs of the monomer PQPQLPY. Monomer 1 has one d-amino acid (d-proline 1, pQPQLPY), monomer 2 has two d-amino acids (d-proline 1 and d-glutamine 2, pqPQLPY), monomer 3 has threed-amino acids (d-proline 1,d-glutamine 2, and d-proline 3 pqpQLPY). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on an AVIV spectropolarimeter, model 60DS installed with a standard analysis program. The temperature was controlled using a recirculating water bath setting to 5 °C. Spectra were recorded with a quartz cell of 0.2-cm path length, using an acquisition time of 2 s/nm, with a 1-nm spectral bandwidth, over the wavelength range from 190 to 260 nm. The samples were prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptide previously quantified with a 1 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm sodium borate, 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 15 mm NaCl with the pH adjusted at 7.0 (13Marqusee S. Baldwin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 84: 8898-8902Google Scholar). A number of standard buffers used for CD analysis of peptides were evaluated (13Marqusee S. Baldwin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 84: 8898-8902Google Scholar,14Kelly M.A. Chellgren B.W. Rucker A.L. Troutman J.M. Fried M.G. Miller A.F. Creamer T.P.

Chem. 1996; 61: 6775-6782Google Scholar); the citrate buffer was found to give the best resolution. Data are represented in molar ellipticities ([θ]max, degree·cm2·dmol−1). The CD spectra represent an average of two accumulations at least and were corrected by subtracting the buffer base line and then usually fitted to a fourth-order polynomial curve, without additional filtering or smoothing. To quantify the amount of PPII character in each peptide, it was necessary to define the CD spectra for both 100 and 0% PPII helical content. The former presumably corresponds to a rigid PPII structure, whereas the latter refers to a completely disordered state. To estimate the maximum helical content (100%) of each peptide, we used the method of Creamer and co-workers (14Kelly M.A. Chellgren B.W. Rucker A.L. Troutman J.M. Fried M.G. Miller A.F. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14376-14383Google Scholar), where [θ]max at 227 nm measured in the presence of high guanidine concentrations was used as the upper bound for PPII helical content [θ]Gnd. To define 0% PPII helical content, [θ]min was measured at 227 nm in the presence of high concentrations of CaCl2([θ]Ca). From these parameters the PPII content could be estimated as follows.%PPII=[θ]max+‖[θ]Ca‖[θ]Gnd+‖[θ]Ca‖×100(Eq. 1) Lyophilized peptides for NMR measurements were rehydrated in solution A or B: solution A, Me2SO-d6 containing trimethylsilane as an internal chemical shift reference; solution B, a 20 mm filtered sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) with 10% of D2O. Acidic conditions were used to decrease the exchange rates of surface amide protons that are freely accessible to the solvent. Alternatively, NMR spectra were acquired in D2O (solution C). Final peptide concentrations of 10 mm were attained. Me2SO-d6 and deuterium oxide (D2O) were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. The sample is stable up to 2 months, as monitored by the one-dimensional1H spectra. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Gemini 500 MHz spectrometer with triple resonance and three axis gradient capabilities. For most experiments a mixing time was applied, and the temperature was controlled at 25 °C. Natural abundance two-dimensional experiments that were performed included: 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC),1H-13C HSQC, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY). The water signal was suppressed by presaturation. Data collection and processing were performed on Silicon Graphics workstations using VNMR programs. Coupling constants (3 J HNα) were extracted from the one-dimensional spectrum. The NOE cross-peak intensities (mixed time, 25 °C) were determined using the SPARKY software. The ideal PPII conformation model was built using the molecular modeling program SYBYL (Tripos Associates, St Louis, MO). The coupling constant (3 J HNα) is related to the dihedral angle φ as expressed by the relationship (15Padi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Google Scholar):3 J HNα = 6.7cos2φ − 1.3cosφ + 1.5. The coupling constants were converted into φ values, which were introduced as a dihedral constraints, with ψ values of 146. Expression, purification, and kinetic analysis of tTGase were performed as described previously (7Piper J.L. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 386-393Google Scholar). Glutamate dehydrogenase was purchased from Biozyme (San Diego, CA) and benzyloxycarbonyl-glutamylglycine (Z-Gln-Gly) from Sigma. As a standard for polyproline II left-handed helical peptides, we measured the spectrum of a poly-l-proline at 5 °C, in a 1 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm sodium borate, 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 15 mm NaCl with the pH adjusted at 7.0 (13Marqusee S. Baldwin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 84: 8898-8902Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.1, this spectrum reproduced well the characteristic features of a stable polyproline II helix in polar environments: a strong negative band around 210 nm (π-π* transition) and a weak positive band around 229 nm (n-π* transition) (16Ronish E.W. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 1635-1651Google Scholar, 17Rabanal F. Ludevid M.D. Pons M. Giralt E. Biopolymers. 1993; 313: 1019-1028Google Scholar, 18Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 281-292Google Scholar). Initial studies were performed on PQPQLPYPQPQLPY, an immunodominant peptide from α-2 gliadin (5Arentz-Hansen H. Korner R. Molberg O. Quarsten H. Vader W. Kooy Y.M.C. Lundin K.E.A. Koning F. Roepstorff P. Sollid L. McAdam S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 603-612Google Scholar). This peptide is selectively deamidated by tTGase at Gln4 and Gln11 (7Piper J.L. Gray G.M. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 386-393Google Scholar). The CD spectra of PQPQLPYPQPQLPY and its mono-deamidated analog PQPELPYPQPQLPY displayed both characteristics of a polyproline II helix (Fig. 1). The 229 nm maxima of these gliadin peptides were slightly shifted to lower wavelengths in comparison with the poly-l-proline reference. Presumably this results from a loss of tertiary amide chromophores due to fewer proline residues (18Siligardi G. Drake A.F. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 281-292Google Scholar). Two additional experiments provided evidence for PPII helical content in these gliadin peptides. First, unlike most secondary structural motifs, hydrogen bonding does not contribute significantly to the conformation of PPII peptides. Consistent with this, the circular dichroism spectra of both peptides show an increase in PPII content in the presence of 4–6 m chaotropic agents such as guanidine or urea (Fig. 2 A). Presumably, this increase results from interactions between the denaturing agent and the peptide backbone, which force the peptide to assume a more extended conformation in the sterically limited PPII region of (φ, ψ) space. Second, also consistent with earlier studies on PPII peptides, the molar ellipticities of both peptides showed a decrease at λmin and λmax in the presence of 0.1–1.5m CaCl2 (14Kelly M.A. Chellgren B.W. Rucker A.L. Troutman J.M. Fried M.G. Miller A.F. Creamer T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14376-14383Google Scholar, 19Dalcol I. Pons M. Ludevid M.D. Giralt E. J. Org. Chem. 1996; 61: 6775-6782Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B), until the positive band disappeared altogether due to disruption of the extended helix (20Tiffany M.L. Krimm S. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1767-1770Google Scholar, 21Helbecque N. Loucheux-Lefevre M.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1982; 19: 94-101Google Scholar). To test whether the PPII character of the above peptides could be ascribed to the PQPQLPY motif, CD spectroscopy was performed on this monomeric peptide, as well as four naturally occurring analogs (PQPQLSY, SQPQLPY, PQPQASP, PQPQQPP) found in gluten proteins. The first two analogs are from naturally occurring gliadin sequences, whereas the latter two are the closest homologs of PQPQLPY from the sequences of rice gluten proteins. (Rice is non-toxic in the Celiac diet.) As shown in Fig. 3, both gliadin peptides had strong PPII helical character, whereas both rice peptides had substantially reduced helicity. Recently it was shown that substitution of d-amino acids into a biologically active heptapeptide resulted in an increase of its PPII content (22Uray K. Kajtar J. Vass E. Price M.R. Hollosi M. Hudecz F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 25-32Google Scholar). To assess the effect of substituting Pro1, Gln2, and Pro3 in PQPQLPY for their d-counterparts, the CD spectra of pQPQLPY, pqPQLPY, and pqpQLPY were analyzed. (Lowercase letters correspond to d-amino acids.) As shown in Table III, whereas monomers 1 and 2 were highly helical, helicity was substantially reduced in monomer 3. Indeed, monomer 1 (pQPQLPY) had the highest polyproline II helical content among all PQPQLPY analogs evaluated in this study and was therefore the principal target for structural analysis via NMR spectroscopy (see below).Table IIISummary of PPII content and kinetic data for PQPQLPY, PQPQLPYPQPQLPY, gliadin peptides and derivativestTGase substrates% PPIIK mk cat/K mmmmin−1·mm−1PQPQLSY*93.20.387PQPQLPY*87.80.382PQPQLPF*84.40.472SQPQLPY*83.20.396PQPQAPS*20.7>107PQPQQPP*<1>101pQPQLPY960.295pqPQLPY90.40.198pqpQLPY48.60.741PQPQPPP89>10<10Kinetic parameters for peptides marked with an asterisk are from Ref.7Piper J.L.

To verify that PQPQLPY and selected analogs did indeed adopt a polyproline II helical conformation, the structure of pQPQLPY (the analog with the highest helical content) was determined by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. As a prerequisite, the chemical shifts of individual hydrogen atoms needed to be assigned. A standard method (23Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar) was used to sequentially assign all the proton resonances of this peptide at 25 °C. TOCSY spectra were used to identify spin systems, and ROESY spectra were used to obtain interresidue connectivities and to distinguish equivalent spin systems. Unambiguous assignments were made in the following three steps. First, the 15N-1H HSQC of pQPQLPY in solution A (Me2SO) or B (phosphate buffer) was ascertained to contain the correct number of amide proton peaks before further peak assignment. Since proline residues do not contain amide protons, and the N-terminal amino group proton is not observed in aqueous buffers, only four residues in the seven-residue peptide were expected to show cross-peaks corresponding to the amide protons. In addition, two peaks for amide protons in each of the glutamine side chains were expected. In aggregate, ten strong cross-peaks were observed in solution A, whereas eight peaks were observed in solution B. (An extra peak observed in each case was weaker than the others and was therefore assumed to correspond to the protonated state of the N-terminal residue.) Second, we examined the α-δH/NH fingerprint regions of the TOCSY spectra. The spin systems of the individual amino acids residues were readily identified in the TOCSY spectrum. For example, the two glutamine spin systems showed characteristic βΗ and γH, whereas the leucine spin system had a characteristic unique δ-methyl proton chemical shift at <1 ppm, and the tyrosine residue had characteristic signals in the aromatic region of the spectrum. Further examination of the full TOCSY and1H-13C HSQC spectrum also revealed three sets of peaks in the carbon (F1) dimension, corresponding to the proline Cδ-Hδ correlation Pro1, Pro3, Pro6. Third, using these assigned residues together with the sequential NOE connectivities from ROESY, sequential specific resonance assignments could be completed. The complete 1H NMR assignments for pQPQLPY in solution B and D2O are summarized in TableI, whereas αH and NH chemical shifts in Me2SO-d6 are summarized in the Supplemental Material. The NH shift dispersion was approximately equivalent (∼0.3 ppm) in either solvent, implying that solvent polarity and dielectric had little influence on the conformation of the peptide. Since the one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra of pQPQLPY showed the same characteristics in phosphate buffer, D2O and Me2SO-d 6, the solution conformation of this peptide was explored in either solvent by determination of Cα proton chemical shift values, three-bond spin-spin (3J) coupling constants, medium/long range NOE coupling, and interproton distances between the αH of the preceding residues and the proline αH and δH. The deviation of αH chemical shifts from random coil values provides some information about peptide secondary structure, since well defined chemical shift changes are associated with α-helices and extended β-strands (24Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Google Scholar, 25Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Google Scholar). The Chemical shift index developed by Wishart and Sykes (26Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Google Scholar) compares each αH chemical shift in a peptide/protein to a range of random coil values, as determined from a large data base of peptides and proteins. A chemical shift value lower than the range indicates that the residue lies in a region of α-helix, while a value greater than the range suggests participation in a β-strand-extended structure. A grouping of four or more upfield shifts (average negative shift −0.38 ppm) is designated as an α-helix, while three or more consecutive downfield shifts (average positive shift 0.38 ppm) imply β-strand (24Wishart D.S.

Changes in chemical shifts of αH resonances from random coil for pQPQLPY in aqueous buffer are summarized in Table I. While several αH chemical shifts fell outside the random coil range, our data did not suggest local regions of classical α-helix or β-strand secondary structure in aqueous solution, with chemical shift index αH values < 1.2 ppm. Therefore, it was likely that pQPQLPY has an alternative, possibly more rigid, conformation than other peptides. The torsion angles φ and ψ are key parameters for defining the backbone conformation of a polypeptide chain (27Ramachandran G.N. Ramadrishnan C. Sasisekharan V. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 95-99Google Scholar). In solution these angles can be detected experimentally by NMR via spin-spin coupling constants, which in the case of 3J coupling constants can be related to specific torsion angles by Karplus relationships (15Padi A. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Google Scholar,28Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1959; 30: 11-15Google Scholar). Three bond 3JHNα coupling constants for extended chains are 6–9 Hz, whereas smaller coupling constants (2–5 Hz) are observed for α-helix and for the second and/or the third residues of β-strand secondary structure (29Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 201: 161-200Google Scholar). All3JHNα coupling constants measured for pQPQLPY in aqueous buffer are summarized in Table I. Those coupling constants were found to be in the 6.5–7.5 Hz range, in accordance with an extended structure. The intensity of the ratio between sequential αH-NH (i,i+ 1) and NH-NH (i, i+ 1) NOEs is useful as a measure for secondary structure, since it depends on the dihedral angles (φ and ψ). Using population-weighted random coil, Dobson and co-workers (30Fiebig K.M. Schwalbe H. Buck M. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 2661-2666Google Scholar) predicted that the intensity ratio of αH-NH (i, i+ 1)/NH-NH (i,i+ 1) NOEs was about 1.4 for random structure, notably distinct from the ratio for extended β-strand conformation (about 55). An analysis of NOE intensities for pQPQLPY revealed that in aqueous solution or in Me2SO-d 6, NH-NH (i, i + 1) were not detected for any residues of the peptide, whereas αH-NH (i,i + 1) were medium/strong (Figs.4 and 5). This suggested a high αH-NH (i, i + 1)/NH-NH (i, i + 1) intensity ratio, also consistent with a predominantly extended conformation rather than random coil. The NOE intensity ratio αH-NH (i, i+ 1)/αH-NH (i, i) provided further evidence for extended structure in solution. A value of about 2.3 is predicted for the population-weight random coil model, while a value >4 is predicted for a β-strand (31Sharman G.L. Searle M.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5291-5300Google Scholar). Our analysis of NOE intensities in aqueous buffer revealed that just the αH-NH (i, i) were not detected with an exception for the residue Gln4, which had an intensity ratio αH-NH (i, i + 1)/αH-NH (i, i) of 3. However in Me2SO-d 6, all residues had an intensity ratio αH-NH (i, i +1)/αH-NH (i, i) larger than 3.5, consistent with a large population of extended structure through the entire sequence (Table I, Fig. 4, and Supplemental Material).Figure 5A, expanded TOCSY region for pQPQLPY, in solution C (D2O). B, expanded ROESY region for pQPQLPY, in solution C (D2O).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A key requirement for a PPII helix is that the peptide bonds preceding Pro residues adopt trans configurations. To distinguish between the cis/trans configuration of the imide bonds in pQPQLPY, the difference in interproton distances between the αH of the preceding residues and the proline αH and δH were measured (32Hinck A.P. Eberhardt E.S. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11810-11818Google Scholar). A short distance (strong NOE signal) between αH of a preceding residue and δH of a proline is diagnostic for the transconfiguration, whereas a short distance (strong NOE signal) between αH of a preceding residue and αH of a proline is diagnostic for the cis configuration. In Me2SO-d 6(supporting information) or in D2O (Fig. 5), the αδ (i, I+ 1) NOE cross-peaks in the ROESY spectrum strongly indicated that the proline res"

https://openalex.org/W1542084674,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of various ribonucleosides to free base and ribose components has been obtained from cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens and purified about 300-fold by fractionation with protamine sulfate, ammonium sulfate, alumina Cγ, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The preparation thus purified catalyzes the hydrolysis of about 50 µmoles of uridine per min per mg of protein at 37°, and is stable when stored at -15°. The enzyme is highly specific for nucleosides containing the β-d-ribofuranosyl carbon-nitrogen linkage. A broad specificity is shown with respect to the base components: both pyrimidine and purine ribonucleosides are hydrolyzed. Because the maximum rate of hydrolysis of a pyrimidine nucleoside is generally much greater than that of a purine nucleoside, the systematic name N-ribosylpyrimidine ribohydrolase is suggested for this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1486555545,"Abstract The kinetics of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate by rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been investigated in aqueous solution at 25° in the pH range 6 to 9. Steady state kinetics was examined under conditions in which substrate is present in great excess over enzyme; pre-steady state kinetics was examined under similar conditions and also when substrate and enzyme are present in approximately equal concentrations. As previously observed, the p-nitrophenolate-time curves were biphasic, exhibiting a rapid exponential reaction, reflecting principally the rate of enzyme acylation, followed by a zero order reaction, reflecting principally the rate of enzyme deacylation. The pH-rate profiles for both acylation and deacylation reactions were carefully examined and found to be similar. In each case, the rate constants increase linearly with increasing hydroxide ion concentration below pH 7.5 and then level off with increasing pH in a manner consistent with the ionization of single groups. Thus, kinetically, acylation depends on a basic group, the conjugate acid of which has a pKa near 8.1, and deacylation depends on a similar group, with pKa near 8.7. The number of moles of p-nitrophenolate released per mole of enzyme in the exponential phase of the reaction is a function of pH, rising from about 2.5 to 3.0 below pH 8 to 5.5 above pH 8. Under steady state conditions, an extraneous reaction was noted at very high substrate concentrations; that is, the rate law under these conditions has the form v = k3E0 + kiiiE0S0. For enzyme acylation with p-nitrophenyl acetate, the magnitude and pH dependence of the rate constants are consistent with unaided attack of a crucial sulfhydryl anion on the ester. In contrast, for deacylation, the magnitude and pH dependence of rate constants require the involvement of a second catalytic entity of the enzyme."

Human CD27 is a B cell co-stimulatory molecule. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CD27 and CD40 signals on BCR-mediated apoptosis of B cells. BCR ligation activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathways including down-regulation of Bcl-XL, dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochromec, and activation of caspase-9. Each of these effects was significantly inhibited by CD27 and CD40. Bik expression was weakly but significantly down-regulated by CD27 but up-regulated by CD40. BCR ligation resulted in p53 activation including its phosphorylation at Ser15, nuclear translocation, and target genep53AIP1 induction. CD27 and CD40 clearly suppressed these processes. Analyses that used dominant-negative p53 variants revealed a low but still substantial level of BCR-mediated apoptosis and intact mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. These pathways were further inhibited by CD27 and CD40, although the cells showed no p53 phosphorylation or p53AIP1 expression.

BCR signaling initiates receptor editing, apoptosis, anergy, and immune response (1Craxton A. Otipoby K. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Google Scholar). The nature of the antigen (Ag)-induced response depends on the developmental stage of the responding cell, the avidity of the Ag-BCR interaction, and the availability of co-stimulatory signals from helper T cells. This differential responsiveness to Ag plays a critical role in the elimination of autoreactive B cells from the functional repertoire and results in immunological tolerance (2Goodnow C.C. Cyster J.G. Hartley S.B. Bell S.E. Coole M.P. Hearly J.I. Akkaraju S. Rathmell J.C. Pogue S.L. Shokat K.P. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59: 279-368Google Scholar). The human Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Ramos, expresses surface IgM as BCR, and engagement of this BCR with an anti-IgM antibody (Ab) induces apoptotic cell death. Because of these features, Ramos cells have been used extensively as a model of clonal deletion of B cells in the germinal center, and Ramos cells facilitate the dissection of molecular and biochemical pathways that lead to cell death (3An S.

Accumulating evidence suggests that BCR ligation activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway (5Doi T. Motoyama N. Tokunaga A. Watanabe T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 11: 933-941Google Scholar, 6Berard M. Mondiere P. Casamayor-Palleja M. Hennino A. Bella C. Defrance T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4655-4662Google Scholar, 7Bouchon A. Krammer P.H.

General agreement exists that alterations in the ratio of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family can protect against the initiation or progression of apoptosis by modulating mitochondrial membrane permeability (9Adams M.A. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 322-326Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that overexpression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL prevents BCR-mediated apoptosis (10Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H.

Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 35-45Google Scholar) and that BCR ligation induces proapoptotic protein Bik (12Jiang A. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6025-6033Google Scholar). On the other hand, a growing number of gene products have been identified as components of the machinery that leads to cell death. Among these, the tumor suppressor gene p53 is of particular interest. The p53 protein plays important roles in the control of cell death as well as cell-cycle inhibition (13Voudsen K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar, 14Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanism(s) through which p53 exerts these effects is not clear but seems to depend on the ability of p53 protein to act as a transcription factor. Recently one of the important p53 transcriptional target genes was found to be p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1 (p53AIP1) (15Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda C. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Nishimori K. Tamai T. Tokino Y. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Google Scholar). p53AIP1 is localized within the mitochondria and plays a direct role in the mediation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Although it was reported that in the murine B lymphoma cell line WEHI-231, p53 and the p53 target gene, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1, are involved in BCR-mediated apoptosis (16Wu M. Bellas R.E. Shen J. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1671-1679Google Scholar), whether BCR-mediated signaling primarily activates p53 remains unresolved. Among a number of cell surface molecules involved in T-B cell cooperation and subsequent B cell fate, the B cell molecule CD40, a member of the TNFR family, mediates a co-stimulatory signal and plays a pivotal role in B cell proliferation, memory B cell differentiation, and B cell survival (3An S. Knox K.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 115-122Google Scholar, 17Ghia P. Boussiotis V. Schultze J. Cardoso A. Dorfman D.H. Gribben J. Freeman A. Nadler L. Blood. 1998; 91: 244-251Google Scholar, 18Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are involved in CD40-mediated rescue from BCR-mediated apoptosis (17Ghia P. Boussiotis V. Schultze J. Cardoso A. Dorfman D.H. Gribben J. Freeman A. Nadler L. Blood. 1998; 91: 244-251Google Scholar, 18Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Google Scholar, 19Choi M.S. Boise L.H.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3722-3725Google Scholar). CD27 is also a member of the TNFR family, and we have previously reported that this molecule mediates a co-stimulatory signal for B cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation in humans (21Kobata T.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 2652-2657Google Scholar). Although CD27 signaling, in addition to CD40 signaling, induces activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (18Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Google Scholar, 23Akiba H. Nakano H. Nishinaka S. Shindo M. Kobata T. Atsuta M. Morimoto C. Ware C.F. Malinin N.L. Wallach D. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13353-13358Google Scholar), the role of CD27 signaling in BCR-mediated apoptosis and p53 activation is still obscure. In the present study we offer evidence for the crucial roles of both CD27 and CD40 signals in human BCR-mediated apoptosis. Our results showed that p53 is secondarily activated and amplifies the apoptotic cascade that is regulated by both CD27 and CD40 signals at the mitochondrial level. The following Abs were used in this study: Bax (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), Bcl-XL, caspase-3, cytochrome c, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), p53 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); caspase-9, phospho-p53 (Ser15) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); NBK (Bik), Bcl-2, histone H4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); cytochrome oxidase type IV (COV IV; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); β-actin (Sigma). The Epstein-Barr virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma Ramos cells (sIgM+CD27+ CD40+) were purchased from Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5.5 × 10−2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cells were treated with anti-IgM Ab (Sigma) or control Ab (goat IgG, Sigma) to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. For co-culture with cells transfected with human CD154 gene, CD70 gene, or vector alone (22Jacquot S. Kobata T. Iwata S. Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2652-2657Google Scholar), 1 × 105 Ramos cells were preincubated with varying amounts of transfectants treated with mitomycin C (Sigma) in 96-well, round-bottomed plates. After incubation for 30 min, anti-IgM Ab was added to the culture and cells were harvested at 24 h. The caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk and zLEHD-fmk were obtained from Calbiochem. For treatment with caspase inhibitors, 1 × 105 Ramos cells were preincubated with serial dilution of zVAD-fmk or zLEHD-fmk in 96-well, round-bottomed plates. After the incubation for 30 min, anti-IgM Ab was added to the culture and cells were harvested at 24 h. To detect apoptotic cells, phosphatidylserine exposure was measured by using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide was added just before analysis on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Nuclear protein extraction was performed as described previously (15Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda C. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Nishimori K. Tamai T. Tokino Y. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Google Scholar) except for the use of digitonin instead of Nonidet P-40. Briefly, cells washed in phosphate-buffered saline were resuspended in cold TKM10-10−5 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 10 min, cells were lysed by digitonin (Sigma) to 0.1 mm (final concentration). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and nuclear protein was extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. For cytochrome c release assay, the cells washed in phosphate-buffered saline were lysed in isotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 0.3 m mannitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) plus 0.1 mm digitonin with protease inhibitors. After incubation on ice for 5 min, cytosol fraction was collected by centrifugation, and insoluble fraction was disrupted by sonication with a sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Tween 20) supplemented with protease inhibitors. For whole cell extractions, the cell pellets washed in phosphate-buffered saline were resuspended with 0.5% SDS solution and boiled for 5 min. Proteins (4–8 μg) were separated on an SDS-PAGE, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), blocked with 5% skim milk, and immunoblotted with arbitrary Ab- and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary Ab. The blotting was developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce) and visualized with a LumiVision analyzer (Taitec Co., Tokyo, Japan). The densitometric analysis was performed by using a LumiVision analyzer (Taitec Co.). Changes in Δψm were tested by MitoLight apoptosis detection kit according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Labeled cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur. The expression of p53AIP1 (16Wu M. Bellas R.E. Shen J. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1671-1679Google Scholar) was determined by a method for real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with use of the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems) (24Kruse N. Pette M. Toyka K. Rieckmann P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 210: 195-203Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers for p53AIP1 were 5′-GATCTTCCTCTGAGGCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-AAACCCAGCCAGGTGTGTGT-3′, respectively. The sense and antisense primers for β-actin were 5′-tcacccacactgtgcccatctacga-3′ and 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′, respectively. The reaction master mix that contained a target hybridization probe labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein at the 5′ end was used. The p53AIP1probe was 5′-CAGATCTGCTCAAGCTTCCTGCAGTGG-3′. β-Actin was 5′-ATGCCCCCCCCATGCCATCCTGCGT-3′. The thermal cycling conditions included 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for denaturing and anneal-extension, respectively. The p53 dominant-negative construct, in which cysteine at position 135 in the p53-binding site is mutated to tyrosine (C135Y), abrogates the endogenous p53 wild-type function (25Scheffner M. Takahashi T. Huibregtse J.M. Minna J.D. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5100-5105Google Scholar). To construct a p53DN-expression vector, a cDNA that encoded full-length p53DN protein was subcloned from pCMV-p53mt135 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) into pBluescript SK (+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and finally into the pBCMGSneo expression vector (26Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Google Scholar) at the XhoI andNotI sites, generating a clone termed pBCMGS-p53DN. pBCMGS-p53WT was also constructed. Ramos cells were electroporated with pBCMGS-p53DN, pBCMGS-p53WT, or pBCMGSneo alone. The human CD70 and CD154 and the vector alone (mock)-transfected cells in the murine pre-B 300-19 cell line have been described previously (22Jacquot S. Kobata T. Iwata S. Morimoto C. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2652-2657Google Scholar). The paired Student's ttest was used to determine the statistical significance of the data. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. BCRs on Ramos cells ligated with anti-IgM Ab displayed their apoptotic figures as annexin V-positive cells. Apoptotic cells started to appear at 6 h. These cells constituted approximately 40% of the cells at 24 h and approximately 50% at 48 h (Fig.1 A). We then compared the effects of CD27 and CD40 signals on BCR-mediated apoptosis. Ramos cells were mixed with increasing numbers of transfected cells that expressed CD70 (CD27L) or CD154 (CD40L), both of which are expressed by activated T cells, in the presence of anti-IgM Ab. CD27 ligation as well as CD40 ligation inhibited BCR-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). When the ratio of transfectant cells to Ramos cells was 20%, CD70- and CD154-transfected cells exhibited a significant inhibition of apoptosis of Ramos cells stimulated with anti-IgM Ab compared with mock-transfected cells (70%, p < 0.05 and 75%,p < 0.01, respectively). The extent of inhibitory effect by CD27 ligation was almost comparable to that by CD40 ligation (no significant difference). These inhibitory effects were specifically abrogated by the addition of anti-CD70 or anti-CD154 Ab (data not shown). These results suggest that both CD27 and CD40 signals are involved in antiapoptotic effects for B cell survival. In agreement with previous reports that BCR ligation activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway (5Doi T. Motoyama N. Tokunaga A. Watanabe T. Int.

In addition, Bik was strongly induced by 6 h, whereas Bcl-XL was gradually down-regulated to a barely detectable level at 48 h (Fig.2 B). The expression of Bcl-2 was absent in unstimulated Ramos cells and was induced weakly at a relatively late phase. CD27 ligation suppressed the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and the cleavage of PARP with the same efficacy as that observed for CD40 ligation (Fig. 2 A). As previously reported (17Ghia P. Boussiotis V. Schultze J. Cardoso A. Dorfman D.H. Gribben J. Freeman A. Nadler L. Blood. 1998; 91: 244-251Google Scholar, 18Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3722-3725Google Scholar), CD40 ligation up-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as much as 9.7- (p < 0.01) and 6.8-fold (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). Under similar conditions, CD27 ligation also up-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL as much as 5.0- (p < 0.01) and 3.9-fold (p < 0.01), respectively. Interestingly, proapoptotic Bik was weakly down-regulated (1.3-fold decrease by CD27 ligation, p < 0.05), whereas CD40 ligation resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in Bik expression (p < 0.01) (Fig.2, B and C). Cytochrome c release from the intramitochondrial space into the cytosol was detectable even after 6 h and increased by 48 h (Fig. 3 A). BCR ligation altered the mitochondrial Δψm (Fig. 3 C). These results confirm that BCR ligation activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. As expected, CD27 ligation strongly reduced cytochromec release after BCR ligation, in which the inhibitory level was almost the same as CD40 ligation (Fig. 3 B). Likewise, CD27 ligation significantly inhibited the dissipation of mitochondrial Δψm, similar to CD40 ligation (Fig. 3 C). These results clearly indicate that CD27 and CD40 signals regulate BCR-mediated apoptosis at the mitochondrial level through the alteration of the balance among Bcl-2 family members to regulate mitochondrial permeability. p53 can directly engage apoptotic pathways in the cell and stimulate mitochondrial perturbations including cytochrome c release (13Voudsen K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Google Scholar, 14Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Google Scholar). To assess the functional activation of p53 in response to BCR ligation, we examined p53 phosphorylation at Ser15. p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 represents a response to cellular stress such as DNA damage (27Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, phospho-p53 was identified at 24 h after BCR ligation, and a steady increase in phosphorylation level was observed. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser6, Ser9, Ser20, or Ser392 was not detected (data not shown). Recent studies have demonstrated that p53 phosphorylation at Ser15decreased its nuclear export activity and resulted in accumulation of p53 in the nucleus (28Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Google Scholar). On the basis of this finding, we next examined the location of p53 after BCR ligation. The intracellular distribution of p53 was found to be biased toward the nucleus (Fig. 4 C). Recent studies demonstrated that, among the identified target genes of p53, p53AIP1, an indispensable mediator of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway, was induced directly by p53 in response to DNA damage and that p53AIP1 was responsive to functional p53 by phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser46 residues (15Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda C. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Nishimori K. Tamai T. Tokino Y. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Google Scholar). In the present study, thep53AIP1 gene was clearly induced in Ramos cells at 24 h after BCR ligation compared with unstimulated cells (Fig.4 E). Compared with a mock control at 24 h after BCR ligation, CD27 and CD40 ligation inhibited p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, A andB), its translocation into the nucleus (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 4, Cand D), and p53AIP1 expression induced by BCR ligation (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 E). These results suggest that CD27 and CD40 signals inhibit p53 activation. It is assumed that BCRmediated signaling primarily activates p53 downstream, which in turn executes the apoptotic process. However, the above finding of p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 andp53AIP1 induction on BCR ligation could also be interpreted to mean that p53 activation was secondarily induced in response to cellular stress such as DNA damage. To examine the direct involvement of p53 activation in BCR-mediated apoptosis, stably transfected Ramos cells with p53DN or p53WT were prepared. Western blot analysis showed high levels of both p53DN and p53WT expression, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed no difference in surface IgM expression between these transfectants (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, A andB, overexpression of p53WT caused Ramos cells to become hypersensitive against BCR ligation, demonstrating rapid cell death by 6 h (p < 0.01) and magnified p53AIP1gene expression (p < 0.01) compared with transfected Ramos cells with vector alone. On the other hand, p53DN still showed a substantial level of BCR-mediated apoptosis after 24 h incubation compared with vector control in the presence of anti-IgM Ab (p < 0.05) despite the fact that p53AIP1gene expression at 12 h after BCR ligation was almost completely suppressed by p53DN to a basal level compared with p53DN in the presence of control Ab. After BCR ligation, p53DN only slightly suppressed phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, the cleavage of PARP, and cytochrome c release compared with vector control (no significance except for PARP cleavage (p < 0.05), whereas p53WT strongly amplified these (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, C and D, and Fig 6, A and B). Interestingly, although no significant difference was found in Bcl-XL expression among these transfectants, up-regulation of Bax and Bik was observed in p53WT compared with vector control in the presence of anti-IgM Ab (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6,C and D). Consistent with the above results, whereas p53WT strongly magnified the alteration of mitochondrial Δψm, p53DN still showed a substantial level of mitochondrial Δψm dissipation compared with vector control after BCR ligation (Fig. 6 E). These results suggest that p53-independent and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways may operate in BCR-mediated apoptosis. In addition, p53 may be activated secondarily and subsequently drive apoptosis at the mitochondrial level through p53AIP1, because p53AIP1 is located in the mitochondria and its overexpression causes dissipation of mitochondrial Δψm (15Oda K.

Data shown are representative of three different experiments and are presented as mean ± S.D.; *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we examined the effects of CD27 and CD40 signals on BCR-mediated apoptosis of p53DN cells to clarify whether their signaling inhibits p53-independent apoptotic pathway. Compared with vector control after BCR ligation, CD27 and CD40 signals significantly inhibited apoptosis of p53DN cells (p < 0.05) (Fig.7 A), up-regulated Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 expression (p < 0.01) (Fig. 7, B and C), and suppressed cytochromec release into the cytosol (p < 0.01) (Fig.7, D and E). Thus, these results suggest that CD27 and CD40 signals regulate the p53-independent apoptotic pathway at the mitochondrial level and consequently regulate the p53-amplified pathway. In this report we compared the effects of CD70/CD27 and CD154/CD40 interactions that belong to the TNF/TNFR family on human T cell-dependent B cell survival after Ag stimulation. For this purpose, we used Ramos cells as a model for germinal center B cells and mimicked provision of T cell help through the selective use of transfectant cells that express the ligands CD70 and CD154 for the receptors CD27 and CD40 on B cells, respectively. The potential physiologic relevance of these TNF/TNFR family molecules in B cell activation, differentiation, and survival has yet to be fully proved. However, it is likely that multiple surface molecules are involved in the fine tuning of T cell-dependent B cell responses and fate and that different molecules are functionally implicated in each maturation stage of B cells. In addition, to evaluate the role of p53 in BCR-mediated apoptosis, we developed and used p53DN and p53WT Ramos cells. First we found that both CD27 ligation and CD40 ligation each clearly inhibited BCR-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1 B). Of note, these results are in contrast to those of Prasad et al. (29Prasad K.V.S. Ao Z. Yoon Y. Wu M.X. Rizk M. Jacquot S. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6346-6351Google Scholar) who reported that CD27 signaling itself induced apoptosis of Ramos cells. The reason for the opposite results is that CD27 might provide different intracellular signals to B cells under different culture conditions, for instance the presence or absence of Ag stimulation as observed with other TNF receptors. For example, Fas (CD95) provides co-stimulatory signals to resting T cells but triggers apoptosis of activated T cells (30Siegel R.M.K.-M. Chan F. Chun H.J. Lenardo M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 469-474Google Scholar). Thus, CD27 could provide proapoptotic signals for B cells in the absence of Ag stimulation or low-affinity Ag recognition but could provide survival and/or co-stimulatory signals for activated B cells with high-affinity Ag stimulation. Our results also showed that both CD27 and CD40 ligation altered the expression of the Bcl-2 family molecules, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release, p53 phosphorylation at Ser15, nuclear translocation of p53, and p53AIP1induction (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). These findings clearly indicate that CD27 and CD40 signals exhibit their regulatory effects on BCR-mediated apoptosis at least at the mitochondrial level. It should be noted that Bik was weakly down-regulated by CD27 ligation, whereas it was up-regulated by CD40 ligation (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, it is possible that CD27 signals regulate BCR-mediated apoptosis at the mitochondrial level in a manner different from CD40 signals through the alteration of the balance among Bcl-2 family members to regulate mitochondrial permeability. In addition to Bax, one of the target proteins for p53, Bik might be involved in the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway. Because previous studies have demonstrated that BCR ligation increased the amount of Bik associated with Bcl-XL during apoptosis (12Jiang A. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6025-6033Google Scholar), Bik may contribute at least in part to the high apoptotic sensitivity of p53WT together with Bax to antagonize the function of Bcl-XL. We also examined the role of p53 in BCR-mediated apoptosis and the role of CD27 and CD40 signals on this mechanism. Previous studies indicated that DNA damage could induce p53 phosphorylation at Ser15as well as p53AIP1 expression (15Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda C. Tanikawa T. Mori H. Nishimori K. Tamai T. Tokino Y. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Google Scholar, 17Ghia P. Boussiotis V. Schultze J. Cardoso A. Dorfman D.H. Gribben J. Freeman A. Nadler L. Blood. 1998; 91: 244-251Google Scholar). In addition, p53 activation seems to occur at a relatively late phase after BCR ligation when compared with the appearance of annexin V-positive cells and cleavage of caspases and PARP (Figs. 1 A, 2 A, and4 A). After BCR ligation, p53DN still revealed a detectable level of cytochrome c release, cleavage of PARP, p53 phosphorylation, down-regulation of Bcl-XL, and up-regulation of Bik to levels almost comparable to those observed in vector control and showed a substantial level of apoptosis despite the failure of induction of p53AIP1 (Figs. 5 and 6). In addition, although the exact time of activation of the executioner, caspase-3, after BCR ligation was not clear, we were able to detect DNA fragmentation even after 6 h (data not shown). When we used z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, we observed a complete inhibition of both DNA fragmentation and p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 during a 24-h culture period after BCR ligation (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that 1) BCR ligation initiated a p53-independent apoptotic pathway that resulted in DNA damage, 2) DNA damage in turn activated a p53-dependent pathway, and 3) both the p53-independent and p53-dependent apoptotic pathways are located in the mitochondria, and their activation resulted in amplification of the apoptotic process. This conclusion is supported by the results of previous studies demonstrating that splenic B cells from p53-null mice were not more resistant to apoptosis than normal mice (31Shick L. Carman J.H. Choi J.K. Somasundaram K. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Zeng Y.X. Wang K.G. Salhany K. Kadesch T.R. Monroe J.G. Donehower L.A. EI-Deiry W.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 121-131Google Scholar), and that BCR ligation activated a p53-independent pathway of c-Myc-induced apoptosis in murine WEHI-231 cells (32Hagiyama H. Adachi T. Yoshida T. Nomura T. Miyasaka N. Honjo T. Tsubata T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4091-4098Google Scholar). To our knowledge, however, no report has described the relationship between p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways or the relationship between CD27/CD40 signaling and p53 activation in BCR-mediated apoptosis in humans. This issue is important in the consideration of the potential biological role of p53 in human B cell fate and responses. It should be noted that murine B cells showed only a marginal expression of CD27 (33Gravestein L.A. Nieland J.D. Kruisbeek A.M. Borst J. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 551-557Google Scholar, 34Oshima H.

Med. 1998; 188: 1679-1689Google Scholar) and that a normal B cell response to antigen challenge was observed in CD27-deficient mice (36Hendriks J. Gravestein L.A. Tesselaar K. van Lier R.A.W. Schumacher T.N.M. Borst J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 433-440Google Scholar). CD27 and CD40 signals primarily inhibited p53-independent pathway in human BCR-mediated apoptosis at the mitochondrial level (Fig. 7). It is possible that the findings obtained in the present study are specific for Ramos cells. To rule out this possibility, we performed the same series of experiments using another human B cell line, P32/ISH. P32/ISH cells express IgM, CD40, and CD27, and are susceptible to BCR-mediated apoptosis (37Suzuki T. Kiyokawa N. Taguchi T. Sekino T. Katagiri Y.U. Fujimoto J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5567-5577Google Scholar). Our results in P32/ISH cells were similar to those described in Ramos cells (data not shown), thus indicating that the aforementioned findings were not specific to Ramos cells but rather were common to B cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated in the present study that at the mitochondrial level CD27 and CD40 co-stimulatory signals suppressed the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway in human B cells by inhibiting p53-independent apoptotic pathway induced by BCR ligation. In humans, CD40 signals induce proliferation of B cells and generation of memory B cells, and CD27 signals induce marginal proliferation of B cells and generation of plasma cells, resulting in Ig production (3An S.

Therefore, in humans CD27 signals might rescue the differentiation of germinal center B cells, especially memory B cells (35Klein U. Rajewsky K. Kuppers R. J. Exp.

Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 111-115Google Scholar), which is required for cytokinesis. As a Rho partner, mDia has important roles in stress fiber formation, focal adhesion formation, and cell movement (3Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat.

Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we recently identified a novel mDia-interacting protein (5Satoh S. Tominaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39290-39294Google Scholar). We also identified a previously described protein, Pax6, as an mDia partner, using full-length mDia2 or truncated mDia2 (dominant active) as bait.Pax6 is a transcription factor containing two DNA binding domains, a paired domain and a homeodomain, that play important roles in the developing central nervous system (6Callaerts P.

At these locations, Pax6, like Rho and mDia (11Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Google Scholar), is crucial for normal cell migration (9Engelkamp D. Rashbass P.

Mice or rats in which one copy of the Pax6 gene has been mutated exhibit small eyes (Sey) (12Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L.M. Ton C.C.T. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V. Nature. 1991; 354: 522-525Google Scholar).Both Rho and another of its downstream targets, p160ROCK (Rho kinase), have been proposed to negatively regulate the early steps of axon outgrowth in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (13Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Google Scholar). In the same system, it has been reported that Pax6 participates in the regulation of granule cell polarization independent of the Rho/ROCK pathway (14Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi M. Kengaku M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3133-3144Google Scholar). Moreover, we have reported that signaling downstream of mDia is distinct from that downstream of ROCK and that the effects of mDia depend on the activity of Src-tyrosine kinase, which is known to promote neurite extension (15Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Google Scholar) and neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum and other brain regions (16Ingraham C.A. Cox M.E. Ward D.C. Fults D.W. Maness P.F. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1989; 10: 1-14Google Scholar). These findings led us to consider the possibility that the effects of mDia/Pax6 on neurite extension are distinct from those of Rho/ROCK (17Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 18Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 409-415Google Scholar). Here, we report that mDia enters the nucleus, binds to Pax6, and decreases Pax6 transcriptional activity in non-neuronal cells. In cerebellar granule cells, mDia also alters Pax6 subcellular distribution and enhances neurite branching and length.RESULTSA mouse homologue of formin has been reported to be localized in the nucleus (23Chan D.C. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23472-23477Google Scholar), and inspection of the mDia protein sequence revealed a putative nuclear localization signal. We therefore examined whether mDia could enter the nucleus by using leptomycin B (24Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.R. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Google Scholar), an inhibitor of nuclear pore component, exportin. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of transfected NIH3T3 cells with leptomycin B caused GFP-mDia2 to change its localization from a diffuse pattern to an exclusively nuclear pattern. We also observed that while Pax6 was located exclusively in the nucleus when expressed in HeLa or NIH3T3 cells, co-expression of mDia and Pax6 resulted in a mixed, nuclear and cytosolic Pax6 immunostaining pattern (Fig. 1 B). Such a cytosolic Pax6 immunostaining was never observed in cells expressing Pax6 with mDia lacking an N terminus (data not shown). These findings prompted us to examine the in vivo interaction of mDia and Pax6 using a Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Fig. 1 C). Pax6, expressed as a GAL4 fusion protein, directed the strong expression of luciferase from a Gal4-dependent reporter construct. Co-transfection of mDia2 decreased this luciferase activity. These results suggest that mDia blocks the binding of Pax6 to DNA, thereby decreasing the transcriptional activity of Pax6 in vivo. Indeed, transcriptional activity of Pax6 was examined using the PAX6 reporter gene (CD19.2/luc) (22Singh S. Tang H.K. Lee J.Y. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21531-21541Google Scholar), and the activity was reduced by mDia co-expression (Fig. 1 D).Next, we attempted to confirm the in vitro interaction of mDia and Pax6 in a “pull-down” assay. A significantly greater degree of interaction was observed in the pairs of mDia1-B/Pax6-(1–131), mDia1-C/Pax6-(1–131), and mDia1-C/Pax6-(132–271) compared with each negative control (Fig.2 A, lane 1 in thelower panel). Fig. 2 B shows a summary of the results from Fig. 2 A and a model for the interaction of both proteins. A FH2 domain in mDia (mDia-C) appears to interact with the DNA-binding domains of Pax6 (Pax6-(1–131) and Pax6-(132–271)), providing a possible mechanistic explanation for the inhibition of DNA binding and transcriptional activity of Pax6 by mDia.Figure 2In vitro interaction of mDia with Pax6. A, GST pull-down assay. Autoradiographs of in vitro translated (IVT) 35S-mDia1 subregions after pull-down with the indicated GST-Pax6 fusion proteins (input was indicated as Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining). Both mDia and Pax6 subregions used for the binding assays are shown in B(upper panel). B, summary of the results inA and a predicted model for the interaction of mDia with Pax6. mDia contains characteristic FH1, FH2, and FH3 domains as a formin homology protein.

A FH2 domain in mDia2 seems to be important for interaction with a Pax6 homeodomain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore the significance of the mDia-Pax6 interaction in vivo, we performed similar experiments using cultured cerebellar granule cells, which express Pax6 endogenously. We first demonstrated the expression of both mDia1 and mDia2 mRNAs in granule cells taken from 3-day-old mice (data not shown). Next, we examined the immunostaining of endogenous mDia1 and Pax6. Extranuclear expression of endogenous Pax6 was observed in some cells and Pax6 expression overlapped with that of mDia1, suggesting their co-localization (Fig. 3). We examined neurite outgrowth in cerebellar granule cells (using Pax6 co-staining as a marker of neurons, not glia cells) within 12–16 h after transfection with either GFP alone or GFP-tagged full-length mDia1. These experiments were performed in the presence of serum to permit activation of Rho, ROCK, and mDia. Short bipolar neurites arose in control GFP-transfected cells, a neurite extension pattern characteristic of cerebellar granule cells (Fig.4 A) (13Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Google Scholar). In cells transfected with mDia, we noted the appearance of endogenous Pax6 outside of the nucleus in some of the granule cells (Fig. 4, B andD, and Fig. 5 C), consistent with the effect we observed in HeLa or NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 B) and non-treated cerebellar granule cells (Fig. 3). Moreover, the immunoreactivity of Pax6 in the nucleus was weaker in the mDia-transfected cells than in the untransfected cells (Figs.4 C and 5, B and E). The expression of mDia1 also increased both the extent of neurite branching (Fig. 4,C and D) and neurite length (Fig. 4, Band D) compared with the GFP-transfected control cells (Fig.4 A). These effects are summarized in Fig. 4 E. In brief, mDia expression led to decreased Pax6 immunoreactivity in more than 40% of the cells and Pax6 mislocalization in more than 30% of the cells (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05versus control, respectively). In addition, elongation and multibranching of neurites upon mDia expression were observed in 67% (p < 0.05 versus control) and 55% (p < 0.05 versus control) of the cells, respectively. It is currently impossible to investigate the effect of endogenous mDia, because no reagents acting specifically on mDia are available. Therefore, we performed experiments on cerebellar granule cells in the presence of serum, which activates Rho, ROCK, and mDia. According to the reported results (17Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 18Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Google Scholar), activation of Rho and ROCK causes neurite contraction. However, in our experiments, cerebellar granule cells retained the ability to extend their neurites in the context of mDia expression, suggesting that exogenous mDia can overcome the inhibitory effects of Rho and ROCK on neurite extension. Furthermore, a truncated form of mDia lacking both nuclear localization signal and FH2 domains, and therefore unable to bind Pax6 (Fig.1 C), was unable to rescue neurite extension in the presence of serum (data not shown). This finding suggests that the interaction of mDia with Pax6 is critical for its effects on neurites.Figure 3mDia expression and localization in the cerebellar granule cells. Co-localization of endogenous mDia and Pax6. The orange color indicates the expression of both mDia1 and Pax6 (merge). After plating the granule cells, cells were fixed after 20 h.

Band C, Y-27632 alone was found to change the neurite polarity and length (A). mDia effects became more prominent in elongation (B) and multibranching (C) of neuritis by ROCK inhibitor.

Red and green images indicate Pax6 and GFP-mDia, respectively. The open circle in G(green) shows the mDia at the growth cone. The reverse effects by mDia in E and G were confirmed to be significant (p < 0.05 for both settingsversus without mDia) when χ2 analyses were performed (n = 12). The markers used (asterisk, arrowhead, and arrow) in Pax6 stainings in Fig. 5 indicate the same as those described in the legends to Figs. 3 and 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further confirm the interaction of mDia effects and those of Rho or ROCK, we also examined the combined effects of mDia overexpression with either application of the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, co-transfection of RhoV14 (dominant active Rho), or co-transfection of ROCKΔ3 (dominant active ROCK) (Fig. 5). Application of Y-27632 alone changed the polarity of neurites and promoted their elongation (Fig. 5 A) as reported previously (13Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Google Scholar, 14Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi M. Kengaku M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3133-3144Google Scholar). mDia effects on multibranching or neurite length became more prominent in the presence of this drug in some neurites (Fig. 5, B and C). Neurite shortening was evoked by expression of RhoV14 or ROCKΔ3 as reported previously (Fig. 5, D and F), and the shortening was reversed by co-expression of mDia (Fig. 5, E andG). In Fig. 5 G, the existence of mDia at the growth cone was observed (white circle). Furthremore, lamellipodia-like neurites were observed in some cells (Figs. 4 C and 5 E). These data suggest that the mDia effects on neurite extension and multibranching are different from those of the Rho/ROCK pathway, which causes growth cone contraction and neurite retraction via myosin light chain phosphorylation (11Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Google Scholar, 25Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONmDia, a formin homology protein and a target protein of the small GTPase, Rho, is known to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (stress fiber formation and microtubule organization (26Ishizaki T. Morishima Y. Okamoto M. Furuyashiki T. Kato T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 8-14Google Scholar)) and cytokinesis. The mechanistic basis for the effect of mDia on stress fiber formation is thought to include the de novo production of actin filaments (1Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Google Scholar, 5Satoh S. Tominaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39290-39294Google Scholar). This stress fiber formation occurs in cooperation with ROCK, which causes F-actin contraction through myosin light chain phosphorylation (25Amano M. Chihara K. Nakamura N. Fukata Y. Yano T. Shibata M. Ikebe M. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Google Scholar). It has also been reported that mDia regulates the transcription of focal adhesion molecules through the activation of serum response factor (4Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Google Scholar, 27Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Google Scholar). Mutations of formin homology proteins in all species examined are known to cause defects in cytokinesis (1Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Google Scholar). For example, mouse formin enters the nucleus, and mutations in this protein are reported to cause limb deformities and renal abnormalities (28Wynshaw-Boris A. Ryan G. Deng C.X. Chan D.C. Jackson-Grusby L. Larson D. Dunmore J.H. Leder P. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 372-384Google Scholar), and the mutated human Dia2 is reported to be responsible for primary ovarian failure (29Bione S. Sala C. Manzini C. Arrigo G. Zuffardi O. Banfi S. Borsani G. Jonveaux P. Philippe C. Zuccotti M. Ballabio A. Toniolo D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 533-541Google Scholar). However, a comprehensive picture of how mDia influences cellular morphology and how it interacts with other components downstream of Rho has not been totally clear.A Rho/ROCK pathway is known to be involved in the negative regulation of axon outgrowth in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (13Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that mDia caused neurite extension and multibranching in cerebellar granule neurons in the pathway distinct from that of Rho/ROCK. This represents the first description of positive effects of mDia on neurite extension and multibranching and suggests that mDia and ROCK might regulate the axon outgrowth in balance in the downstream of Rho activation.The data presented here clearly demonstrate that mDia can localize to the nucleus, bind directly to Pax6, and alter the expression level and localization pattern of Pax6 in heterologous expression systems. Moreover, some of these mDia effects were also observed in native neurons. These findings represent the first example of Pax6 binding to an FH2 domain in mammalian cells.Pax6 is thought to participate in neuronal differentiation and migration, a conclusion drawn largely from morphological analyses ofSye mice or rats (9Engelkamp D. Rashbass P. Seawright A. van Heyningen V. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3585-3596Google Scholar, 14Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi M. Kengaku M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3133-3144Google Scholar) and reported defects in specification of hindbrain motor neuron subtypes (7Takahashi M. Osumi N. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1327-1338Google Scholar, 30Osumi N. Hirota A. Ohuchi H. Nakafuku M. Iimura T. Kuratani S. Fujiwara M. Noji S. Eto K. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2961-2972Google Scholar). Rho plays an important role in cell migration in non-neuronal cells (31Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Google Scholar), and mDia, a protein downstream of Rho, interacts with Src, which in turn has been reported to be involved in the turnover of focal adhesions in cooporation with focal adhesion kinase (32Horwitz A.F. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Google Scholar). These facts, together with our studies, suggest that mDia, too, might play a role in neurite outgrowth and cell migration by inhibiting the Pax6-dependent transcriptional regulation of molecules such as F-actin, microtuble, cadherin, and other guidance cues. The neurite multibranching and lamellipodia-like neurites observed in cerebellar granule cells of Sey rat (14Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi M. Kengaku M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3133-3144Google Scholar) and mDia-induced neurite changes might share similar origins. Rho GTPases (Rac and Cdc42) have been shown to be involved in neuronal growth cone morphology, neurite extension, and axonal pathfinding during early central nervous system development (33Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Google Scholar, 34Dickson B.J. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rho kinase causes neurite contraction. This apparent importance of Rho GTPases to the morphology of neurites is consistent with the proposed effects of mDia, which might act to some extent through its interaction with Pax6. However, our data did not exclude the possibility that mDia alone can cause neurite extension and morphological changes. Examining the effects of mDia on the neurons lacking Pax6 expression could provide more information about the role of mDia and its interaction with Rho GTPases. mDia (a mammalian homologue of Drosophila diaphanous) is a target of the small GTPase, Rho (1Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Google Scholar), and belongs to the formin homology (FH) 1The abbreviations used are: FH, formin homology; Sey , small eyes; GST, glutathioneS-transferase 1The abbreviations used are: FH, formin homology; Sey , small eyes; GST, glutathioneS-transferaseprotein family (2Wasserman S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 111-115Google Scholar), which is required for cytokinesis. As a Rho partner, mDia has important roles in stress fiber formation, focal adhesion formation, and cell movement (3Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Google Scholar, 4Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Google Scholar). Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we recently identified a novel mDia-interacting protein (5Satoh S. Tominaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39290-39294Google Scholar). We also identified a previously described protein, Pax6, as an mDia partner, using full-length mDia2 or truncated mDia2 (dominant active) as bait. Pax6 is a transcription factor containing two DNA binding domains, a paired domain and a homeodomain, that play important roles in the developing central nervous system (6Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Google Scholar, 7Takahashi M. Osumi N. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1327-1338Google Scholar, 8Heins N. Malatesta P. Cecconi F. Nakafuku M. Tucker K.L. Hack M.A. Chapouton P. Barde Y.A. Gotz M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 308-315Google Scholar), especially in the cerebellum (9Engelkamp D. Rashbass P. Seawright A. van Heyningen V. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3585-3596Google Scholar) and eyes (10Ashery-Padan A. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 706-714Google Scholar). At these locations, Pax6, like Rho and mDia (11Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Google Scholar), is crucial for normal cell migration (9Engelkamp D. Rashbass P. Seawright A. van Heyningen V. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3585-3596Google Scholar, 10Ashery-Padan A. Gruss P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 706-714Google Scholar). Mice or rats in which one copy of the Pax6 gene has been mutated exhibit small eyes (Sey) (12Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L.M. Ton C.C.T. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V. Nature. 1991; 354: 522-525Google Scholar). Both Rho and another of its downstream targets, p160ROCK (Rho kinase), have been proposed to negatively regulate the early steps of axon outgrowth in cultured cerebellar granule neurons (13Bito H. Furuyashiki T. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Neuron. 2000; 26: 431-441Google Scholar). In the same system, it has been reported that Pax6 participates in the regulation of granule cell polarization independent of the Rho/ROCK pathway (14Yamasaki T. Kawaji K. Ono K. Bito H. Hirano T. Osumi M. Kengaku M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3133-3144Google Scholar). Moreover, we have reported that signaling downstream of mDia is distinct from that downstream of ROCK and that the effects of mDia depend on the activity of Src-tyrosine kinase, which is known to promote neurite extension (15Ignelzi M.A. Miller D.R. Soriano P. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Google Scholar) and neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum and other brain regions (16Ingraham C.A. Cox M.E. Ward D.C. Fults D.W. Maness P.F. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1989; 10: 1-14Google Scholar). These findings led us to consider the possibility that the effects of mDia/Pax6 on neurite extension are distinct from those of Rho/ROCK (17Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 18Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Google Scholar). In fact, opposing effects between ROCK and mDia on the maintenance of adherens junctions have been reported very recently (19Sahai E. Marshall C.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 409-415Google Scholar). Here, we report that mDia enters the nucleus, binds to Pax6, and decreases Pax6 transcriptional activity in non-neuronal cells. In cerebellar granule cells, mDia also alters Pax6 subcellular distribution and enhances neurite branching and length. RESULTSA mouse homologue of formin has been reported to be localized in the nucleus (23Chan D.C. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23472-23477Google Scholar), and inspection of the mDia protein sequence revealed a putative nuclear localization signal. We therefore examined whether mDia could enter the nucleus by using leptomycin B (24Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.R. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Google Scholar), an inhibitor of nuclear pore component, exportin. As shown in Fig.1 A, treatment of transfected NIH3T3 cells with leptomycin B caused GFP-mDia2 to change its localization from a diffuse pattern to an exclusively nuclear pattern. We also observed that while Pax6 was located exclusively in the nucleus when expressed in HeLa or NIH3T3 cells, co-expression of mDia and Pax6 resulted in a mixed, nuclear and cytosolic Pax6 immunostaining pattern (Fig. 1 B). Such a cytosolic Pax6 immunostaining was never observed in cells expressing Pax6 with mDia lacking an N terminus (data not shown). These findings prompted us to examine the in vivo interaction of mDia and Pax6 using a Dual-Luciferase Assay System (Fig. 1 C). Pax6, expressed as a GAL4 fusion protein, directed the strong expression of luciferase from a Gal4-dependent reporter constr"

https://openalex.org/W1552832170,"The α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>integrin plays an important role in leukocyte biology through its interactions with a diverse set of ligands. Efficient ligand binding requires the involvement of both the α<sub>M</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> subunits. Past ligand binding studies have focused mainly on the α<sub>M</sub> subunit, with the β<sub>2</sub>subunit being largely unexplored. Therefore, in this study we conducted homolog-scanning mutagenesis on the I-domain (residues 125–385) within the β<sub>2</sub> subunit. We identified four noncontiguous sequences (Arg<sup>144</sup>–Lys<sup>148</sup>, Gln<sup>199</sup>–Ala<sup>203</sup>, Leu<sup>225</sup>–Leu<sup>230</sup>, and Gly<sup>305</sup>–His<sup>309</sup>) that are critical for fibrinogen and C3bi binding to α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>. Molecular modeling revealed that these four sequences reside within a narrow region on the surface of the β<sub>2</sub>I-domain, in close proximity to three potential cation-binding sites. Among these sequences, Gln<sup>199</sup>–Ala<sup>203</sup>, Leu<sup>225</sup>–Leu<sup>230</sup>, and Gly<sup>305</sup>–His<sup>309</sup> are important for the binding of both ligands, whereas Arg<sup>144</sup>–Lys<sup>148</sup> is more critical for fibrinogen than for C3bi binding. These sequences within the β<sub>2</sub>I-domain are directly involved in ligand binding, since 1) switching these segments to their corresponding β<sub>1</sub> sequences destroyed ligand binding; 2) loss of function was not due to a nonspecific gross conformational change, since the defective α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub> mutants reacted well with a panel of conformation-dependent mAbs; 3) mutation of these functional sequences did not effect Ca<sup>2+</sup>binding; and 4) synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences Gln<sup>199</sup>–Ala<sup>203</sup> and Gly<sup>305</sup>–His<sup>309</sup> blocked ligand binding to α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, and the peptides interacted directly with fibrinogen and C3bi.
