Genomic studies of T. urartu have been useful for investigating the structure, function and evolution of polyploid wheat genomes. Here we report the generation of a high-quality genome sequence of T. urartu by combining bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-by-BAC sequencing, single molecule real-time whole-genome shotgun sequencing 3 , linked reads and optical mapping4,5. We assembled seven chromosome-scale pseudomolecules and identified protein-coding genes, and we suggest a model for the evolution of T. urartu chromosomes. Comparative analyses with genomes of other grasses showed gene loss and amplification in the numbers of transposable elements in the T. urartu genome. Population genomics analysis of 147 T. urartu accessions from across the Fertile Crescent showed clustering of three groups, with differences in altitude and biostress, such as powdery mildew disease. The T. urartu genome assembly provides a valuable resource for studying genetic variation in wheat and related grasses, and promises to facilitate the discovery of genes that could be useful for wheat improvement."

https://openalex.org/W2802575142,"Magnetic reconnection in current sheets is a magnetic-to-particle energy conversion process that is fundamental to many space and laboratory plasma systems. In the standard model of reconnection, this process occurs in a minuscule electron-scale diffusion region1,2. On larger scales, ions couple to the newly reconnected magnetic-field lines and are ejected away from the diffusion region in the form of bi-directional ion jets at the ion Alfvén speed3–5. Much of the energy conversion occurs in spatially extended ion exhausts downstream of the diffusion region6. In turbulent plasmas, which contain a large number of small-scale current sheets, reconnection has long been suggested to have a major role in the dissipation of turbulent energy at kinetic scales7–11. However, evidence for reconnection plasma jetting in small-scale turbulent plasmas has so far been lacking. Here we report observations made in Earth’s turbulent magnetosheath region (downstream of the bow shock) of an electron-scale current sheet in which diverging bi-directional super-ion-Alfvénic electron jets, parallel electric fields and enhanced magnetic-to-particle energy conversion were detected. Contrary to the standard model of reconnection, the thin reconnecting current sheet was not embedded in a wider ion-scale current layer and no ion jets were detected. Observations of this and other similar, but unidirectional, electron jet events without signatures of ion reconnection reveal a form of reconnection that can drive turbulent energy transfer and dissipation in electron-scale current sheets without ion coupling. Observations of electron-scale current sheets in Earth’s turbulent magnetosheath reveal electron reconnection without ion coupling, contrary to expectations from the standard model of magnetic reconnection."
https://openalex.org/W2801838590,"Rising non-communicable diseases (NCDs) coupled with increasing injuries have resulted in a significant increase in health spending in India. While out-of-pocket expenditure remains the major source of health care financing in India (two-thirds of the total health spending), the financial burden varies enormously across diseases and by the economic well-being of the households. Though prior studies have examined the variation in disease pattern, little is known about the financial risk to the families by type of diseases in India. In this context, the present study examines disease-specific out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and distress health financing.Unit data from the 71st round of the National Sample Survey Organization (2014) was used for this study. OOPE is defined as health spending on hospitalization net of reimbursement, and CHE is defined as household health spending exceeding 10% of household consumption expenditure. Distress health financing is defined as a situation when a household has to borrow money or sell their property/assets or when it gets contributions from friends/relatives to meet its health care expenses. OOPE was estimated for 16 selected diseases and across three broad categories- communicable diseases, NCDs and injuries. Multivariate logistic regression was used to understand the determinants of distress financing and CHE.Mean OOPE on hospitalization was INR 19,210 and was the highest for cancer (INR 57,232) followed by heart diseases (INR 40,947). About 28% of the households incurred CHE and faced distress financing. Among all the diseases, cancer caused the highest CHE (79%) and distress financing (43%). More than one-third of the inpatients reported distressed financing for heart diseases, neurological disorders, genito urinary problems, musculoskeletal diseases, gastro-intestinal problems and injuries. The likelihood of incurring distress financing was 3.2 times higher for those hospitalized for cancer (OR 3.23; 95% CI: 2.62-3.99) and 2.6 times for tuberculosis patients (OR 2.61; 95% CI: 2.06-3.31). A large proportion of households who had reported distress financing also incurred CHE.Free treatment for cancer and heart diseases is recommended for the vulnerable sections of the society. Risk-pooling and social security mechanisms based on contributions from both households as well as the central and state governments can reduce the financial burden of diseases and avert households from distress health financing."
https://openalex.org/W3124695330,"A Bell test is a randomized trial that compares experimental observations against the philosophical worldview of local realism. A Bell test requires spatially distributed entanglement, fast and high-efficiency detection and unpredictable measurement settings. Although technology can satisfy the first two of these requirements, the use of physical devices to choose settings in a Bell test involves making assumptions about the physics that one aims to test. Bell himself noted this weakness in using physical setting choices and argued that human `free will' could be used rigorously to ensure unpredictability in Bell tests. Here we report a set of local-realism tests using human choices, which avoids assumptions about predictability in physics. We recruited about 100,000 human participants to play an online video game that incentivizes fast, sustained input of unpredictable selections and illustrates Bell-test methodology. The participants generated 97,347,490 binary choices, which were directed via a scalable web platform to 12 laboratories on five continents, where 13 experiments tested local realism using photons, single atoms, atomic ensembles, and superconducting devices. Over a 12-hour period on 30 November 2016, participants worldwide provided a sustained data flow of over 1,000 bits per second to the experiments, which used different human-generated data to choose each measurement setting. The observed correlations strongly contradict local realism and other realistic positions in bipartite and tripartite scenarios. Project outcomes include closing the `freedom-of-choice loophole' (the possibility that the setting choices are influenced by `hidden variables' to correlate with the particle properties), the utilization of video-game methods for rapid collection of human generated randomness, and the use of networking techniques for global participation in experimental science."

https://openalex.org/W3102103163,"The fields of particle and nuclear physics have undertaken extensive programs to search for evidence of physics beyond that explained by current theories. The observation of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider completed the set of particles predicted by the Standard Model (SM), currently the best description of fundamental particles and forces. However, the theory's limitations include a failure to predict fundamental parameters and the inability to account for dark matter/energy, gravity, and the matter-antimater asymmetry in the universe, among other phenomena. Given the lack of additional particles found so far through direct searches in the post-Higgs era, indirect searches utilizing precise measurements of well predicted SM observables allow highly targeted alternative tests for physics beyond the SM. Indirect searches have the potential to reach mass/energy scales beyond those directly accessible by today's high-energy accelerators. The value of the weak charge of the proton Q_W^p is an example of such an indirect search, as it sets the strength of the proton's interaction with particles via the well-predicted neutral electroweak force. Parity violation (invariance under spatial inversion (x,y,z) -> (-x,-y,-z)) is violated only in the weak interaction, thus providing a unique tool to isolate the weak interaction in order to measure the proton's weak charge. Here we report Q_W^p=0.0719+-0.0045, as extracted from our measured parity-violating (PV) polarized electron-proton scattering asymmetry, A_ep=-226.5+-9.3 ppb. Our value of Q_W^p is in excellent agreement with the SM, and sets multi-TeV-scale constraints on any semi-leptonic PV physics not described within the SM."

https://openalex.org/W2799531502,"The transcriptional programs that establish neuronal identity evolved to produce the rich diversity of neuronal cell types that arise sequentially during development. Remarkably, transient expression of certain transcription factors can also endow non-neural cells with neuronal properties. The relationship between reprogramming factors and the transcriptional networks that produce neuronal identity and diversity remains largely unknown. Here, from a screen of 598 pairs of transcription factors, we identify 76 pairs of transcription factors that induce mouse fibroblasts to differentiate into cells with neuronal features. By comparing the transcriptomes of these induced neuronal cells (iN cells) with those of endogenous neurons, we define a ‘core’ cell-autonomous neuronal signature. The iN cells also exhibit diversity; each transcription factor pair produces iN cells with unique transcriptional patterns that can predict their pharmacological responses. By linking distinct transcription factor input ‘codes’ to defined transcriptional outputs, this study delineates cell-autonomous features of neuronal identity and diversity and expands the reprogramming toolbox to facilitate engineering of induced neurons with desired patterns of gene expression and related functional properties. A screen in which combinatorial pairs of transcription factors are exogenously expressed in fibroblasts identifies different combinations that reprogram these cells into induced neuronal cells with diverse functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2800055208,"Global transport of organisms by humans provides novel resources to wild species, which often respond maladaptively. Native herbivorous insects have been killed feeding on toxic exotic plants, which acted as 'ecological traps'1-4. We document a novel 'eco-evolutionary trap' stemming from the opposite effect; that is, high fitness on an exotic resource despite lack of adaptation to it. Plantago lanceolata was introduced to western North America by cattle-ranching. Feeding on this exotic plant released a large, isolated population of the native butterfly Euphydryas editha from a longstanding trade-off between maternal fecundity and offspring mortality. Because of this release-and despite a reduced insect developmental rate when feeding on this exotic-Plantago immediately supported higher larval survival than did the insects' traditional host, Collinsia parviflora 5 . Previous work from the 1980s documented an evolving preference for Plantago by ovipositing adults 6 . We predicted that if this trend continued the insects could endanger themselves, because the availability of Plantago to butterflies is controlled by humans, who change land management practices faster than butterflies evolve 6 . Here we report the fulfilment of this prediction. The butterflies abandoned Collinsia and evolved total dependence on Plantago. The trap was set. In 2005, humans withdrew their cattle, springing the trap. Grasses grew around the Plantago, cooling the thermophilic insects, which then went extinct. This local extinction could have been prevented if the population had retained partial use of Collinsia, which occupied drier microhabitats unaffected by cattle removal. The flush of grasses abated quickly, rendering the meadow once again suitable for Euphydryas feeding on either host, but no butterflies were observed from 2008 to 2012. In 2013-2014, the site was naturally recolonized by Euphydryas feeding exclusively on Collinsia, returning the system to its starting point and setting the stage for a repeat of the anthropogenic evolutionary cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2800273734,"Detection and monitoring are the first essential step for effective management of sheath blight (ShB), a major disease in rice worldwide. Unmanned aerial systems have a high potential of being utilized to improve this detection process since they can reduce the time needed for scouting for the disease at a field scale, and are affordable and user-friendly in operation. In this study, a commercialized quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped with digital and multispectral cameras, was used to capture imagery data of research plots with 67 rice cultivars and elite lines. Collected imagery data were then processed and analyzed to characterize the development of ShB and quantify different levels of the disease in the field. Through color features extraction and color space transformation of images, it was found that the color transformation could qualitatively detect the infected areas of ShB in the field plots. However, it was less effective to detect different levels of the disease. Five vegetation indices were then calculated from the multispectral images, and ground truths of disease severity and GreenSeeker measured NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were collected. The results of relationship analyses indicate that there was a strong correlation between ground-measured NDVIs and image-extracted NDVIs with the R2 of 0.907 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0854, and a good correlation between image-extracted NDVIs and disease severity with the R2 of 0.627 and the RMSE of 0.0852. Use of image-based NDVIs extracted from multispectral images could quantify different levels of ShB in the field plots with an accuracy of 63%. These results demonstrate that a customer-grade UAV integrated with digital and multispectral cameras can be an effective tool to detect the ShB disease at a field scale."

https://openalex.org/W2802322159,"Computer assisted technologies based on algorithmic software segmentation are an increasing topic of interest in complex surgical cases. However - due to functional instability, time consuming software processes, personnel resources or licensed-based financial costs many segmentation processes are often outsourced from clinical centers to third parties and the industry. Therefore, the aim of this trial was to assess the practical feasibility of an easy available, functional stable and licensed-free segmentation approach to be used in the clinical practice. In this retrospective, randomized, controlled trail the accuracy and accordance of the open-source based segmentation algorithm GrowCut (GC) was assessed through the comparison to the manually generated ground truth of the same anatomy using 10 CT lower jaw data-sets from the clinical routine. Assessment parameters were the segmentation time, the volume, the voxel number, the Dice Score (DSC) and the Hausdorff distance (HD). Overall segmentation times were about one minute. Mean DSC values of over 85% and HD below 33.5 voxel could be achieved. Statistical differences between the assessment parameters were not significant (p<0.05) and correlation coefficients were close to the value one (r > 0.94). Complete functional stable and time saving segmentations with high accuracy and high positive correlation could be performed by the presented interactive open-source based approach. In the cranio-maxillofacial complex the used method could represent an algorithmic alternative for image-based segmentation in the clinical practice for e.g. surgical treatment planning or visualization of postoperative results and offers several advantages. Systematic comparisons to other segmentation approaches or with a greater data amount are areas of future works."
https://openalex.org/W2802466942,"Understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of species assemblages is a main challenge in ecology. The mechanisms that shape species assemblages and their temporal fluctuations along tropical elevational gradients are particularly poorly understood. Here, we examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of bird assemblages along an elevational gradient in Ecuador. We conducted bird point counts at three elevations (1000, 2000 and 3000 m) on 18 1-ha plots and repeated the sampling eight times over two years (216 hours in total). For each plot, we obtained data of monthly temperatures and precipitation and recorded the overall resource availability (i.e., the sum of flower, fruit, and invertebrate resources). As expected, bird richness decreased from low to high elevations. Moreover, we found a significant decrease in bird abundance and richness and an increase in evenness between the most and least humid season at each of the three elevations. Climatic factors were more closely related to these temporal fluctuations than local resource availability. While temperature had significant positive effects on the abundance of birds at mid and high elevations, precipitation negatively affected bird abundance at low and mid elevations. Our study highlights that bird assemblages along tropical elevational gradients can show pronounced seasonal fluctuations. In particular, low temperatures and high precipitation seem to impose important constraints on birds. We conclude that potential changes in climate, due to global warming, are likely to affect the spatio-temporal dynamics of bird assemblages along tropical elevational gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2801181686,"Lysosomal accumulation of undegraded materials is a common feature of lysosomal storage diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and the aging process. To better understand the role of lysosomal storage in the onset of cell damage, we used human fibroblasts loaded with sucrose as a model of lysosomal accumulation. Sucrose-loaded fibroblasts displayed increased lysosomal biogenesis followed by arrested cell proliferation. Notably, we found that reduced lysosomal catabolism and autophagy impairment led to an increase in sphingolipids ( i.e., sphingomyelin, glucosylceramide, ceramide, and the gangliosides GM3 and GD3), at both intracellular and plasma membrane (PM) levels. In addition, we observed an increase in the lysosomal membrane protein Lamp-1 on the PM of sucrose-loaded fibroblasts and a greater release of the soluble lysosomal protein cathepsin D in their extracellular medium compared with controls. These results indicate increased fusion between lysosomes and the PM, as also suggested by the increased activity of lysosomal glycosphingolipid hydrolases on the PM of sucrose-loaded fibroblasts. The inhibition of β-glucocerebrosidase and nonlysosomal glucosylceramidase, both involved in ceramide production resulting from glycosphingolipid catabolism on the PM, partially restored cell proliferation. Our findings indicate the existence of a new molecular mechanism underlying cell damage triggered by lysosomal impairment.-Samarani, M., Loberto, N., Soldà, G., Straniero, L., Asselta, R., Duga, S., Lunghi, G., Zucca, F.

https://openalex.org/W2801130228,"Chronic active antibody mediated rejection (c-aABMR) is a major cause of long-term kidney allograft loss. It is hypothesized that frequent sub-therapeutic exposure to immunosuppressive drugs, in particular tacrolimus (Tac), is a risk factor for the development of c-aABMR. The intra-patient variability (IPV) in Tac exposure may serve as a substitute biomarker for underexposure and/or non-adherence. In this study, the association between Tac IPV and the development of c-aABMR was investigated.We retrospectively included 59 patients diagnosed with c-aABMR and compared them to 189 control patients matched for age, year of transplantation and type of kidney donor. The Tac IPV was calculated from pre-dose tacrolimus concentrations measured over a 3 year period preceding the diagnosis of c-aABMR. The mean Tac predose concentrations (C0), Tac IPV, renal allograft function and graft survival were compared between the groups.Tac IPV was 24.4% for the cases versus 23.6% for the controls (p = 0.47). The mean Tac C0 was comparable for the cases (5.8 ng/mL) and control patients (6.1 ng/mL, p = 0.08). Only in the c-aABMR group a significant decline in both mean Tac C0 and allograft function over the timespan of 3 years was observed (p = 0.03 and p<0.001). Additionally, in the group of c-aABMR patients a high IPV was associated with inferior graft survival (p = 0.03).A high Tac IPV per se does not predispose to the development of c-aABMR but is associated with inferior graft survival once c-aABMR is diagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2802502141,"The human body represents a notable example of ciliary diversification. Extending from the surface of most cells, cilia accomplish a diverse set of tasks. Predictably, mutations in ciliary genes cause a wide range of human diseases such as male infertility and blindness. In Caenorhabditis elegans sensory cilia, this functional diversity appears to be traceable to the differential regulation of the kinesin-2-powered intraflagellar-transport (IFT) machinery. Here we reconstituted the first, to our knowledge, functional multi-component IFT complex that is deployed in the sensory cilia of C. elegans. Our bottom-up approach revealed the molecular basis of specific motor recruitment to the IFT trains. We identified the key component that incorporates homodimeric kinesin-2 into its physiologically relevant context, which in turn allosterically activates the motor for efficient transport. These results will enable the molecular delineation of IFT regulation, which has eluded understanding since its discovery more than two decades ago."

https://openalex.org/W2800995193,"Accurate estimation of the neural activity underlying magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals requires co-registration i.e., determination of the position and orientation of the sensors with respect to the head. In modern MEG systems, an array of hundreds of low-Tc SQUID sensors is used to localize a set of small, magnetic dipole-like (head-position indicator, HPI) coils that are attached to the subject’s head. With accurate prior knowledge of the positions and orientations of the sensors with respect to one another, the HPI coils can be localized with high precision, and thereby the positions of the sensors in relation to the head. With advances in magnetic field sensing technologies, e.g., high-Tc SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers (OPM), that require less extreme operating temperatures than low-Tc SQUID sensors, on-scalp MEG is on the horizon. To utilize the full potential of on-scalp MEG, flexible sensor arrays are preferable. Conventional co-registration is impractical for such systems as the relative positions and orientations of the sensors to each other are subject-specific and hence not known a priori. Herein, we present a method for co-registration of on-scalp MEG sensors. We propose to invert the conventional co-registration approach and localize the sensors relative to an array of HPI coils on the subject’s head. We show that given accurate prior knowledge of the positions of the HPI coils with respect to one another, the sensors can be localized with high precision. We simulated our method with realistic parameters and layouts for sensor and coil arrays. Results indicate co-registration is possible with sub-millimeter accuracy, but the performance strongly depends upon a number of factors. Accurate calibration of the coils and precise determination of the positions and orientations of the coils with respect to one another are crucial. Finally, we propose methods to tackle practical challenges to further improve the method."
https://openalex.org/W2801461554,"Background Progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been explained by genomic abnormalities along with the adenoma-carcinoma sequence theory (ACS). The aim of our study is to elucidate whether the promoter DNA methylation of the cancer-specific methylation gene, cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1), contributes to the carcinogenic process in CRC. Methods The study group comprised 107 patients with CRC who underwent surgical resection and 90 adenomas treated with endoscopic resection in the Kitasato University Hospital in 2000. We analyzed the extent of methylation in each tissue using quantitative TaqMan methylation-specific PCR for CDO1. Results The methylation level increased along with the ACS process (p < 0.0001), and statistically significant differences were found between normal-appearing mucosa (NAM) and low-grade adenoma (p < 0.0001), and between low-grade adenoma and high-grade adenoma (p = 0.01), but not between high-grade adenoma and cancer with no liver metastasis. Furthermore, primary CRC cancers with liver metastasis harbored significantly higher methylation of CDO1 than those without liver metastasis (p = 0.02). As a result, the area under the curve by CDO1 promoter methylation was 0.96, 0.80, and 0.67 to discriminate cancer from NAM, low-grade adenoma from NAM, and low-grade adenoma from high-grade adenoma, respectively. Conclusions CDO1 methylation accumulates during the ACS process, and consistently contributes to CRC progression."

Quantifying variation at the single cell and colony level improves our ability to understand dynamics in natural communities. Automated high-frequency monitoring of these communities is presently limited by the absence of repeatable, rapid protocols to analyse SFCM datasets, where images of individual particles are not available. Here we demonstrate a repeatable, semi-automated method to (1) rapidly clean SFCM data from a phytoplankton community by removing signals that do not belong to live phytoplankton cells, (2) classify individual cells into trait clusters that correspond to functional groups, and (3) quantify the biovolumes of individual cells, the total biovolume of the whole community and the total biovolumes of the major functional groups. Our method involves the development of training datasets using lab cultures, the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify trait clusters, and machine learning tools (random forests) to (1) evaluate variable importance, (2) classify data points, and (3) estimate biovolumes of individual cells. We provide example datasets and R code for our analytical approach that can be adapted for analysis of datasets from other flow cytometers or scanning flow cytometers."

B. burgdorferi is a spirochetal bacterium that causes Lyme disease while protozoan pathogens belonging to Babesia species are responsible for babesiosis. Currently used serological tests do not always detect acute Lyme disease or babesiosis, and fail to differentiate cured patients from those who get re-infected. This is a major problem for proper diagnosis particularly in regions endemic for tick-borne diseases. Microscopy based evaluation of babesiosis is confirmatory but is labor intensive and insensitive such that many asymptomatic patients remain undetected and donate blood resulting in transfusion transmitted babesiosis.We conducted multiplex qPCR for simultaneous diagnosis of active Lyme disease and babesiosis in 192 blood samples collected from a region endemic for both diseases. We document qPCR results obtained from testing of each sample three times to detect infection with each pathogen separately or together. Results for Lyme disease by qPCR were also compared with serological tests currently used for Lyme disease when available. Considering at least two out of three test results for consistency, 18.2% of patients tested positive for Lyme disease, 18.7% for co-infection with B. burgdorferi and B. microti and 6.3% showed only babesiosis.With an 80% sensitivity for detection of Lyme disease, and ability to detect co-infection with B. microti, multiplex qPCR can be employed for diagnosis of these diseases to start appropriate treatment in a timely manner."
https://openalex.org/W2800903243,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1) is known to be crucial to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Recently, CEACAM1 deficiency was shown to result in the formation of aortic plaque-like lesions, indicating a role for CEACAM1 in adult vessels as well. The underlying mechanisms remained largely elusive. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the role of CEACAM1 in endothelial homeostasis. Here, we show that CEACAM1 deficiency causes subcellular eNOS redistribution in endothelial cells (i.e., by eNOS depalmitoylation) and alters endothelial glycocalyx that confers antiadhesive properties to the endothelium (i.e., by repression of glycocalyx-degrading enzymes). Accordingly, our analysis revealed an increased leukocyte-endothelial interaction in CEACAM1-deficient endothelium. In addition, CEACAM1 age dependently modulated basal and TNF-α-mediated endothelial barrier (EB) leakiness. In younger mice, CEACAM1 was protective for EB, whereas in aged mice it promoted EB leakiness. EB function depends on interendothelial adherence junctions formed by β-catenin/vascular endothelial-cadherin complexes. We show here that CEACAM1 influenced basal and TNF-α-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin and caveolin-1, which are essential players in EB modulation. Both increased adhesiveness to leukocytes and EB modulation due to CEACAM1 deficiency may facilitate inflammatory cell transmigration into the vascular wall and subsequent plaque formation.

https://openalex.org/W2799393161,"Drug resistant tuberculosis is increasing world-wide. Resistance against isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), or both (multi-drug resistant TB, MDR-TB) is of particular concern, since INH and RIF form part of the standard regimen for TB disease. While it is known that suboptimal treatment can lead to resistance, it remains unclear how host immune responses and antibiotic dynamics within granulomas (sites of infection) affect emergence and selection of drug-resistant bacteria. We take a systems pharmacology approach to explore resistance dynamics within granulomas. We integrate spatio-temporal host immunity, INH and RIF dynamics, and bacterial dynamics (including fitness costs and compensatory mutations) in a computational framework. We simulate resistance emergence in the absence of treatment, as well as resistance selection during INH and/or RIF treatment. There are four main findings. First, in the absence of treatment, the percentage of granulomas containing resistant bacteria mirrors the non-monotonic bacterial dynamics within granulomas. Second, drug-resistant bacteria are less frequently found in non-replicating states in caseum, compared to drug-sensitive bacteria. Third, due to a steeper dose response curve and faster plasma clearance of INH compared to RIF, INH-resistant bacteria have a stronger influence on treatment outcomes than RIF-resistant bacteria. Finally, under combination therapy with INH and RIF, few MDR bacteria are able to significantly affect treatment outcomes. Overall, our approach allows drug-specific prediction of drug resistance emergence and selection in the complex granuloma context. Since our predictions are based on pre-clinical data, our approach can be implemented relatively early in the treatment development process, thereby enabling pro-active rather than reactive responses to emerging drug resistance for new drugs. Furthermore, this quantitative and drug-specific approach can help identify drug-specific properties that influence resistance and use this information to design treatment regimens that minimize resistance selection and expand the useful life-span of new antibiotics."

However, there is dearth of data on the colonization and drug resistance pattern of the main bacterial pathogens in the pharynx of HIV infected children in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the pharyngeal colonization and drug resistance profile of bacterial pathogens in HIV infected children attending ART clinic of Felegehiwot Referral Hospital (FHRH), Amhara Region, Ethiopia.A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2016 to June 2017 at the ART clinic of FHRH. A total of 300 HIV infected children were enrolled in the study. Data on socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants were collected with face-to-face interview and patient-card review using structured questionnaire. Bacterial species were identified using standard bacteriological techniques. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion technique. Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables.The median age of the participants was 11 years. Overall, 153 (51%) of children were colonized by respiratory bacteria in their pharynx. Colonization rate was higher in children from mothers who had attained college and above levels of education than others (P = 0.04). It was also higher in children without the sign of malnutrition than others (P = 0.004). The colonization rate of S.aureus, M.catarrhalis, S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae were 88 (29%), 37 (12.3%), 31 (10.3%) and 6 (2%), respectively. S.aureus-M.catarrhalis concurrent colonization was found in 14 (4.7%) of children. Age (P = 0.03), schooling (P = 0.045) and history of running nose (P = 0.043) were significantly associated with S.aureus colonization. Living in urban setting (P = 0.042) and children from mothers with college and above levels of education (P = 0.002) were significantly associated with M.catarrhalis colonization. Majority of the isolates were resistant to penicillin (68.5%) and cotrimoxazole (52.5%).S.aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin (84.1%) and cotrimoxazole (51.1%).M.catarrhalis isolates were resistant to penicillin (94.6%), erythromycin (86.5%)and cotrimoxazole (78.4%). Overall, 99 (59.3%) of the isolates were multi-drug (MDR) resistant. The overall MDR rates among S.aureus, M.catarrhalis and S.pneumoniae isolates were 65.9%, 78.4% and 22.6%, respectively.Pharyngeal colonization of respiratory bacteria in HIV infected children is a major public health problem. Single and multiple antibiotic resistant is alarmingly high among respiratory colonizers. Therefore, regular screening of HIV infected children for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended to prevent the development of severe opportunistic infections."

The study of the genetic basis of important agronomic traits in rice landraces and identification of genes will facilitate the breed improvement. Gelatinization temperature (GT), gel consistency (GC) and pericarp color (PC) are important indices of rice cooking and eating quality evaluation and potential nutritional importance, which attract wide attentions in the application of genetic and breeding. To dissect the genetic basis of GT, GC and PC, a total of 419 rice landraces core germplasm collections consisting of 330 indica lines, 78 japonica lines and 11 uncertain varieties were planted, collected, then GT, GC, PC were measured for two years, and sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology. In this study, 261,385,070 clean reads and 56,768 polymorphic SLAF tags were obtained, which a total of 211,818 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered. With 208,993 SNPs meeting the criterion of minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.05 and integrity> 0.5, the phylogenetic tree and population structure analysis were performed for all 419 rice landraces, and the whole panel mainly separated into six subpopulations based on population structure analysis. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out for the whole panel, indica subpanel and japonica subpanel with subset SNPs respectively. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 6 for GT was detected in the whole panel and indica subpanel, and one QTL associated with GC was located on chromosome 6 in the whole panel and indica subpanel. For the PC trait, 8 QTLs were detected in the whole panel on chromosome 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11, and 7 QTLs in the indica subpanel on chromosome 3, 4, 7, 8, 10 and 11. For the three traits, no QTL was detected in japonica subpanel, probably because of the polymorphism repartition between the subpanel, or small population size of japonica subpanel. This paper provides new gene resources and insights into the molecular mechanisms of important agricultural trait of rice phenotypic variation and genetic improvement of rice quality variety breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2801902333,"Compliant bamboo poles have long been used for load carriage in Asian cultures. Although this custom differs from Western conventions of rigid body attachments (e.g. backpack), potential benefits include reduced peak shoulder forces as well as metabolic transport cost savings. Evidence that carrying a flexible pole benefits locomotion remains mixed, perhaps in part because the properties of pole design (e.g. bamboo material, structural geometry, etc.) have largely been neglected. These properties influence vibrational forces and consequently, the energy required by the user to manage the oscillations. We collected authentic bamboo poles from northern Vietnam and characterized their design parameters. Four poles were extensively studied in the lab (load-deflection testing, resonance testing, and computed tomography scans of three-dimensional geometry), and 10 others were tested at a rural Vietnamese farm site (basic measures of form and resonance). A mass-spring-damper model was used to characterize a relationship between resonant frequency (which affects the energetics of the pole-carrier system) and pole properties concerning stiffness, damping, etc. Model predictions of resonant frequencies agreed well with empirical data. Although measured properties suggest the poles are not optimally designed to reduce peak oscillation forces, resonant frequencies are within range of a typical human walking cadence, and this is likely to have a consequence on locomotion energetics."
https://openalex.org/W2803071297,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to neovascularization in tumors. However, the relationship of EPCs and tumor-induced angiogenesis still remains to be clarified. The present study aimed at investigating the influence of 4 different tumor types on angiogenic properties of EPCs in an in vitro and in vivo rat model. It could be demonstrated that in vitro proliferation, migration, and angiogenic abilities and genetic modifications of EPCs are controlled in a tumor-type-dependent manner. The proangiogenic effect of mammary carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells was more pronounced compared to colon carcinoma cells. Coinjection of encapsulated tumor cells, especially mammary carcinoma cells, and EPCs in a rat model confirmed a contributing effect of EPCs in tumor vascularization. Cytokines secreted by tumors such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 2, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand play a pivotal role in the tumor cell-EPC interaction, leading to enhanced migration and angiogenesis. With the present study, we were able to decipher possible underlying mechanisms by which EPCs are stimulated by tumor cells and contribute to tumor vascularization. The present study will contribute to a better understanding of tumor-induced vascularization, thus facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies targeting tumor- EPC interactions.—An, R., Schmid, R., Klausing, A., Robering, J.

Several studies have found inequalities associated with oral health and SES. We examined the relationship between tooth loss and SES in Korean adults using data from the 2012-2013 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Methods: A total of 7,005 participants were included in this study. Subjects were divided into two groups depending on their total number of natural teeth: <20 and ≥20. Next, participants were divided into quartiles depending on household income and educational level. Multivariate logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) for remaining teeth according to income and education levels.As income and education levels increased, subjects were more likely to have ≥20 remaining teeth (p-value and p-value for trend <0.001), brush their teeth more than three times per day, use extra oral products, and have regular oral-health checkups (all p<0.001). The odds of having ≥20 remaining teeth increased with increases in income and education, after adjusting for all covariates (OR = 1.493 for income Q3, OR = 1.571 for income Q4; OR = 1.763 for 10-12 years education, OR = 2.189 for ≥13years education).Subjects with higher SES had more remaining teeth than subjects with lower SES. Preserving remaining teeth should be encouraged in subjects with low SES by promoting good oral-health behavior and encouraging more oral-health checkups."

The membrane-associated, intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A3 is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer and contributes to cell migration and invasion. To interrogate further the role of PTP4A3 in colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion, we deleted the Ptp4a3 gene from murine colorectal tumor cells. The resulting PTP4A3−/− cells exhibited impaired colony formation, spheroid formation, migration, and adherence compared with the paired PTP4A3fl/fl cells. We replicated these phenotypic changes using the new small-molecule, allosteric PTP4A3 inhibitor JMS-053. A related structure, JMS-038, which lacked phosphatase inhibition, displayed no cellular activity. Reduction in cell viability and colony formation by JMS-053 occurred in both mouse and human colorectal cell lines and required PTP4A3 expression. Ptp4a3 deletion increased the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and adhesion genes, including the tumor suppressor Emilin 1. JMS- 053 also increased Emilin 1 gene expression. Moreover, The Cancer Genome Atlas genomic database revealed human colorectal tumors with high Ptp4a3 expression had low Emilin 1 expression. These chemical and biologic reagents reveal a previously unknown communication between the intracellular PTP4A3 phosphatase and the ECM and support efforts to pharmacologically target PTP4A3.—McQueeney, K.

https://openalex.org/W2800209867,"Several studies have suggested that signals emerging from white adipose tissue can contribute to the control of longevity. In turn, aging is associated with perturbed regulation and partitioning of fat depots and insulin resistance. However, the exact mechanisms involved in these relationships remain undetermined. Using RAP-PCR on adipose tissue of young and old male mice coupled with qPCR validation, we have uncovered the long non-coding RNA Malat1 as a gene robustly downregulated in visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) during normal aging in male mice and men. Reductions in Malat1 expression in subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) were also observed in genetic (ob and db) as well as diet-induced models of obesity. Based on these findings, Malat1+/+ and Malat1-/- mouse littermates were thus probed to detect whether loss of Malat1 would impact age or diet-induced gain in fat mass and development of glucose intolerance. Contrary to this hypothesis, male and female Malat1-deficient mice gained as much weight, and developed insulin resistance to a similar extent as their Malat1+/+ littermates when studied up to eight months old on regular chow or a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. Moreover, we observed no marked difference in oxygen consumption, food intake, or lipid profiles between Malat1+/+ and Malat1-/- mice. Therefore, we conclude that the overall metabolic impact of the absence of Malat1 on adipose tissue accretion and glucose intolerance is either physiologically not relevant upon aging and obesity, or that it is masked by as yet unknown compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2800101573,"Automatic and accurate detection of positive and negative nuclei from images of immunostained tissue biopsies is critical to the success of digital pathology. The evaluation of most nuclei detection algorithms relies on manually generated ground truth prepared by pathologists, which is unfortunately time-consuming and suffers from inter-pathologist variability. In this work, we developed a digital immunohistochemistry (IHC) phantom that can be used for evaluating computer algorithms for enumeration of IHC positive cells. Our phantom development consists of two main steps, 1) extraction of the individual as well as nuclei clumps of both positive and negative nuclei from real WSI images, and 2) systematic placement of the extracted nuclei clumps on an image canvas. The resulting images are visually similar to the original tissue images. We created a set of 42 images with different concentrations of positive and negative nuclei. These images were evaluated by four board certified pathologists in the task of estimating the ratio of positive to total number of nuclei. The resulting concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) between the pathologist and the true ratio range from 0.86 to 0.95 (point estimates). The same ratio was also computed by an automated computer algorithm, which yielded a CCC value of 0.99. Reading the phantom data with known ground truth, the human readers show substantial variability and lower average performance than the computer algorithm in terms of CCC. This shows the limitation of using a human reader panel to establish a reference standard for the evaluation of computer algorithms, thereby highlighting the usefulness of the phantom developed in this work. Using our phantom images, we further developed a function that can approximate the true ratio from the area of the positive and negative nuclei, hence avoiding the need to detect individual nuclei. The predicted ratios of 10 held-out images using the function (trained on 32 images) are within ±2.68% of the true ratio. Moreover, we also report the evaluation of a computerized image analysis method on the synthetic tissue dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2800815191,"It is generally agreed that human influenza virus preferentially binds to α-2,6-linked sialic acid-containing receptors, and mutations that change the binding preference may alter virus infectivity and host tropism. Limited information is available on the glycan-binding specificity of epidemic influenza viruses. In this study, we systemically investigated the glycan-binding preferences of human influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated from 1999 to 2007 in Taiwan using a high-throughput carbohydrate array. The binding patterns of 37 H3N2 viruses were classified into three groups with significant binding-pattern variations. The results showed that the carbohydrate-binding patterns of H3N2 varied over time. A phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin gene also revealed progressive drift year to year. Of note, the viruses that caused large outbreaks in 1999 and 2003 showed glycan-binding preferences to both α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialylated glycans. Twenty amino acid substitutions were identified primarily at antigenic sites that might contribute to H3N2 virus evolution and the change in the glycan-binding patterns. This study provides not only a systematic analysis of the receptor-binding specificity of influenza clinical isolates but also information that could help to monitor the outbreak potential and virus evolution of influenza viruses."

Underpinned by the five-stage framework of Arksey and O’Malley, the scoping study examined peer-reviewed literature published between 2008 and 2017. Nine electronic databases were searched using keywords specific to disability in Rwanda. Data were charted by three reviewers according to pre-determined and emergent categories. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data sources. A total of 60 scholarly articles met the inclusion criteria. Within the research, studies pertaining to the UN CRPD Articles of health, awareness raising, accessibility, and children with disabilities were the most published. The literature identified a movement towards the realization of the rights for persons with disabilities in Rwanda since the country signed the UN CRPD. Despite efforts to meet these rights, discrimination against persons with disabilities still exists and greater investment in the disability sector is needed, particularly for justice, social protection, and mental health services. Given the state of the evidence, concerning research gaps also exist in regards to deinstitutionalization and protection issues (i.e., violence and abuse). This consolidation of evidence may help to inform the decision-making priorities for government and civil society organizations in policy and programming and also direct future research."

Our previous studies have found that mitochondria damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a major role in the SDT-induced apoptosis. This study aimed at investigating the potential involvement of the mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) and ROS in the pro-apoptotic effects of SDT on THP-1 macrophages. THP-1 macrophages were divided into control and SDT groups, and went through pretreatment of the specific TSPO ligand PK11195 and ROS scavengers N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), then compared with groups without pretreatment. Application of PK11195 reduced intracellular accumulation of endogenous PpIX. PK11195 and NAC reduced the generation of intracellular ROS and oxidation of cardiolipin induced by SDT, respectively. PK11195 and NAC also reduced SDT-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss, the translocation of cytochrome c and cell apoptosis. PpIX accumulation, ROS generation and cell apoptosis were also attenuated by siTSPO. Our findings indicate the pivotal role of TSPO and ROS in SDT-induced cardiolipin oxidation, ΔΨm collapse, cytochrome c translocation and apoptosis in THP-1 macrophages."

Reciprocal inhibition is one of the effects of electrical stimulation (ES), and is the automatic antagonist alpha motor neuron inhibition which is evoked by excitation of the agonist muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the influences of ES of the tibialis anterior (TA) on plantar pressure and the GM activity during gait in healthy adults. ES was applied to the TAs of twenty healthy male adults for 30 minutes at the level of intensity that causes a full range of dorsiflexion in the ankle (frequency; 50 Hz, on-time; 10 sec, off-time; 10 sec). Subjects walked 10 meters before and after ES, and we measured the peak plantar pressure (PP), pressure time integral (PTI), and gait parameters by using an F-scan system. The percentage of integrated electromyogram (%IEMG), active time, onset time, peak time, and cessation time of TA and GM were calculated. PP and PTI under the forefoot, rear foot, and total plantar surface significantly decreased after the application of ES. Meanwhile, changes of gait parameters were not observed. %IEMG and the active time of both muscles did not change; however, onset time and peak time of GM became significantly delayed. ES application to the TA delayed the timing of onset and peak in the GM, and caused the decrease of plantar pressure during gait. The present results suggest that ES to the TA could become a new method for the control of plantar pressure via modulation of GM activity during gait."

https://openalex.org/W2802929912,"Morphological transformations in primitive organisms have long been observed; however, its biomechanical roles are largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the structural advantages of dimorphism in Arthrospira platensis, a filamentous multicellular cyanobacterium. We report that helical trichomes, the default shape, have a higher persistence length (Lp), indicating a higher resistance to bending or a large value of flexural rigidity (kf), the product of the local cell stiffness (E) and the moment of inertia of the trichomes’ cross-section (I). Through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), we determined that the E of straight and helical trichomes were the same. In contrast, our computational model shows that I is greatly dependent on helical radii, implying that trichome morphology is the major contributor to kf variation. According to our estimation, increasing the helical radii alone can increase kf by 2 orders of magnitude. We also observe that straight trichomes have improved gliding ability, due to its structure and lower kf. Our study shows that dimorphism provides mechanical adjustability to the organism and may allow it to thrive in different environmental conditions. The higher kf provides helical trichomes a better nutrient uptake through advection in aquatic environments. On the other hand, the lower kf improves the gliding ability of straight trichomes in aquatic environments, enabling it to chemotactically relocate to more favorable territories when it encounters certain environmental stresses. When more optimal conditions are encountered, straight trichomes can revert to their original helical form. Our study is one of the first to highlight the biomechanical role of an overall-shape transformation in cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2799450648,"Dendritic cells (DC) are sentinels of the immune system, alerting and enlisting T cells to clear pathogenic threats. As such, numerous studies have demonstrated their effective uptake and proteolytic activities coupled with antigen processing and presentation functions. Yet, less is known about how these cellular mechanisms change and develop as myeloid cells progress from progenitor cells to more differentiated cell types such as DC. Thus, our study comparatively examined these functions at different stages of myeloid cell development driven by the GM-CSF. To measure these activities at different stages of development, GM-CSF driven bone marrow cells were sorted based on expression of Ly6C, CD115, and CD11c. This strategy enables isolation of cells representing five distinct myeloid cell types: Common Myeloid Progenitor (CMP), Granulocyte/Macrophage Progenitor (GMP), monocytes, monocyte-derived Macrophage/monocyte-derived Dendritic cell Precursors (moMac/moDP), and monocyte-derived DC (moDC). We observed significant differences in the uptake capacity, proteolysis, and antigen processing and presentation functions between these myeloid cell populations. CMP showed minimal uptake capacity with no detectable antigen processing and presenting function. The GMP population showed higher uptake capacity, modest proteolytic activity, and little T cell stimulatory function. In the monocyte population, the uptake capacity reached its peak, yet this cell type had minimal antigen processing and presentation function. Finally, moMac/moDP and moDC had a modestly decreased uptake capacity, high degradative capacity and strong antigen processing and presentation functions. These insights into when antigen processing and presentation function develop in myeloid cells during GM-CSF driven differentiation are crucial to the development of vaccines, allowing targeting of the most qualified cells as an ideal vaccine vehicles."

https://openalex.org/W2803043567,"Background People with HIV are at for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and fatty liver disease, but the role of Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is poorly understood. MetS and fatty liver disease been associated with changes in adiponectin, soluble ST2 (sST2), chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3L1), hyaluronic acid (HA), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) concentrations in HIV-uninfected populations. Protease (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) may contribute to these comorbidities, but the effects of switching from PI- or NNRTI to raltegravir (RAL) on these biomarkers is unknown. Methods Cryopreserved plasma was obtained from a completed, prospective trial of HIV-infected women with central adiposity on NNRTI- or PI-based ART during which they were randomized to remain on their current ART or switch to a RAL based regimen. Biomarker concentrations were quantified using ELISA and Multiplex assays at baseline and 24 weeks after randomization. Wilcoxon-signed rank test evaluated within-group changes, Spearman and linear regression models evaluated correlations between biomarkers and clinical covariates. Results Participants had a median age of 43 years, CD4+ T lymphocyte count 558 cells/mm3 and BMI 32 kg/m2; 35% met criteria for MetS. At baseline, higher adiponectin levels correlated with higher Chi3L1 levels (r = 0.42, p = 0.02), as did declines after 24 weeks (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Changes in sST2 correlated with changes in Chi3L1 (r = 0.43, p = 0.02) and adiponectin (r = 0.40, p = 0.03). Adiponectin and Chi3L1 levels decreased significantly in women switched to RAL vs continue PI/NNRTI. Conclusion In women with HIV and central obesity, the hepatic steatosis/fibrosis marker Chi3L1 and adiponectin decrease in conjunction with sST2 decreases following switch to RAL. Whether switching from NNRTI/PI-based regimens to RAL can improve hepatic steatosis and dysmetabolism requires further study. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00656175"

https://openalex.org/W2801143887,"Background and aims 
Associated with numerous metabolic and behavioral abnormalities, obesity is classified by metrics reliant on body weight (such as body mass index). However, overnutrition is the common cause of obesity, and may independently contribute to these obesity-related abnormalities. Here, we use dietary challenges to parse apart the relative influence of diet and/or energy balance from body weight on various metabolic and behavioral outcomes.


Materials and methods 
Seventy male mice (mus musculus) were subjected to the diet switch feeding paradigm, generating groups with various body weights and energetic imbalances. Spontaneous activity patterns, blood metabolite levels, and unbiased gene expression of the nutrient-sensing ventral hypothalamus (using RNA-sequencing) were measured, and these metrics were compared using standardized multivariate linear regression models.


Results 
Spontaneous activity patterns were negatively related to body weight (p<0.0001) but not diet/energy balance (p = 0.63). Both body weight and diet/energy balance predicted circulating glucose and insulin levels, while body weight alone predicted plasma leptin levels. Regarding gene expression within the ventral hypothalamus, only two genes responded to diet/energy balance (neuropeptide y [npy] and agouti-related peptide [agrp]), while others were related only to body weight.


Conclusions 
Collectively, these results demonstrate that individual components of obesity—specifically obesogenic diets/energy imbalance and elevated body mass—can have independent effects on metabolic and behavioral outcomes. This work highlights the shortcomings of using body mass-based indices to assess metabolic health, and identifies novel associations between blood biomarkers, neural gene expression, and animal behavior following dietary challenges."
