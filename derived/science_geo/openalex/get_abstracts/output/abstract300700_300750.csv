https://openalex.org/W2069496819,"In some calcium carbonate-bearing sandstones from the edge of the continental shelf off the northeast United States, the deltaC(13) range is from -30 and -60 per mil for both aragonite and high-magnesium calcite. The deltaC(13) of co-existing shells of Modiolus sp. is normal (+ 1.7 to -2.7 per mil). The deltaO(18) values of around + 3.5 per mil in all samples suggest deposition at temperatures around 0 degrees C. Quaternary methane oxidized either chemically or microbiologically to carbon dioxide is the probable source of carbon in these carbonates."
https://openalex.org/W2108516891,"By means of photoperiod manipulation, the physiological states of spring and autumn migratory readiness were induced in indigo buntings. The orientational tendencies of these two groups of birds were tested simultaneously in May 1968, under an artificial, spring planetarium sky. Birds in spring condition oriented northward; those in autumnal condition, southward. These results suggest that changes in the internal physiological state of the bird rather than differences in the external stimulus situation are responsible for the seasonal reversal of preferred migration direction in this species."

https://openalex.org/W2071021829,"The uniflagellate aquatic phycomycete Blastocladia ramosa appears to be a facultative anaerobe. Blastocladia pringsheimii requires traces of oxygen. Growth of both species is no greater or only slightly greater at normal atmospheric oxygen pressure than under 0.2 percent oxygen pressure, but their growth is enhanced by the addition of 5 or 20 percent carbon dioxide. The cells of both species lack typical cristate mitochondria and contain only traces of cytochrome. Blastocladia resembles the biflagellate Aqualinderella fermentans in adaptation to an environment poor in oxygen and rich in carbon dioxide."

This system accumulates mass spectra at every point of the gas chromatogram in a permanent form which permits one to observe mass spectra of minor as well as major constituents. One minor component, whose identification was confirmed by synthesis, was 6,10,14-trimethyl-pentadecanoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2095140295,"In July 1965, Mariner 4 flew past
Mars and recorded 20 television pictures
of the martian surface; the principal
television result of that pioneering
flight was the discovery that Mars' surface
is heavily cratered and resembles
the Moon more than it does the Earth
(1). On 31 July 1969, the more advanced
Mariner 6 spacecraft, carrying
two television cameras, passed Mars
and recorded 75 pictures. A twin spacecraft,
Mariner 7, passed Mars on 5
August 1969. This report summarizes
the results of a first, qualitative study
of the Mariner 6 television pictures,
carried out on the uncalibrated data
within a few days after receipt on
Earth."

https://openalex.org/W2070705083,"Single motor units, i.e., anterior horn cells plus the muscle fibers they innervate, have recently been placed under direct observation while responding to a normal reflex stimulus. Details such as the normal rate of discharge, latent period, refractory period, influence of fatigue, etc., have been carefully studied. The work of Denny-Brown, Adrian and Bronk, Eccles and Sherrington have all indicated that the natural rate of discharge of the anterior horn cell is slow, i.e., 5 to 25 per sec., and never more than 80 to 90 per sec. under intense stimulation. A motor unit discharging at 10 per sec. may continue in activity for indefinite periods of time without fatigue. Tonic responses are maintained by such rates of discharge and therefore no special tonic mechanisms need be postulated to explain the absence of fatigue."
