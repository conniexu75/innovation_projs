https://openalex.org/W1574658543,"Expression of the human telomerase catalytic component, hTERT, in normal human somatic cells can reconstitute telomerase activity and extend their replicative lifespan. We report here that at twice the normal number of population doublings, telomerase-expressing human skin fibroblasts (BJ-hTERT) and retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE-hTERT) retain normal growth control in response to serum deprivation, high cell density, G1 or G2 phase blockers and spindle inhibitors. In addition, we observed no cell growth in soft agar and detected no tumour formation in vivo. Thus, we find that telomerase expression in normal cells does not appear to induce changes associated with a malignant phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2126835057,"Several distinct phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) and two cyclooxygenases (COXs) were transfected, alone or in combination, into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and their functional coupling during immediate and delayed prostaglandin (PG)-biosynthetic responses was reconstituted. Signaling PLA2s, i.e. cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (type IV) and two secretory PLA2s (sPLA2), types IIA (sPLA2-IIA) and V (sPLA2-V), promoted arachidonic acid (AA) release from their respective transfectants after stimulation with calcium ionophore or, when bradykinin receptor was cotransfected, with bradykinin, which evoked the immediate response, and interleukin-1 plus serum, which induced the delayed response. Experiments on cells transfected with either COX alone revealed subtle differences between the PG-biosynthetic properties of the two isozymes in that COX-1 and COX-2 were favored over the other in the presence of high and low exogenous AA concentrations, respectively. Moreover, COX-2, but not COX-1, could turn on endogenous AA release, which was inhibited by a cPLA2 inhibitor. When PLA2 and COX were coexpressed, AA released by cPLA2, sPLA2-IIA and sPLA2-V was converted to PGE2 by both COX-1 and COX-2 during the immediate response and predominantly by COX-2 during the delayed response. Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (type VI), which plays a crucial role in phospholipid remodeling, failed to couple with COX-2 during the delayed response, whereas it was linked to ionophore-induced immediate PGE2 generation via COX-1 in marked preference to COX-2. Finally, coculture of PLA2 and COX transfectants revealed that extracellular sPLA2s-IIA and -V, but neither intracellular cPLA2 nor iPLA2, augmented PGE2 generation by neighboring COX-expressing cells, implying that the heparin-binding sPLA2s play a particular role as paracrine amplifiers of the PG-biosynthetic response signal from one cell to another.

The existence of two kinetically distinct PG-biosynthetic responses, the immediate and delayed phases, implies the recruitment of different sets of biosynthetic enzymes to this pathway. Although several works have suggested that preferential coupling between these biosynthetic enzymes accounts for the differential regulation of the immediate and delayed responses, conflicting evidence has been yielded by different experimental systems (4Murakami M.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). A rapidly expanding body of evidence suggests that the two COXs, the constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2, play distinct roles in regulating AA metabolism (3Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Several investigators have proposed that COX-1 and COX-2 respectively metabolize exogenous and endogenous arachidonic acid (AA) to PGs (12Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

This statement, however, is an oversimplification, because in certain situations, COX-1 metabolizes endogenous AA to PGs, e.g. thromboxane generation by platelets (14Langenbach R. Morham S.G.

Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, utilization of COX-1 is observed during the early phase of PG biosynthesis occurring within several minutes of stimulation, whereas COX-2-dependent PG generation proceeds over several hours in parallel with the induction of COX-2 expression (4Murakami M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 473-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Although subtle differences in the subcellular distributions of these two isozymes may be responsible for their separate functions, a recent electron microscopic analysis showed that their locations in the perinuclear and endoplasmic reticular membranes were indistinguishable (16Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singler I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Whether distinct PLA2s are utilized selectively in the different PG-biosynthetic phases and couple specifically with each COX isozyme is controversial. PLA2s are subdivided into several classes, among which cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2; recently called cPLA2α after the recent discovery of two related isozymes cPLA2 β and γ (17Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol.

The increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are prerequisite for cPLA2activation, occur rapidly and are often transient, implying that cPLA2 plays a crucial role in immediate AA release (18Leslie C.C.

Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Evidence is accumulating that cPLA2 is also involved in the delayed response (9Murakami M. Kuwata H. Amakasu Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25999-26005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanism whereby cPLA2 is activated under such a Ca2+-free condition is poorly understood. Some studies showed that sPLA2 couples selectively with COX-1 during the immediate phase (6Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), whereas others demonstrated that sPLA2, particularly type IIA (sPLA2-IIA), functions during the delayed phase, as its expression is often induced markedly in response to proinflammatory stimuli and correlates with ongoing PG biosynthesis (10Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 23Nakazato Y. Simonson M.S. Herman W.H. Konieczkowski M.

Several types of cell express type V sPLA2 (sPLA2-V), which appears to mediate certain phases of PG biosynthesis (26Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) evidence for the involvement of iPLA2 in stimulus-dependent AA release has been reported. The conflicting observations reported so far may be due to the limitations of studies using chemical inhibitors, antibodies, and even antisense oligonucleotides, which often cannot gain access to certain cellular compartments and may cause cross-inhibition or undesirable side effects, thereby leading to misinterpretation. Recently, in an attempt to elucidate the general functions of each PLA2 in AA release, we analyzed the functional effects of transfecting various PLA2 isozymes into mammalian cell lines, such as human embryonic kidney 293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. This approach enabled us to assess the overlapping and different functions of five distinct PLA2s, namely cPLA2, sPLA2s (IIA, IIC, and V), and iPLA2 (32Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that cPLA2 and the two heparin-binding sPLA2s, sPLA2-IIA and sPLA2-V, act as “signaling” PLA2s that promote stimulus-dependent AA release during both the immediate and delayed responses, whereas iPLA2 mediates spontaneous fatty acid release during culture, consistent with its proposed role in “phospholipid remodeling” rather than signaling (30Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In this study, we extended our previous study in order to investigate particular functional cooperation between PLA2 and COX enzymes during different phases of PG biosynthesis by cotransfecting each PLA2 and COX into 293 cells. Reconstitution of the immediate and delayed PGE2 biosynthetic responses of these transfectants confirmed that distinct functional coupling between different PLA2 and COX enzymes occurs during each phase. The cDNAs for mouse cPLA2, mouse sPLA2-IIA, and its mutants (G30S, H48E, and KE4), rat sPLA2-V, rat sPLA2-IIC, and hamster iPLA2 were described previously (32Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T.

A23187 was purchased from Calbiochem. BK was purchased from Sigma. Human and mouse interleukin (IL)-1βs were purchased from Genzyme. LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent, Opti-MEM medium, and Trizol reagent were obtained from Life Technologies. RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Nissui Pharmaceutical. Transformants of 293 cells that stably expressed cPLA2, sPLA2-IIA, sPLA2-V, sPLA2-IIC, and iPLA2 were established as described previously (32Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). COX-1 and COX-2 cDNAs were transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min and then added to cells that had attained 40–60% confluence in 6-well plates (Iwaki) containing 1 ml of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 6 h, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh culture medium comprising RPMI 1640 containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). After overnight culture, the medium was replaced again with 2 ml of fresh medium, and culture was continued at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. For transient expression analysis, the cells were harvested 3 days after transfection and used immediately. In order to establish stable transfectants, cells transfected with each cDNA were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in culture medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). After culture for 2–4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression of each COX was assessed by immunoblotting. The established clones were expanded and used for the experiments as described below. In order to establish PLA2/COX double transformants, 293 transformants expressing each COX were subjected to a second transfection with each PLA2 cDNA, which had been subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) (Invitrogen). Three days after transfection, the cells were used for the experiments or seeded into 96-well plates to be cloned by culture in the presence of 50 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) in order to establish stable transformants overexpressing both PLA2 and COX. The expression of each PLA2 was examined by RNA blotting, and in the case of sPLA2s, by measuring PLA2 activities released into the supernatants. A similar strategy was employed to produce PLA2/BKR double transformants: after the second transfection with cPLA2 or sPLA2-IIA cDNA in pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+), G418-resistant 293 cells stably expressing rat B2-type BKR were selected with zeocin. Cells in 1 ml of culture medium were seeded, at a density of 5 × 104cells/ml, into each well of 24-well plates. After culture for 4 days, the supernatants were collected, and the cells were incubated for a further 15 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of culture medium containing 1m NaCl. This allowed cell surface-associated sPLA2s to be recovered quantitatively from the medium, as described previously (32Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14411-14423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The PLA2 activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of free radiolabeled fatty acids released from the substrates 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NEN Life Science Products) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for sPLA2-V and sPLA2-IIA, respectively. Each reaction mixture consisted of an aliquot of the required sample, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.0 (for sPLA2-V) or 7.4 (for sPLA2-IIA), 4 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 10–30 min at 37 °C, the [14C]fatty acids released were extracted by the method of Dole and Meinertz (40Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was counted. Approximately equal amounts (∼10 μg) of the total RNAs obtained from transfected cells were applied to each lane of 1.2% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore). The resulting blots were then probed with the respective cDNA probes that had been labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming (Takara Shuzo). All hybridizations were carried out as described previously (10Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Cell lysates (105 cell equivalents) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% (w/v) for cPLA2 and 10% for COX-1 and COX-2) under reducing conditions. In order to analyze sPLA2-IIA, the cells were treated for 15 min with culture medium containing 1 m NaCl, and aliquots of the resulting supernatants were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were probed with the respective antibodies and visualized using the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (10Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 104 in 1 ml of culture medium) were seeded into each well of 24-well plates. In order to assess AA release, 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]AA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the cells in each well on day 3, when they had nearly reached confluence, and culture was continued for another day. After three washes with fresh medium, 250 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with or without 10 μm A23187, 10 μm BK, or 1 ng/ml IL-1β and/or 10% FCS was added to each well and the amount of free [3H]AA released into each supernatant during culture (up to 30 min after the addition of A23187 and BK and up to 8 h after IL-1β) was measured. The percentage release of AA was calculated using the formula (S/(S + P)) × 100, where Sand P are the radioactivities measured in equal portions of the supernatant and cell pellet, respectively. The supernatants from replicate cells cultured without added radiolabeled fatty acids were subjected to the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay. Conversion of exogenous AA to PGE2 was determined by treating cells with AA for 30 min and immunoassaying the PGE2 produced. Human COX-1 and COX-2 cDNAs, subcloned into a mammalian expression vector with a neomycin-resistant marker, were individually transfected into 293 and CHO cells to establish stable transformants. Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 proteins was barely detectable in parental 293 cells but was detected clearly in the respective transformants (Fig. 1 A). In order to assess immediate and delayed PGE2 generation from endogenous AA by each COX, we stimulated the transformants with 10 μm A23187 for 30 min and 1 ng/ml IL-1 in the presence of 10% FCS for 4 h, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Whereas treatment of parental 293 cells with A23187 resulted in minimal PGE2 generation, consistent with undetectable expression levels of both COX isozymes (Fig. 1 A), replicate cells expressing COX-1 and COX-2 produced approximately 15 and 35 times more PGE2 in response to A23187 than the control cells (Fig.1 B, top). When COX-2-expressing cells were stimulated with IL-1/FCS, delayed PGE2 generation increased markedly, reaching approximately 14 times the amount generated by the control cells (Fig. 1 B, bottom). In contrast, COX-1-expressing cells produced only minimal amounts of PGE2 that did not differ significantly from the amounts produced by the control cells. To investigate the functional differences between COX-1 and COX-2 further, we measured the COX activities by supplying the transfectants with exogenous AA (Fig. 1 C). In our assay system, COX-1 transfectants produced PGE2 when the exogenous AA concentration exceeded 10 μm, reaching nearly 100 ng of PGE2 in the presence of 50 μm AA, whereas conversion to PGE2 was undetectable when the AA concentration was below 10 μm. COX-2-expressing cells produced substantial amounts of PGE2 even when the AA concentration was below 10 μm. Approximately 20 ng of PGE2 was produced by COX-2-expressing cells treated with 50 μm AA, only 15 the amount produced by COX-1 transfectants. No appreciable conversion of AA to PGE2 by the control cells was observed. Conversion of exogenous AA to PGE2 by cells expressing COX-1 and COX-2 was inhibited by the COX-1-specific inhibitor valeryl salicylate and the COX-2-specific inhibitor NS-398, respectively, but not vice versa (Fig.1 D). Collectively, these data suggest that COX-1 is favored over COX-2 when excess AA is supplied, whereas COX-2 is more active than COX-1 when the supply of AA is limited. We observed that some PGE2 was produced by cells expressing COX-2, but not COX-1, even in the absence of exogenous AA or any extracellular stimulus (Fig. 1, C and E), indicating that COX-2 could utilize endogenous AA in this situation. Interestingly, COX-2-expressing cells not only spontaneously produced more PGE2 but also released more AA than the control cells (Fig. 1 E). This increased AA release induced by COX-2 transfection was significantly suppressed by the cPLA2inhibitor MAFP but not by the iPLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone, the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (Fig. 1 E), or the sPLA2 inhibitor LY311727 (data not shown), whereas PGE2 generation by COX-2 transfectants was suppressed by MAFP and NS-398 but not by bromoenol lactone. Immunoblot analysis revealed a trace amount of cPLA2 (Fig. 1 F) but none of other PLA2s examined in this study (data not shown) in parental 293 cells. These observations suggest that COX-2 can activate AA release mediated by the MAFP-sensitive cPLA2through a mechanism independent of COX activity. In order to verify that the observations described above was also applicable to other cells, we carried out similar experiments using CHO cells transfected with COX-1 and COX-2 (Fig. 1, F andG). CHO cells expressing COX-1 and COX-2 produced 16 and 25 times more PGE2, respectively, than the parental cells during the immediate response to A23187 (Fig. 1 G, left). Significant and comparable increases in PGE2 generation by parental and COX-1-expressing cells after stimulation with IL-1 plus FCS was observed (Fig. 1 G, middle). This increase was suppressed almost completely by NS-398 (data not shown) (32Murakami M. Shimbara S. Kambe T. Kuwata H. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Kudo I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2085155504,"Sperm capacitation in vitro is highly correlated with an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that is regulated by cAMP through a unique mode of signal transduction cross-talk. The activation of this signaling pathway, as well as capacitation, requires bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the incubation medium. BSA is hypothesized to modulate capacitation through its ability to remove cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that the cholesterol-binding heptasaccharides, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and OH-propyl-β-cyclodextrin, promote the release of cholesterol from the mouse sperm plasma membrane in media devoid of BSA. Both of these β-cyclodextrins were also demonstrated to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of BSA in both mouse and bull sperm, and the patterns of phosphorylation were similar to those induced by media containing BSA. The potency of the different β-cyclodextrins to increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm was correlated with their cholesterol binding efficiencies, and preincubation of the β-cyclodextrins with cholesterol- SO4− to saturate their cholesterol-binding sites blocked the ability of these compounds to stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The β-cyclodextrin effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was both NaHCO3 and protein kinase A-dependent. The β-cyclodextrins were also able to capacitate mouse sperm in the absence of BSA, as measured by the ability of the zona pellucida to induce the acrosome reaction and by successful fertilization in vitro. In summary, β-cyclodextrins can completely replace BSA in media to support signal transduction leading to capacitation. These data further support the coupling of cholesterol efflux to the activation of membrane and transmembrane signaling events leading to the activation of a unique signaling pathway involving the cross-talk between cAMP and tyrosine kinase second messenger systems, thus defining a new mode of cellular signal transduction initiated by cholesterol release.

Immediately after ejaculation, mammalian sperm do not possess the ability to fertilize the egg. They acquire the ability to fertilize during transit through the female tract in a poorly understood process known as capacitation (1Austin C.R. Aust. J. Sci.

Capacitation is defined as the time-dependent acquisition of fertilization competence, and is generally assessed as the ability of the acrosome-intact sperm to undergo an acrosome reaction in response to physiological inducers such as the ZP 1The abbreviations used are: ZP, zona pellucida; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PKA, protein kinase A; M-β-CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; 2-OH-p-β-CD, OH-propyl-β-cyclodextrin; PVA, polyvinyl alcohol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP. or progesterone (5Visconti P.E.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Capacitation can be mimicked in vitro by incubating epididymal or ejaculated sperm in a defined medium containing appropriate concentrations of electrolytes, metabolic energy sources, Ca2+, HCO3−, and a protein source (usually bovine serum albumin;BSA) (7Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 3 Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Capacitation has also been correlated with changes in sperm intracellular ion concentrations, metabolism, and motility (7Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 3 Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar, 8Harrison R.A.P. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1996; 8: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Although these changes have been known for many years to accompany this maturational event, the molecular basis underlying these events is poorly understood. Remarkably, capacitation in vitro can occur in the absence of any specific external stimulus, suggesting that specific aspects of the capacitation process can be initiated and controlled intrinsically by the sperm itself, and that certain minimal environmental requirements must be met. This intrinsic nature of the capacitation process is of great interest from a cell regulation standpoint. It is possible that a controlling factor(s) intrinsic to the sperm plasma membrane may regulate changes in the properties of the membrane and that a de-repression of a set of preprogrammed cellular events must ultimately occur to promote the development of the capacitated state. The requirement for BSA in regulating capacitation is thought to be due to its ability to remove cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane (9Suzuki F. Yanagimachi R. Gem. Res. 1989; 23: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Langlais J. Roberts K.D. Gamete Res. 1985; 12: 183-224Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Go K.J. Wolf D.P. Biol.

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1976; 152: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is proposed that cholesterol efflux then leads to changes in membrane architecture and fluidity that give rise to the capacitated state. Cholesterol efflux, therefore, may represent an integral part of this intrinsic regulatory property of sperm to undergo capacitation. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that sperm capacitation in several species is correlated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins (15Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X.P. Gerton G.L. Tesarik J. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Dev.

Our laboratory has determined that both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and capacitation are regulated by cAMP at the level of protein kinase A (PKA), and requires the presence of Ca2+, HCO3−, and BSA in the medium (19Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mode of signal transduction cross-talk is, to date, unique to sperm. Although BSA is believed to be required for capacitation as a consequence of its ability to serve as a cholesterol-binding molecule, it is still not known if the only action of BSA is through the removal of cholesterol. β-Cyclodextrins are cyclic heptasaccharides consisting of β(1–4)-glucopyranose units (20Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These compounds are water-soluble, are able to effectively solubilize non-polar substances, and because of these properties, have been used to deliver hydrophobic drugs (20Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These compounds are also able to promote cholesterol efflux from a variety of somatic cells (21Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol.

These studies also showed that there is an initial rapid efflux of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of mouse L-cells and human fibroblasts in response to β-cyclodextrins (21Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that BSA is acting through the removal of cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane by analyzing if β-cyclodextrins are able to replace BSA in the medium to up-regulate signal transduction pathways leading to protein tyrosine phosphorylation as well as capacitation. We demonstrate that both M-β-CD and 2-OH-p-β-CD promote the release of cholesterol from the mouse sperm plasma membrane in the absence of BSA. Addition of these β-cyclodextrins to the medium also increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of BSA in mouse and bull sperm, and the patterns of phosphorylation were similar to those patterns seen in media containing BSA. These effects of β-cyclodextrins were likely due to their ability to capture cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane. The β-cyclodextrin effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the presence of NaHCO3 in the capacitation medium and the effect was cAMP-dependent. β-Cyclodextrins were also able to capacitate mouse sperm in the absence of BSA, as measured by the ability of the ZP to induce the acrosome reaction and by successful fertilization in vitro. This work is the first to demonstrate that a chemically defined non-protein constituent can substitute in capacitation media for protein cholesterol acceptors. These data further support the idea that cholesterol efflux is, in some way, coupled to the activation of membrane and transmembrane signaling events leading to the activation of a unique cross-talk between cAMP and tyrosine kinase second messenger systems, and thus defines a new mode of cellular signal transduction. 2-OH-propyl-β-cyclodextrin, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and BSA (Fraction V, Sigma) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10) was from UBI, Lake Placid, NY. Solvents were from EM Science (chromatographic grade). Analtech diphasic plates (Unibond RP18/silica gel, 10 × 12 cm, 250 μm thickness) were obtained from Analtech Inc. (Newark, DE). Whatman HP-K silica gel plates (10 × 10 cm, 250 μm thickness) were purchased from Whatman Inc. (Clifton, NJ). The basic medium used for the studies with mouse sperm was a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium (HMB-Hepes buffered), as described by Lee and Storey (23Lee M.A. Storey B.T. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This medium was first prepared in the absence of Ca2+, BSA, and pyruvate, sterilized by passage through a 0.20-μm filter (Nalgene), and frozen at −20 °C in aliquots for single use. Working “complete” media were prepared by adding Ca2+ (1.7 mm), pyruvate (1 mm), and BSA (3 mg/ml), followed by gassing with 5% CO2 in air to pH 7.3. A modified Tyrode's Hepes-buffered medium (SpTALPH) was used for the experiments with bull sperm, as described by Parrish et al.(24Parrish J.J. Susko-Parrish J. Winer M.A. First N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). This medium was modified in the following manner: BSA was replaced by 1 mg/ml polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to reduce the ability of SpTALPH to capacitate sperm (15Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.4 mm EDTA was added. The medium was first prepared in the absence of Ca2+ and pyruvate and frozen at −20 °C in aliquots for single use. Working complete SpTALPH medium was prepared by adding Ca2+ (2 mm), pyruvate (1 mm), NaHCO3 (10 mm), PVA (1 mg/ml), and gentamycin (50 mg/ml). The pH of SpTALPH was adjusted to 7.4 following equilibration for 1 h at 39 °C in room air, and sterilized by passage through a 0.20-μm filter (Nalgene, Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Caudal epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired breeder males by placing one minced cauda epididymis in 0.5 ml of medium HMB without BSA at 30 °C. After 5 min the sperm in suspension were washed in 10 ml of the same medium by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature (24 °C). The sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 5–10 × 106 cells/ml and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. After incubation for 1.5 h, except where indicated, the sperm were concentrated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min (room temperature), the sperm pellet washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged again, and the resultant pellet resuspended in sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) without mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was removed, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v), the samples boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. Ejaculated bovine sperm (Bos taurus, Holstein), collected by artificial vagina, was generously provided by the Hofmann Center at New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (Kennett Square, PA). The sperm were immediately assessed for motility by light microscopy and then, at 10–20 min following collection, were diluted 1:5 into SpTALPH. These samples were then subjected to two washes by centrifugation at 375 × g for 10 min each in SpTALPH to remove seminal plasma, as described previously (17Galantino-Homer H. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24Parrish J.J. Susko-Parrish J. Winer M.A. First N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Sperm were kept at 22–24 °C in SpTALPH following the washes for transport to the laboratory (1–2 h), and then subjected to a final wash in SpTALPH. The concentration of sperm in the SpTALPH solution was determined by hemocytometer and adjusted to 5 × 107cells/ml with SpTALPH before initiating the capacitation experiments. For capacitation, 100-μl aliquots of the sperm suspension (5 × 106 cells), as well as the appropriate test reagents (1–3 μl), were incubated in capped 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes at 39 °C in a Thermolyne 37900 culture as described previously (17Galantino-Homer H. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24Parrish J.J. Susko-Parrish J. Winer M.A. First N.L. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 1171-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Additions to the sperm suspension were made immediately before initiation of the incubation period. Following an incubation period of 4 h, the sperm were concentrated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min at room temperature, washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mmNa3VO4 at room temperature, and the sperm pellet then resuspended in sample buffer (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) without mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After centrifuging at 10,000 × gfor 3 min, the supernatant was removed, boiled in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. For all experiments, sperm from two to three different mature Holstein bulls were assayed to control for individual variation. Mouse sperm (5 × 106) were incubated in 500 μl of capacitation medium in either the absence or presence of 3 mg/ml BSA or with the appropriate β-cyclodextrins for 1.5 h. After this period, each aliquot was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g and cholesterol, desmosterol, and cholesterol-SO4− were measured in the sperm pellet and in the resultant medium supernatant as described previously (26Alvarez J.G. Storey B.T. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 334-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm pellets were extracted with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), vortexed for 10 s, centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant evaporated to dryness under N2. The resultant supernatants following the initial centrifugation were then extracted with 6 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), vortexed for 10 s, centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 s, and the lower organic phase aspirated and evaporated to dryness. Both the sperm pellet and medium supernatant extracts were dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and 4-μl aliquots applied to silver nitrate-impregnated Whatman HP-K silica gel microplates (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) (5 × 5 cm, 250 μm thickness). Aliquots (4 μl) of cholesterol, desmosterol, cholesterol sulfate, and desmosterol (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, were applied on separate lanes as reference standards. The plates were pre-developed in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) to 1 cm from the lower edge of the plate. This pre-development step was used to minimize eddy diffusion which results in band broadening and lower resolution. Following pre-development, the plates were thoroughly dried and then developed in chloroform/acetone (95:5, v/v) in the same dimension. Following development, the plates were thoroughly dried, dipped in a 10% solution of copper sulfate (in 8% phosphoric acid), and placed on a CAMAG Plate Heater III at 185 °C for 5 min. The resulting bands were scanned at 400 nm in the reflectance mode using a Shimadzu CS-9000 spectrodensitometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). The integrated areas obtained for the unknowns were interpolated with the standard curves obtained for cholesterol, desmosterol, and cholesterol sulfate standards, and the values expressed as nanograms/106 cells. SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed in 8 or 10% gels. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon P (Millipore) in all experiments was carried out according to the method of Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) at 70 V (constant) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunodetection was carried out at room temperature as described previously (28Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a monoclonal antibody against anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; UBI) and blots developed using enhanced chemiluminescence detection with an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. As one end point of capacitation, we analyzed the ZP-induced acrosome reaction in mouse sperm, based on the premise that only capacitated sperm would undergo exocytosis in response to ZP. The percentage of acrosome reactions was measured using Coomassie Blue G-250 as described by Thaler and Cardullo (29Thaler C.D. Cardullo R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7788-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm were incubated under the desired experimental conditions for 1.5 h, followed by the addition of 5 ZP/μl, 5 μm A23187, or buffer for an additional 30 min. An equal volume of 2 × fixative solution (7.5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) was then added to each tube. After 10 min, the sperm were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 × g and resuspended in 0.1 mammonium acetate (pH 9). After centrifugation, the sperm pellet was resuspended in 20–50 μl of the same buffer, spread on to poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and air dried. The slides were then stained with 0.04% (w/v) Coomassie Blue G-250 in 3.5% (v/v) perchloric acid for 10 min, gently rinsed with deionized H2O until they appeared blue, air dried, and then mounted with Permount. To calculate the percentage of acrosome reactions, at least 200 sperm were counted per experimental condition. The data presented are the average of at least three different experiments. In vitro fertilization of metaphase II-arrested mouse eggs was performed as described previously (30Moore G.D. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with modifications as described in Visconti et al.(15Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PVA was used to maintain the isotonic conditions when sperm were cultured in media devoid of BSA prior to insemination. When β-cyclodextrins were included in the capacitation media, the medium containing the capacitated sperm were diluted 100-fold prior to insemination of the eggs. β-Cyclodextrins were also present in the insemination media in some of the experiments. All in vitrofertilizations were performed using metaphase-arrested eggs retrieved at approximately 14 h post-human chorionic gonadotropin injection. Phase-contrast optics were used to evaluate fertilization by looking for the presence of the second polar body and the formation of both the male and female pronuclei. Previously, we demonstrated in mouse sperm that both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and capacitation required the presence of BSA in the incubation medium (15Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of BSA in regulating signal transduction leading to capacitation has been postulated to involve the removal of cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane (9Suzuki F. Yanagimachi R. Gem. Res. 1989; 23: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Langlais J. Roberts K.D. Gamete Res. 1985; 12: 183-224Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 11Go K.J. Wolf D.P. Biol.

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1976; 152: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This hypothesis would predict that other cholesterol binding compounds that also remove cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane could substitute for BSA in media to regulate signal transduction leading to capacitation. To test this model we first determined if cholesterol, cholesterol-SO4−, and desmosterol were removed from the sperm plasma membrane by 2-OH-p-β-CD and M-β-CD under our experimental conditions. This was done by directly measuring the cholesterol released into the incubation medium, as well as that remaining associated with the sperm after incubating the sperm in the absence or presence of these compounds. Cauda epididymal sperm were incubated in HMB medium in the absence or presence of 3 mg/ml BSA, 1 and 3 mm 2-OH-p-β-CD, or 1 and 3 mm M-β-CD. As shown in Table I, a majority of the measurable cholesterol, cholesterol-SO4−, and desmosterol remained associated with the sperm following a 1.5-h incubation in media devoid of BSA. This is in contrast to sperm incubated in media containing 3 mg/ml BSA for the same period of time, where a significant release of these sterols into the media was observed. 2-OH-p-β-CD, which is a very effective cholesterol binding heptasaccharide, mediated steroid release from sperm in a concentration-dependent manner in the absence of BSA (Table I). This β-cyclodextrin was more effective than BSA in mediating steroid release from the sperm, as evidenced by the significantly higher steroid concentrations observed in the media following incubation. M-β-CD, likewise, mediated steroid release from sperm in a concentration-dependent manner, but was more potent than 2-OH-p-β-CD, consistent with the fact that M-β-CD is the most potent β-cyclodextrin with respect to its affinity for cholesterol binding (21Yancey P.G.

We have generated a monoclonal antibody to the mouse 4F2 light chain and cloned the cDNA. It encodes a mouse counterpart of rat L-type amino acid transporter-1, and induces system L amino acid transport in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of 4F2 heavy chain. Transfection studies in mammalian cells have indicated that the 4F2 heavy chain is expressed on the plasma membrane on its own, whereas the 4F2 light chain can be transported to the surface only in the presence of 4F2 heavy chain. 4F2 heavy chain is expressed diffusely on the surface of fibroblastic L cells, whereas it is localized selectively to the cell-cell adhesion sites in L cells expressing cadherins. These results indicate that the 4F2 heavy chain is associated covalently with an amino acid transporter and controls the cell surface expression as well as the membrane topology of the 4F2 heterodimer. Although 4F2 heavy and light chains are expressed coordinately in most tissues, the light chain is barely detected by the antibody in kidney and intestine, despite the presence of heavy chain in a complex form. The results predict the presence of multiple 4F2 light chains. 4F2, also termed CD98, is an integral membrane protein consisting of a heavy chain linked to a light chain by disulfide bond.

Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Strominger J.L. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 347-351PubMed Google Scholar). It is known to be rather ubiquitously expressed in many types of cells and notably in almost all tumor cell lines (2Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). Early biochemical studies have revealed that 4F2 antigen is a heterodimer consisting of a type 2 glycosylated integral membrane protein of around 80 kDa (heavy chain (H-chain)) 1The abbreviations used are: H-chain, heavy chain; L-chain, light chain; ABC, avidin-biotin complex; BAT, broad specificity amino acid transporter; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; LAT1, L-type amino acid transporter 1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; EL, L cells stably transfected with E-cadherin; NL, L cells transfected with N-cadherin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. and a protein with apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa (light chain (L-chain)) linked by disulfide-bond (2Hemler M.E.

A. 1987; 84: 9204-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Parmacek M.S. Karpinski B.A. Gottesdiener K.M. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1915-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), 4F2 L-chain remained unidentified. 4F2 H-chain shares some 30% homology with a broad specificity amino acid transporter (BAT), which activates system b0,+-like amino acid transport (6Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Leiden J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since 4F2 H-chain has been indicated subsequently to induce multiple amino acid transport systems (10Broer A. Hamprecht B. Broer S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), there has been speculation that 4F2 H-chain is a specific activator of the transport systems rather than a carrier (11Palacin M. Estevez R. Zorzano A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Besides its relation to amino acid transport, a variety of functional implications have been made on 4F2. For instance, anti-4F2 H-chain antibody has been reported to inhibit growth of some tumor cells (12Yagita H. Masuko T. Hashimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1478-1484PubMed Google Scholar) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (13Warren A.P. Patel K. McConkey D.J. Palacios R. Blood. 1996; 87: 3676-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, it was indicated to be involved in the virus-induced syncytium formation as well as cell fusion of normal monocytes in the absence of virus infection (14Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Morikawa S. Kawano M. Kusugawa S. Komada H. Nishio M. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2044-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Ohgimoto S. Tabata N. Suga S. Nishio M. Ohta H. Tsurudome M. Komada H. Kawano M. Watanabe N. Ito Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3585-3592PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, 4F2 H-chain has been shown to reverse the dominant negative effect of overexpressed cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin on the ligand affinity of integrin (16Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although these results imply the involvement of 4F2 antigen in diverse cellular activities, exact mechanisms underlying them remain unknown. In the present study, we first have generated a monoclonal antibody to mouse 4F2 L-chain and isolated the 4F2 L-chain cDNA by expression cloning using it. 4F2 L-chain consists of 512 residues and is predicted to be a very hydrophobic protein with 11 or possibly 12 membrane-spanning regions. GenBankTM search has revealed that the cDNA is a mouse counterpart of the most recently reported rat gene termed L-type amino acid transporter-1, LAT1. LAT1 cRNA could induce system L amino acid transport in Xenopusoocytes in the presence of rat 4F2 H-chain and has been suggested to be a 4F2 L-chain (17Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that the mouse 4F2 L-chain induces high affinity amino acid transport with features of system L in the presence of mouse 4F2 H-chain and have proved that it is associated covalently with 4F2 H-chain by a disulfide bond via cysteine at position 103 of the latter. The 4F2 H-chain has been indicated to be expressed on the cell surface as a monomer on its own, whereas 4F2 L-chain is transported to the plasma membrane only in the presence of 4F2 H-chain. 4F2 H-chain is expressed on the epithelial cell surface of most embryonic tissues in vivo, and the analysis on cultured cells has indicated further that 4F2 H-chain is expressed selectively at cell-cell adhesion sites generated by cadherins. The present results thus reveal a critical role of 4F2 H-chain in the control of intracellular trafficking as well as the cell surface topology of the 4F2 heterodimer and provide a new clue to delineate the mechanisms for its involvement in diverse cellular functions. We also present the results predicting the presence of additional 4F2 L-chains that is distinct from that of LAT1 in some normal epithelial tissues such as kidney and intestine. Anti-4F2 H-chain monoclonal antibody (mAb), 14.37, has been reported previously (3Kubota H. Sato M. Ogawa Y. Iwai K. Hattori M. Yoshida T. Minato N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To raise anti-4F2 mAbs for multiple purposes, Armenian hamsters were immunized with pooled SDS-PAGE gel slices corresponding to the 80-kDa 4F2 H-chain or 37-kDa L-chain from the P3U1 cell lysates that had been immunoprecipitated with 14.37 mAb. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by two independent assays: immunoprecipitation of125I-labeled P3U1 cell lysates, and immunoblotting of the cell lysates immunoprecipitated with 14.37 mAb. By these procedures, two additional anti-4F2 H-chain mAbs were obtained: 10.10 mAb, which is capable of efficiently immunoprecipitating the 4F2 heterodimer from P3U1 cells as well as the 4F2 H-chain expressed by cDNA transfection, and 10.4 mAb, which is effective for the detection of 80-kDa 4F2 H-chain by immunoblotting. The 10.10 mAb could be used for immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, and immunohistochemistry, whereas the 10.4 mAb could be used for immunoblotting. Another mAb, 10.7, was also capable of immunoprecipitating the 4F2 heterodimer from P3U1 cells. It specifically reacted to the 37-kDa band by the immunoblotting and was indicated to recognize the 4F2 L-chain (see also text). The 10.7 mAb has been shown to stain the cells only after the permeabilization, suggesting that its epitope is in the cytoplasmic region. Anti-E-cadherin (ECCD-2) was purchased from Takara Co.Ltd, Kyoto, Japan, and anti-N-cadherin (NCD-2) was provided by Dr. Takeichi, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. Anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was purified in our laboratory. L cells and those stably transfected with E-cadherin (EL) and N-cadherin cDNA (NL) were also provided by Dr. Takeichi. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. cDNA library of BAL 17.2 mouse B lymphoma cells was constructed in the expression vector pPISC, 2K. Iwai, unpublished data. and COS cells were transfected with the cDNA library (10 μg/5 × 106 cells) by electroporation. Cells were harvested by trypsinization 3 days after the transfection and fixed and permeabilized by Fix and Parm (Caltag, S. San Francisco, CA), as instructed by manufacturer. Cells were stained with 10.7 mAb followed by FITC-conjugated anti-hamster IgG (Caltag, S. San Francisco, CA). Positively stained cells were collected by cell sorting with fluorescence-activated cell sorter Vantage (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Episomal plasmids were directly recovered from such collected cells by the method described by Davis et al.(18Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Radziejewski C. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sorted cells were treated with buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml of proteinase K at 55 °C overnight followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were suspended in 2 μl of water and transformed into bacteria. Plasmids were purified from liquid culture of bacteria and again transfected into COS cells. After three cycles of the procedure, a single plasmid clone, p10.7, was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA transfection into COS and HeLa cells was done using electroporation and CaPO4 method, respectively. 4F2 L-chain cDNA tagged with Myc epitope at the C terminus was constructed by subcloning synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the epitope tag and a part of cDNA into the 3′-end of the cDNA. Single residue mutants of 4F2 H-chain (cysteine at position 103 being substituted for serine, C103S, and cysteine at 325 for serine, C325S) were constructed by the two-step PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For cRNA synthesis, cDNAs of both 4F2 H-chain (3Kubota H. Sato M. Ogawa Y. Iwai K. Hattori M. Yoshida T. Minato N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and 4F2 L-chain were subcloned into pSP73 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). After linearizing the plasmids withXhoI, cRNAs were synthesized by using mMASSAGE, mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells either unlabeled or surface labeled with biotin using biotin-XX succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were lysed with a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, PMSF, leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin trypsin inhibitor), incubated with antibodies (2–5 μg) at 4 °C for 3 h, and then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, incubated with antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies or with avidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for biotinylated samples, and developed using a Supersignal Western blotting detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Northern blotting was done as described previously (3Kubota H. Sato M. Ogawa Y. Iwai K. Hattori M. Yoshida T. Minato N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on the coverslips, rinsed with TBS+(Tris-buffered saline, pH7.4, supplemented with 10 mmCaCl2), fixed with 3% formaldehyde in TBS+, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS+. For double staining, the cells were incubated with anti-4F2 H-chain mAb (10.10) and anti-E-cadherin or anti-Myc for 1 h at room temperature and then with biotin-conjugated goat anti-hamster IgG (Caltag) and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Caltag) for 1 h at room temperature followed by Texas red-avidin (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). The samples were dried, mounted in ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and analyzed with a confocal laser microscopy (Olympus, Osaka, Japan). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described before (19Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole embryos (E14) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Frozen sections at 10–16-mm thickness were preblocked, incubated with 10.10 mAb, and then with biotin-conjugated goat anti-hamster IgG followed by ABC kit. Amino acid uptake was measured as described (6Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, five to seven Xenopus oocytes per condition were washed twice in amino acid-free uptake solution (100 mmcholine chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Oocytes injected with cRNAs or water as a control were incubated with 200 μl of uptake solution containing 50 μm radiolabeled amino acids at 370 KBq/ml for 30 min at 25 °C. Amino acid competition experiments were performed by adding 5 mm inhibitors to the uptake solutions. After incubation, oocytes were washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold wash solution (80 μm choline chloride, 20 mml-arginine, 20 mml-leucine, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). Each oocyte was then transferred to a vial, dissolved with 200 μl of 10% SDS, followed by addition of 3 ml of scintillation solution for scintillation counting. An anti-mouse 4F2 mAb, 10.7, was produced, that was capable of immunoprecipitating a band at 120 kDa in nonreducing condition and two bands at 80 and 37 kDa positions in reducing condition from the surface-labeled P3U1 cell lysates (data not shown). When the immunoprecipitate of P3U1 lysate with either anti-4F2 H-chain (14.37) or 10.7 mAb was blotted with 10.7, a 37-kDa band was detected (Fig. 1 a,left), and conversely, immunoprecipitation with 10.7 resulted in the coprecipitation of 80 kDa 4F2 H-chain (Fig.1 a, right). The results indicate that 10.7 mAb recognizes the light chain of 4F2 heterodimer. We then isolated a 4F2 L-chain cDNA, p10.7, by expression cloning using the mAb as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When COS cells were transfected with either 4F2 H-chain (p14.37, Ref. 3Kubota H. Sato M. Ogawa Y. Iwai K. Hattori M. Yoshida T. Minato N. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or p10.7 cDNA, an 80- or 37-kDa band, respectively, was immunoprecipitated only with the corresponding mAb as expected. On the other hand, when COS cells were cotransfected with both cDNAs, anti-4F2 H-chain mAb could immunoprecipitate the 37-kDa band reactive to 10.7 mAb in addition to the 80-kDa 4F2 H-chain band (Fig. 1 b). Because 4F2 H-chain has only two cysteines at positions 103 and 325 in the extracellular region (5Parmacek M.S. Karpinski B.A. Gottesdiener K.M. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1915-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a single residue mutation for each cysteine to serine was introduced, C103S and C325S, and cotransfected with p10.7 cDNA. As also shown in Fig. 1 b, the C103S mutation of 4F2 H-chain abrogated the coprecipitation of the 37-kDa band by anti-4F2 H-chain mAb, whereas the C325S mutation did not. These results have proven that the cDNA indeed encodes the 4F2 L-chain. The p10.7 cDNA consists of 3456 bp and contains an open reading frame (nucleotides 27–1565) encoding 512 residues (GenBankTM/DDBJ accession number AB17189). The deduced amino acid sequence is highly homologous (98% identity) to the recently reported rat LAT1 (17Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The hydrophobicity profile shown in Fig. 2 a predicts at least 11 and possibly 12 helical transmembrane domains. As shown in Fig.2 b, injection of 4F2 L-chain cRNA alone intoXenopus oocytes induced negligible Na+-independent uptake of Leu or Arg, whereas 4F2 H-chain cRNA induced Arg uptake as reported previously (8Bertran J. Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Kuhn L.C. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Wells R.G. Lee W.S. Kanai Y. Leiden J.M. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15285-15288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When both cRNAs were coinjected, potent Na+-independent Leu uptake was induced, whereas Arg-uptake tended to be suppressed as compared with that induced by 4F2 H-chain cRNA alone. The Leu uptake in the double cRNA transfectants was almost completely inhibited by Ile, Val, His, and Phe as well as by 2-(−)-endoamino-bicycloheptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), a specific inhibitor of system L transport. A kinetic study revealed that the Na+-independent Leu uptake was saturable and high affinity, with the K m calculated to be around 25 μm (Fig. 2 b). We then examined the intracellular trafficking of each protein. COS cells transfected with either 4F2 L- or H-chain cDNA alone, or with both, were surface-labeled with biotin, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-4F2 H- or L-chain mAb followed by the detection of biotinylated proteins with ABC system. As controls, aliquots of the same cell lysates (one-fourth) were immunoprecipitated similarly and blotted with the corresponding mAbs. The level of biotinylated 4F2 L-chain was found to be marginal as compared with the total 4F2 L-chain in the L-chain single transfectants, whereas the vast majority of 4F2 L-chain was estimated to be expressed on the cell surface in the H-chain/ L-chain double transfectants (Fig. 3 a,left panel). In contrast, comparable levels of biotinylated 4F2 H-chain were detected in both H-chain single and H-chain/L-chain double transfectants (Fig. 3 a, right panel). Biotinylated 4F2 H-chain in the former was detected as a monomer without covalently associated molecule as 4F2 H-chain (C103S) (Fig.3 b), eliminating the possibility that mouse 4F2 H-chain was associated with the endogenous 4F2 L-chain in COS cells and expressed on the cell surface. 4F2 H-chain (C103S), that failed to form disulfide-linkage with 4F2 L-chain, however, was capable of inducing cell surface expression of 4F2 L-chain as efficiently as wild type 4F2 H-chain (Fig. 3 a). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. When 4F2 H- or L-chain cDNA was singly transfected into HeLa cells, 4F2 H-chain was expressed on the cell surface, whereas 4F2 L-chain was remained mostly in the cytosol particularly in the Golgi area (Fig. 4,a versus b). With the cotransfection of 4F2 H- and L-chain cDNAs, on the other hand, 4F2 L-chain was expressed on the cell surface with the same pattern as 4F2 H-chain (Fig. 4, c versus d). An essentially similar effect was obtained by the cotransfection with 4F2 H-chain (C103S) cDNA as well (Fig. 4, e versus f). These results indicate that 4F2 H-chain functions as a “guidance molecule” for 4F2 L-chain to the plasma membrane, for which the covalent linkage by a disulfide bond is not essential.Figure 44F2 H-chain guides the intracellular trafficking of 4F2 L-chain to the plasma membrane independently of disulfide-linkage immunostaining analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with 4F2 H-chain cDNA (a), 4F2 L-chain cDNA tagged with Myc epitope at the C terminus (b), 4F2 H-chain and Myc-4F2 L-chain cDNAs (c and d), or with 4F2 H-chain (C103S) and Myc-4F2 L-chain cDNAs (eand f) by CaPO4 method. Three days later, the cells were fixed and stained with biotin-conjugated anti-4F2 H-chain followed by Texas Red-avidin (a), or anti-Myc mAb followed by FITC-anti-mouse IgG (b). For the double transfectants, the cells were double-stained with anti-4F2 H-chain (c ande) and anti-Myc (d and f) as above.Panels c and d, as well ase and f, represent the same fields, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In normal mouse lymphocytes, the 4F2 L-chain transcript is induced rapidly following the mitogenic stimulation in vitro with concanavalin A in a coordinated manner as with that of 4F2 H-chain (Fig.5 a). Also, both transcripts are expressed in all leukemic cell lines examined and with similar relative intensities (data not shown). In Fig. 5 b, expression profiles of 4F2 H- and 4F2 L-chain transcripts in normal adult organs are shown. Although both mRNAs are expressed rather ubiquitously, the level of 4F2 L-chain mRNA appears to be disproportionally low as compared with that of 4F2 H-chain in kidney, small intestine, and liver (see below). The expression pattern of 4F2 on the cells was then investigated. In OTF9 embryonic carcinoma cells, endogenous 4F2 H-chain was found to be located selectively at the cell-cell adhesion sites (Fig. 6 b). Because the distribution was found to be nearly identical to that of E-cadherin (Fig. 6 a), we intended to examine directly the effect of cadherins on 4F2 H-chain distribution at the cell surface using fibroblastic L cells and those stably transfected with E-cadherin (EL) or N-cadherin (NL). In L cells, 4F2 H-chain was stained diffusely on the surface and E-cadherin was undetectable (Fig. 6, cand d). In EL and NL cells, which exhibited significant cell-cell adhesion, 4F2 H-chain was concentrated at the cell-cell adhesion sites and colocalized with the cadherins (Fig. 6,e, f and g, h). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that 4F2 H-chain was associated with 4F2 L-chain in all these cells (data not shown). These results thus suggest that 4F2 H-chain is sorted specifically to the cell-cell adherent membrane sites, most likely together with 4F2 L-chain, once the stable cell adhesion is generated by cadherins. Finally, we examined the cellular localization of 4F2 H-chain in various normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry of mouse embryos has indicated that 4F2 H-chain is expressed on the surface of epithelial cells of most tissues, including epidermis (Fig. 7 a), the choroid plexus in the brain (b), retina (c), as well as intestinal (d), renal (e), and thymic epithelium (f). In polarized epithelial cells such as in intestine and kidney, 4F2 H-chain expression is restricted apparently at the lateral adhesion sites (Fig. 7, d and e), consistent with the colocalized expression with E-cadherin in cell lines. We wished to know whether 4F2 H-chain on the cell surface of these tissues is associated with the 4F2 L-chain. Thus far, the only available anti-4F2 L-chain antibody, 10.7 mAb, worked poorly in immunohistochemistry. Therefore, immunoblotting analysis was performed. The 4F2 H-chain is expressed in all embryonic and adult tissues examined (Fig. 8 A). The 4F2 L-chain, however, is detected barely in the kidney, intestine, and adult liver, whereas it is expressed strongly in others including brain, testis, and spleen as well as fetal liver (Fig. 8 a). Nonetheless, the 80-kDa 4F2 H-chain in kidney and intestine is detected still as a 120-kDa complex in nonreducing condition (Fig.8 b), strongly implying that the 4F2 H-chain forms complex with 4F2 L-chain(s) that is distinct from the LAT1 in these polarized epithelial tissues.Figure 8Dissociated expression of the 4F2 H-chain and 4F2 L-chain (LAT1) in kidney, intestine, and liver implication for the multiple 4F2 L-chain(s). a, various organs from E18 embryos (E18) and adult (A) mice were homogenized, extracted in a lysis buffer, electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE in reducing condition, and immunoblotted with anti-4F2 H-chain (10.4) and anti-4F2 L-chain (10.7) mAbs. b, tissue extracts of indicated organs from adult mice were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE in either nonreducing or reducing condition and immunoblotted with anti-4F2 H-chain mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the present study, we have generated a monoclonal antibody to the mouse 4F2 L-chain and cloned its cDNA. The deduced amino acid sequence has revealed that 4F2 L-chain consists of 512 residues with at least 11 or possibly 12 helical transmembrane domains, calculated molecular mass being 56 kDa. Results 3H. Yang and N. Minato, unpublished observations. indicate that both N- and C-terminal ends of the coding region are retained in the 4F2 L-chain, and thus much faster migration of 4F2 L-chain in SDS-PAGE at 37-kDa position appears to be because of the intrinsic structural features. 4F2 L-chain is highly homologous (98% identity) to the very recently reported rat LAT1 (17Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23629-23632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and thus considered to be its mouse counterpart. Rat LAT1 has been shown to induce system L amino acid transport in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of 4F2 H-chain. Based on the functional dependence on 4F2 H-chain, LAT1 is suggested to be a 4F2 H-chain. Our present results have confirmed that the mouse 4F2 L-chain can mediate amino acid transport with typical features of high affinity system L when expressed in Xenopus oocytes together with the 4F2 H-chain. We have indicated further that the 4F2 L-chain is associated covalently with 4F2 H-chain in the cells by a disulfide bond via cysteine at position 103, which is conserved in the 4F2 H-chain of mouse, rat, and human (4Lumadue J.A. Glick A.B. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9204-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Parmacek M.S. Karpinski B.A. Gottesdiener K.M. Thompson C.B. Leiden J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1915-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proved that 4F2 H-chain is associated covalently with a system L amino acid transporter. We then addressed the molecular basis for the functional dependence of 4F2 L-chain on 4F2 H-chain. Present results have indicated that 4F2 H-chain alone is expressed efficiently on the cell surface as monomer. In contrast, 4F2 L-chain is expressed minimally at the plasma membrane in mammalian cells, remaining mostly in the Golgi area, and requires 4F2 H-chain to be sorted to the cell surface. The results thus indicate that one of the functions of 4F2 H-chain is to guide 4F2 L-chain to the plasma membrane. Rather unexpectedly, the guidance effect is independent of disulfide-linkage, implying the involvement of noncovalent steric association. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the heterodimeric P-type cation-exchange ATPases, in which a β-subunit is responsible for the correct intracellular trafficking of α/β heterodimeric holoenzymes from ER to the cell surface (20Chow D.C. Forte J.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid permeases in lower eukaryocytes are expressed usually as monomeric proteins (21Sophianopoulou V. Diallinas G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 53-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane expression of permeases in yeast, however, is shown to be controlled by a unique ER-resident protein, SHR3, without which the transport of permeases from ER to plasma membrane is impaired selectively (22Ljungdahl P.O. Gimeno C.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 463-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this aspect, it is noted that a mutation of BAT (M467T), most commonly detected in the patients of type I cysteinuria, results in the defective expression of BAT protein on the cell surface (23Chillaron J. Estevez R. Samarzija I. Waldegger S. Testar X. Lang F. Zorzano A. Busch A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9543-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The BAT is reported also to be associated with an as yet undefined 50-kDa protein in the kidney cells (24Wang Y. Tate S.S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It thus seems possible that 4F2 H-chain/BAT family, often called “transport-related” proteins, represents specific “guidance molecules” for selected amino acid transporters to the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. At present, it remains to be seen whether 4F2 H-chain has additional functions as an integral part of the transport carrier. In normal mouse embryos, 4F2 H-chain has been shown to be expressed prominently in the epithelial cells of most tissue, in addition to the vascular and lymphohematopoietic cells. In the polarized epithelial cells such as in kidney and intestine, 4F2 H-chain expression appears to be restricted at the lateral sites, which primarily depended on cadherins (25Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis of OTF9 embryonic carcinoma cells in culture has indicated clearly that the 4F2 H-chain is expressed selectively at the cell-cell adhesion sites and colocalizes with E-cadherin. Furthermore, in L cells stably transfected with E- or N-cadherin cDNA, 4F2 H-chain is expressed at the cell-cell adhesion sites, whereas it is expressed diffusely on the surface of L cells without cadherin, indicating that the membrane topology of 4F2 H-chain is regulated by cadherins. Results 4K. Suga and N. Minato, unpublished observations. have indicated that E-cadherin is coimmunoprecipitated with 4F2 heterodimer from OTF9 cells lysed with mild detergents, suggesting that 4F2 complex is included in the membrane domain generated by E-cadherin. Similar cell-cell adhesion-dependent restriction of the cell surface topology has been reported for Na+/K+-ATPase and Cl−/HCO3− channel (26Grindstaff K.K. Yeaman C. Anandasabapathy N. Hsu S.C. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Scheller R.H. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 731-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 27Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Our present results have also implicated the presence of multiple 4F2 L-chain(s) that are associated covalently with 4F2 H-chain. In cells of most tissues including lymphoid cells and most cancer cells, both 4F2 H- and L-chain are detected at comparable levels. In the intestine and kidney, however, 4F2 L-chain is detected barely by the 10.7 mAb. Nonetheless, the 4F2 H-chain is present mostly as a 120-kDa complex rather than an 80-kDa monomer form also in these tissues, suggesting the presence of distinct 4F2 L-chain(s). Molecular heterogeneity in the system L transport activity has been previously demonstrated (28Weissbach L. Handlogten M.E. Christensen H.N. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12006-12011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because 4F2 H-chain in these polarized epithelial cells is localized selectively on the lateral, but not apical, surface, the yet undefined 4F2 L-chain(s) may be expected to exhibit unique functions, directional solute transports for instance. The 4F2 antigen has been suggested to be involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, including cellular growth (12Yagita H. Masuko T. Hashimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1478-1484PubMed Google Scholar, 13Warren A.P. Patel K. McConkey D.J. Palacios R.

Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It has been reported also that anti-4F2 H-chain antibodies affect the Ca2+-influx in sarcolemmal vesicles (29Michalak M. Quackenbush E.J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 92-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although system L transport of the 4F2 heterodimer should play certainly important roles in proliferative cells, including tumor cells, to meet critical nutritional requirements, the relation of it to many other suspected functions remains obscure. Further studies on the guidance mechanisms of 4F2 H-chain for 4F2 L-chain(s) and possibly other proteins, with or without covalent linkage, to the cell surface as well as the analysis on the mechanisms for regulation of membrane topology of 4F2 heterodimer by cell adhesion molecules might provide new clues to delineate the multiple functions of 4F2 antigen in various cell types.

Among them, cores 2 and 4 are important for having N-acetyllactosamine side chains, which can be further modified to express various functional oligosaccharides. Previously, we discovered by cloning cDNAs that the core 2 branching enzyme, termed core 2 β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-leukocyte type (C2GnT-L), is highly homologous to the I branching β-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT) (Bierhuizen, M. F. A., Mattei, M.-G., and Fukuda, M. (1993) Genes Dev.7, 468–478). Using these homologous sequences as probes, we identified an expressed sequence tag in dbEST, which has significant homology to C2GnT-L and IGnT. This approach, together with 5′and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, yielded a human cDNA that encompasses a whole coding region of an enzyme, termed C2GnT-mucin type (C2GnT-M). C2GnT-M has 48.2 and 33.8% identity with C2GnT-L and IGnT at the amino acid levels. The expression of C2GnT-M cDNA directed the expression of core 2 branched oligosaccharides and I antigen on the cell surface. Moreover, a soluble chimeric C2GnT-M had core 4 branching activity in addition to core 2 and I branching activities. A soluble chimeric C2GnT-L, in contrast, almost exclusively contains core 2 branching activity. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the C2GnT-M transcripts are heavily expressed in colon, small intestine, trachea, and stomach, where mucin is produced. In contrast, the transcripts of C2GnT-L were more widely detected, including the lymph node and bone marrow. These results indicate that the newly cloned C2GnT-M plays a critical role inO-glycan synthesis in mucins and might have distinctly different roles in oligosaccharide ligand formation compared with C2GnT-L."

As our understanding of the contributory roles of NO in the blood vessel wall evolves, so does the need to firmly understand the basic principles governing the regulated expression of the eNOS mRNA transcript and enzyme. Regulation of eNOS at the biochemical and enzymatic level is now better understood. eNOS is a peripheral membrane protein that is localized to specialized cell surface microdomains implicated in signal transduction known as plasmalemmal caveolae (5Shaul P.

N-Myristoylation and palmitoylation are necessary for efficient targeting and membrane insertion (6Robinson L. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11776-11780Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Increases in intracellular calcium following endothelial activation facilitate interactions between the eNOS apoenzyme and calmodulin. This enhances NADPH-dependent electron flux through eNOS dimers resulting in the 5-electron oxidation ofl-arginine and release of NO (7Lee C. Robinson L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27403-27406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 is also recruited to eNOS following cellular activation. Recent studies have highlighted the important contributions of changes in steady-state eNOS mRNA transcripts to the regulated expression of NO in disease states in vivo and in models of endothelial activation in vitro. For instance, impairment in the bioactivity of endothelial-derived NO may be mediated, in part, through decreased expression of the mRNA and protein for eNOS in atherosclerotic human blood vessels (8Wilcox J.N.

The regulation of eNOS mRNA stability in response to exogenous stimuli, especially the mechanism by which the transcript is degraded, is an evolving story. In situ cRNA hybridization studies performed in a wide variety of human tissues revealed that eNOS mRNA transcripts are relatively endothelial cell-specific (8Wilcox J.N. Subramanian R.R.

This contrasts with the broad tissue distribution of other known members of the human NOS gene family, namely neuronal NOS and inducible NOS. As is the case with nearly all cell-restricted transcripts, some exceptions to the endothelial-restricted expression of eNOS mRNA transcripts have been noted: syncytiotrophoblast of human placental villi, pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the brain, and cardiac myocytes, among others. When compared with other genes expressed in vascular endothelium such as preproendothelin-1, endothelin converting enzyme-1, CD31/PECAM, or von Willebrand factor, the mRNA for eNOS is very endothelial cell-specific. mRNAs known to be even more restricted to the vascular endothelium than eNOS are uncommon, but include the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinases Flk-1/KDR, Flt-1, Tie-1, Tie-2/Tek, and the cytokine-inducible adhesion molecule E-selectin (19Risau W. Flamme I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 73-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the human E-selectin promoter has been identified as a useful model for biochemical and functional characterization of transcriptional regulation of inducible mRNAs in vascular endothelium. In contrast to the mechanistic details emerging from studies of inducible gene expression, few constitutively expressed endothelial cell-restricted genes have been exhaustively dissected. One well studied human gene is preproendothelin-1 (20Kawana M. Lee M. Quertermous E. Quertermous T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4225-4231Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Functional studies showed that GATA-2 and AP-1 synergistically activate the preproendothelin-1 promoter. GATA-2, the major GATA-binding protein expressed in endothelial cells (21Wilson D.B. Dorfman D.M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), also has functional importance in the transcription of other endothelial genes such as human von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-2. However, given the broad tissue distribution of the GATA-2, it cannot be the sole molecular determinant for the cell type-specific expression of these genes. Studies have also investigated the cis-acting DNA elements and trans-acting factors that regulate the transcription of Flt-1, Flk-1/KDR, and Tie-2. cAMP response element and Ets motifs cooperate in activating the Flt-1 promoter (22Wakiya K. Begue A. Stehelin D. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30823-30828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Three regions have been identified within the 5′-flanking sequences of the Flk-1/KDR gene containing putative Sp1, AP-2, NF-κB, and E-box elements important for functional activity in endothelial cells (23Patterson C. Perrella M. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More recent studies with the Tie-2 gene (24Fadel B. Boutet S. Quertermous T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) identified negative (region I) and positive regulatory elements (regions U and A), although the trans-factors remain to be examined (24Fadel B. Boutet S. Quertermous T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In each of these examples, detailed studies that seek a comprehensive dissection of the functionally important cis-DNA elements and the multiprotein complexes implicated in the cooperative control of constitutive expression in endothelial cells are slowly emerging. Recently, this laboratory and others reported the isolation and characterization of complementary and genomic clones for eNOS (18Marsden P.A. Shappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M. Sundell C.L.

The human eNOS gene is present as a single copy in the haploid human genome and has been localized to 7q35–36 (26Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C.

Structural characterization of genomic DNA revealed that the 4052-nt mRNA is derived from 26 exons distributed over 21 kilobases of human genomic DNA (26Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W.

Even though analysis of 5′-flanking regions failed to define a canonical TATAA motif a single major transcription initiation site was defined by primer extension, S1 nuclease protection, and 5′-RACE to be 22 nt upstream of the translational start site (26Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The early characterization of human eNOS genomic clones and 5′-flanking regions, by us and others, suggested a trivial model.

The eNOS gene is constitutively expressed by the vascular endothelium; however, the transcriptional mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated thus far. A comprehensive understanding of the interdependent protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions that reciprocally interact with co-activators and the general transcription machinery on the native eNOS promoter is necessary for developing further insight into perturbations of eNOS expression in the diseased blood vessel wall. Based upon this premise, the present study focused upon a detailed dissection of the functionally important cis-DNA elements and the multiprotein complexes implicated in the cooperative control of constitutive expression of the human eNOS gene. Two tightly clustered activator regions were identified in proximal enhancer regions of the TATA-less eNOS promoter using deletion analysis and linker-scanning mutagenesis: positive regulatory domain I (PRD I) (−104/−95 relative to transcription initiation) and PRD II (−144/−115). Analysis of trans-factor binding and functional expression studies revealed a surprising degree of cooperativity and complexity. Through analysis of nucleoprotein complexes in endothelial cells and functional domain studies in Drosophila Schneider cells and endothelial cells, we demonstrate positive and negative protein-protein cooperativity involving Sp1, variants of Sp3, Ets-1, Elf-1, MAZ, and YY1. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and characterized as described previously (16Flowers M. Wang Y. Stewart R. Patel B. Marsden P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1988-H1997PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marsden P.A. Shappert K.T. Chen H.S. Flowers M. Sundell C.L. Wilcox J.N. Lamas S. Michel T.

Schneider'sDrosophila line 2 (SL2) were obtained from ATCC (Rockport, MD), propagated in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 23 °C with atmospheric CO2. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (NEB) (Beverly, MA), Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), and Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Plasmid DNA was prepared using two rounds of gradient-sedimentation ultracentrifugation in ethidium bromide-saturated cesium chloride cushions. Multiple independent preparations were employed in transfection experiments. Comparable findings were evident when plasmid DNA was prepared in dam −,dcm − bacteria. An EMBL3 phage clone containing human eNOS genomic sequences was isolated using Southern blot hybridization (26Marsden P.A. Heng H.H. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3.6-kb ApaI fragment, extending from −3500 to +113 relative to the major transcription start site, was subcloned into theApaI site of pBluescript SK I (−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 3.6-kb ApaI fragment was isolated by preparative gel electrophoresis, blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme, and ligated to 12-bp SalI linkers (NEB). The 3.6-kb SalI fragment was then subcloned into the XhoI site of the promoter-less reporter construct, pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI), and designated as pGL2 −3500/+109. pGL2 −3500/+109 was used as a template to generate pGL2 −1900/+109, pGL2 −1193/+109, pGL2 −1001/+109, pGL2 −743/+109, pGL2 −265/+109, pGL2 −49/+109, and pGL2 −14/+109 by means of restriction enzyme digestion. The integrity of promoter/reporter gene constructs was assessed with DNA sequence analysis. PCR was used to generate pGL2 −217/+109, pGL2 −185/+109, pGL2 −151/+109, pGL2 −133/+109, and pGL2 −92/+109. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Constructs generated with PCR were sequenced using an automated ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Canada Inc., Mississauga, ON) to monitor for PCR-associated nucleotide incorporation errors. Twelve linker-scanning mutations, containing the sequence 5′-GCAGATCCGC-3′, and spanning a 120-bp region of the human eNOS promoter from −164 to −45, relative to the transcription start site, were created. These mutations were incorporated into the pGL2 −1193/+109 construct. Two types of amplicons, namely an A amplicon (the 5′-fragment) and a B amplicon (the 3′-fragment), were created using a modified PCR-based method. Primers used to create the linker-scanning mutants are listed in TableI. The A amplicon was generated using two primers: Amain and An. Amain is a gene-specific sense primer that is homologous to −327 to −309 regions of the eNOS promoter. An, where n corresponds to the location of the specific 10 bp to be mutated, is a 25-mer, antisense primer containing a 15-bp sequence homologous to the eNOS promoter and a 10-bp mutation at the 5′-end that is heterologous to eNOS sequence. Similarly, the B amplicon was generated using two primers: Bmain and Bn. Bn is a 25-mer, sense primer containing 15 bp of homologous eNOS sequence and a heterologous 10-bp mutation at the 5′-end of the primer. Bmain is a 21-mer homologous to the luciferase reporter gene sequence in the pGL2-Basic vector. A and B amplicons were subcloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) and sequenced. The A and B amplicons were subsequently subcloned between the PstI andBglII sites of the −1193/+109 pGL2 promoter/reporter luciferase construct.Table IPrimers pairs used to construct all pGL2–1193/+109 linker-scanning mutantsNamePrimer sequenceAmain5′-CCT TTA TGA CCC CCT GGT G-3′Bmain5′-TTT ATG TTT TTG GCG TCT TCC-3′A−164/−1555′-CGA GAT CTG CAC GCC CGC TGG CCT G-3′B−164/−1555′-CGG GAT CCG CCT TTA GAG CCT CCC A-3′A−154/−1455′-CGA GAT CTG CGG CTC TAA AGC CTC A-3′B−154/−1455′-CGG GAT CCG CTC CCA GCC GGG CTT G-3′A−144/−1355′-CGA GAT CTG CGG CTC TAA AGC CTC A-3′B−144/−1355′-CGG GAT CCG CGC TTG TTC CTG TCC C-3′A−134/−1255′-CGA GAT CTG CCC GGC TGG GAG GCT C-3′B−134/−1255′-CGG GAT CCG CGT CCC ATT GTG TAT G-3′A−124/−1155′-CGA GAT CTG CAG GAA CAA GCC CGG C-3′B−124/−1155′-CGG GAT CCG CGT ATG GGA TAG GGG C-3′A−114/−1055′-CGA GAT CTG CAC AAT GGG ACA GGA A-3′B−114/−1055′-CGG GAT CCG CGG GGC GGG GCG AGG G-3′A−104/−955′-CGA GAT CTG CTA TCC CAT ACA CAA T-3′B−140/−955′-CGG GAT CCG CGA GGG CCA GCA CTG G-3′A−94/−855′-CGA GAT CTG CGC CCC GCC CCT ATC C-3′B−94/−855′-CGG GAT CCG CAC TGG AGA CGG CCC T-3′A−84/−755′-CGA GAT CTG CGC TGG CCC TCG CCC C-3′B−84/−755′-CGG GAT CCG CCC CCT CCC ACT GCC C-3′A−74/−655′-CGA GAT CTG CGC TCT CCA GTG CTG G-3′B−74/−655′-CGG GAT CCG CTG CCC CCT CCT CTC G-3′A−64/−555′-CGA GAT CTG CGT GGG AGG GGG CTC T-3′B−54/−555′-CGG GAT CCG CTC TCG GTC CCC TCC C-3′A−54/−455′-CGA GAT CTG CGG AGG GGG CAG TGG G-3′B−54/−455′-CGG GAT CCG CCT CCC TCT TCC TAA G-3′A−44/−355′-CGA GAT CTG CGG GAC CGA GAG GAG G-3′B−44/−355′-CGG GAT CCG CCT AAG GAA AAG GCC A-3′ Open table in a new tab Each pGL2 −1193/+109 linker mutant construct was digested with SmaI (a 3′-multiple cloning site within pGL2-Basic vector) and PstI (−265), blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme, and ligated. Expression cassettes for Sp1, Sp3 variants, Elf-1, Ets-1, and MAZ were based upon pPacUO, a transient episomal vector which contains the 2.6-kbDrosophila actin 5C promoter, a 0.7-kb 5′-UTR Ultrabithorax (Ubx) internal ribosome entry site, the first eight codons of the Ubx open reading frame and 1.1-kb of 3′-UTR from the actin 5C gene. The latter provides polyadenylation signal sequences. pPacUSp1 and pPacUO was kindly provided by R. Tjian (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Berkeley, IL) and has been described previously (30Biggin M. Bickel S. Benson M. Pirrotta V. Tjian R.

Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). For construction of pPacUSp3(−Nterm) the pPacUSp3 plasmid was subjected to a partial NotI and aBglII digestion. The 8.9-kb fragment was blunt-ended with Klenow and an intramolecular ligation performed removing 0.85-kb from the NH2 terminus of the Sp3 open reading frame leaving amino acids 297–667 of human Sp3 (Sp3ΔNH2). pPacUElf-1 was constructed using a full-length human Elf-1 cDNA kindly provided by J. M. Leiden (Chicago, IL). A 1.9-kb XhoI fragment was subcloned into the XhoI site of pPacUO. The resulting plasmid was subjected to a partial PstI restriction digestion and blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme to remove 4 nt placing the Elf-1 cDNA in frame with the first 8 codons of the Ubx open reading frame. pPacUEts-1 was constructed using a full-length murine Ets-1 cDNA provided by B. J. Graves (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). A 1.5-kb NdeI-BamHI fragment was blunt-ended and subcloned into the blunt-endedBamHI site of pPacUO. pCGN-MAZ was kindly provided by Thomas Shenk (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Princeton, NJ) (33Parks C. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For pPacUMAZ, pCGN-MAZ was cleaved with a partial EcoRI digestion. The linearized plasmid was blunt-ended and digested withBamHI. pPacUO was cleaved with XhoI, blunt-ended, and cleaved with BamHI. The resulting 2.3-kb fragment containing the MAZ open reading frame was cloned into theBamHI sites of pPacUO. For transient transfections DNA concentrations were independently determined using a DyNA Quant 200 Fluorometer (Hoefer Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden), an Ultrospec Plus UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and analytical gel electrophoresis. All transient transfections were carried out using the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). BAEC and HUVEC cultures were plated at 3.3 × 104 cells/ml (3.5 ml) and grown on 60-mm dishes 48 h prior to transfection. Transfection conditions were optimized using the SV40 promoter/enhancer luciferase control plasmid, pGL2-Control, to confirm that increasing amounts of templates resulted in proportional increases in reporter activity. Endothelial cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of promoter/reporter construct, 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-gal, and 1.5 μg of pBluescript II SK(−) DNA. β-Galactosidase activity was used to control for transfection efficiency, and pBluescript II SK(−) DNA was used to optimize DNA/Lipofectin ratios and hence transfection efficiency. The formation of DNA/Lipofectin complexes containing DNA/Lipofectin in a 2:1 (mass:mass) ratio were incubated for 60 min at 22 °C and then added to cells at 37 °C in serum-free Opti-MEM I. The transfection mix was replaced at 5 h with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% bovine serum and antibiotics. Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. pGL2-Control vector was used as a positive control. The pGL2-Basic vector lacking both a eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences was used as a negative control. For Drosophila Schneider studies, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of experimental promoter/luciferase construct, the indicated amount of expression plasmids, and 0.5 μg of pRSV-β-gal. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant (2 μg) with the addition of pPacUO. SL2 cells were seeded at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml at the time of transfection. A cytomegalovirus-based heterologous eukaryotic expression cassette for Elf-1 (pcDNAI/neo-Elf-1) was kindly provided by J. M. Leiden (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested with 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA). Protein extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min to pellet residual cellular debris and stored at −80 °C for subsequent assay. The Bio-Rad protein assay was used to determine protein concentration using bovine serum albumin as a reference standard. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to characterize RNA species produced from transfected DNA constructs to confirm that episomal eNOS promoter/reporter constructs utilized comparable sites for transcription initiation as the native promoter (data not shown). Luciferase assays were carried out on the MonoLight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). Coenzyme A and ATP were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). d-Luciferin and luminometer cuvettes were from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory. Briefly, 25 μl of protein extract, 100 μl ofd-luciferin (1 mm), 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (30 nm Tricine (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 3 mm ATP, 15 mm MgSO4, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm coenzyme A), and a pH of 7.8 were used. Measurements of light units were integrated over a 10-s interval. Data in raw luciferase units (RLU) were norm"
https://openalex.org/W2003607850,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is considered to belong to a class of transcription factors, the functions of which are exposed to redox regulation. We have recently demonstrated that thioredoxin (TRX), a cellular reducing catalyst, plays an important role in restoration of GR function in vivo under oxidative conditions. Although both the ligand binding domain and other domains of the GR have been suggested to be modulated by TRX, the molecular mechanism of the interaction is largely unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the GR, which is highly conserved among the nuclear receptors, is also responsible for communication with TRX in vivo. Mammalian two-hybrid assay and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay revealed the direct association between TRX and the GR DBD. Moreover, analysis of subcellular localization of TRX and the chimeric protein harboring herpes simplex viral protein 16 transactivation domain and the GR DBD indicated that the interaction might take place in the nucleus under oxidative conditions. Together these observations indicate that TRX, via a direct association with the conserved DBD motif, may represent a key mediator operating in interplay between cellular redox signaling and nuclear receptor-mediated signal transduction.

Aside from chemical oxidants/reductants, however, it largely remains to be elucidated which endogenous factor might be involved in redox regulation of transcription factors. A cellular reducing catalyst thioredoxin (TRX) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; TRX, thioredoxin; DBD, DNA binding domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; VP16, viral protein 16; Ref-1, redox factor-1; NLS, nuclear localization signal; LBD, ligand binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NFκB, nuclear factor κB. is a small protein with a molecular mass of 13 kDa, and acts as a potent disulfide reductase for a variety of target proteins (14Holmgren A.

Recently, TRX has been shown to interact, directly or indirectly, with several transcription factors. For example, TRX facilitates the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFκB by reducing Cys62 in the DNA binding loop of p50 subunit (4Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.-L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 16Okamoto T. Ogiwara H. Hayashi T. Mitsui A. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TRX has also been suggested to participate in redox regulation of AP-1 via interaction with another reducing catalyst, redox factor-1 (Ref-1) (17Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), which reduces conserved cysteine residues within the DNA binding domains of Fos and Jun (18Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 19Xanthoudakis S. Curran T.

A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). TRX has thus been suggested as a candidate endogenous molecule operating in the redox-regulation of gene expression via modulation of many transcription factors. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the superfamily of the nuclear receptors, comprising a central DNA binding domain (DBD), nuclear localization signals (NLSs), a ligand binding domain (LBD), and several transactivation functions (21Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 22Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar, 23Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). After binding hormone and dissociation of heat shock proteins, the GR translocates into the nucleus, thereby communicating with basal transcriptional machinery, coactivators, other transcription factors, and DNA and modulating target gene expression to produce pleiotropic glucocorticoid hormone actions (24Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 25Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Numerous biochemical studies have demonstrated that GR function in vitro is subject to redox modulation, via reversible modification of functionally and structurally critical cysteine residues within the GR; oxidative treatment of the GR reduces both ligand binding activity (27Chakraborti P.K.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 406-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and binding to DNA cellulose (29Hutchison K.A. Matic G. Meshinchi S. Bresnick E.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10505-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Bodwell J.E. Holbrook N.J. Munck A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that metal ions that have high affinity for thiols interfere GR functions in living cells, plausibly via similar modification of cysteine thiols (31Makino Y. Tanaka H. Dahlman-Wright K. Makino I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 612-620PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has shown that cellular redox state is an important determinant of GR function in vivo and that TRX is implicated in redox regulation of GR function; GR-mediated gene expression is suppressed by oxidative treatment of cells, which overexpression of TRX counteracts (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Suggested mechanisms are 1) that TRX may preserve ligand binding activity of the GR, in accordance with previous biochemical observations showing that ligand binding activity of cytosolic GR is maintained by the presence of TRX systems (TRX and TRX reductase) (33Grippo J.F. Tienrungroj W. Dahmer K.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13658-13664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) that the nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transactivation of the GR may also be influenced by TRX. The precise mechanisms of molecular interplay between the GR and TRX, however, are not yet well understood. To explore the molecular mechanism of redox regulation of GR function with particular reference to its interaction with TRX, we here report that the conserved DBD of the GR, independent of the LBD, is a target for redox regulation by TRX. Mechanistically, direct association between the DBD and TRX in the nucleus was shown by mammalian two-hybrid and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. Thus, we suggest that TRX may play a critical role allowing cellular redox potential to modulate steroid hormone receptor-mediated gene expression. COS7, CV-1, and HeLa cells were obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics. The human GR overexpressing (300,000–500,000 molecules/cell) Chinese hamster ovary-pMTGR cells (35Alksnis M. Barkhem T. Strömstedt P.-E. Ahola H. Kutoh E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Nilson S. J.

Nilsson (Karo Bio, Huddinge, Sweden) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in the presence of cadmium and zinc ions, each at a concentration of 40 μm. In all experiments, serum was stripped with dextran-coated charcoal, and cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Diamide and dexamethasone were purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant TRX was produced according to the method described previously and kindly provided by Ajinomoto Co. Inc., Basic Research Laboratory (Kawasaki, Japan) (36Tagaya Y. Wakasugi H. Masutani H. Nakamura S. Iwata S. Mitsui A. Fujii S. Wakasugi N. Tursz T. Yodoi J. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1279-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of TRX was prepared as described previously (37Tagaya Y. Okada M. Sugie K. Kasahara T. Kondo N. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K.-I. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Anti-GST polyclonal antibody was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa Syuzo (Kyoto, Japan). The expression vectors for the wild-type and mutant GR, RShGRα and I550, respectively, have been described elsewhere (38Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and were kindly supplied by Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The expression plasmids for TRX and antisense TRX, pcDSRαADF and pASADF, respectively, have also previously been described (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To construct expression plasmids for fusion protein VP16 transactivation domain and the DBD of the human GR with or without constitutive NLS, NL1, the DNA fragments encoding 129 amino acids (serine 403 to leucine 532) or 87 amino acids (serine 403 to alanine 490) of the human GR were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate flanking sequences for enzymatic cleavage and inserted into the BamHI site of the parent pCMX-VP16 (39Perlman T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), resulting in pCMX-VP16-GR DBD and pCMX-VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, respectively. Construction of the expression plasmid for the fusion protein of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (40Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and TRX has been previously described (17Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused chimeric protein, pCMX-GFP-VP16-GR DBD and pCMX-GFP-VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, were made by inserting a polymerase chain reaction-cloned DNA fragments encoding VP16-GR DBD and VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, respectively, into the pCMX-GFP vector (41Ogawa H. Inoue S. Tsujii F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid-responsive reporter construct pGRE-Luc (31Makino Y. Tanaka H. Dahlman-Wright K. Makino I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 612-620PubMed Google Scholar) and the GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter tk-GALpx3-Luc (17Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) were previously described. The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency when appropriate. Partially purified GR was prepared from Chinese hamster ovary-pMTGR whole cell extract essentially as described by Cairns et al. (42Cairns W. Cairns C. Pongratz I. Poellinger L. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11221-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extracts were prepared in the presence of molybdate and chromatographed through a phosphocellulose column. The flow-through material was then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column, and the absorbed material was eluted with 200 mm NaCl. Salt and molybdate were removed from the pooled, eluted material by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. After transformation (25 °C for 60 min), the receptor fraction was further purified by fast protein liquid anion-exchange Mono Q chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing receptor were identified by ligand binding and specific DNA binding assays. These fractions contained 10–20% pure receptor and were used for protein-DNA interaction experiments. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out as described previously (43Tanaka H. Makino Y. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-Å. Okamoto K. Makino I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 938-945PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, partially purified GR (usually 10 ng of protein per reaction) was incubated with 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled GRE oligonucleotide (5′-CGAGTAGCTAGAACAGACTGTTCTGAGG-3′) probe in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm spermidine, 0.25 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min on ice. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (1× TBE is 89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The gels were run at 350 V for 2 h and dried. Results were visualized by autoradiography. Cells grown on 8-chambered sterile glass slides (Nippon Becton & Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) were fixed for immunostaining using a freshly prepared solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described previously with minor modification (44Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation, cells were washed five times with PBS at room temperature and incubated with anti-human TRX monoclonal mouse antibody at 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 9 h at 4 °C. The cells were then again washed five times with PBS and incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed a further five times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed a final five times with PBS and mounted with GEL/MOUNTTM (Biomeda Co. Ltd., Foster City, CA) for examination on a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Karl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). Transient transfection was performed as described previously (31Makino Y. Tanaka H. Dahlman-Wright K. Makino I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 612-620PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on plastic culture dishes (IWAKI Glass, Funabashi, Japan) to 30–50% confluence and washed with PBS three times, and medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid mixture was mixed with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI) and added to the culture. After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, and the cells further cultured in the presence or absence of various ligands for 24 h. After normalization of transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase expression, luciferase enzyme activity was determined in a luminometer (Berthold GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany) essentially as described before (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For the construction of the expression plasmid for GST-GR DBD fusion protein, the DNA fragment encoding the DNA binding domain (serine 403 to leucine 532) of the human GR was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated in frame into the BamHI site of the pGEX4T-3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cell pellets were suspended in PBS containing 1 mm ZnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were incubated with 200 μg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 ml of elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol before storage at −80 °C. The protein was characterized by Western blot analysis. Bacterially expressed GST-GR DBD fusion protein (10 μg) or GST (5 μg) was incubated with 45 μg of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 250 μl of PBS at room temperature for 30 min. After being washed three times, the beads were incubated with 10 μg of recombinant TRX in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, with or without 5 mm diamide at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were then washed five times, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (20% v/v glycerol, 4.6% w/v SDS, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol), and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were then electrically transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with appropriate antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the ECL Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As described above, we hypothesized that TRX may preserve GR-dependent gene expression under oxidative conditions (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To further explore this hypothesis, we manipulated cellular TRX levels by means of transfection of either sense or antisense TRX expression plasmids and tested glucocorticoid-dependent reporter gene expression under oxidative conditions. HeLa cells were transfected with the GR expression plasmid, the glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid, and either TRX or antisense TRX expression plasmid, and cultured in the presence of 100 nm dexamethasone and 1 mmH2O2 as indicated (Fig.1). As reported previously (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), treatment with H2O2 resulted in an approximately 3-fold decrease in hormone induction response (lanes 1–3). When TRX was overexpressed, the repression effect of H2O2 was dose-dependently abolished (lanes 4–6, hatched columns). In contrast, reduction of cellular TRX levels, accomplished by expression of antisense TRX (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 45Yokomizo A. Ono M. Nanri H. Makino Y. Ohga T. Wada M. Okamoto T. Yodoi J. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4293-4296PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in increased sensitivity to H2O2 and a further decrease in hormone induction (lanes 4–6, filled columns). This indicates that cellular TRX levels are an important determinant of glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression in oxidative conditions. We next studied the subcellular localization of TRX in HeLa cells using indirect immunofluorescent analysis. HeLa cells were cultured in the presence or absence of H2O2 for 2 h and then fixed for immunodetection of TRX. In the absence of H2O2, TRX is mainly found in the cytoplasm, with some cells showing partial nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 2, left panel). However, in the presence of H2O2, the majority of the cells showed nuclear-predominant TRX fluorescence (right panel), indicating that TRX translocates into the nucleus under oxidative conditions. If TRX translocates into the nucleus under oxidative conditions, it is likely that TRX interacts with the GR in the nucleus to restore the transactivational function of the GR. The GR mutant I550 (which lacks the ligand binding domain, is constitutively present in the nucleus even in the absence of hormone (46Jewell C.M. Webster J.C. Burnstein K.L. Sar M. Bodwell J.E. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and acts as a ligand-independent transcriptional activator (47Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar)) was shown to be sensitive to oxidative stress (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, suppression of I550-mediated gene expression either by treatment with H2O2 (Fig.3 A) or antisense TRX expression (Fig. 3 B) is similar to that seen for wild-type GR (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), further evidence for the nuclear location of the GR-TRX interaction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using either partially purified full-length GR (Fig. 4) or the recombinant GR DBD (32Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) revealed that sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the GR is abolished by addition of the oxidative reagent diamide, and progressively restored by addition of recombinant TRX. Based on these results and the fact that the GR DBD contains several cysteine residues as a part of the zinc finger structures (22Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar), we speculated that the DBD of the GR could be one of the targets of TRX in the nucleus. To further examine this possibility, we constructed expression plasmids for fusion proteins of the GR DBD with or without the constitutive NLS (NL1) plus the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein, VP16-GR DBD and VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Note that transactivation domain of VP16 does not contain cysteine residues (48Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). When these chimeric proteins were expressed as a fusion protein with GFP in COS7 cells, VP16-GR DBD was shown to be constitutively localized in the nucleus, whereas VP16-GR DBDΔNL1 was exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 5 C shows that VP16-GR DBD but not VP16-GR DBDΔNL1 acts as a GRE-specific constitutive transcriptional activator. Neither VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, VP16, nor a fusion protein of the VP16 activation domain plus GAL4 DBD (VP16-GAL4) transactivates the GRE-driven reporter plasmid (Fig.5 C).Figure 5A, schematic presentation of fusion proteins VP16-GR DBD and VP16-GR DBDΔNL1. B, subcellular localization of GFP-VP16-GR DBD and GFP-VP16-GR DBDΔNL1. COS7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of GFP-VP16-GR DBD or GFP-VP16-GR DBDΔNL1 expression plasmids. After 24 h of transfection, subcellular localization of expressed chimeric proteins was examined by fluorescence microscopy. C, VP16-GR DBD activates gene expression through sequence-specific interaction with GRE in a ligand-independent manner. COS7 cells were grown in 60-mm-diameter culture dishes and transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmids pGRE-Luc or tk-GALpx3-Luc and 100 ng of the expression plasmids for VP16-GR DBD, VP16-GR DBDΔNL1, VP16-GAL4, and VP16. The cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection, and cellular luciferase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expressed luciferase activities when the cells were transfected with each reporter plasmid alone served as controls (columns 1 and 6). Results are plotted as mean ± S.D. of three experiments. D,H2O2-mediated repression and TRX-mediated restoration of the GR DBD-GRE interaction in living cells. COS7 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pGRE-Luc reporter, 100 ng of VP16-GR DBD expression plasmid, and various amounts of TRX expression plasmid pcDSRαADF, as indicated. The cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h, and then cellular luciferase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as fold induction compared with the cells without either cotransfection of any expression plasmids or treatment with H2O2.

https://openalex.org/W2110789463,"Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) localize the second messenger response to particular subcellular domains by sequestration of the type II protein kinase A. Previously, AKAP120 was identified from a rabbit gastric parietal cell cDNA library; however, a monoclonal antibody raised against AKAP120 labeled a 350-kDa band in Western blots of parietal cell cytosol. Recloning has now revealed that AKAP120 is a segment of a larger protein, AKAP350. We have now obtained a complete sequence of human gastric AKAP350 as well as partial cDNA sequences from human lung and rabbit parietal cells. The genomic region containing AKAP350 is found on chromosome 7q21 and is multiply spliced, producing at least three distinct AKAP350 isoforms as well as yotiao, a protein associated with theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Rabbit parietal cell AKAP350 is missing a sequence corresponding to a single exon in the middle of the molecule located just after the yotiao homology region. Two carboxyl-terminal splice variants were also identified. Both of the major splice variants showed tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that AKAP350 was associated with centrosomes in many cell types. In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, AKAP350 localized asymmetrically to one pole of the centrosome, and nocodazole did not alter its localization. During the cell cycle, AKAP350 was associated with the centrosomes as well as with the cleavage furrow during anaphase and telophase. Several epithelial cell types also demonstrated noncentrosomal pools of AKAP350, especially parietal cells, which contained multiple cytosolic immunoreactive foci throughout the cells. The localization of AKAP350 suggests that it may regulate centrosomal and noncentrosomal cytoskeletal systems in many different cell types. Protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) localize the second messenger response to particular subcellular domains by sequestration of the type II protein kinase A. Previously, AKAP120 was identified from a rabbit gastric parietal cell cDNA library; however, a monoclonal antibody raised against AKAP120 labeled a 350-kDa band in Western blots of parietal cell cytosol. Recloning has now revealed that AKAP120 is a segment of a larger protein, AKAP350. We have now obtained a complete sequence of human gastric AKAP350 as well as partial cDNA sequences from human lung and rabbit parietal cells. The genomic region containing AKAP350 is found on chromosome 7q21 and is multiply spliced, producing at least three distinct AKAP350 isoforms as well as yotiao, a protein associated with theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Rabbit parietal cell AKAP350 is missing a sequence corresponding to a single exon in the middle of the molecule located just after the yotiao homology region. Two carboxyl-terminal splice variants were also identified. Both of the major splice variants showed tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that AKAP350 was associated with centrosomes in many cell types.

The localization of AKAP350 suggests that it may regulate centrosomal and noncentrosomal cytoskeletal systems in many different cell types. Transduction of signals from extracellular stimuli is most commonly accomplished via ligand-receptor binding and generation of a second messenger response. While increases in intracellular second messengers have traditionally been viewed as global cellular events, second messenger effects are often limited to particular regions or organelles within cells. Investigations over the past decade have led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the compartmentalization of second messenger effects. These studies have identified a diverse group of scaffolding proteins that sequester both protein kinases and protein phosphatases within specific cellular domains (1Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

A growing group of AKAPs that bind the regulatory subunit of type II protein kinase A (RII) have been reported over the past several years. The first RII-binding protein was identified over 15 years ago when microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) was described (3Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

More recently, an AKAP with binding capacity for the regulatory subunits of type I protein kinase A has also been reported (11Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).A number of AKAPs are associated with the cell cytoskeleton and appear to regulate plasma membrane events possibly through anchoring at the sites of interaction between cytoskeletal elements and membrane receptors and channels. Ezrin, a member of the ERM family of F-actin-associated proteins that is phosphorylated in response to mediators that elevate cAMP responses in gastric parietal cells (12Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K.

Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9327-9333Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), localizes the type II protein kinase A to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of membrane channel activity. Similarly, protein kinase A anchoring to the postsynaptic densities (15Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

AKAP15 targets type II protein kinase A to L-type calcium channels in transverse tubules of skeletal muscle and influences rapid voltage-dependent potentiation (17Gray P.C. Johnson B.D.

MAP-2 binds type II protein kinase A and sequesters it in association with dendritic microtubules (4Miller P. Walter U. Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MAP-2 by protein kinase A inhibits microtubule nucleation in vitro (3Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3284-3290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of all of these AKAPs suggests that specific scaffolding functions can account for subcellular signaling specificity.We have previously reported the cloning and initial characterization of a protein kinase A-anchoring protein, AKAP120, from a rabbit gastric parietal cell cDNA library (18Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Yeh J. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is now apparent that the initial AKAP120 sequence is a fragment of a larger 350-kDa AKAP (AKAP350). We have completed the sequence of human AKAP350, which represents a multiply spliced family of proteins coded for by a single gene sequence on human chromosome 7q21. Immunolocalization demonstrates that AKAP350 is associated with centrosomes in many cells and also shows noncentrosomal organization in certain epithelial cells, including gastric parietal cells.DISCUSSIONProtein kinase A-anchoring proteins represent a diverse superfamily of scaffolding proteins. This report clarifies the characteristics of a novel multiply spliced AKAP family. Monoclonal antibodies raised against AKAP120 identified proteins of 350 and 250 kDa in most tissues and cells. AKAP120 was originally cloned from a rabbit parietal cell cDNA expression library using32P-labeled RII as a probe. The single clone isolated yielded an open reading frame of 3500-nt cDNA coding for a recombinant expressed protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa (18Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Yeh J. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As described above, eukaryotic expression of this AKAP sequence as a fusion with the EGFP indicated that the AKAP120 clone could not account for the endogenous 350-kDa immunoreactive species. The results of our cloning experiments reported here show that the original clone was not full-length and included an erroneous stop codon. The full-length sequence of AKAP350 contains at least two major areas for alternative splicing. In addition, genomic sequence also contains a major spliced product that codes for the previously described yotiao protein (29Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present sequence length matches the major mRNA length observed in rabbit and human tissues of over 11 kb. Our results demonstrate that splice variants may be differentially distributed among tissue and cell types. Indeed, since smaller 9.5-kb species of mRNA have been identified in Northern blots, it is possible that further splice variants may be present.Previously, a multiply spliced murine AKAP gene has been described, yielding six isoforms, collectively known as AKAP-KL (30Dong F. Feldmesser M. Casadevall A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6533-6541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Parallel cloning of the AKAP350 in both rabbit and human has revealed multiple splice variants. Additionally, the existence of the yotiao protein coding region as a 5′-end splice variant indicates that the AKAP350 genomic region produces a complex family of protein products from internal alternative exon splicing as well as alternative splicing at both the 5′- and 3′-ends. The function of specific spliced exons remains to be determined. It is tempting to suggest that specific spliced exons may account for proper targeting of the AKAP or interaction with specific proteins. This possibility appears especially possible for the highly spliced region within BAC AA0066, which contains the alternate splice point for the terminal exon of yotiao as well as the major internal alternatively spliced exon in AKAP350, immediately following the yotiao homology region. The AKAP350 sequence lacking this exon was the major sequence in rabbit parietal cells as well as in most gastrointestinal mucosae. In contrast, the sequence including this 140-nt sequence was predominant in gastric wall smooth muscle and brain tissue. Interestingly, this exon includes a pair of adjacent cysteines, perhaps indicative of a possible covalent cross-linking point either for homodimerization or interaction with other proteins.A second major splice variation occurs at the C terminus of AKAP350 as described above. The AKAP350 sequence isolated from the tracheal cDNA library results in an alternative 16 carboxyl-terminal amino acids not found in the human gastric or the promyeloblast sequence due to a splice variant in the next to last exon. Since the end of this exon coincides with multiple consecutive adenosines, it is unlikely that this is the true 3′-end in this mRNA. It is more probable that oligo(dT) priming occurred internally at the polyadenine in the mRNA 3′-untranslated region. Analysis of this splice variant has demonstrated its presence in several tissues. However, while both 3′ splice variant sequences were detected in whole lung cDNA, when we examined cDNA from CalU3 cells (a lung serous cell line) and a human bronchial epithelial cell line, we were unable to detect the 3′ splice variant originally isolated from the bronchial epithelial cell library. Since the library was constructed from only an enriched population of tracheal epithelial cells, it seems likely that the message must emanate from a nonepithelial lung cell. These data further suggest that there is a cell-specific distribution of these AKAP350 isoforms. In addition to the two major splice variants, the PMY2245 expressed sequenced tag cDNA also demonstrated a minor splice variant yielding a deletion of eight amino acids (24 nt) because of an alternate splice donor choice. Given the theoretical function of AKAPs, it appears reasonable that these splice variants may define either specific intracellular targeting for particular AKAP350 isoforms in different cell types or their association with specific scaffolding components.Alternative splicing of this nature has been well characterized in several complex spliced protein families including odorant receptors (31Breer H. Wanner I. Strotmann J. Behav. Genet. 1996; 26: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), neurexins (32Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Sudhaf T.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and myofibrillar proteins (33Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Breitbart R.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Contractile protein genes provide a model system for study of this process. Either a particular gene among members of a multigene family is selected for expression or a spectrum of different proteins may be generated from a single gene. A prime example of both is found in troponin T, a member of the thin filament of vertebrate sarcomere with specific subtypes in cardiac as well as fast and slow skeletal muscle (Tc, Tf, Ts). Each subtype is coded by a gene with a unique promoter region and terminates at a single polyadenylation site. Within each subtype, however, a series of adjacent exons are intermittently spliced out, forming a large number of isoforms (32 for Tf) coded by the same gene. Gene transcripts are assembled from variations in both donor and acceptor splice site selection (33Nadal-Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. Patton J.G. Breitbart R.E. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The results of our investigations have shown that AKAP350 and yotiao are products of the same genomic region on chromosome 7q21. Yotiao was identified as a protein in brain that interacts with the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (29Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the regions that mediate this interaction also are present in the amino-terminal region of AKAP350. Examination of the genomic sequence region upstream of the yotiao coding region suggests that there is a GC-rich putative promoter region. The genomic region upstream of the 5′-end of the AKAP350 sequence contains a putative TATA box and other putative regulatory elements. Thus, the two proteins probably have separate transcriptional regulators. The 14G2 antibody that we have used in our immunolocalization studies recognizes a region of AKAP350 that is not contained in yotiao. Thus, our localization studies are specific for AKAP350. In contrast, the antibodies used in studies of yotiao are raised against regions that are predicted to cross-react with AKAP350 (29Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, it is interesting to note that the size of the major species observed in whole brain was considerably larger than the size of yotiao protein exogenously expressed in fibroblasts (29Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the assignment of yotiao staining and distribution may need to be reevaluated with more specific antisera against the far amino or carboxyl termini of yotiao. In addition, it will be of interest to identify whether AKAP350 in brain also interacts with an NMDA receptor.An extensive amount of study has been dedicated to elucidating the function of the centrosome and its components as they relate to the general physiology of the cell. The centrosome is the principal microtubule organizing center in most cells, composed of a pair of centrioles and a surrounding matrix, also referred to as the pericentriolar material. Each centriole has bilateral appendages at one pole known as transitional fibers (34Szollosi D. J. Cell Biol. 1964; 21: 465-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin is a major component of the centriole cores in a variety of cells (35Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), and several studies suggest that this protein may be essential for microtubule nucleation from centrosomes (36Joshi H.C. Palacios M.J. McNamara L. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 1992; 356: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). As one might expect for an organelle central to cytoskeletal organization, a number of regulatory molecules also are associated with the centrosome. The importance of protein phosphorylation in microtubule nucleation is underscored by the presence of the p34cdc2 kinase and type II protein kinase A at the centrosome (7DeCamilli P. Moretti M. Donini S.D. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Nigg E.A. Schafer G. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M.

Keryer et al.(9Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exper. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) subsequently studied the distribution of RII isoforms α and β in a human lymphoblast cell line, finding the RII-β localized to the Golgi-centrosomal area. The characteristics of the 350-kDa AKAP that we have cloned appear similar to those of the centrosomal AKAP350 identified by Keryer et al. (9Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exper. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in an RII blot overlay of isolated centrosome proteins from the KE37 human lymphoblast cell line. These investigators immunoprecipitated the protein using the serum 0013 polyclonal antibody, previously reported as a specific marker for human centrosomes (20Komesli S. Tournier F. Paintrand M. Margolis R.L. Job D. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2869-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Gosti-Testu F. Marty M.C. Berges F. Maunoury R. Bornens M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No further characterization of this protein in the literature has been submitted, however, since the initial report. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that this protein may indeed be identical to the protein cloned here. First, Western blots with our 14G2 monoclonal antibody show a similar pattern of 250- and 350-kDa proteins as seen by Keryer et al. (9Keryer G. Rios R.M. Landmark B.F. Skalhegg B. Lohmann S.M. Bornens M. Exper. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with the 0013 polyclonal serum and RII overlays. Second, immunocytochemistry with the 14G2 monoclonal antibody also shows prominent localization of the protein with the centrosomes of both polarized and nonpolarized cells. Third, as noted for the AKAP350 protein previously described, the distribution of 14G2 immunoreactive protein in MDCK cells was not altered by treatment of cells with nocodozole.AKAPs are well characterized as scaffolding proteins, sequestering the RII subunit and consequently the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase A in a location where phosphorylation of a particular substrate will be needed for some key regulatory process (39Dell'Acqua M.L. Scoot J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 40Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Centrosomes, as the site of microtubule nucleation and mitotic spindle formation as well as a binding site for several centrosome-associated proteins, provide a host of possible substrates for regulation by protein kinase A phosphorylation. A role for AKAPs in microtubule nucleation has previously been established in the case of MAP-2 (3Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3284-3290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In immunocytochemical analysis, γ-tubulin has become the marker of choice for the centrosomes; however, it is now clear that many cell types also have noncentrosomal pools of γ-tubulin. This does not seem to be the case in the MDCK cell line, where γ-tubulin staining and AKAP350 were limited to the discrete pair of centrioles forming the centrosome. Parietal cells, at the other end of the spectrum, display multiple foci of AKAP350 labeling throughout the cell. These other sites do not correlate with γ-tubulin staining in parietal cells. While most tissues and cells demonstrate AKAP350 distribution in association with centrosomes, several epithelial cells also showed noncentrosomal staining patterns. In the human airway epithelial cell line, for example, the majority of AKAP350 staining appears at the centrosome; however, it is also apparent in a lateral subapical pattern. Similar permutations of AKAP350 distribution in these and other epithelial cells (e.g. colonic epithelial cells) allow us to speculate that the protein kinase A is probably targeted to cytoskeletal elements other than centrosomes in many cell types.Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated AKAP350 staining associated with large globular complexes scattered throughout the cytosol of parietal cells, lending support to the idea that this protein is part of a complex of regulatory molecules. The presence of multiple AKAP350-containing structures in parietal cells may reflect its involvement in the massive cytoskeletal reorganization that takes place when parietal cells are stimulated to secrete acid (27Soroka C.J. Chew C.S. Modlin I.M. Hanzel D. Smolka A. Goldenring J.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 76-87PubMed Google Scholar). Other less differentiated cell types, especially those that have undergone transformation into a phase of unregulated growth, may require AKAP350 simply for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome; hence, the distribution is strictly limited to this organelle. Examination of the mitotic spindle apparatus in the stages of mitosis in HeLa and HCT116 colon adenocarcinoma cells demonstrated the presence of AKAP350 not only at the centrosome throughout mitosis but also at the cleavage furrow in anaphase and telophase for both cell types. This finding might suggest a possible role for AKAP350 in establishment or activation of contraction to form the contractile ring in telophase cells. Interestingly, no RII was observed in association with AKAP350 in the cleavage furrow. This may suggest that an alternate splice variant, different from centrosomal AKAP350, is associated with a different cytoskeletal system. Of note, the extensive coiled-coil structure in AKAP350 shows homology not only to centrosome-associated proteins (e.g. pericentrin) but also to intermediate filament-associated proteins and myosins. In addition to alternate cytoskeletal association, it is also likely that AKAP350 is scaffolding other regulators beyond type II protein kinase A. Along these lines, AKAP79 is associated with both protein phosphatase and protein kinase C (28Klauk T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Further investigations will be required to elucidate components of the AKAP350 scaffolding complex and the basis of its cytoskeletal targeting.In summary, we have cloned and characterized a new family of 350-kDa AKAPs that are the products of a multiply spliced gene region that also produces the previously described yotiao protein. In most tissues, AKAP350 localizes to the centrosome. However, in several epithelial cell types, multiple extracentrosomal foci are present. These results suggest that AKAP350 may be a multifunctional scaffolding protein. Transduction of signals from extracellular stimuli is most commonly accomplished via ligand-receptor binding and generation of a second messenger response. While increases in intracellular second messengers have traditionally been viewed as global cellular events, second messenger effects are often limited to particular regions or organelles within cells. Investigations over the past decade have led to a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the compartmentalization of second messenger effects. These studies have identified a diverse group of scaffolding proteins that sequester both protein kinases and protein phosphatases within specific cellular domains (1Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2165406289,"To investigate the interactions that determine DNA polymerase accuracy, we have measured the fidelity of 26 mutants with amino acid substitutions in the polymerase domain of a 3′-5′-exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment. Most of these mutant polymerases synthesized DNA with an apparent fidelity similar to that of the wild-type control, suggesting that fidelity at the polymerase active site depends on highly specific enzyme-substrate interactions and is not easily perturbed. In addition to the previously studied Y766A mutator, four novel base substitution mutators were identified; they are R668A, R682A, E710A, and N845A. Each of these five mutator alleles results from substitution of a highly conserved amino acid side chain located on the exposed surface of the polymerase cleft near the polymerase active site. Analysis of base substitution errors at four template positions indicated that each of the five mutator polymerases has its own characteristic error specificity, suggesting that the Arg-668, Arg-682, Glu-710, Tyr-766, and Asn-845 side chains may contribute to polymerase fidelity in a variety of different ways. We separated the contributions of the nucleotide insertion and mismatch extension steps by using a novel fidelity assay that scores base substitution errors during synthesis to fill a single nucleotide gap (and hence does not require mismatch extension) and by measuring the rates of polymerase-catalyzed mismatch extension reactions. The R682A, E710A, Y766A, and N845A mutations cause decreased fidelity at the nucleotide insertion step, whereas R668A results in lower fidelity in both nucleotide insertion and mismatch extension. Relative to wild type, several Klenow fragment mutants showed substantially more discrimination against extension of a T·G mismatch under the conditions of the fidelity assay, providing one explanation for the anti-mutator phenotypes of mutants such as R754A and Q849A. To investigate the interactions that determine DNA polymerase accuracy, we have measured the fidelity of 26 mutants with amino acid substitutions in the polymerase domain of a 3′-5′-exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment. Most of these mutant polymerases synthesized DNA with an apparent fidelity similar to that of the wild-type control, suggesting that fidelity at the polymerase active site depends on highly specific enzyme-substrate interactions and is not easily perturbed. In addition to the previously studied Y766A mutator, four novel base substitution mutators were identified; they are R668A, R682A, E710A, and N845A. Each of these five mutator alleles results from substitution of a highly conserved amino acid side chain located on the exposed surface of the polymerase cleft near the polymerase active site.

Relative to wild type, several Klenow fragment mutants showed substantially more discrimination against extension of a T·G mismatch under the conditions of the fidelity assay, providing one explanation for the anti-mutator phenotypes of mutants such as R754A and Q849A. Three steps are responsible for the high fidelity of DNA replication; they are nucleotide selectivity and exonucleolytic proofreading of errors by the polymerase and post-synthetic correction of mismatches. Among these, the DNA polymerase itself usually provides the greatest contribution to fidelity, producing on average only one substitution error for every 104 to 105nucleotides incorporated, depending on the polymerase (1Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18251-18254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase errors can be initiated either by misinsertion of a nucleotide or by misalignment of the template-primer. Either initiating event can ultimately result in base pair substitution, deletion, or addition. Using as a model system the extremely well characterized Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, our approach for understanding the structural basis for polymerase fidelity has been to screen a battery of amino acid substitutions directed to the active site region, including side chains thought to be involved in nucleotide binding and interactions with primer and template. Polymerases from different families share fundamental similarities in tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 2Arnold E. Ding J. Hughes S.H. Hostomsky Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sousa R. Trends Biochem.

The polymerase domains resemble a partially open right hand, with a cleft formed by three subdomains that have been designated fingers, palm, and thumb. The palm subdomain, which forms the base of the polymerase cleft, contains important active site residues, in particular the cluster of carboxylate side chains that coordinate the pair of divalent metal ions that catalyze the polymerase reaction (6Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The fingers subdomain also contributes side chains to the active site, especially those involved in nucleotide recognition (7Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). The thumb subdomain interacts with the template-primer duplex upstream of the site of nucleotide addition (8Doublié S.

Many of the amino acid side chains that form the exposed surface of the polymerase cleft are highly conserved in their respective polymerase families. Although the only structural information for Klenow fragment with duplex DNA is an editing complex with the DNA primer terminus at the 3′-5′-exonuclease active site (12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), co-crystal structures with DNA at or close to the polymerase active site have been reported for other polymerases of the pol I 1The abbreviations used are: pol I, DNA polymerase I; Pu, purine. family. Binary polymerase·DNA complexes have been described for the DNA polymerase I of Thermus aquaticus (Taq DNA polymerase) (10Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and for the Klenow fragment analog derived fromBacillus stearothermophilus DNA polymerase I (11Kiefer J.R. Mao C. Braman J.C. Beese L.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and a ternary complex (polymerase·DNA·ddNTP) has been solved with the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 (8Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Because of the high degree of structural and sequence similarity, information from these three co-crystals can be used to interpret data obtained with Klenow fragment mutants. Klenow fragment catalyzes DNA synthesis with high fidelity, having an average base substitution error rate of ≈2 × 10−5and an average frameshift error rate of ≈5 × 10−6, even in the absence of exonucleolytic proofreading (13Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This polymerase discriminates against nucleotide misinsertion by having a lower binding affinity for the incorrect dNTP and a slower catalytic rate for misinsertion than for correct insertion (14Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); although the precise values vary from mispair to mispair, the rate discrimination is quantitatively larger than the nucleotide binding discrimination (15Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To date, two mutation sites that influence fidelity in Klenow fragment have been described. Substitution of Ser or Ala for Tyr-766, at the carboxyl terminus of the long O-helix in the fingers subdomain (see Fig. 1), results in decreased nucleotide selectivity during polymerization (15Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and a consequent increase in base substitution errors and frameshift errors at non-reiterated sequences (16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A Klenow fragment mutant that lacks 24 amino acids at the tip of the thumb subdomain has decreased DNA binding affinity and processivity and an increased rate of frameshift errors at homopolymeric sequences (17Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with the interactions of the thumb tip with the minor groove of the template-primer duplex that have been observed crystallographically (8Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 10Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A.

In this study we have screened a large number of mutations in the polymerase cleft region of an exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment, for effects on polymerase fidelity, and have identified four new mutator DNA polymerases, each with its own distinct error specificity. Bacterial strains and reagents for polymerase fidelity measurements have been described (18Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were from Research Genetics. The 20-mer primers, 5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCA and 5′-GTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCTCG, when annealed to the 33-mer template, (5′)ACGTCGTGACTGAGAAAACCCTGGCGTTACCCA, give a correct (T·A) or an incorrect (T·G) base pair, respectively, at the primer terminus. The template sequence corresponds to the region surrounding the opal codon introduced at positions 87–89 of the lacZα sequence, such that the primer terminal base is paired with the T of the TGA codon. Mutant derivatives of Klenow fragment were constructed and purified as described (19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Joyce C.M. Derbyshire V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Biochemical properties of the majority of these proteins have been reported previously (7Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol.

All polymerases in this study carried the D424A mutation, which eliminates the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity (23Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Reactions (25 μl) were performed as described previously (18Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), with 150 ng of gapped M13mp2 DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP. Wild-type or mutant polymerase was added to initiate synthesis. The amounts (in picomoles) of each enzyme needed to fill the gap completely, determined by electrophoresis of a portion of the reaction on a 0.8% agarose gel, were as follows: wild-type (D424A), 0.17; N579A, 0.2; S582A, 0.53; S608A, 2; T609A, 0.5; R631A, 1.2; K635A, 6.8; R668A, 7.2; S670A, 0.4; N675A, 0.87; Q677A, 40; N678A, 0.88; R682A, 0.48; S707A, 3.3; Q708A, 0.94; E710A, 20; H734A, 0.43; R754A, 1.6; K758A, 10; F762A, 0.95; Y766A, 9.6; R835L, 0.4; R841A, 1.3; N845A, 0.2; Q849A, 8.2; H881A, 0.49; and E883A, 1.8. Reactions were terminated by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. All reactions whose products were analyzed for lacZ mutant frequency yielded DNA that migrated with double-stranded nicked circular molecules in an agarose gel (data not shown). Reaction products were transfected intoE. coli and plated to score the color of M13 plaques, as described (18Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For the forward mutation assay, correct synthesis yields blue plaques, whereas a variety of polymerization errors are scored as light blue or colorless plaque phenotypes. Three reversion substrates were also used, with errors scored as blue revertants of a colorless plaque phenotype. Base substitutions were scored for eight of nine possible mispairs at a TGA codon at positions 87–89 in thelacZα sequence (24Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single base deletions were detected using a substrate containing an additional T in a TTTT run at positions 70–73. Plus one or −2 frameshifts were monitored in a substrate containing a run of 5 Ts at the same position but in the −1 reading frame (25Kroutil L.C. Register K. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An M13mp2 substrate having a single nucleotide gap opposite the template A of a TGA codon artificially introduced within the lacZα coding sequence was constructed and purified as described by Osheroff et al. (26Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; (in press): 274Google Scholar). DNA synthesis conditions were based on a slightly different short gap fidelity assay (27Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 150 fmol of gapped DNA, 1 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 400 units of T4 DNA ligase. DNA synthesis was initiated by addition of wild-type or mutant Klenow fragment derivatives in the amounts described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min, reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. Reaction products were fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and covalently closed circular products were isolated by electroelution from the agarose gel for transfection into E. coli strain MC1061 as above. The oligonucleotides described above were annealed so as to give a 3′-terminal G opposite a template T (mismatch substrate) and a 3′-terminal A opposite the same template T (control substrate). In either case the primer oligonucleotide was 5′-labeled with32P. Polymerase (≈2 μm) and DNA substrate (≈20 nm) were allowed to equilibrate in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and the reaction was initiated by addition of an equal volume of 2 mm dGTP (complementary to the next template nucleotide) in the same buffer. Samples were removed, either manually or using a rapid quench-flow instrument, at appropriate time intervals, quenched by addition of excess EDTA, and analyzed as described (22Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) to give the apparent first-order rate constant for nucleotide addition. The Klenow fragment mutations that we studied are indicated in Fig.1. Wild-type residues were replaced by Ala (or, in one case, Leu) in order to remove potentially important side chain interactions. The majority of these 28 side chains are highly conserved in the pol I family of polymerases (Fig.2) and all reside on or near the exposed surface of the cleft in the polymerase domain (Fig. 1). Most of the mutant proteins came from earlier studies on the role of side chains involved in catalysis and nucleotide binding within the polymerase active site region on the palm and fingers subdomains (7Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Polesky A.H. Dahlberg M.E. Benkovic S.J. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8417-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional mutations were made in side chains, primarily in the thumb subdomain, that were identified as contacts to the DNA duplex in the Klenow fragment·DNA editing complex (12Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In order to focus on fidelity-determining processes at the polymerase active site without complications due to exonucleolytic proofreading, all Klenow fragment derivatives in this study carried the 3′-5′-exonuclease-deficient D424A mutation (23Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For simplicity, each protein is described by the genotype of the polymerase domain; thus the D424A control is referred to as wild-type, and E710A denotes the double mutation D424A,E710A. We first measured the frequency of errors produced by each mutant polymerase during gap-filling synthesis across a lacZ target in phage M13mp2 (Fig. 2). The wild-type polymerase gave lacZ mutants at a frequency of 57 × 10−4 (Fig. 2), based on data from this and previous studies (13Bebenek K. Joyce C.M. Fitzgerald M.P. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13878-13887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Minnick D.T. Astatke M. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24954-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The D705A and D882A derivatives of Klenow fragment, which have very low catalytic activity, were unable to perform gap-filling synthesis even when a vast excess of polymerase was present in the reaction and were not investigated further. Of the remaining 26 proteins, the majority gave forward mutant frequencies similar to that of wild-type Klenow fragment. Several mutant derivatives, particularly R754A, Q849A, and H881A, gave lacZ mutants at frequencies lower than that observed for the wild-type enzyme. The R668A and Y766A polymerases gave mutants at 2.6- and 3.7-fold higher frequencies, respectively, than wild-type. The Y766A polymerase had previously been demonstrated to be a strong base substitution mutator (15Carroll S.S. Cowart M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 804-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The N678A, R682A, and E710A polymerases also gave smaller but reproducible increases in the frequency of lacZ mutants. Because the forward mutation assay detects many different types of errors in a variety of sequence contexts, substantial changes in particular subsets of errors may not be apparent unless large numbers of lacZ mutants are sequenced. For example, although the forward mutant frequency for the Y766A derivative was increased only 3.7-fold overall (Fig. 2), a detailed analysis of error specificity in the lacZ forward mutant assay indicated that this enzyme exhibited a 60-fold increase in misincorporation of dTMP opposite template G and greater than 10-fold increases in several other base substitution and deletion errors (16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study of 26 mutant polymerases, it was clearly impractical to sequence large collections of lacZ mutants generated by each enzyme (although this was done for a few enzymes, see legend to Fig. 2). We therefore decided to use a series of reversion assays that monitor base substitution or frameshift errors at specific template positions. These assays, which are highly sensitive due to low background mutation frequencies, were used to examine a number of different Klenow fragment derivatives, including those having forward mutant frequencies greater than the wild-type value. The first reversion substrate was an M13mp2 DNA with a 361-base gap containing a TGA codon at position 87–89 in the lacZα mutation target (TGA89assay). Base substitution errors resulting from eight of the nine possible mispairs are detectable as blue plaque revertants (24Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these eight, reversion to the wild-type coding sequence via an A·dCTP mispair results in a dark blue plaque phenotype that is easily distinguished on indicator plates (24Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4450-4459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other seven mispairs all yield revertants having a similar light blue plaque color, necessitating sequence analysis or hybridization probing to define error specificity for these mispairs. The average reversion frequency obtained in the TGA89 assay for the wild-type Klenow fragment was 17 × 10−5(Table I). A 6-fold increase was observed with the known base substitution mutator, Y766A (16Bell J.B. Eckert K.A. Joyce C.M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7345-7351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), serving as a positive control. Four other mutant derivatives (R668A, R682A, E710A, and N845A) also showed an increase in base substitution errors relative to the wild-type enzyme. The R754A and Q849A enzymes gave reversion frequencies lower than the wild-type value. The reversion frequencies obtained with the rest of the mutant enzymes that were tested were not significantly different from that of wild-type Klenow fragment (TableI).Table IlacZα revertants generated during synthesis by wild-type and mutant derivatives of Klenow fragmentEnzyme1-aAll the proteins in this study carry the D424A (exonuclease-deficient) mutation.Plaque numberReversion frequency1-bThe first three columns show complete data from a single experiment.

Open table in a new tab The DNA sequences of revertants generated by the four new mutator polymerases were compared with those generated by the wild-type enzyme, in order to determine error rates for each of the eight detectable mispairs at the TGA codon (Table II). Remarkably, 127 of 136 revertants recovered after gap-filling by the E710A mutant polymerase had the dark blue plaque phenotype characteristic of misinsertion of dCMP opposite template adenine, making the E710A polymerase a 70-fold mutator for this particular error at the opal codon site. Revertants produced by the R668A, R682A, and N845A mutant polymerases, on the other hand, gave predominantly light blue plaques and were characterized further by DNA sequencing (see below).Table IIBase substitution error specificity for mutator polymerases in two opal codon reversion assaysMutationMispairWild-typeR668AR682AE710AN845ARev.E.R.2-aError rates (E.R.), defined as errors per detectable nucleotide incorporated, were calculated by dividing the number of revertants (Rev.) obtained for each substitution error by the total number of mutants sequenced and then multiplying by the reversion frequency (from Table I).

We investigated the effects of a novel chromogranin A catecholamine release-inhibitory fragment, catestatin (chromogranin A<sub>344–364</sub>), on agonist-induced desensitization of catecholamine release from pheochromocytoma cells. In a dose-dependent fashion, the nicotinic antagonist catestatin blocked agonist desensitization of both catecholamine release (IC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 0.24 μm) and<sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake (IC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 0.31 μm), the initial step in nicotinic cationic signal transduction; both secretion inhibition and blockade of desensitization were noncompetitive with agonist. Desensitizing effects of the nicotinic agonists nicotine and epibatidine were blocked. This antagonist action was specific to desensitization by nicotinic agonists, since catestatin did not block desensitization of catecholamine release induced by agents which bypass the nicotinic receptor. Hill plots with slopes near unity suggested noncooperativity for catestatin effects on both nicotinic responses (secretory antagonism and blockade of desensitization). Human, bovine, and rat catestatins (as well as substance P) had similar potencies. IC<sub>50</sub> values for secretion inhibition and blockade of desensitization paralleled each other (<i>r</i> = 0.76,<i>n</i> = 10 antagonists, <i>p</i> = 0.01) for several noncompetitive nicotinic antagonists. Peptide nicotinic antagonists (catestatins, substance P) were far more potent inhibitors of both secretion (<i>p</i> = 0.019) and desensitization (<i>p</i> = 0.005) than nonpeptide antagonists (trimethaphan, hexamethonium, procaine, phencyclidine, cocaine, or clonidine), and the peptides displayed enhanced selectivity to block desensitization <i>versus</i> secretion (<i>p</i> = 0.003). We conclude that catestatin is a highly potent, dose-dependent, noncompetitive, noncooperative, specific inhibitor of nicotinic desensitization, an effect which may have implications for control of catecholamine release."

We investigated the binding of phospholipid vesicles to the monocytic leukemia cell lines THP-1 and J774A.1 with a flow cytometric assay; vesicles contained 50 mol% PtdSer, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), or phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro), with the balance being phosphatidylcholine. Specific, high affinity binding was observed for vesicles containing PtdSer, PtdIns, or PtdGro. Specificity of the assay was confirmed by control experiments with erythrocytes, which showed minimal vesicle binding, and with annexin V, which blocked the binding of PtdSer, PtdGro, and PtdIns vesicles to the THP-1 cells. However, O-phospho-l-serine (to 1 mm) had no effect on the binding of PtdSer vesicles, indicating that high affinity binding requires a surface containing multiple phosphoserine groups rather than a single molecule. A monoclonal antibody to CD36 blocked up to 60% of the specific binding of PtdSer vesicles but had minimal to no effect on the binding of PtdGro or PtdIns vesicles. This antibody also selectively inhibited the phagocytosis of PtdSer-containing vesicles as measured by fluorescence microscopy, indicating that CD36 is functionally significant for phagocytosis of this vesicle type. In addition, collagen and thrombospondin, two other putative ligands of CD36, were unable to inhibit the binding of PtdSer vesicles. We conclude that CD36 is the primary protein responsible for the high affinity binding of PtdSer vesicles to these monocyte-like cells. In addition, CD36 appears to be specific for PtdSer among anionic phospholipids, and non-phospholipid ligands of CD36 do not share binding sites with PtdSer on CD36.

Phospholipids are distributed asymmetrically between the two faces of the plasma membrane (1Devaux P.F. Zachowski A. Chem. Phys.

In particular, PtdSer 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; C7PtdCho, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; NBD-PtdCho, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdGro, phosphatidylglycerol; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; C7PtdCho, 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; NBD-PtdCho, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdGro, phosphatidylglycerol; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol.is nearly absent from the extracellular face of the plasma membrane in resting cells. Membrane phospholipid asymmetry is maintained by the aminophospholipid translocase, an ATP-dependent enzyme that transports PtdSer and phosphatidylethanolamine from the outer face to the inner face of the plasma membrane. This protein was recently cloned and shown to be a member of a new family of ATP-dependent transporters (4Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Under some circumstances disruption of membrane asymmetry results in PtdSer exposure at the outer face of the membrane. This is an essential part of the normal platelet procoagulant response, and increased PtdSer exposure may also be a signal for clearance of damaged or senescent cells. More recently, increased exposure of PtdSer has emerged as a key early event in cells undergoing apoptosis (5Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J.

Given the earlier work suggesting a role for PtdSer exposure in triggering phagocytic removal of cells, exposure of PtdSer may mark apoptotic cells for phagocytic removal, either by specialized phagocytic cells or by their healthy neighbors. There are several means by which apoptotic cells are marked for phagocytosis; one of these mechanisms involves recognition of exposed PtdSer (10Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The receptors responsible for recognizing cells with exposed PtdSer are not well known, but several candidate proteins have been proposed. Two structurally related members of the scavenger receptor family, CD36 and SR-BI, are implicated in binding of anionic phospholipid vesicles to some cell types (11Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 12Ryeom S.W. Silverstein R.L. Scotto A. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20536-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, CD36 has also been proposed as a receptor for collagen (13Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thrombospondin (14Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin.

Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Also, recent work has identified SR-BI more plausibly as a receptor for high density lipoprotein, and its expression is largely restricted to liver and steroidogenic tissues (18Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Another candidate protein is CD68 (macrosialin), which appears to be involved in the binding of PtdSer vesicles and apoptotic thymocytes to mouse peritoneal macrophages (19Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9580-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,20Ramprasad M.P. Terpstra V. Kondratenko N. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14833-14838Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, additional work is needed to clarify the role of CD36 as a possible PtdSer receptor in comparison with other proteins. In this study, we have characterized the binding of phospholipid vesicles to THP-1 and J774A.1 cells. These cell lines were chosen because they are monocyte-like with phagocytic properties (21Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 22Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okumura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K.

We have developed a flow cytometric procedure for measuring the binding of phospholipid vesicles to cells. We find that CD36 appears to be highly specific for PtdSer vesicles and cannot explain the binding of other anionic phospholipids to these cells. All phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and were of the following composition: C7PtdCho, synthetic 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; NBD-PtdCho, 1-palmitoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-3-phospha-tidylcholine; PtdCho, synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylcholine; PtdGro, synthetic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidyl-glycerol; PtdIns, bovine liver phosphatidylglycerol; PtdSer, bovine brain phosphatidylserine. The THP-l and J774A.1 cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection. Normal human red blood cells were from anonymous donors. Anti-CD36 and goat antibody against mouse IgG (affinity purified, F(ab′)2 fragment, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled) were from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME).O-Phospho-l-serine and collagen (calf skin, acid-soluble) were from Sigma. Human thrombospondin was from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant human annexin V was expressed and purified as described (24Wood B.L. Gibson D.F. Tait J.F. Blood. 1996; 88: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantum 24 and Quantum 25 fluorescent beads were purchased from Flow Cytometry Standards Corp. (San Juan, Puerto Rico). THP-1 cells were grown and passaged 1:3 every 3–4 days in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium plus l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc. Catalog No. 11875-093), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. J774A.1 cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc. Catalog No. 11965-092) supplemented with 1.2 g/liter HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Prior to use in experiments cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 500 × g), washed once with binding assay buffer, and resuspended in binding assay buffer (described below). Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared according to Gabriel and Roberts (25Gabriel N.E. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4011-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and quantitated by phosphorus assay as described previously (26Tait J.F. Gibson D. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all figures, concentrations of phospholipid vesicles are expressed as the total concentration of monomeric phospholipids. The molar composition of PtdSer vesicles was 50% PtdSer, 10% NBD-PtdCho, 20% PtdCho, and 20% C7PtdCho. Unlabeled PtdSer vesicles, used for competition studies or to determine nonspecific binding, contained 50% PtdSer, 30% PtdCho, and 20% C7PtdCho. Other types of labeled or unlabeled phospholipid vesicles were made in identical fashion by substituting either PtdIns, PtdGro, or PtdCho for the 50% PtdSer. The size of the phospholipid vesicles was determined by dynamic light scattering on a Model SM-200 apparatus with a BI9000AT autocorrelator card and version 6.0 software (Brookhaven Instrument Corp.). Measurements were made at 23 °C with a 488 nm laser line at 90° scattering angle; vesicle stock solutions were diluted to 0.1–0.2 mm in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl; data were analyzed by cumulant analysis with a linear fit. The number of phospholipid molecules per vesicle was then calculated from the measured diameter assuming a bilayer thickness of 5 nm and an area per phospholipid molecule of 0.68 nm2 (27Lim T.K. Bloomfield V.A. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4177-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The measured average vesicle diameter (in nm) and calculated number of phospholipid molecules per vesicle were as follows: PtdSer, 112 nm and 1.11 × 105; PtdGro, 117 nm and 1.21 × 105; PtdIns, 113 nm and 1.13 × 105; PtdCho, 156 nm and 2.18 × 105. The vesicle binding assay was performed in ≥0.160 ml of buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 133 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNaH2PO4, and 5 mm glucose; in experiments requiring calcium, the buffer was supplemented with either 1 or 2.5 mm CaCl2, as indicated in the text, and 2 mm MgCl2. NBD-labeled vesicles were added at 10 μm final concentration or other concentrations as noted, and either 0 or 500 μm unlabeled vesicles were added to determine nonspecific binding. Cells resuspended in assay buffer were then added to the tubes at a final concentration of 106/ml. Samples were incubated on ice for 120 min; cells were pelleted at 500 × g, washed once in assay buffer, and then resuspended in 0.4 ml of fresh assay buffer containing 0.01 mg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to allow detection of any necrotic cells present. Samples were analyzed on a Coulter XL flow cytometer, with forward and side scatter gates set to include cells but exclude cellular debris and phospholipid vesicles. NBD fluorescence was monitored in the FL1 channel and propidium iodide in the FL4 channel. The amount of fluorescent vesicles bound per cell was then calculated from the mean fluorescence intensity of the gated cell population. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Competition studies were performed by adding the indicated competitor at the same time as the NBD-PtdSer vesicles and carrying out the assay as described above. Blocking experiments were carried out by adding the blocking agent to the cells, incubating for 30 min on ice, and then adding 10 μm PtdSer vesicle and 0 or 500 μmunlabeled PtdSer vesicles and continuing the incubation for 120 min on ice. Samples were prepared as described above with 10 μm NBD-labeled vesicles and incubated for 120 min on ice. Cells were washed three times and suspended in 200 μl of assay buffer, then incubated either on ice or at 37 °C (to allow endocytosis to occur) for an additional 30 min, fixed for 15 min on ice with a final concentration of 0.75% paraformaldehyde in assay buffer, and washed twice. A wet mount of the cells in 15 μl of assay buffer was observed under a total magnification of 400× on a Nikon Labophot-2 fluorescent microscope, which had a B-2A filter in place (excitation: 450–490 nm; dichromatic beam splitter: 505 nm; barrier filter: 520 nm). The images were captured with a CCD camera 72S series that was interfaced to an 80486-based microcomputer through a video imaging board as described (28Astion M.L. Orkand A.R. Olsen G.B. Pagliaro L.J. Wener M.H. Lab. Med. 1993; 24: 341-344Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Prior to printing, all images received a uniform contrast enhancement with Adobe Photoshop (version 4.0). To determine binding constants from the flow cytometric data, the following additional measurements were made. The fraction of free (unbound) vesicles was determined over the range of added vesicle concentrations by fluorometric analysis of the supernatants of binding reactions after removal of cells by centrifugation. To convert the mean fluorescence intensity per cell as determined by flow cytometry to the number of phospholipid molecules bound per cell, a conversion factor was determined as follows. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of fluorescent vesicles, washed by centrifugation, and dissolved in cell binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and their fluorescence intensity was measured by fluorometry and flow cytometry. The number of molecules bound per cell could then be calculated by reference to a standard curve prepared with known amounts of pure NBD-PtdCho dissolved in the same buffer. The binding constant (K d) and number of vesicle binding sites per cell (B max) were determined by fitting the specific binding data to a model of non-cooperative binding to homogeneous sites. Curve-fitting was performed by iterative non-linear least-squares analysis (SOLVE function of Microsoft Excel version 5.0). Fitting was performed with the data of bound phospholipid monomerversus concentration of free phospholipid monomer. The fitted K d and B max values were then expressed in terms of the molarity of vesicles by dividing by the number of phospholipid molecules per vesicle as determined above. THP-1 and J774A.1 cells (2 × 105 cells) were incubated for 30 min on ice in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 10, or 20 μg/ml anti-CD36. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 30 min on ice in 50 μl with 7.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-antimouse antibody; cells were then washed twice more and suspended in 300 μl of buffer, and their fluorescence intensity was measured in the FL1 channel of the flow cytometer. Quantum 24 and Quantum 25 fluorescein beads were used to convert observed fluorescence intensity to molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome; this was then converted to molecules of CD36 per cell by dividing by the manufacturer's stated value for molecules of fluorescein per molecule of second antibody, assuming one molecule of second antibody bound per CD36 molecule. A flow cytometric procedure was developed to measure binding of vesicles to cells. To isolate the step consisting of binding of vesicles to the cell surface prior to their possible internalization by endocytic processes, assays were performed at 4 °C. Previous work has shown that binding of vesicles to cells occurs at 4 °C, but internalization occurs only at higher temperatures (29Lee K.D. Nir S. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To keep the labeled phospholipid component constant, vesicles of all types were labeled with 10% NBD-PtdCho; use of NBD-PtdCho also prevented cell labeling due to possible transmembrane transport of the labeled phospholipid by the aminophospholipid translocase. When PtdSer vesicles were added to THP-1 cells, a nearly homogeneous population of labeled cells was observed, and the mean fluorescence of this population was reduced by addition of excess unlabeled PtdSer vesicles (Fig.1). In most experiments, a single population of cells was observed; significant heterogeneity of the number of binding sites per cell was only observed when necrotic cells were present, as judged by high propidium iodide uptake; these necrotic cells had increased uptake of PtdSer vesicles that could not be blocked by excess unlabeled vesicles. The lower half of Fig. 1 shows a titration of THP-1 cells with increasing amounts of PtdSer vesicles, in the absence (total binding) and presence (nonspecific binding) of a large excess of unlabeled PtdSer vesicles. The results show a saturable, high affinity component of the binding reaction, as well as a low affinity, nonsaturable component. The specific binding of vesicles containing different anionic phospholipids to THP-1 cells was measured with the same procedure; all vesicles were labeled with identical amounts of fluorescent phospholipid, i.e. 10% NBD-PtdCho (Fig.2). As shown in TableI, the apparent affinity and capacity of binding were very similar for vesicles containing PtdSer, PtdGro, and PtdIns. However, the capacity for PtdCho binding was approximately 5-fold less than for vesicles containing anionic phospholipids. These results were confirmed with another monocyte-like cell line, J774A.1. As shown in Table I, these cells had a very similar affinity for phospholipid vesicles, but their capacity for binding anionic vesicles was 3-fold greater.Table IBinding parameters for vesicle-cell interactionVesicle typeTHP-1 cellsJ774A.1 cellsBinding capacityK dBinding capacityK dvesicles/cellpmvesicles/cellpmPtdSer1410584600100PtdGro1280513780110PtdIns137057348098PtdCho2652534837For each cell and vesicle type, results are the means of two experiments, each performed in duplicate.

The average uncertainty (S.D.) in the binding parameters is ±18%, based on replicate determinations performed on different days. The dissociation constants are expressed in terms of the molarity of vesicles. As a control to rule out possible nonspecific interaction of vesicles with any cell membrane, normal human erythrocytes were also titrated under the same conditions as THP-1 cells (Fig. 2). The observed binding of anionic vesicles was 10- to 20-fold less than to THP-1 cells, far less than could be explained by the slightly smaller size of the erythrocytes. Also, in contrast to results obtained with the THP-1 cells, the binding of PtdCho vesicles to erythrocytes was not appreciably different from the binding of PtdSer, PtdGro, or PtdIns vesicles. These data also confirm that the fluorescent labeling of cells detected by this assay is not due to transfer of individual NBD-PtdCho molecules from vesicles to the cell membrane. If this were occurring, one would expect uniform cellular labeling regardless of the phospholipid head group (anionic or neutral) present in the labeled vesicles, and the addition of excess unlabeled vesicles would not alter the observed cellular labeling. In addition, labeling of THP-1 cells and erythrocytes would be equal, which was not observed. Annexin V was used to verify that binding of anionic phospholipid vesicles to THP-1 cells was not due to a nonspecific adsorption process for any particles of the size of the vesicles. (Annexin V binds with high affinity to vesicles containing anionic but not neutral phospholipids; a concentration of 1 μm annexin V at 2.5 mm CaCl2 is sufficient to saturate the available binding sites on 50% PtdSer vesicles at 50 μm phospholipid concentration (26Tait J.F. Gibson D. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7944-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tait J.F. Gibson D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).) The binding of the three anionic phospholipid vesicles was inhibited by annexin V (Fig. 3). In contrast, the binding of PtdCho vesicles was minimally affected. Monomeric phospho-l-serine has been used as a reagent to determine whether binding of vesicles or cells to a given cell type is due to a putative PtdSer receptorversus receptors with specificity for other ligands (5Fadok V.A.

However, monomeric phospho-l-serine up to a concentration of 1 mm was unable to inhibit the binding of PtdSer vesicles to THP-1 cells (Fig.4 A). Similarly, glycerophospho-l-serine had no effect up to a concentration of at least 100 μm (not shown). In contrast, unlabeled PtdSer vesicles inhibited binding of PtdSer vesicles in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, binding of PtdSer vesicles was inhibited by unlabeled PtdGro and PtdIns vesicles (Fig.4 B). The expression of CD36 on the cell surface was confirmed as described under “Experimental Procedures”; these measurements yielded a value of 2.5 × 104 molecules per cell for THP-1 cells and 2.2 × 104 molecules per cell for J774A.1 cells. To determine whether CD36 could explain some or all of the specific binding of anionic phospholipid vesicles, binding assays were then performed in the presence or absence of a monoclonal antibody to CD36 (Fig. 5 A). The antibody blocked PtdSer vesicle binding in a dose-dependent manner; up to 60% of the specific binding of PtdSer vesicles could be blocked at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. In contrast, the antibody had no effect on the binding of PtdGro, PtdIns, or PtdCho (not shown) vesicles under the same conditions. To rule out possible nonspecific effects of the antibody, control experiments were performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody of the same isotype to CD71 (the transferrin receptor); this antibody had no effect on PtdSer binding (not shown). The selective effect of anti-CD36 on PtdSer binding was also confirmed with J774A.1 cells (Fig. 5 B). Collagen (13Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombospondin (14Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) have been reported to be ligands for CD36. We therefore tested their effect on the binding of PtdSer vesicles under the same conditions used for the experiments with anti-CD36 described above. Collagen up to 100 μg/ml did not inhibit the binding of PtdSer vesicles (TableII). Similarly, thrombospondin up to 25 μg/ml did not inhibit binding.Table IIEffect of ligands of CD36 on PtdSer vesicle binding to THP-1 cellsCompetitor[Competitor]Specific bindingμg/ml% controlCollagen100128 ± 19 (n = 5)Thrombospondin25118 ± 19 (n = 2)Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the indicated concentration of competitor; specific binding was then determined by measurements with 10 μm NBD-labeled PtdSer vesicle in the presence or absence of 500 μm unlabeled PtdSer vesicles. Assays with thrombospondin were performed in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Results are expressed as a percentage of the specific binding observed in the absence of competitor. Open table in a new tab Cells were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the indicated concentration of competitor; specific binding was then determined by measurements with 10 μm NBD-labeled PtdSer vesicle in the presence or absence of 500 μm unlabeled PtdSer vesicles. Assays with thrombospondin were performed in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Results are expressed as a percentage of the specific binding observed in the absence of competitor. Fluorescence microscopy was performed to determine whether anti-CD36 inhibited phagocytosis of PtdSer vesicles, as well as their initial binding to the cell surface. Assays performed entirely at 4 °C confirmed that all vesicle types bound to the cell surface and that anti-CD36 selectively inhibited cell surface binding of PtdSer vesicles, consistent with the flow cytometric data. When cells were first incubated at 4 °C and then warmed to 37 °C to allow endocytosis to occur, all vesicle types were internalized, as judged by cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining. However, anti-CD36 selectively inhibited the endocytosis of PtdSer vesicles (Fig. 6,panel B versus panel A), whereas it did not inhibit the endocytosis of PtdGro vesicles (Fig. 6, panel D versus panel C) or PtdIns vesicles (not shown). Thus, the component of PtdSer binding inhibited by anti-CD36 is functionally significant for endocytosis. Phagocytic removal of necrotic or apoptotic cells involves an initial step of recognition of the target cell, followed by subsequent steps leading to its internalization and digestion. To focus on the initial step involved in cellular recognition of membranes containing exposed anionic phospholipids, the present study was performed under conditions that prevent phagocytosis. Under these conditions, both THP-1 and J774A.1 cells have saturable, high affinity membrane binding sites for anionic phospholipid vesicles. The affinity (K d = 0.05 to 0.1 nm) and capacity (1400 sites per THP-1 cell, 4600 sites per J774A.1 cell) measured by the flow cytometric technique are comparable with values obtained by others with traditional fluorometric or radioligand techniques. For example, Leeet al. (29Lee K.D. Nir S. Papahadjopoulos D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) studied binding of PtdSer/PtdCho/cholesterol vesicles to J774A.1 cells at 4 °C and found a population of high affinity sites with a K d of 0.3 nm and about 3000 sites per cell for suspension-cultured cells. Similarly, Rigotti et al. (11Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) reported a K d of 0.18 nm for binding of PtdSer/PtdCho/cholesterol liposomes at 4 °C to a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with a cDNA for scavenger receptor BI. The vesicle binding is specific by several criteria. Comparable binding sites are essentially absent on erythrocytes, a cell without phagocytic or endocytotic capability. Addition of annexin V, which will coat the surface of anionic phospholipid vesicles, prevented binding, indicating that binding was not due to a nonspecific adsorption of any particles of the size of the vesicles. Although binding of PtdCho vesicles could be demonstrated, the amount of binding was about 5-fold to 10-fold less than for vesicles containing anionic phospholipids. Vesicle binding could not be attributed to uptake by necrotic cells, as these cells could be detected and gated out on the flow cytometer. Some previous studies have used competition assay with monomeric phosphoserine and its derivatives as a diagnostic criterion for the involvement of a PtdSer receptor in binding and/or phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (5Fadok V.A.

(5Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar) showed that phospho-l-serine and glycerophospho-l-serine, but not phospho-d-serine, inhibited the phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes by mouse peritoneal macrophages; 50% inhibition of uptake was observed at about 10 μm phospho-l-serine. Similarly, phospho-l-serine and glycerophospho-l-serine, but not phospho-d-serine, partially inhibited the rosetting of red blood cells with exposed PtdSer on murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages (31Fadok V.A. Laszlo D.J. Noble P.W. Weinstein L. Riches D.W. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4274-4285PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study these compounds had no effect on the binding of PtdSer vesicles to THP-1 cells. This suggests that the PtdSer receptor requires a surface containing multiple molecules of phosphoserine to bind vesicles with high affinity. Thus, phosphoserine may not be useful as a reagent for identifying the involvement of the PtdSer receptor in the initial step of cell-cell or cell-vesicle binding. The reason for the discrepancy with earlier studies is not clear. It is possible that monomeric phosphoserine inhibits a later step in the adherence or phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies rather than their initial binding to the cell surface, which is the step measured in the present study. An unexpected finding of this study was the observation that CD36 may have greater selectivity for PtdSer among anionic phospholipids than has been inferred from previous studies. In this study, binding of PtdSer-containing vesicles was inhibited by antibody to CD36 (Fig. 5). In addition, fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6) showed that antibody to CD36 selectively inhibited the endocytosis of PtdSer vesicles, indicating that CD36 is functionally significant for phagocytosis. In COS cells transfected with human CD36, Rigotti et al. (11Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) showed that PtdIns and PtdSer, but not PtdCho, inhibited the binding of125I-acetyl-low density lipoproteins to cells at 4 °C; PtdIns was a better inhibitor than PtdSer. In a system consisting of primary cultures of rat retinal pigment epithelial cells incubated at 37 °C, Ryeom et al. (12Ryeom S.W. Silverstein R.L. Scotto A. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20536-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) found that anti-CD36 inhibited 78% of the binding of labeled PtdSer vesicles and 72% of the binding of PtdIns vesicles, whereas it inhibited only 14% of the binding of PtdCho vesicles. In addition to its putative role as a PtdSer receptor, CD36 has been shown to bind several other ligands, including collagen and thrombospondin. However, these ligands did not compete for PtdSer vesicle binding to the THP-1 cell surface in this study (Table II). This suggests that the binding site for PtdSer vesicles on CD36 is not shared with the binding site for these other ligands. CD36 has been reported to bind to collagen with an apparent K d of 3 μg/ml (13Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to thrombospondin with an apparentK d of 22 μg/ml (14Asch A.S. Barnwell J. Silverstein R.L. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentrations of competitor proteins used should have caused a measurable decrease in the binding of PtdSer vesicles if these substances shared binding sites on CD36 with PtdSer vesicles. It may seem paradoxical that PtdGro and PtdIns vesicles compete with PtdSer vesicles for binding to the cell, yet antibody to CD36 only inhibits the binding of PtdSer vesicles. These findings can be reconciled in a model that considers the relative sizes of the vesicles and their binding proteins (Fig. 7). Initially, vesicles bind to the cell surface via a specific receptor or docking protein; bound vesicles may then collect in coated pits prior to endocytosis. Among cell-surface proteins, CD36 has a strong preference for binding PtdSer vesicles, whereas other unidentified protein(s) provide binding sites for PtdGro and PtdIns vesicles. However, the cell surface has limited capacity to bind vesicles of any type due to steric crowding effects; thus, binding of large amounts of one vesicle type can limit the binding of another vesicle type, even though they may be binding to different receptor proteins. In contrast, an antibody molecule is far smaller than a vesicle, and thus binding of anti-CD36 to CD36 would not prevent binding of other vesicle types to their cognate receptor protein(s). This model can also explain why the number of high affinity binding sites for PtdSer vesicles (1400–4600 sites/cell) is considerably less than the number of cell-surface CD36 molecules (22,000–25,000). As the surface area of the cell (d = ∼10 μm) is about 104 times the surface area of the vesicle (d = 0.1 μm), saturation of cell surface binding due to steric crowding might be expected once roughly 103-104 vesicles are bound to the cell surface. In conclusion, CD36 appears to be the major PtdSer-binding protein on the surface of THP-1 and J774A.1 cells. In addition, the CD36 binding site for PtdSer vesicles is highly specific and does not also bind other anionic phospholipids or non-phospholipid ligands.

Labeling was for 75 min with 0.43 mCi of l-[35S]methionine (Pro-Mix, Amersham International PLC). Analysis of expression was undertaken on microsomal fractions at 4 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors, layered onto a gradient of 1.8 m sucrose in 20 mm imidazole and 0.5 m sucrose in 20 mm imidazole, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellicle of microsomes at the 0.5–1.8 m sucrose interface was resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors). ApoB, apoA-I, and MTP-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with saturating quantities of sheep anti-human apoB (Boehringer Mannheim from Roche Diagnostics Ltd.), anti-apoA-I (Genzyme Diagnostics), rabbit anti-human MTP antibodies, or anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), respectively. Immobilized proteins were washed with buffer A and recovered by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The details of the coordinate expression of MTP and apoB have been described, as have the l-[35S]methionine labeling of cells and the immunoprecipitation of apoB (2Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chase was for 3 h. To screen for sites of interaction between apoB and MTP, distal to residues 1–264 of apoB, we used a yeast two-hybrid system. Short, overlapping cDNAs encoding residues 247–1147 of apoB (apoB5–25) (Fig. 1 A) were assayed for interaction with the MTP amino-terminal (residues 22–304), predicted α-helical (residues 298–603), and carboxyl-terminal domains (residues 604–894). ApoB residues 349–583 (apoB8–13) and 512–721 (apoB11–16) produced an interaction with the predicted α-helical domain of MTP (Fig. 1 B). The strongest interaction was with apoB residues 512–721 (apoB11–16). No other site of interaction was detected (data not shown). To fine map the region on MTP that interacts with apoB, predicted helices 1–8 (residues 297–442), 9–13 (residues 447–529), and 13–17 (residues 517–603) of MTP were expressed with residues 349–583 (apoB8–13) and 512–721 (apoB11–16) of apoB (Fig. 1 C). The interactions with predicted helices 13–17 of MTP were ∼10- and 5-fold higher than with predicted helices 1–8 and 9–13, respectively. These results indicate that residues 512–721 (apoB11–16) of apoB interact with helices 13–17 of MTP, which also form a major binding site for PDI (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The PDI binding site on MTP was also mapped in a yeast two-hybrid system and corroborated by the characterization of mutant forms of full-length MTP expressed in COS-1 and Sf9 cells. To fine map the region on apoB that interacts with MTP, we examined the interaction of subfragments of apoB11–16 (residues 512–721) with predicted helices 13–17 of MTP (Fig. 1 D). The removal of residues 512–524 from the amino terminus of residues 512–721 of apoB (apoB11–16) abolished the interaction. The deletion of residues 701–721 and 664–721 from the carboxyl terminus of residues 512–721 of apoB (apoB11–16) reduced the interaction by 29 and 49%, respectively. These data indicate that helices 13–17 of MTP (residues 517–603) interact with a site encompassing predicted helices 13–17 (residues 512–592) of apoB and the carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 593–721) of apoB16. The homologous interacting regions of apoB and MTP (Fig. 2 A) are encoded by exons with conserved intron demarcations (Fig. 2, A andB). In view of the co-localization of the binding sites for PDI and residues 512–721 of apoB (apoB11–16) to helices 13–17 of MTP, we examined whether mutations of MTP that disrupted the interaction of MTP with PDI (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) might also impair apoB binding. MTP R540A and R540H, which disrupt the predicted buried salt bridge, and a series of mutant MTPs that had been used to map the PDI binding site (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were expressed with either PDI (residues 18–274) or apoB (residues 512–721). The predicted positions of the salt bridge residue (Arg-540) and of mutated residues Val-520, Lys-521, Arg-526, Tyr-554, Met-555, Lys-558, Ile-592, Arg-594, and Arg-595 at the surface of helices 13–17 of MTP are shown in Fig. 2 C. MTP R540H and double mutant R594A/R595A had a more marked effect on the interaction of MTP with apoB than on the interaction of MTP with PDI (Fig. 3). Mutants R540A, Y554A/M555A, Y554A/M555A/K558A, and Y554A/M555A/I592A were more deleterious for the interaction of MTP with PDI. The disruption for mutants V520A, K521A, R526A, and I592A was similar for both proteins (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the apoB and PDI binding sites on the α-helical region of MTP are in close proximity. The proximity of binding sites on MTP for apoB and PDI was further evaluated by studies performed in a baculovirus expression system (Fig.4). ApoB was co-immunoprecipitated with MTP using anti-MTP antibodies, whereas MTP was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB antibodies. The coordinate expression of PDI reduced the amount of apoB17 (residues 1–781) co-immunoprecipitated with MTP as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A). This reduction was also visually evident with apoB16 (residues 1–721) but not with apoB13 (residues 1–590) or apoB11 (residues 1–499) (Fig. 4 B). Rather, PDI expression increased the amount of apoB11 and apoB13 co-immunoprecipitated with MTP by around 25%. This increase corresponds to a 3-fold higher level of MTP in these cells, presumably because of increased solubilization of MTP by PDI (Fig. 4 B). Thus, on a mole to mole basis, PDI substantially reduced the amount of apoB11 and apoB13 co-immunoprecipitated with MTP. Similar results were obtained in an independent experiment in which MTP was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB antibodies. PDI reduced the amount of MTP co-immunoprecipitated with apoB16 (residues 1–721), apoB13 (residues 1–590), and apoB11 (residues 1–499) by 73, 52, and 29%, respectively (Fig. 4 C). No reduction was observed with apoB5.8 (residues 1–264). These results support the close proximity of the binding sites on MTP for residues 512–721 of apoB and 18–274 of PDI and, in addition, indicate that the amino-terminal limit of this apoB binding site may extend further upstream than residue 499 of apoB. Next, we evaluated whether mutations in predicted helices 13–17 (residues 512–592) of apoB (Fig. 2 A) might disrupt the binding of amino acids 512–721 of apoB to MTP. The predicted buried salt bridge residues Arg-531 and Glu-557 in apoB (Fig. 2 D) were individually replaced with alanine. R531H was also created, because the replacement of the homologous residue (Arg-540) in MTP with histidine causes abetalipoproteinemia (20Rehberg E.F. Samson-Bouma M.-E. Kienzle B. Blinderman L. Jamil H. Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Gordon D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid system, R531A, R531H, and E557A reduced the interaction of helices 13–17 of MTP with amino acids 512–721 of apoB to 20.4 ± 6, 9.2 ± 3.2, and 56.1 ± 26% of wild type, respectively (Fig.5 A). To examine the consequence of this loss of binding between apoB and MTP for lipoprotein assembly, R531A, R531H, and E557A were introduced into apoB36, and their impact on the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from COS-1 cells was examined. Mutants R531H and R531A, which had markedly reduced the interaction of amino acids 512–721 of apoB with MTP in the yeast two-hybrid system, reduced apoB secretion, whereas mutant E557A did not (Fig. 5 B). Secretion levels were 20, 53, and 95% of wild type, respectively. Thus, the loss of the interaction between amino acids 512–721 (apoB11–16) of apoB and the carboxyl terminus of the predicted α-helical domain of MTP is deleterious for the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In this study, we have identified a region on MTP that interacts with both apoB and PDI. The delineation of the apoB and MTP binding sites has been facilitated by the use of well characterized molecular models of residues 294–592 and 304–598 of apoB and MTP, respectively. The models were generated from the crystal structure of lamprey LV (10Anderson T.A. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 895-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The structural relationship between MTP, apoB, and VTG is supported by conservation of gene structure, primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, and site-directed mutagenesis (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the predicted amino-terminal β-barrels of apoB and MTP (first ∼300 residues) interact (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the interaction between residues 512–721 of apoB and helices 13–17 (residues 517–603) of MTP. This interaction was identified and characterized in a yeast two-hybrid system. The binding site on MTP for apoB is in close proximity to the major PDI binding site. Mutation of the buried salt bridge residue Arg-540 of MTP and of residues at the surface of predicted helices 15 (Tyr-554, Met-555, Lys-558) and 17 (Ile-592, Arg-594, Arg-595) impair the interaction of MTP with apoB and PDI, whereas the equivalent mutation of residues in helix 13 (Val-520, Lys-521, and Arg-526) of MTP do not. Accordingly, we propose that apoB and PDI have binding sites centered on predicted helices 15–17 (residues 556–598) of MTP. The fact that 4 of the 10 MTP mutations were more deleterious for the interaction of MTP with PDI than with residues 512–721 of apoB, whereas 2 were more deleterious for the interaction between MTP and apoB, suggests that apoB and PDI do not bind to the same site on MTP. However, the mutation data do not exclude the possibility that the critical residues on MTP for binding to apoB and PDI may differ and that these critical residues form part of a common binding site. An interaction between MTP and residues 270–570 of apoB has recently been reported by Hussain et al. (21Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in a third experimental system. The present study provides strong evidence that this apoB binding site encompasses helices 13–17 (residues 514–592) of the predicted α-helical domain of apoB, as well as structural motifs formed by residues 640–721 at the carboxyl-terminal end of apoB16. The site may also include residues 430–511 of apoB, which are predicted to form helices 9–12 of its α-helical structure (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the experimental system of Hussain et al. (21Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), an expression construct encoding residues 270–509 of apoB produced an interaction with MTP that was 58% of that observed with residues 270–570 of apoB, whereas a corresponding construct that comprised residues 270–430 of apoB produced virtually no interaction. These results, combined with our yeast two-hybrid data, indicate that the interaction of apoB with helices 13–17 of the predicted α-helical domain of MTP is centered on residues 512–592 (apoB11-apoB13) of apoB and includes flanking residues 430–511 (apoB9-apoB11) and 640–721 (apoB14-apoB16). Our baculovirus expression studies also indicate that PDI and amino acids 512–721 of apoB bind to the same helical region of MTP. From our previous study (8Mann C.J. Anderson T.A. Read J. Chester S.A. Harrison G.B. Köechl S. Ritchie P.J. Bradbury P. Hussain F.S. Amey J. Vanloo B. Rosseneu M. Infante R. Hancock J.M. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and the present yeast two-hybrid data we made two predictions. First, we predicted that the coordinate expression of PDI with MTP would not impair the interaction of residues 1–264 of apoB (apoB5.8) with the predicted β-barrel of MTP, which is confirmed in this study. Second, we predicted that PDI would reduce the interaction of MTP with apoB16 (residues 1–721), apoB13 (residues 1–590), and apoB11 (residues 1–499) and that the maximum reduction would be with apoB13 and apoB16. Thus, we show that PDI expression successively reduced the interaction of MTP with apoB11 (residues 1–499), apoB13 (residues 1–590), and apoB16 (residues 1–721). The present study demonstrates that disruption of predicted helices 13–17 (residues 512–592) at the center of the distal binding site on apoB impairs the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Thus, we show that the mutation of the apoB buried salt bridge residue, Arg-531, which virtually abolished the interaction of MTP with apoB in the yeast two-hybrid system, had a marked impact on lipoprotein secretion. These results indicate that the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins is perturbed by the loss of interaction of the distal apoB binding site (residues 512–721) with MTP. An alternative explanation would be that the apoB Arg-531 mutation supports lipoprotein assembly but impairs the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins through aberrant misfolding. The present study does not directly address this issue. However, our data and those of Hussain et al. (21Hussain M.M. Bakillah A. Nayak N. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25612-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) are consistent with a loss of interaction between residues 512–721 of apoB and MTP as being the primary cause of reduced secretion. Incubation of cells with a pharmacological agent that specifically blocks this interaction represents an attractive strategy for determining its importance for lipoprotein production. The location of the two binding sites on apoB and MTP would serve to align nascent apoB in a head to head orientation with MTP. This would position the predicted lipid binding domain of MTP with the lipid binding structures of apoB and presumably facilitate the transfer of lipid from MTP to apoB. The proximity of the distal apoB binding site and of the PDI binding site on MTP raises the question as to how this arrangement might facilitate lipoprotein assembly. It will be important to establish whether apoB displaces PDI from MTP only to be replaced again by PDI as lipidation progresses in the distal parts of the secretory pathway.

The Golgi cisternae constitute a compartmentalized and polarized structure, allowing post-translational processing enzymes to act in succession. As a routing center, the Golgi receives proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and routes them in bulk to the plasma membrane or specifically to the endosomes and lysosomes. In polarized cells, additional transport routes include targeting to the apical or basolateral plasma membranes or to storage granules (1Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Protein sublocalization, however, is not precise, since the locations of many of the proteins overlap over two or more cisternae (3Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). All known resident Golgi proteins are peripheral or integral membrane proteins. Coiled-coil-containing proteins with different functions (4Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) have been identified on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi.

One type tethers the vesicles to membranes, while another type, termed SNARES, ensure that specific vesicles dock to the membranes. Peripheral coiled-coil proteins on the Golgi surface are of the resident and transient types; they maintain Golgi structure and participate in budding, transport, tethering, and docking of vesicles. Additional coiled-coil proteins of unknown function have been identified as antigens in autoimmune diseases (6Dohlman J.G. Lupas A. Carson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of another, novel cytoplasmic-associated coiled-coil integral membrane Golgi protein termed golgin-84. The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed on a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a MatchMaker kit (CLONTECH) and a ∼4.3-kb human OCRL1cDNA (full open reading frame) as bait. The human OCRL1cDNA was subcloned into vector pGBT9 (GAL4 DNA binding domain) and the brain cDNA library into vector pGAD424 (GAL4 activating domain). The integrity of the OCRL1 construct was verified by in vitro transcription and translation. Approximately 1.5 million brain clones were screened. Screening and elimination of false positives were performed as described by the manufacturer. Plaque screening in a λlgt10 human testis 5′-Stretch Plus cDNA library (CLONTECH) was performed using double lifts onto nitrocellulose filters (DuPont) from 12 Petri dishes (150-mm diameter) containing ∼37,000 plaques on an NM514 Escherichia colilawn. A golgin-84 expressed sequence tag probe 134426 (828 bp) was [32P]dCTP-labeled (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Prime-ItTM RmT labeling kit (Stratagene) and NucTrapTM probe purification columns (Stratagene). After a 4-h prehybridization, the filters were hybridized with the labeled golgin-84 probe under high stringency (50% formamide, 6× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt′s solution, 1% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C overnight. Blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each and then at 65 °C for the same time. The blots were finally washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15–30 min. Seventeen plaques were positive through the tertiary screen. Inserts were then amplified from the purified phage with λlgt10 arm primers (CLONTECH) and confirmed as golgin-84. DNA was purified (Qiagen) from three phage (numbers 3, 12, and 16) with inserts closest in size to full-length golgin-84 mRNA (∼2.8 kb), and the inserts were subcloned intoEcoRI-digested pUC18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The largest subclone, number 16 (2.6 kbp), was missing ∼200 bp from its 3′-end. The brain and testis golgin-84 cDNAs were cycle-sequenced (ABI 373A) as described by the manufacturer. Subclones 3, 12, and 16 were sequenced with universal primers FWD and REV and an internal golgin-84-specific primer (13dS1). All three testis subclones were identical. Six additional golgin-84 primers (13dS2–13dS7) were used to sequence clone 16: 13dS1 5′-GGTCATGCAGATCCTGTAAC-3′, 13dS2 5′-TCAGCAGCTGATAACATTCG-3′, 13dS3 5′-GCTGACCAGCTACTGAGTAC-3′, 13dS4 5′-CATGAACTGTCTAACCTTCG-3′, 13dS5 5′-GGCCAGATACATCAGCTCAG-3′, 13dS6 5′-TCAACAGAACAATCATGACC-3′, and 13dS7 5′-CGGAGTCCTCGAGTCATTCG-3′. Protein and cDNA sequences were analyzed by Lasergene (Macintosh) and PCGene (IBM). 2Additional analyses, including data base searching, were performed at various World Wide Web sites, listed athttp://www-biol.univ-mrs.fr/english/logligne.html. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane was probed with radiolabeled 2.6-kb human golgin-84 cDNA (specific activity, ∼5.7 × 108cpm/μg). The blot was prehybridized with ExpressHybTMhybridization solution (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 68 °C and then hybridized in it for 2 h at 68 °C. After hybridization, two 15-min room temperature washes of 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS were performed followed by two 30-min washes at 60 °C. The blot was then exposed for 4 days. After exposure, the blot was stripped, prehybridized, and hybridized with a β-actin probe (specific activity, ∼4.45 × 108 cpm/μg) as described for golgin-84. Washing conditions were the same as for golgin-84, although an additional high stringency wash of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS was performed at 60 °C for 1 h. Antibodies were raised in rabbit against denatured and solid phase renatured His6 tag protein containing golgin-84 amino acids 499–687. A 500-ml E. coli culture containing the golgin-84 pET construct (Novagen) was induced at A 595 ∼0.5 with 2 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration) for ∼4–5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed overnight at 4 °C in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 8000 rpm. The cleared supernatant was passed over a Ni2+ resin column (pretreated as described by the manufacturer, Qiagen), and the column was then washed with ∼25 bed volumes of lysis buffer. Protein was eluted from the column in a denatured form by the addition of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm NaH2PO4 in aliquots of decreasing pH: pH 6.0 (2 × 5 ml), pH 5.0 (3 × 3 ml), and pH 3.5 (1 × 10 ml). The denatured protein was then subjected to SDS-PAGE (nine gels, ∼1 mg of antigen/gel), cut from the gels, and used for immunization. Solid phase renatured protein was also prepared on the column by a stepwise renaturation procedure; 25 bed volumes of MCAC (20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mNaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)/6 m guanidine hydrochloride (v/v) buffers mixed in ratios of 1:1, 3:1, and 7:1 were added to the column in the given order. Each renaturation buffer contained 20 mm imidazole. Solid phase renatured protein was eluted from the column with MCAC buffers containing increasing concentrations of imidazole, in increments of 20 mm. The NaCl concentration of the MCAC buffer was lowered to 0.15 m (instead of 0.5 m) immediately prior to and including the elution step in order to facilitate the immunization procedure. Eluted protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration in centricon filtration units (cut-offM r 3000). Eight milligrams of solid phase renatured golgin-84 protein was prepared at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Antisera were raised in an accelerated program; three rabbits were each immunized at different sites with denatured and solid phase renatured golgin-84 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Antibodies were purified on a golgin-84 affinity column prepared with CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified golgin-84 antibodies were eluted from the column with 3 m KSCN, pH 7.0, and dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit II. Cell and tissue lysates (30 μg/lane) were separated on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electroblotted (110 V-h) onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.) membrane. The integrity of the Western blots was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Destained membranes were blocked with 3% gelatin (1 h) and then incubated with golgin-84 primary antibody (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% gelatin (room temperature for 1 h). Immunostained proteins were detected with an horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For light microscopy, cells were grown in four- or eight-chambered slides (Lab-Tek) using standard tissue culture techniques. Whole mouse testes were prepared by rapid freezing in OCT compound (Miles) followed by cryosectioning (10 μm) and air drying the sections on slides. Cells and sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. (room temperature) before permeabilization with either 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min or with 0.2% saponin (Sigma) added to all solutions. Fixed samples were immunolabeled with the affinity-purified polyclonal golgin-84 antibody (1:1000) as well as with commercial monoclonal antibodies mannosidase II (clone 53FC3, Babco), protein-disulfide isomerase (clone RL90, ABR) and β-tubulin (clone Z023,Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The commercial antibodies were used at dilutions recommended by their manufacturers. Primary antibodies were detected with fluorochrome and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. For fluorochrome labeling, cells were fixed, blocked with 10% serum, and then probed with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies were used at their recommended working dilutions (Jackson Laboratories). After immunostaining, cells were PBS-washed and mounted with Immunofluor mounting media (ICN). Horseradish peroxidase immunostaining was accomplished with Vectastain® Elite ABC (peroxidase) and VECTOR® VIP substrate kits (Vector Laboratories). The protocols were carried out essentially as described in the kits with the exception that additional blocking was performed with avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories). Immunostained testis sections were also counterstained with methyl green (Vector Laboratories) prior to mounting with Permount®. Immunostained samples were observed by fluorescence epiillumination and bright field microscopy on a Leica DMRBE microscope. Images were recorded on Kodak Ektachrome Slides (400 ASA) and then scanned and processed in Adobe Photoshop 4. Golgin-84 number 16 cDNA was subcloned into Bluescript II SK+ with its 5′-end oriented toward the T7 promoter. The construct DNA was digested withSpeI and phenol chloroform-extracted. Golgin-84 mRNA was then transcribed from the T7 promoter and capped using an mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). Capped golgin-84 mRNA was translated (0.2 μg/25 μl) for 2 h at 30 °C in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) label and canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega). After translation, the microsomes were collected by centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g), washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.0, at 4 °C for 30 min to remove peripheral membrane proteins. The stripped microsomes were centrifuged at 4 °C and resuspended in 1× PBS. In the proteinase protection study, CaCl2 and Tris (pH 8.0) were added to the translation mix and put on ice for 15 min. before the proteinase K was added. The final concentrations were 10 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 0.2 μg/μl proteinase K. Proteinase K digestion was performed for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the microsomes were pelleted (4 °C, 10 min) and resuspended in a protease stop buffer (15 μl of PBS, 5 μl of 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μl of 5× sample buffer), and the resuspended microsomes were immediately boiled for 5 min. As a positive translocation control, β-lactamase was used to demonstrate the microsome membranes were functional and intact. To analyze the mechanism of golgin-84 insertion into microsomal membranes, translation was terminated with a final concentration of 25 μg/μl cycloheximide. Microsomes were added to the terminated translation reactions and incubated for 2 h at 30 °C before being PBS-washed and alkaline carbonate-stripped. In cross-linking studies, PBS-washed (two times) golgin-84-containing microsomes were exposed to 0.01 and 0.10 mmdithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) in PBS (1.8 μl of Promega microsome stock/50 μl of DTSSP) for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (final concentration). Cross-linked protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, since the DTSSP cross-linker is thiol-cleavable. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the in vitro translated products were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sprayed with En3Hance spray (DuPont) before being exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. EGFP-tagged fusion proteins were expressed in cultured cells from cytomegalovirus promoters. Golgin-84 cDNA restriction fragments encoding the C-terminal 51 (BclI, XbaI) and 184 (BglII, XbaI) amino acid residues were subcloned into BglII, XbaI-digested pEGFP-C3 DNA (CLONTECH). Expression constructs were made with nonmethylated DNA and screened for in a methylase minus E. coli strain SCS110 (Stratagene). Once made, the constructs were transformed into E. coli DH5a. DNA was then prepared for transfection using Qiagen kits. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were seeded (∼1.6 × 105 cells/ml) into chambered (four or eight chambers) slides (Lab-Tek) coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Cells were transfected by exposing them to serum-free DMEM containing DNA and liposomes (1 μg of DNA/5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of medium), and after 5 h an equal volume of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. Transfected cells were analyzed by light microscopy ∼20 h after the start of transfection. For immunostaining, cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin. A pEGFP vector without insert was expressed in cells as a control. An adult human brain cDNA library was screened with a 4.3-kbp human OCRL1 cDNA (8Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) using a Matchmaker kit. Of ∼1.5 million clones screened, two positives were identified. One clone was a novel 781-bp partial cDNA termed 13d. Based on its size and subcellular localization (see below) we term the 13d protein golgin-84. A search of the Unigene data base indicated that the golgin-84 gene maps to distal human chromosome 14q in the region D14S292-qter. To analyze golgin-84 expression a mouse multiple tissue poly(A)+ mRNA blot was probed with a golgin-84 cDNA (Fig.1). A single ∼2.9-kb message was detected that was ubiquitously expressed and abundant in testis. Similar results were obtained with human poly(A)+ mRNA blots (message ∼2.8 kb, data not shown). A 2.63-kbp golgin-84 cDNA (number 16) was then isolated from a human testis library with a 828-bp expressed sequence tag probe, 134426 (Fig.2). The testis clone was found to lack ∼0.2 kbp of sequence from its 3′-UTR when compared with expressed sequence tag AA405331, which matched 85 bp at the 3′-end of clone 16 and extended an additional 209 bp and included a poly(A)+tail. The G + C content was uniform across most of the cDNA but was increased significantly (68%) in the 5′-UTR (131 nucleotides). This high G + C content is characteristic of housekeeping promoters and 5′-UTRs. Of all of the ATGs analyzed in the golgin-84 number 16 cDNA, the sequence flanking the 5′-most ATG (CCATCATGT) conformed best with the Kozak consensus (9Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar, 10Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) as determined by a weighted matrix. An in frame stop codon occurred 21 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG. The open reading frame extending from this ATG was predicted by the Fickett algorithm (11Fickett J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5303-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) to have a 92% chance of coding and encoded a 731-amino acid protein with a mass of 83 kDa.In vitro transcription and translation of the golgin-84 cDNA yielded an ∼84-kDa protein, which matches the protein size seen by Western blotting of tissues (described below). We conclude therefore, that the combined sequence contains the entire coding region and most if not all of the golgin-84 transcript.Figure 2Human golgin-84 cDNA sequence and its encoded protein (GenBankTM accession number AF085199).The first 2.63 kb of sequence was derived from a testis cDNA; the remaining 0.2 kb of 3′-UTR sequence, shown after the dashed line, was taken from expressed sequence tag AA405331. The largest open reading frame is predicted to have a 92% chance of coding (11Fickett J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5303-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar); it encodes a 731-amino acid protein of ∼83 kDa. The sequence flanking the ATG initiation codon conforms with the Kozak consensus and is preceded by an in frame stop codon 21 nucleotides upstream. A polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, is located immediately upstream of the poly(A) tail.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the golgin-84 protein, antibodies were raised in rabbit against His6-tagged denatured and solid phase renatured antigen containing golgin-84 amino acids 498–688 made in E. coli. Golgin-84 antibodies were purified from rabbit antisera with an affinity column. One affinity-purified antibody immunoprecipitatedin vitro translated 35S-labeled golgin-84 protein and detected an ∼84-kDa protein on Western blots of human fibroblast lysates. The corresponding preimmune serum did neither, implying that the affinity-purified antibody recognizes both native and denatured golgin-84. Golgin-84 protein expression was next analyzed in tissues. The affinity-purified golgin-84 antibody was used to probe a Western blot containing lysates (30 μg/lane) from eight mouse tissues, the same tissues used for Northern blot analysis (Fig.3 A). Golgin-84 protein was abundant in testis and present at much lower levels in the other tissues, consistent with the Northern blot data. In heart and muscle, the antibody cross-reacted with abundant myosin (data not shown). To study golgin-84 expression further, mouse testis cryosections were histochemically immunostained with the affinity-purified golgin-84 antibody. Immunostained sections indicated that golgin-84 was abundant in the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells (Fig. 3 B). Not all seminiferous cells immunostained with the antibody; staining was greatly reduced or absent in the spermatozoa. The immunostaining pattern differed between seminiferous tubules, probably reflecting differences in the stage of spermatogenesis occurring in different tubules (12Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). The juxtanuclear immunostaining pattern and its absence/reduction from mature spermatozoa suggested that golgin-84 localized to the Golgi. To determine if golgin-84 was sublocalized to the Golgi, NRK cells were double-labeled with the affinity-purified golgin-84 antibody and an antibody against the Golgi enzyme mannosidase II (medial-trans cisternae). Golgin-84 was detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate and mannosidase II with Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies. The fluorescent signals from the two proteins overlapped considerably, indicating that golgin-84 is indeed a Golgi protein (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with golgin-84 being a Golgi protein, anti-golgin-84 antibody labeled fragmented structures in mitotically dividing NRK cells (13Lowe M. Nakamura N. Warren G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 40-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); the mitotic status of the cells was established by double labeling with a β-tubulin antibody (data not shown). To establish the resident time of golgin-84 in the Golgi, NRK cells were treated with 50 μg of cycloheximide/μl of culture media for 1, 2, 4, and 7 h. Cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis without affecting protein traffic across the Golgi compartments, thus clearing the Golgi of proteins in transit. At 7 h, golgin-84 was still in the Golgi, implying that it is resident there (data not shown). To confirm golgin-84's sublocalization as well as to examine its redistribution kinetics on Golgi perturbation, NRK cells were exposed to 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) in tissue culture media (14Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation with BFA, golgin-84 was transported to and distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4 B). Several cells still showed an intense staining immediately adjacent to their nuclei, suggesting that golgin-84 may be present in the trans-Golgi in addition to the earlier disassembling cis/middle cisternae (15Alcalde J. Bonay P. Roa A. Vilaro S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Shorter BFA exposure times of 2, 5, 15, and 30 min showed that golgin-84 began to redistribute to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at between ∼2 and 5 min of BFA treatment (data not shown), similar to integral membrane Golgi proteins such as mannosidase II (data not shown), but much slower than rapid on-off proteins involved in coat formation such as β-COP (16Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17Serafini T. Stenbeck G. Brecht A. Lottspeich F. Orci L. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Nature. 1991; 349: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Upon drug removal, the Golgi reformed, and golgin-84 returned to it. Cells recovered at different rates. By 1 h, many cells appeared almost fully recovered, with small amounts of golgin-84 remaining in the ER (Fig. 4 B). Golgin-84 was predicted to be a transmembrane protein with type II topology. Hydropathy profile analysis (18Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16899) Google Scholar) predicted a single transmembrane domain (TMD) close to its C terminus at amino acid residues 699–717 (Fig. 5 A) with a slight hydrophobic moment on an Eisenberg hydrophobic moment plot (19Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic moment suggests the golgin-84 TMD associates with one or more other TMDs in the membrane (19Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Based on the charge flanking the golgin-84 TMD, the N-terminal 698 residues of the protein were predicted to be cytoplasmic, and the short 14-residue C terminus was predicted to be luminal (type II membrane protein). No signal sequence was detected with a von Heijne weighted matrix algorithm (20Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3685) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein inserts post-translationally into membranes. To determine if golgin-84 is an integral membrane protein, its mRNA was translated into [35S]methionine-labeled protein in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomes. After translation, the microsomes were washed, stripped to remove peripheral membrane proteins, and collected by centrifugation. The microsomes contained golgin-84, indicating that the protein had been translocated into them (Fig. 5 B). The membrane location and orientation of golgin-84 was then established by a protease protection assay. Microsomes containing the translocated protein were treated with proteinase K. Golgin-84 was digested by the protease to below 66.2 kDa, suggesting that the 698-amino acid N terminus was exposed on the surface of the microsomes, consistent with it being a type II membrane protein (Fig. 5, C andD). A control secretory protein β-lactamase was translocated into the microsome lumen and protected from digestion, indicating that the microsomes were functional and intact (Fig.5 C). Golgin-84 lacks a predicted signal sequence and is thus expected to undergo post-translational insertion into membranes (21Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, microsomes were added either prior to the start of translation or after translation had been terminated by the addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 5 E). Microsomes that were exposed to translating or full-length golgin-84 protein (translation terminated by cycloheximide) for a period of 2 h at 30 °C were washed with PBS, alkaline-extracted, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, translating golgin-84 was translocated into the microsomes. Full-length golgin-84 protein, exposed to microsomes after termination of translation, was also translocated into the microsomal membranes, implying a post-translational mechanism of insertion. In vitro transcription and translation studies indicated golgin-84 to be a C-terminally anchored membrane protein. To confirm that the protein is C-terminally anchored"

To address the regulation of human caspase activation, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is devoid of endogenous caspases. The apical procaspases, -8β and -10, were efficiently processed and activated in yeast. Although protease activity, per se, was insufficient to drive cell death, caspase-10 activity had little effect on cell viability, whereas expression of caspase-8β was cytotoxic. This lethal phenotype was abrogated by co-expression of the pan-caspase inhibitor, baculovirus p35, and by mutation of the active site cysteine of procaspase-8β. In contrast, autoactivation of the executioner caspase-3 and -6 zymogens was not detected. Procaspase-3 activation required co-expression of procaspase-8 or -10. Surprisingly, activation of procaspase-6 required proteolytic activities other than caspase-8, -10, or -3. Caspase-8β or -10 activity was insufficient to catalyze the maturation of procaspase-6. Moreover, a constitutively active caspase-3, although cytotoxic in its own right, was unable to induce the processing of wild-type procaspase-6 and vice versa. These results distinguish sequential modes of activation for different caspases in vivo and establish a yeast model system to examine the regulation of caspase cascades. Moreover, the distinct terminal phenotypes induced by various caspases attest to differences in the cellular targets of these apoptotic proteases, which may be defined using this system.

Moreover, the distinct terminal phenotypes induced by various caspases attest to differences in the cellular targets of these apoptotic proteases, which may be defined using this system. Apoptosis is a highly regulated program of cellular suicide critical for the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Many human diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, AIDS, and several forms of cancer, have been attributed to deregulation of the apoptotic program (3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). The controlled disassembly of cellular structures in response to a wide variety of apoptotic signals is characterized by distinct biochemical and morphological changes (4Green D.R. Reed J.C.

The coordinated activation of a family of cysteine proteases that cleave at specific aspartic acid residues, termed caspases, appears crucial for the execution of the apoptotic program (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 7Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Strict sequence specificity limits the endoproteolytic activity of the mature caspases to a few sites within a fairly small number of defined substrates. Nevertheless, these cleavages result in the activation of pro-apoptotic functions such as the caspases themselves and DNA fragmentation factor, as well as the inactivation of proteins involved in DNA repair, mRNA splicing, or the maintenance of nuclear architecture (6Thornberry N.A.

Phylogenetic analyses distinguish two subfamilies comprising the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -13) and the CED-3/CPP32 proteases (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10) (6Thornberry N.A.

These proteins are expressed as precursor zymogens or procaspases, whose activation involves sequential proteolytic cleavages at aspartic acid residues to liberate the large and small subunits of the mature caspase as well as the prodomain (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 9Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar, 11Nicholson D.W.

The crystal structures of mature caspase-1 and caspase-3 indicate a heterotetramer where two small subunits are flanked by two large subunits, with one of each subunit contributing to the active sites of the heterodimeric enzyme (11Nicholson D.W.

However, the identification of at least 11 human caspase genes, coupled with complex patterns of caspase gene expression in most cells, precludes a direct analysis of individual caspase function in the absence of other caspases. To circumvent these issues, we expressed human caspase-8β, -10, -3, and -6 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the autocatalytic and sequential proteolytic processing of these zymogens, in the absence of other caspase-like activities. Searches of the yeast genome failed to identify caspase homologs, and caspase-like activities have not been detected in yeast cell extracts. The utility of this genetically tractable organism in studying apoptotic mechanisms was recently demonstrated by the identification of yeast and human genes that regulate the proapoptotic activity of Bax in yeast (24Xu Q.

Here, we demonstrate that in yeast it was possible to establish different cascades of caspase activation and directly assess the phenotypic consequences of these unique activities on cell viability and morphology. Our results demonstrate a sequential activation of caspases in vivo, whereby caspase-3 requires initiating protease function(s) for processing, and caspase-8β and caspase-10 catalyze their own processing as well as that of procaspase-3. Surprisingly, however, caspase-6 appears to lie in a distinct protease cascade. This zymogen was not processed by either caspase -8β or -10, nor were constitutively active versions of caspase-3 or -6 able to induce the activation of the wild-type caspase-6 or -3 zymogens, respectively. Apoptosis is a highly regulated program of cellular suicide critical for the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

Many human diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, AIDS, and several forms of cancer, have been attributed to deregulation of the apoptotic program (3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). The controlled disassembly of cellular structures in response to a wide variety of apoptotic signals is characterized by distinct biochemical and morphological changes (4Green D.R. Reed J.C.

The coordinated activation of a family of cysteine proteases that cleave at specific aspartic acid residues, termed caspases, appears crucial for the execution of the apoptotic program (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 7Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Strict sequence specificity limits the endoproteolytic activity of the mature caspases to a few sites within a fairly small number of defined substrates. Nevertheless, these cleavages result in the activation of pro-apoptotic functions such as the caspases themselves and DNA fragmentation factor, as well as the inactivation of proteins involved in DNA repair, mRNA splicing, or the maintenance of nuclear architecture (6Thornberry N.A.

Phylogenetic analyses distinguish two subfamilies comprising the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme-like proteases (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -13) and the CED-3/CPP32 proteases (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10) (6Thornberry N.A.

These proteins are expressed as precursor zymogens or procaspases, whose activation involves sequential proteolytic cleavages at aspartic acid residues to liberate the large and small subunits of the mature caspase as well as the prodomain (6Thornberry N.A.

In cirrhosis, the wounding response of the liver, circulating ET-1 levels are elevated; moreover, ET-1 has potent effects on hepatic stellate cells, the key effectors of cirrhosis. In this study, we have examined the regulatory role of ECE-1, a critical enzyme involved in ET-1 synthesis, in the two major cellular sources of hepatic ET-1. ET-1 release from normal hepatic endothelial cells was 25-fold higher than that from normal stellate cells. However, after liver injury, ET-1 release was increased in stellate cells but markedly decreased in endothelial cells. The two major isoforms of ECE-1, ECE-1α/1β, made up 80% and 20%, respectively, of total ECE-1 in both stellate and endothelial cells. Following liver injury, ECE-1α mRNA was decreased by 44.2% in stellate cells, and by 16.1% in endothelial cells. ECE-1β mRNA expression remained unchanged after injury. In contrast to ECE-1 mRNA, ECE-1 protein expression was increased by 43.9% in stellate cells but decreased in endothelial cells, while relative ECE-1 enzymatic activity was unchanged. In mRNA stability experiments, the half-life of ECE-1α mRNA in normal stellate cells was 13 h compared with 38 h in cells from injured livers. Thus, during hepatic wound healing, differential regulation of ECE-1 mRNA and protein appears to be critical in controlling ET-1 production.

Botelho L.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar,3Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2989-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This enzymatic step has been felt to be relatively nonspecific and not rate-limiting (1Rubanyi G.M. Botelho L.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2713-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Big ET-1 is subsequently cleaved at the Trp-21 residue by a specific membrane-bound endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) (4Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Recently, two ECE-1 isoforms have been identified and termed ECE-1α and -1β, which are alternatively spliced products of the same gene and share the same C-terminal domain (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). ECE-1 has been localized predominantly to endothelial cells, the apparent primary source of ET-1 (4Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. deWit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Thus, ECE-1 has been regarded as an integral component of ET-1 processing in endothelial cells. Persistent hepatic injury leads to a wound healing response that ultimately results in the entity known as cirrhosis. This scarring process is analogous to injury in other organs and includes components of both increased fibrogenesis and wound contraction. Recent evidence indicates that a key component of the hepatic wounding response is the hepatic stellate cell (also Ito cell or lipocyte), a pericyte-like perisinusoidal cell of mesenchymal lineage that lies in close proximity to sinusoidal endothelial cells (7Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). After injury, stellate cells undergo a programmed cascade of events, including enhanced matrix synthesis, cellular proliferation, and remarkable de novoexpression of smooth muscle α-actin, the latter event suggesting a stellate cell to myofibroblast transition (8Kent G. Gay S. Inouye T. Bahu R. Minick O.T. Popper H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3719-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Maher J.J. McGuire R.F. J. Clin.

Fallani M. Biagini G. Bianchi F.B. Pisi E. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1988; 56: 45-49Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This process, termed “activation,” may be stimulated by ET-1 and is mediated by endothelin A and B receptors on stellate cells (12Housset C. Rockey D.C. Bissell D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9266-9270Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 13Rockey D.C. Fouassier L. Chung J.J. Carayon A. Vallee P. Rey C. Housset C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Further study has demonstrated that ET-1 causes stellate cell proliferation and contraction and collagen production during liver injury (13Rockey D.C. Fouassier L. Chung J.J. Carayon A. Vallee P. Rey C. Housset C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Kawada N. Tran-Thi T.A. Klein H. Decker K. Eur. J.

Thus, the data suggest that ET-1 has important effects in hepatic wound healing via its actions on stellate cells. Although ET-1 production during hepatic wounding is likely to be regulated (at least in part) at the level of preproET-1 mRNA production in liver endothelial and stellate cells (13Rockey D.C. Fouassier L. Chung J.J. Carayon A. Vallee P. Rey C. Housset C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ECE-1 could also be an important regulator of ET-1 production. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated ET-1 release as well as ECE-1 mRNA and protein regulation in cells from normal and injured rat livers. We have taken advantage of our ability to reproducibly create a wounding healing environment in the liver and, moreover, the ability to isolate specific cellular components that are the sources of ET-1. The data are consistent with a unique combination of regulatory events in specific cellular compartments during hepatic wound healing and have important implications for endothelin biology in parenchymal organ injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (450–500 gram, Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were maintained on standard chow and water ad libitum. Hepatic fibrogenesis was induced by gavage with carbon tetrachloride (1.0 ml/kg mixed with corn oil) on consecutive weeks or by ligation of the common bile duct (16Kountouras J. Billing B.H. Scheuer P.J. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1984; 65: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar, 17Proctor E. Chatamra K. Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Nonparenchymal cells were isolated as described previously (18de Leeuw A.M. McCarthy S.P. Geerts A. Knook D.L. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, stellate and endothelial cells were isolated by perfusion in situ with 20 mg/100 ml Pronase and 7.5 mg/100 ml collagenase (both from Boehringer Mannheim). The cell suspension was layered on a discontinuous density gradient of 8.2 and 15.6% nycodenz (Accurate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY). The resulting upper layer consists of more than 95% stellate cells. Endothelial cells in the lower layer were further purified by centrifugal elutriation (18 ml/min flow). Purity was assessed by the use of specific markers for each stellate cells and endothelial cells (19Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in modified medium 199, containing 20% serum (10% horse serum and 10% calf serum, Life Technologies, Inc.), 4 mg/100 ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/100 ml amphotericin at a density of approximately 1 × 106cells/ml. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (containing 95% O2 and 5% CO2), and the medium was changed at every 24 h. Cell viability was greater than 80% in all cultures utilized for study. Cells were cultured in serum-containing medium for 48 h, after which time serum-free conditions were introduced. ET-1 in supernatants was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit according to manufacturer specifications (Peninsula Labs, Palo Alto, CA). Immunoreactive ET-1 was normalized to total protein content for each sample (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). The ET-1 antibody used in the radioimmunoassay kit exhibited <5% cross-reactivity with unlabeled ET-3 and <3% cross-reactivity with unlabeled ET-2. Inter- and intra-assay variability of the radioimmunoassay system were 3.8 and 1.5%, respectively. Based on the reported sequence of rat ECE-1 (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), oligodeoxynucleotide primers that could detect each ECE, ECE-1α, and ECE-1β mRNA were synthesized (Fig. 1) (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA). 5′ and 3′ sequences used to isolate ECE-1 were as follows: CGG CTG GTG GTT CTG GTG (154–171bp) and CTT GGT TGT GCT CCC AGA GGT (404–424bp). 5′ and 3′ sequences encoding alternatively spliced ECE-1α and ECE-1β mRNA variants (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the following: ATG ATG TCA TCC TAC AAG (1–18 bp) and CTT GGT TGT GCT CCC AGA GGT (404–424bp) were used to clone ECE-1α cDNA, and ATG GGC AGC CTG AGG CCT (1–18 bp) and CAT GGA GTT TAG GAT GGA (304–321 bp) were used to obtain ECE-1β cDNA (Fig. 1). cDNA fragments were amplified and cloned into pGEM7+ (Promega, Madison, WI). cDNAs, resulting in 270 (ECE-1), 424 (ECE-1α), and 321 (ECE-1β) base pair fragments, respectively, were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method and found to have 99–100% homology to published cDNAs (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18275-18278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted (Tri-reagent, Molecular Research Inc, Cincinnati, OH) from cell lysates; RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically (A 260/280). The integrity of all samples was documented by visualization of 18 and 28 S ribosomal bands after electrophoresis through a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. Radiolabeled probes were synthesized by transcription of appropriate plasmid cDNA with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA (20 μg) was incubated with 1.0 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled cRNA, denatured at 78 °C for 15 min, and hybridized in hybridization buffer at 55 °C for 12–16 h. Unhybridized RNA was digested, and protected hybrids were denatured and separated by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide/urea sequencing gel. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR-5, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY), and scanning densitometry was used to quantitate autoradiographic signals. All RNA samples were also probed with either a cDNA encoding 585 bp of ribosomal protein S-14 (21Rhoads D.D. Dixit A. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2774-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or a cDNA encoding 316 bp of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion, Austin, TX) to verify the integrity of mRNA in each sample and to control internally for the amount of mRNA present in an individual assay. Transfer RNA and lung RNA were used as negative and positive RNAs, respectively, for all experiments. Cultured cells were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmMgCl2 and protease inhibitors, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm pepstatin A, and 20 μm leupeptin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The microsomal membrane fraction was resuspended, and samples (30 μg) were incubated with ECE-1 antibody (10 μg/sample) at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was subsequently incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) precoupled with rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 40 s, the beads were washed three times, and immune complexes were disassociated by heating to 100 °C for 3 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 40 s, supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblot, microsomal membrane proteins (30 μg) or the sample proteins (30 μg) from immunoprecipitation were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (5% mercaptoethanol) and transferred to the nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Blots were incubated with ECE-1 primary antibody B61/104 (1:400) (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Subkowski, BASF, Aktiengesellschaft, Germany) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive protein was detected after addition of substrates and exposed to x-ray film. Bands corresponding to ECE-1 were quantitated by scanning densitometry. ECE-1 enzymatic activity was determined as described previously(4). In brief, microsomal membrane fractions (30 μg) were preincubated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 0.5 m NaCl and protease inhibitors at 37 °C for 15 min prior to addition of 1 μm big ET-1. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in siliconized tubes and terminated by adding 50 μl of 5 mm EDTA. The mixture was then processed as above to detect immunoreactive ET-1. Data are expressed as mean ± standard errors (S.E.) and “n” refers to the numbers of individual experiments performed. Differences among groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls test. The 0.05 level of probability was used as the criterion of significance. We utilized two models of hepatic wounding to examine ET-1 regulation in stellate and endothelial cells. Histological assessment of livers after injury revealed that administration of CCl4 for 14 doses resulted in extensive portal-central, central-central, and portal-portal bridging fibrosis with portal hypertension documented in all cases; bile duct ligation for 8 days resulted in bile duct proliferation with extensive periportal expansion of biliary radicals and extension of fibrous bands from portal tracts into the lobule. Previous studies have demonstrated that preproET-1 mRNA is up-regulated in both stellate and endothelial cells after bile duct ligation, but to a much greater degree in stellate than endothelial cells (13Rockey D.C. Fouassier L. Chung J.J. Carayon A. Vallee P. Rey C. Housset C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although these data elucidate a potential site for ET-1 regulation after wounding, we postulated that because ECE-1 converts big ET-1 to biologically active ET-1, production of the final 21 amino acid product might be regulated not only at the level of precursor preproET-1/big ET-1, but also by the quantity and/or activity of ECE-1. Initial experiments, therefore, examined ET-1 release by normal and injured stellate and endothelial cells. Experiments were designed such that ET-1 levels were measured in culture media soon after cell isolation, and thus would reflect in vivo production and release of ET-1. We found that ET-1 production in normal endothelial cells was 25-fold higher than that from normal stellate cells (Fig. 2). However, after liver injury (both BDL and CCl4-treated rats), ET-1 release from stellate cells was increased, whereas it was decreased in sinusoidal endothelial cells. These data provide strong evidence that endothelial cells are the main source of ET-1 production in normal liver but that, after liver injury, the cellular source of released ET-1 shifts to stellate cells. During initial examination of ECE in liver injury, we explored ECE-1 mRNA and protein expression in stellate and endothelial cells from normal and injured liver. As under “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1, ECE-1 has two isoforms, ECE-1α and ECE-1β. ECE-1α appears to be localized to microsomal membranes, whereas ECE-1β is found on the plasma membrane (6Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 22Gui G. Xu D. Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. Parnot C. Le Moullec J.M. Cousin M.A. Guedin D. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22 (suppl.): 53-56Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, these isoforms may be responsible for endogenous and exogenous conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1, respectively. We found that in each stellate and endothelial cells, ECE-1α mRNA represents the predominant form, making up 80% of total ECE-1 (e.g.ECE-1β constitutes 20% of total ECE-1) (Fig. 3). During liver injury, we unexpectedly found that ECE-1 mRNA levels were reduced in stellate cells (approximately 30%) in both models of liver injury (Fig. 4). ECE-1 mRNA in endothelial cells was also decreased after each bile duct ligation and carbon tetrachloride administration, but to a lesser extent than for stellate cells. Additionally, mRNA expression of the predominant isoform of ECE-1, ECE-1α was significantly decreased in both stellate and endothelial cells after liver wounding (Fig. 5), whereas ECE-1β mRNA levels were not altered (data not shown).Figure 5ECE-1α mRNA expression is decreased in stellate and endothelial cells from injured liver. Stellate and endothelial cells were isolated after liver injury and cultured as in Fig. 2. Forty-eight h after plating, total cellular RNA (20 μg/sample) was isolated and hybridized with32P-labeled cRNAs (ECE-1α and S14) as described under “Materials and Methods.” In panel A, a representative RNase protection assay is shown. In panel B, specific ECE-1α bands were scanned, quantitated, and normalized to the signal for S14 and the data presented graphically. *, p < 0.05 compared with normal (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the decreased ECE-1 mRNA expression was associated with a similar change in protein expression in stellate and endothelial cells after liver injury, we measured intracellular expression of ECE-1 by immunoblotting of microsomal fractions. In contrast to the reduction in ECE mRNA levels, we found that ECE-1 protein levels in stellate cells from injured liver were 43.9% higher than in normal cells, whereas ECE-1 levels in endothelial cells were decreased by 27.6% (Fig. 6). ECE-1 protein levels in normal sinusoidal endothelial cells were 1.3-fold greater than that in normal stellate cells, whereas ECE-1 levels in stellate cells from injured liver were 1.8-fold greater than that from sinusoidal endothelial cells. To determine whether liver injury had an effect on ECE-1 activity itself, we examined conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 by ECE in stellate and endothelial cells from normal and injured livers. After normalizing ECE-1 activity (i.e. conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1) to immunoprecipitated ECE-1, we found no difference in ECE-1 activity in stellate or endothelial cells after liver injury (data not shown). Thus, the quantitative ECE-1 data parallel the results of immunoreactive ET-1 production from stellate and endothelial cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that altered expression of ECE-1 without alteration of its activity in stellate and endothelial cells after wounding determines release of mature ET-1. The divergent results identified for ECE mRNA and protein expression in stellate cells from normal and injured liver imply a form of post-transcriptional regulation for ECE-1. To investigate this possibility, we determined ECE-1α mRNA stability by using the inhibitor of RNA polymerase, actinomycin D. We found that ECE-1α mRNA decay in stellate cells from CCl4-treated rats was much slower than that in normal rats (Fig. 7). mRNA in normal stellate cells was decreased after 6 h and dramatically decreased between 12 and 36 h after exposure of cells with actinomycin D. In contrast, ECE-1α mRNA in stellate cells from CCl4-treated rats was only slightly decreased over a 36-h time span (Fig. 7). By interpolation (23Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), half-life time (t 12) of ECE-1α mRNA in normal stellate cells was found to be 13 h but was 38 h in stellate cells from CCl4-treated rats. Therefore, the 3-fold longer mRNA stability in stellate cells from injured compared with cells from normal liver is likely to be responsible for comparatively greater ECE-1 protein expression in stellate cells. The wounding response to injury is carried out by cells which contract the wound and/or produce increased amounts of extracellular matrix. For example, the mediator of the wounding healing response of the liver is the perisinusoidal stellate cell, a cell type which undergoes a cascade of events that confers on them the ability to contract and to produce large amounts of extracellular matrix proteins. Additionally, stellate cells have been shown to express abundant endothelin and cytokine (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-β) receptors, the ligands for which have been implicated in their contractility and fibrogenesis, respectively. ET-1, the predominant ET-receptor ligand, appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of a number of pathologic wound healing diseases such as renal, cardiac, and pulmonary fibrosis as well as hepatic cirrhosis (24Moore K. Wendon J. Frazer M. Karani J. Williams R. Badr K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 25Gandhi C.R. Sproat L.A. Subbotin V.M.

In cirrhosis, plasma ET-1 levels are elevated (24Moore K. Wendon J. Frazer M. Karani J. Williams R. Badr K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1774-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 28Moller S. Gulberg V. Henriksen J.H. Gerbes A.L. J. Hepatol. 1995; 23: 135-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that liver sinusoidal endothelial and stellate cells are sources of ET-1 (13Rockey D.C.

Further, ET-1 has been shown to have potent effects on stellate cells, inducing their contraction and resulting in their activation (12Housset C. Rockey D.C. Bissell D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9266-9270Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Kawada N. Tran-Thi T.A. Klein H. Decker K. Eur. J.

For this reason, an important issue with regard to liver wounding is the regulation of ET-1. Our data demonstrate a shift in the cellular source of ET-1 after hepatic wounding. In normal liver, sinusoidal endothelial cells released significantly more ET-1 than stellate cells. In contrast, after injury, stellate cells became a more prominent source of ET-1 and are likely to be responsible for elevated circulating levels of this peptide in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, the mechanism for the change in ET-1 release appeared to be that ECE was differentially regulated (i.e. up in stellate and down in endothelial cells) in the two cell types. These data raise the possibility that nonendothelial structures might be an important source of ET-1 in other forms of wound healing. We have previously shown that preproET-1 mRNA becomes elevated in both stellate and endothelial cells after bile duct ligation, although to a much greater degree in stellate than endothelial cells (13Rockey D.C. Fouassier L. Chung J.J. Carayon A. Vallee P. Rey C. Housset C. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with enhanced production of ET-1 and suggest that ET-1 production could be regulated at the level of preproET-1 mRNA transcription and preproET-1/big ET-1 synthesis. However, because the level of biologically active ET-1 also depends on ECE-1, the enzyme that converts big ET-1 to ET-1, we postulated that ECE-1 could serve as an important regulatory element. Surprisingly, while ECE-1 mRNA decreased during liver wounding in both stellate and endothelial cells, the level of proteolytically active ECE-1 protein increased in stellate cells but decreased in endothelial cells (a picture mirrored by cellular ET-1 release). Not only is such a differential regulatory event unique, but, because released ET-1 peptide levels closely parallel ECE-1 protein expression, this leads us to conclude that ECE-1 plays a major role in the regulation of ET-1 release into the wounding environment. Other work is consistent with our own and suggests that ECE-1 is important in regulation of ET-1 production in pathological states. For example, in a rat vascular balloon injury model and human coronary atherosclerotic lesions, ECE-1 mRNA and enzyme activity were increased (34Minamino T. Kurihara H. Takahashi M. Shimada K. Maemura K. Oda H. Ishikawa T. Uchiyama T. Tanzawa K. Yazaki Y. Yorimitsu K. Moroi K. Inagaki N. Saito T. Masuda Y. Masaki T. Seino S. Kimura S. Circulation. 1997; 95: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ECE is regulated in these models is open to speculation but has been postulated to be related to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as this compound has been shown to directly stimulate ECE-1 expression (35Matsuura A. Kawashima S. Yamochi W. Hirata K. Yamaguchi T. Emoto N. Yokoyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, in human bronchial epithelial cells, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were shown to increase not only ET-1 mRNA expression and ET-1 release but also ECE-1 mRNA expression (26Saleh D. Furukawa K. Tsao M.S. Maghazachi A. Corrin B. Yanagisawa M. Barnes P.J. Giaid A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We postulate, however, that ET-1 regulation in liver injury and wounding is likely to be more complex than simple cytokine or growth factor stimulation of ECE-1 mRNA and protein (or preproET-1 mRNA) because we have demonstrated divergent regulation of ECE-1 mRNA and protein in two different cell types, each of which is prominent in liver wounding. Phosphoramidon-sensitive ECEs are type II integral membrane proteins; two ECEs, ECE-1 (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K.

Sequence analysis of ECE-1 and ECE-2 reveals 59% amino acid homology; the two isoforms are distinguished largely by their sensitivity to phosphoramidon, their pH optimum, and possibly by their subcellular localization (38Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of ECE-1, ECE-1α and ECE-1β, have been identified in various rat tissues, but the expression level of ECE-1α is 5–10-fold higher than that of ECE-1β (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that ECE-1α mRNA was 4-fold higher than ECE-1β in normal stellate and endothelial cells and that mRNA levels of ECE-1 and ECE-1α were decreased in stellate and endothelial cells from injured liver but ECE-1β levels were unchanged. These results are important for two reasons. First, ECE-1α appears to be regulable, whereas ECE-1β apparently is not. Secondly, because ECE-1α is the major isoform and is regulable, the data imply that ECE-1α is the major biologically isoform of ECE-1 (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that ECE-1 is localized primarily to endothelial cells (40Barnes K. Walkden B.J.

In our study, we have not only definitively confirmed ECE-1 expression by liver endothelial cells but also demonstrated ECE-1 production by stellate cells, mesenchymal cells of an entirely different lineage than endothelial cells. Other data on expression of ECE-1 in nonendothelial cells are limited but indicate that ECE-1 mRNA or protein expression is predominantly a feature of endothelial cells; few other cell types express ECE-1 (40Barnes K. Walkden B.J. Wilkinson T.C. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Takada J. Hata M. Okada K. Matsuyama K. Yano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that stellate cells were a major source of ECE. Thus, it is likely that paracrine effects of endothelial cell-derived ET-1 on stellate cells are important; however, our data also highlight an important potential autocrine loop of ET-1 synthesis and binding in nonendothelial cells. The intracellular distribution of ECE-1 is important because different ECE-1 isoforms localized to different subcellular fractions may behave differently in function. The majority of ECE-1 activity has been identified in microsomal membrane fractions (22Gui G. Xu D. Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. Parnot C. Le Moullec J.M. Cousin M.A. Guedin D. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22 (suppl.): 53-56Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Currently available data suggest that ECE-1α is most likely localized at intracellular compartment whereas ECE-1β is on plasma membrane (6Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 44Schweizer A. Valdenaire O. Nelbock P. Deuschle U. Dumas Milne Edwards J.B. Stumpf J.G. Loffler B.M. Biochem.

Localization studies have demonstrated that, in Chinese hamster ovary and/or COS cells transfected with ECE-1, ECE-1α or ECE-1β, all three isoforms localize to the plasma and intracellular membrane (5Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,41Takahashi M. Fukuda K. Shimada K. Barnes K. Turner A.J. Ikeda M. Koike H. Yamamoto Y. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, other data conflict and indicate that ECE-1 and ECE-1α are found intracellularly, whereas ECE-1β is present on the plasma membrane (22Gui G. Xu D. Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. Parnot C. Le Moullec J.M. Cousin M.A. Guedin D. Corvol P. Pinet F. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22 (suppl.): 53-56Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most of the currently available studies demonstrating ECE-1α in intracellular locations have been performed in endothelial cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas studies revealing ECE-1α and ECE-1β localization to the plasma membrane have been done in transfected cells that normally do not express ECE-1. Our study allows careful examination of the cellular compartmentation of ECE-1. We have demonstrated by both subcellular fractionation and immunohistochemistry (data not shown) that in both primary endothelial and stellate cells, the vast majority of ECE-1 is intracellular. This finding is consistent with the postulate that the predominant active isoform is microsomal-bound ECE-1α rather than ECE-1β. Our results indicate that the half-life of ECE-1 mRNA was dramatically increased in stellate cells after liver injury and their activation. This was associated with a striking decrease in steady-state ECE-1 mRNA levels and an increase in ECE-1 protein; in aggregate, these data intimate that ECE-1 mRNA transcription is reduced in injured stellate cells, but also suggest that ECE-1 protein levels are controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. In contrast, the half-life of ECE-1 mRNA in endothelial cells is unchanged after injury whereas ECE-1 mRNA and protein levels are reduced, suggesting transcriptional or pre-translational control. Although we are unaware of previous data demonstrating altered ECE-1 mRNA stability and protein expression in a biologically important situation such as wound healing, these data have several important implications. For example, the data raise the possibility that the wounding response results in production or recruitment of cellular machinery that could stabilize ECE-1 mRNA and imply that wounding may modify cellular protein synthesis by complex molecular mechanisms."

The goal of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of endocytic sorting, focussing on post-internalization events. We have identified a sequence located between amino acid residues 675 and 697, encompassing a dileucine motif at residues 679 and 680, that enhances endosome-to-lysosome transport when conformational restraints in the EGF receptor carboxyl terminus are removed by truncation. The same dileucine motif is also necessary for efficient lysosomal transport of ligand-occupied full-length EGF receptors. A L679A,L680A substitution diminished the degradation of occupied full-length EGF receptors without affecting internalization but had a significant effect on recycling. Rapid recycling of mutant receptors resulted in reduced intracellular retention of occupied EGF receptors and delayed down-regulation of cell surface receptors. We propose that the L679A,L680A substitution acts primarily to impair transport of ligand-receptor complexes through an early endosomal compartment, diverting occupied receptors to a recycling compartment at the expense of incorporation into lysosome transport vesicles. We also found that mutant receptors with truncations at the distal half of tyrosine kinase domain (residues 809–957) were not efficiently delivered to the cell surface but were destroyed in an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradative pathway.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). EGF regulates the intracellular trafficking of ligand-EGF receptor (EGFR) complexes, causing accelerated internalization from clathrin-coated pits, retention in endosomes, and ultimately degradation in lysosomes (reviewed in Ref.2Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ligand-regulated EGFR down-regulation therefore modulates cellular responses to growth factors by controlling the duration of signaling from the cell surface and by transporting activated EGFRs to intracellular compartments where they continue to signal (reviewed in Ref. 3Baass P.C. DiGuglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, because EGFR is the only ErbB receptor that undergoes ligand-induced down-regulation (4Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), signal transduction by different members of the ErbB family may be regulated by compartmentalization in the endocytic pathway. The importance of EGFR endocytic transport to normal proliferation is exemplified by the fact that EGFRs that fail to internalize have been associated with cell transformation (5Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (6Matsui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1991; 22: 6170-6175Google Scholar).EGFR down-regulation is a complex process regulated by many factors, including ligand occupancy, receptor aggregation, tyrosine kinase activity, endosomal acidification, and intrinsic sorting signals (2Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is also clear that the multiple transport steps in the endocytic pathway are facilitated by different molecular interactions (7Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M.

Internalization is regulated by endocytic codes located in the EGFR carboxyl-terminal domain that are functionally interchangeable with the internalization signal of the transferrin receptor (11Chang C.P.

Internalization also involves interactions between cytoplasmic sequences in activated EGFRs and plasma membrane clathrin AP-2 adaptor proteins (7Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.

Although a tyrosine-based signal encompassing carboxyl-terminal domain residues 973–977 mediates AP-2 bindingin vitro, the physiological relevance of this interaction is unclear, because EGFRs with an internal deletion of this region undergo normal ligand-induced internalization (16Nesterov A. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8719-8723Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AP-2 also interacts with two EGFR substrates: eps15, which is constitutively associated with AP-2 in vivo (17Benmerah A. Gagnon J. Begue B. Megarbane B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussen N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and SHC, which binds AP-2in vitro (18Okabayashi Y. Sugimoto Y. Totty N.F. Huang J. Kido Y.

Another signaling intermediate required for efficient EGFR internalization is Grb2, which binds to activated EGFRs either directly or as part of a SHC-Grb2 complex (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Grb2 provides a phosphoinositide-dependent link to dynamin (19Barylko B.

Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that EGFR internalization from clathrin-coated pits is facilitated by multiple interactions occurring simultaneously.Following internalization, ligand-receptor complexes are diverted from a recycling pathway to lysosomes (10French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endosome-to-lysosome sorting presumably involves the signal-mediated transfer of ligand-receptor complexes to vesicles called endosomal carrier vesicles or multivesicular bodies (ECV/MVBs), which transport material to late endosomes (reviewed in Ref. 22Gruenberg J. Maxfield M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Although candidate sorting sequences have been identified in the carboxyl half of the cytoplasmic domain, a consensus has not been reached regarding the structural and enzymatic requirements for transporting EGFRs to lysosomes (9Opresko L.K. Chang C.P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One candidate lysosomal sorting molecule, SNX-1, has been identified that binds at the distal border of the tyrosine kinase domain (see Fig. 1and Ref. 25Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).The goal of this study was to further characterize the molecular basis for selective transport of ligand-EGFR complexes to lysosomes. This was accomplished by analyzing a series of EGFR proteins with progressive truncations encompassing the entire cytoplasmic domain to test the hypothesis that cryptic sorting sequences normally masked in unoccupied full-length EGFRs would be exposed in truncated receptors. In contrast to previous studies, we analyzed sequences in the juxtamembrane domain as well as the carboxyl terminus for two reasons. First, the EGFR cytoplasmic domain has numerous consensus leucine-based signals implicated in lysosomal targeting of a number of membrane proteins (26Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 27Verhey K.J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) located throughout the cytoplasmic domain. Second, the juxtamembrane domain contains a sorting signal that regulates EGFR basolateral delivery in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (30Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region may have a broader role in vesicular transport. We have found that a sequence located between amino acid residues 675 and 697 in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region enhances endosome-to-lysosome transport of truncated EGFRs. Residues Leu679 and Leu680, which conform to a leucine-based sorting signal, were shown to be a critical determinant for efficient lysosomal transport of cytoplasmically truncated EGFRs. This same motif was also required for the efficient transport of ligand occupied full-length EGFR complexes to lysosomes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized the molecular basis for selective transport of ligand-EGFR complexes to lysosomes. By examining cytoplasmically truncated EGFRs exhibiting reduced protein stability, we identified two categories of receptor proteins with enhanced degradation phenotypes: those exhibiting enhanced degradation after reaching the cell surface and those undergoing rapid degradation shortly after biosynthesis. In addition, we demonstrated that a dileucine motif in the EGFR juxtamembrane domain is required for efficient lysosomal transport of truncated EGFRs as well as ligand occupied full-length EGFRs.The mutant receptors c′-697 and c′-723, which terminate in the proximal half of the kinase catalytic core domain, both exhibited enhanced endosome-to-lysosome transport after delivery to the cell surface. Because c′-674 receptors did not have a shortened half-life, we hypothesized that EGFR residues 675–697 encompass a cryptic signal that regulates sorting in the endocytic pathway. Examination of the amino acid sequence between residues 675 and 697 revealed a potential leucine-based sorting signal at amino acids, Leu679-Leu680. To test the relative importance of Leu679-Leu680, these residues were changed to alanines in the context of a c′-697 truncation. The L679A,L680A substitution abolished the enhanced degradation phenotype, suggesting that Leu679-Leu680 acts to divert recycling molecules to lysosomes when conformational restraints in the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain are removed by truncation.To test the hypothesis that Leu679-Leu680 is part of a signal that regulates lysosomal sorting of ligand-receptor complexes, the L679A,L680A substitution was also studied in the context of a full-length receptor. Identical to wild-type EGFR, EGFR/L679A,L680A mediated slow uptake of a nonactivating EGFR mAb Fab fragment consistent with constitutive membrane turnover (8Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding induced intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and led to accelerated internalization of mutant and wild-type EGFRs to similar extents. These results indicate that Leu679-Leu680 is not required for internalization of full-length EGFRs, in agreement with findings from other investigators who have shown that the EGFR juxtamembrane domain is not important for ligand-induced receptor uptake (7Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Chang C.P. Lazar C. Walsh B. Komuro M. Collawn J.F. Kuhn L.A. Tainer J.A. Trowbridge I.S. Farquhar M.G. Rosenfeld M.G. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19312-19320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although wild-type and mutant receptors facilitated the rapid accumulation of intracellular ligand, steady-state levels of accumulated ligand were substantially lower in cells expressing the mutant EGFR than in cells expressing wild-type EGFR. The reduced ability of cells expressing mutant receptors to accumulate intracellular ligand was also evident in down-regulation assays monitoring the disappearance of cell surface ligand binding sites. Additionally, mutant EGFRs were not as efficiently transported to lysosomes as wild-type EGFRs, as shown by differences in the biosynthetic half-lives of ligand-occupied EGFRs. EGFR/L679A,L680A receptors did, however, exhibit faster recycling kinetics than wild-type EGFRs. These data suggest that reduced ligand accumulation and down-regulation exhibited by EGFR/L679A,L680A receptors is due to enhanced recycling of internalized receptors from endosomes.A closer examination of the amino acid sequence surrounding Leu679-Leu680 reveals that this region conforms to other known leucine-based signals by several criteria. For example, the targeting activity of leucine-based motifs is often influenced by an acidic residue four or five residues amino-terminal to the leucine pair (49Pond L. Kuhn L.A. Teyton L. Schutze M.P. Tainer J.A. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19989-19997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, leucine-based signals may be regulated by post-translational modification, because they often have nearby phosphorylation sites (45Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The putative signal encompassing Leu679-Leu680 has both an appropriately distanced acidic residue (Glu673) as well as nearby mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation sites (Thr669 and Ser671) (Fig. 6). Although leucine-based signals implicated in lysosomal transport were originally identified in membrane proteins with relatively short (20–30 amino acids) cytoplasmic tails, critical leucine motifs also have been found in juxtamembrane regions of other membrane proteins with more extensive cytoplasmic domains, such as the T-cell receptor CD3 γ subunit (29Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor (50Haft C.R. Klausner R.D. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26286-26294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The altered transport of the EGFR/L679A,L680A is probably due to the fact these molecules do not fully interact with sorting factor(s) required for efficient transport to lysosomes, because lysosomal transport is thought to be signal-mediated (reviewed in Ref. 22Gruenberg J. Maxfield M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Although we do not know whether a signal encompassing Leu679-Leu680 facilitates protein-protein interactions, computer-based modeling suggests that this region can form an amphipathic α-helix. As shown in Fig. 6 B, nonpolar residues Asn676, Ala678, Leu679, Leu680, Ile682, and Leu683 are aligned on one side of a theoretical amphipathic helix and charged residues Arg681, Lys684, and Glu685on the opposite side. The hydrophobic face of this structure could directly specify protein-protein interactions, or alternatively it could confer stability to a signal located on the hydrophilic face by interacting with surrounding molecules. In either case, leucine side-chains are critical because activity of this signal is abolished by substitution with less hydrophobic alanine residues.Because endosome-to-lysosome transport is a multi-step process, it is reasonable to hypothesize that each step is regulated by distinct structural elements. In addition to the signal described in this study, two other intrinsic EGFR lysosomal targeting signals have been reported by other investigators (Fig. 6). One of these signals, located between residues 945 and 957 at the distal border of the kinase catalytic core (9Opresko L.K. Chang C.P. Will B.H. Burke P.M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4325-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), encompasses the binding site for SNX-1 (25Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Another lysosomal sorting signal has been localized to residues 1022–1123 at the carboxyl terminus (23Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that sequestration of EGFRs into internal vesicles of ECV/MVBs requires phosphorylation of the EGFR substrate annexin I (51Futter C.E. Felder S. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Differences in their requirements for kinase activity suggest that some signals act relatively early in the endocytic pathway before kinase activity is extinguished, whereas others act relatively late in the pathway after kinase inactivation and/or ligand dissociation. Although these diverse sequences may be redundant signals that regulate the same transport step, we consider it more likely that multiple lysosomal sorting signals act sequentially at different steps in the endosome-to-lysosome pathway. Although the relation of the Leu679-Leu680 signal to other lysosomal sorting signals is currently unknown, the fact that steps regulated by this signal occur within minutes of adding ligand indicates that it acts relatively early in the endocytic pathway. In addition, an adenovirus E3 protein that down-regulates EGFR by diverting constitutively recycling EGFRs to ECV/MVBs contains an identical motif at its carboxyl terminus (47Hoffman P. Carlin C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If the adenovirus protein mimics a normal trafficking event, the dileucine motif in EGFR probably acts either before or during incorporation into forming ECV/MVBs.Receptor proteins undergoing rapid degradation shortly after biosynthesis had truncations involving the distal half of the kinase domain. The rapid turnover of these receptors was not restricted to a particular cell type, because similar results were obtained when these proteins were expressed in other cell lines including NR6, Chinese hamster ovary, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (data not shown). These receptors exhibited half-lives in the order c′-957 > c′-809 > c′-885 (data not shown). Degradation of c′-885 and c′-809 receptors, and to a lesser extent c′-957 receptors, was mediated by an BFA-insensitive pathway (Fig. 3). One interpretation for these results is that these molecules are disposed of by an ER quality control apparatus that recognizes aberrant proteins (41Lord J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1067-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to c′-885 and c′-809 receptors, a portion of c′-957 receptors appeared to be degraded in a post-ER compartment. If the SNX-1 binding site is constitutively active in the c′-957 receptors, these data suggest that SNX-1 may mediate transport of c′-957 receptors that escape the ER degradative pathway from the trans-Golgi network to lysosomes.In summary, our results indicate that the efficient transport of ligand-receptor complexes to lysosomes depends on an intrinsic signal encompassing Leu679-Leu680 located at EGFR juxtamembrane domain. The Leu679-Leu680 signal exerts its effect by facilitating movement of occupied EGFRs through an early endocytic compartment. Along with other studies that have identified a basolateral sorting signal in this same region (30Hobert M.E. Kil S.J. Medof M.E. Carlin C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32901-32909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we suggest that the EGFR juxtamembrane domain may have a broad role in vesicular transport. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ECV/MVB, endosomal carrier vesicle/multivesicular body; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BFA, brefeldin A; endo H, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; ECV/MVB, endosomal carrier vesicle/multivesicular body; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BFA, brefeldin A; endo H, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin.and related polypeptides elicit biological responses through binding to specific cell surface receptors belonging to the ErbB family of protein-tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). EGF regulates the intracellular trafficking of ligand-EGF receptor (EGFR) complexes, causing accelerated internalization from clathrin-coated pits, retention in endosomes, and ultimately degradation in lysosomes (reviewed in Ref.2Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Ligand-regulated EGFR down-regulation therefore modulates cellular responses to growth factors by controlling the duration of signaling from the cell surface and by transporting activated EGFRs to intracellular compartments where they continue to signal (reviewed in Ref. 3Baass P.C. DiGuglielmo G.M. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, because EGFR is the only ErbB receptor that undergoes ligand-induced down-regulation (4Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), signal transduction by different members of the ErbB family may be regulated by compartmentalization in the endocytic pathway. The importance of EGFR endocytic transport to normal proliferation is exemplified by the fact that EGFRs that fail to internalize have been associated with cell transformation (5Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (6Matsui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1991; 22: 6170-6175Google Scholar). EGFR down-regulation is a complex process regulated by many factors, including ligand occupancy, receptor aggregation, tyrosine kinase activity, endosomal acidification, and intrinsic sorting signals (2Seaman M.N.J. Burd C.G. Emr S.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is also clear that the multiple transport steps in the endocytic pathway are facilitated by different molecular interactions (7Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M.

Internalization is regulated by endocytic codes located in the EGFR carboxyl-terminal domain that are functionally interchangeable with the internalization signal of the transferrin receptor (11Chang C.P.

We named it PRAX-1, for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1. PRAX-1 is a 1857-amino acid protein, the sequence of which was structurally unrelated to any known proteins. The gene encoding PRAX-1 is located in the q22-q23 region of the long arm of the human chromosome 17. The PRAX-1 mRNA is 7.5 kilobase pairs, predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, pituitary gland, and thymus. At the protein level, we found the PRAX-1 as a single 220–250-kDa protein in the brain and in many different human cell lines tested using specific antibody raised against PRAX-1. Parallel analysis of the PRAX-1 mRNA and protein expression performed in mouse and rat gave similar results. Immunocytochemistry analysis carried out to define the distribution of the PRAX-1 protein in the rat brain showed that PRAX-1 was prevalent in the mesolimbic system, specially abundant in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Exhibiting several domains involved in protein-protein interaction (three proline-rich domains, three leucine-zipper motifs, and an Src homology region 3-like domain), the PRAX-1 may be looked upon as a new adaptator protein. We show that both the Src homology region 3-like domain and a proline-rich domain in PRAX-1 are required for the interaction with PBR.

Benzodiazepines are among the most widely prescribed drugs due to their pharmacological actions in relieving anxiety, as anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, or sedative hypnotics. They are first known to elicit their tranquilizing effect in the central nervous system via a specific receptor complex on γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channels restrictedly expressed on neuronal membranes (1Braestrup C. Squires R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3805-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 2Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In addition to these central type benzodiazepine receptors, a second class of binding sites was also identified in peripheral tissues and termed the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). 1The abbreviations used are: PBR, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); CtPBR, C-terminal end of PBR (aa 156–169); (CtPBR)2 double repeat of the C-terminal end of PBR, (CtPBR)3, triple repeat of the C-terminal end of PBR; PRAX-1, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1; PRAX-1(2H), PRAX-1 portion isolated in the two-hybrid screening; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); SH, Src homology region; Ab, antibody; FISH, fluorescence in situhybridization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. PBR pharmacologically differs from its central counterpart in its lack of coupling to γ-aminobutyric acid receptors and in its ligand specificity. In contrast to the central receptor, PBR exhibits nanomolar affinity to the benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 or to the isoquinoline carboxamide derivative PK11195 and low affinity for the benzodiazepine clonazepam. PBR is a 169-amino acid protein with five transmembrane domains associated with the mitochondrial outer membranes (3Sprengel R. Werner P. Seeburg P.H. Mukhin A.G. Santi M.R. Grayson D.R. Guidotti A.

PBR tissue distribution analysis revealed an ubiquitous expression of the protein with a particularly high abundance in steroid-producing tissues such as adrenal, testis, ovary, and glia. PBR is also abundant in lung, liver, kidney, and salivary glands. On the other hand, PBR expression is relatively low in skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and neurons (5Anholt R.R.H. Pedersen P.L. De Souza E.B. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 576-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the immune system, PBR was shown to be expressed among all human peripheral blood leukocyte subsets, mainly in monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, and less abundantly in natural killer cells and B and T lymphocytes (8Canat X. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Cahard D. Shire D. Roque C. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Life Sci. 1992; 52: 107-118Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Carayon P. Portier M. Dussossoy D. Bord A. Petitprêtre G. Canat X. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Blood. 1996; 87: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand PBR functions, the protein has been the object of considerable biochemical and pharmacological investigations. However, the functional assignment of PBR still has to be discovered. To date, the best documented role for PBR has been shown in steroidogenic tissues, where PBR mediates the intramitochondrial cholesterol transport, which is the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. It was found to be implicated in the acute stimulation of steroid biosynthesis, increasing pregnenolone formation (10Papadopoulos V. Mukhin A.G. Costa E. Krueger K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3772-3779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Besman M.J. Yanagibashi K. Lee T.D. Kawamura M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The disruption of the PBR gene in the R2C Leydig tumor cell line, a typical steroidogenic system, resulted in a dramatic decrease in the steroid biosynthesis (12Papadopoulos V. Amri H. Li H. Boujrad N. Vidic B. Garnier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32129-32135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, PBR is also expressed in cells that do not synthesize steroid; thus, the function of PBR could not be restricted to the steroidogenic field. Indeed PBR has also been implicated via specific ligands in a number of other unrelated cellular phenomena. A variety of effects of benzodiazepines on cell growth and differentiation mediated via the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor has been reported, including the following diverse actions: Ro5-4864 enhances melanogenesis in melanoma cells (13Matthew E. Laskin J.D. Zimmerman E.A. Weinstein I.B. Hsu K.C. Engelhardt D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1985; 229: 1265-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Recently, another field of interest emerged considering the link between PBR and mitochondria. Mitochondria are strongly considered as key actors in apoptosis. Indeed, mitochondria were demonstrated to be implicated in the early steps of apoptosis through the alterations in the mitochondrial permeability transition, the release of the apoptosis-inducing factor sequestered in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, and in the regulation of apoptosis via the presence of Bcl-2 in the outer mitochondrial membrane (19Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber C. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 20Hockenbery D. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Considering the pivotal role of mitochondria in apoptosis, PBR looked upon as an actor in apoptosis must be questioned. In accordance with this, we have recently demonstrated that PBR is involved in the protection of hematopoietic cells against apoptosis following H2O2 treatment (9Carayon P. Portier M. Dussossoy D. Bord A. Petitprêtre G. Canat X. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Blood. 1996; 87: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the expression of PBR and the resistance to H2O2toxicity on hematopoietic cell lines were found to be correlated and resistance of cells to H2O2 significantly increased by PBR cDNA transfection. Thus, participating in an antioxidant pathway, PBR may play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis events. Previous phylogenic studies reinforced this novel idea of a PBR implicated in antioxidant pathway and modulation of apoptosis. Significant similarity exists between PBR and the CrtK protein ofRhodobacter capsulatus, a photosynthetic bacterium. The 35% identity between these proteins reveals a strong conservation of sequence between two proteins that diverged 2 billion years ago (21Baker M.E. Fanestil D.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 721-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This homology suggests a conserved or a highly specialized function for PBR. Indeed, the rat PBR was recently demonstrated to complement inRhodobacter sphaeroides a mutant that lacks the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) previously reported as CrtK (22Yeliseev A.A. Krueger K.E. Kaplan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, PBR was found to substitute for TspO by negatively regulating the expression of photosynthesis genes in the presence of oxygen. It is interesting that this study also suggests a pivotal role played by PBR in oxygen-dependent signal transduction. Despite the abundance of the aforementioned PBR-mediated effects and because of their diversity, the question of the physiological role of the PBR yet remains unanswered. The key to a better understanding of the role of the PBR may be the elucidation of the molecular scheme involving PBR. PBR has been described to belong to a complex including two different proteins of 32 and 30 kDa. These proteins have been identified as the voltage-dependent anion channel and the adenine nucleotide carrier, respectively (23McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Trifiletti R.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). With the exception of this complex, no other protein-protein interaction implicating PBR has been established so far. Therefore, we set out to identify proteins that interact with PBR using the yeast two-hybrid system (24Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) in the hope that this might shed a light on the roles of PBR in the cellular metabolism. Searching cDNA libraries by the two-hybrid system made it possible to identify proteins that specifically interact with our bait PBR and to clone the corresponding encoding genes. However, as a nuclear-based system, the two-hybrid system was mainly used to detect interactions between soluble proteins. Indeed if the bait protein exhibits transmembrane domains (as PBR does), competition occurs between nuclear and membrane localizations of the fusion proteins; this may dramatically decrease the sensitivity of the two-hybrid assay. The use of the entire PBR sequence as a bait for the two-hybrid screening was impossible due to the particularly high hydrophobic degree of the protein. To circumvent this problem, we designed a truncated bait protein with only the C-terminal end of the receptor. We recently established that the C-terminal sequence of PBR was the only moiety of the protein to be exposed at the outer side of the mitochondrial membrane and accessible for an eventual partner (25Dussossoy D. Carayon P. Feraut D. Belugou S. Combes T. Canat X. Vidal H. Casellas P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26Parola A.L. Yamamura H.I. Laird II H.E. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid screening resulted in the identification of a novel protein that specifically interacts with PBR. We named this protein PRAX-1, for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1. Here, we report first the identification and then the characterization of PRAX-1. The C-terminal end of PBR (aa 156–169) was used as a bait in the two-hybrid screening. The coding sequence for the last 14 amino acids of PBR was subcloned into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector pGBT9 encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. A double and a triple repeat of the C-terminal motif of PBR spaced with 2 glycine residues was also inserted in pGBT9 to design (CtPBR)2 and (CtPBR)3, respectively. GST-(CtPBR)3 fusion protein was created by the insertion of the CtPBR3 coding sequence into the pGEX4T2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in frame with GST. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by sequencing and tested for in-frame protein expression by Western blotting. All yeast cultures were grown in standard liquid or on solid media, either based on rich YPD medium (1% (w/v) bacto-yeast extract, 2% (w/v) bacto-peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose), or minimal SD medium (0, 67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0,2% (w/v) Dropout solution (lacking amino acids involved in the selection desired), 2% (w/v) glucose). For the yeast two-hybrid screening, transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (27Schiestl R.H. Giest R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17mers) 3 -CYC1-lacZ) was first transformed with pGBT9-bait plasmid constructs. Colonies of these transformants were confirmed as His − andLacZ − to ensure that the bait alone does not contain transcription activity in HF7c. Different Matchmaker human cDNA libraries purchased from CLONTECHwere screened according to the two-hybrid strategy (brain, fetal brain, lung, testis, lymphocytes, leukocytes). Library cDNA from colonies that were His+, LacZ+were isolated and introduced into Escherichia coli MC1061 by electroporation. Purified pACTII plasmids were retransformed alone with pGBT9, with pGBT9-bait, with SNF1 or with lamin gene as control plasmids. The library clones that activate the lacZ reporter gene only in the presence of pGBT9-bait were chosen for sequencing. Both strands sequencing was conducted using the ABI PRISMTMdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit. β-Galactosidase reporter activity was determined by plate or liquid culture assays. Plate assays were performed as described elsewhere (28Transy C. Legrain P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Positive blue colonies appeared in 30 min to 3 h. In liquid culture assays, β-galactosidase activity was determined with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) as substrate according to the procedure of Miller (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Values of β-galactosidase activity reported are the average of triplicate assays of three independent transformants. Cultures of E. coli (BL21) were transformed with pGEX4T2 recombinants. Fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bulk GST Purification Module, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expressed proteins were identified as GST-(CtPBR)3 using the 8D7 antibody specific for PBR. For the association studies, binding of GST-(CtPBR)3 and labeled PRAX-1 was assessed by incubating GST-(CtPBR)3 adsorbed to glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with [35S]methionine-labeled PRAX-1 protein. After washing to remove unbound proteins, bound proteins were eluted from the resin by boiling the samples in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel loading buffer and resolved on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic separation, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. The human frontal cortex λZAP cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with the clone resulted from the two-hybrid screening labeled with 32P using the RTS Rad Prime DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA from positive clones was sequenced and then used for the next screening. To obtain the full-length coding sequence, the same library was rescreened using the subsequently isolated clones as probe. The chromosomal assignment for the human PRAX-1 gene was performed by in situ hybridization and FISH detection according the procedure of Heng et al. (30Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 31Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The gene mapping was carried out on chromosome preparations obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured for 72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were synchronized with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml) treatment. The cDNA probe used was of 3.5 kb and comprised the two-hybrid portion. To determine the interaction domain with PBR in PRAX-1, we used the two-hybrid approach. PRAX-1 deletion mutants were tested for their interaction with PBR qualitatively by a culture test for HIS3 expression and by a colony lift assay for β-galactosidase activity. Several PRAX-1(2H) portion domains were subcloned in pACTII to generate differential constructions to be tested. The NcoI PRAX-1(2H) fragment from pACTII-PRAX-1(2H) included the N-terminal 206 aa of the two-hybrid insert. The XmnI/HpaI andBsrBI/HpaI PRAX-1(2H) fragments were also used to test the C-terminal 205 and 118 aa of the PRAX-1(2H) protein, respectively. A truncated version of the PRAX-1(2H) protein was generated by cloning the Cac8I-XbaI PRAX-1(2H) fragment into pACTII. This truncated construction encodes a PRAX-1 fragment from aa 1578 to 1834. A synthetic construction was also designed to fuse two PRAX-1 domains: from aa 1631 to 1656 and from aa 1770 to 1794, linked with three glycine residues. PRAX-1 library insert was excised from pACTII by BglII/XhoI digestion and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ intoBamHI/XhoI sites. In vitrotranscription-translation of the PRAX-1 containing vector was performed in the transcription/translation T-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before autoradiography or transfer onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotting. The human astrocytoma U373 MG and neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml gentamicin, 60 μg/ml Tylocine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW480 obtained from Interchim Bioproducts was grown in Leibovitz's L15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml gentamicin, 60 μg/ml Tylocine (Life Technologies, Inc.). The human T leukemia cell line Jurkat and the histocytic lymphoma cell line U937 were grown in 90% RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 mg/ml Gentamicin. The normal human astrocytes (NHA) was purchased from BioWhittaker (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts) and was grown in Astrocyte Growth Medium BulletKit (Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts). The murine monocyte-macrophage cell line J774A.1 and six different human keratinocyte cell lines (HACAT, SVK14, WS1, NCTC 2544, A431, VA ES BJ) were grown in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 mg/ml Gentamicin. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser as described in Ref. 9Carayon P. Portier M. Dussossoy D. Bord A. Petitprêtre G. Canat X. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Blood. 1996; 87: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly exponentially growing cells (107) were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was transferred in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and mixed with 40 μg of the expression vector containing the human PBR cDNA (pHβAPR-1 neo-hPBR (9Carayon P. Portier M. Dussossoy D. Bord A. Petitprêtre G. Canat X. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Blood. 1996; 87: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The cuvette was maintained on ice for 10 min before electroporation (250 miocrofarads, 320 V). After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the cell suspension was transferred to a 50-ml tissue culture flask. The following day, live cells were counted and plated at 5 ×104 cells/ml in the enriched medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 in 24-well microplates. The selective medium was changed after 48 h. Cells were screened 4 weeks later for the expression of PBR. Multiple tissue Northern blots containing poly(A)+ RNA from various human, rat, or murine tissues were obtained from CLONTECH. Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in hybridization solution (Church buffer: 1% BSA, 7% SDS, 0.5 mNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA), then hybridized overnight at 65 °C using radiolabeled PRAX-1 probe (4 × 105 cpm/μl) in hybridization solution containing 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed twice with WBA (0.5% BSA, 5% SDS, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA) for 5 min at 65 °C, and once with WBB (1% SDS, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA) for 10 min at 65 °C. Finally, blots were autoradiographed using Kodak x-ray film for 24 h at −70 °C. The 837-bp cDNA PRAX-1 probe was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using two internal primers (INSa, 5′-gctctgtttgactatgaccc-3′; INSb, 5′-tcctcctgaggagctgcttc-3′) and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP with the RTK Radprime labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human RNA Master BlotTM (CLONTECH) was used to analyze relative expression levels of PRAX-1 mRNA in 50 different human tissues and different developmental stages. Hybridization and probe construction were performed as described previously for the MTN blots above. The expression of PRAX-1 protein was analyzed by Western blotting using Human Protein MedleyTM(CLONTECH) or human cancer cell line lysates. Cells for protein analysis were lysed in Laemmli buffer, sonicated, and boiled at 100 °C for 10 min. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12% acrylamide) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Anti-PRAX-1 antibody was produced against aa 1772–1792 of PRAX-1 (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France). Rabbit serum was purified by immunoaffinity on an Affi-Gel column (Bio-Rad) to which the peptides were covalently coupled. Purified antibodies were tested for specific recognition by peptide competition (10 μg/ml) before immunoblotting and used at a 1:750 dilution. For subcellular analysis of the expression of PRAX-1, mitochondria were prepared as described in Ref.32Yaffe M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar. The lymphoma cell line U937 was used for immunofluorescence analysis of the PRAX-1 protein subcellular localization. Cells were fixed overnight with 1% paraformaldehyde, washed once and permeabilized for 10 min in a 0.1% saponin, 1% BSA, PBS solution. To visualize PRAX-1, cells were simultaneously incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the rabbit anti-PRAX-1 Ab and mouse anti-mitochondria M117 monoclonal antibody (Leinco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO). Other specific organite markers were also used; specific markers for the nuclear envelope and the endosomes were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Leinco Technologies, Inc.). After two washes, Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Abs (Southern Biotechnology Inc., Birmingham, AL) and rhodol green-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Abs (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) provided fluorescent second step reagents for rabbit and mouse Abs, respectively. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of the PRAX-1 protein distribution was performed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 410, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a c-Apochromat water immersion lens (×63, NA=1.2). Specificity controls were carried out by preincubation of anti-PRAX-1 Abs with the immunizing peptide at 10 μg/ml. Immunocytochemical localization of the PRAX-1 protein was carried out in a series of sections prepared from brain rats. Briefly, 50-μm brain sections were incubated for 48 h at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-PRAX-1 antibody diluted 1:800 with PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. The following day, the sections were washed with PBS, labeled with the secondary antibody, a peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO, diluted 1:500), and the sections processed for immunocytochemistry analysis. Staining was developed in 0.02% hydrogen peroxide in PBS. The reaction was stopped by distilled water. Sections were mounted on gelatin-covered slides, air-dried, and analyzed using a Leica DMLB microscope. For immunofluorescence analysis, the sections were labeled with the secondary antibody, a CY3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, diluted 1:200). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunostained sections were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 410, Zeiss). An Applied Biosystems model 373A sequencer and the ABI PRISMTM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit were used for sequencing. Sequence analyses were performed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package (GCG; Ref. 33Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The percentage of similarity and pairwise homologies were assessed using the Bestfit software. Data base searches were conducted against GenBankTM and European Molecular Biology Laboratory releases. A two-hybrid screening was conducted to identify proteins that interact with PBR. The PBR protein resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane with the bulk of the protein integrated into the membrane and the C-terminal domain oriented toward the cytosol. The last 14 amino acids of the protein were thus the longest hydrophilic portion of the protein demonstrated as accessible with the monoclonal 8D7 anti-PBR antibody specifically recognizing this portion (25Dussossoy D.

https://openalex.org/W1986254790,"Pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (PPME) is a second generation of photosensitizers used in photodynamic therapy. We demonstrated that PPME photosensitization activated NF-κB transcription factor in colon cancer cells. Unexpectedly, this activation occurred in two separate waves, i.e. a rapid and transient one and a second slower but sustained phase. The former was due to photosensitization by PPME localized in the cytoplasmic membrane which triggered interleukin-1 receptor internalization and the transduction pathways controlled by the interleukin-1 type I receptor. Indeed, TRAF6 dominant negative mutant abolished NF-κB activation by PPME photosensitization, and TRAF2 dominant negative mutant was without any effect, and overexpression of IκB kinases increased gene transcription controlled by NF-κB. Oxidative stress was not likely involved in the activation. On the other hand, the slower and sustained wave could be the product of the release of ceramide through activation of the acidic sphingomyelinase. PPME localization within the lysosomal membrane could explain why ceramide acted as second messenger in NF-κB activation by PPME photosensitization. These data will allow a better understanding of the molecular basis of tumor eradication by photodynamic therapy, in particular the importance of the host cell response in the treatment.

Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 58: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Pass H.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 3Fisher A.M.R. Murphree A.L. Gomer C.L. Lasers Surg. Med. 1996; 17: 2-32Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and is initiated by the selective accumulation of a photosensitizing agent in malignant tissue. The sensitizer is harmless unless and until activated by light of the appropriate wavelength. This results in a photochemical reaction leading to tumor destruction through a combination of direct photodamage to cancer cells as well as tumor stroma, especially the microvasculature of the tumor bed and the surrounding tissues (4Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar). The majority of photodynamic agents is provided exogenously via intravenous injection with subsequent uptake of the drug by tissues. The only drug currently approved for therapy is a porphyrin oligomer (Photofrin) which is highly effective but exhibits several drawbacks such as (i) a tendency to cause prolonged skin photosensitivity; (ii) an activation wavelength lower than that optimal for effective penetration through tissue; and (iii) a poorly defined chemical composition that makes a detailed understanding of its mode of action and pharmacokinetics difficult. To address these issues, new photosensitizers are being developed, and a number of new agents are now in clinical trials. Several groups have recently reported the antitumor efficacy of pheophorbide- and pyropheophorbide-based photodynamic therapy (5Henderson B.W. Bellnier D.A. Greco W.R. Sharma A. Pandey R.K. Vaughan L.A. Weishaupt K.R. Dougherty T.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4000-4007PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bellnier D.A. Henderson B.A. Pandey R.K. Potter W.R. Dougherty T.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B.

Med. 1996; 18: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These compounds are chemically well characterized, absorb light above 600 nm, and produce less long term normal tissue phototoxicity than Photofrin. In the pyropheophorbide-a series, either as methyl esters or as carboxylic acids, photosensitizing efficacy increases with the length of the alkyl ether side chain, but the alkyl ether derivatives, although having similar photophysical properties (singlet oxygen and fluorescence yields), exhibit remarkable differences in photosensitizing efficiency (8Pandey R.K. Sumlin A.B. Constantine S. Aoudia M. Potter W.R. Bellnier D.A. Henderson B.W. Rodgers M.A. Smith K.M. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These results suggest that besides hydrophobicity, steric factors and conformation of the alkyl side chains influence localization in the cells. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that singlet oxygen (1O2) is the major damaging species in PDT (9Weishaupt K.R. Gomer C.J. Dougherty T.J. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 2326-2329PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ito T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1978; 28: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 11Athar M. Muktar H. Bickers D. J. Invest.

Other reactive oxygen species (ROS) may also be involved in the biological effects caused by PDT (13Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in the case of porphyrin derivatives used as photosensitizers (8Pandey R.K. Sumlin A.B. Constantine S. Aoudia M. Potter W.R.

Mannoni P. Chanon M. Julliard M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 64: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Photochemically targeted 1O2 is mainly responsible for cytotoxicity caused by PDT. If target cells are not destroyed, photo-oxidative stress may modulate the activation of nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of stress response genes. The cellular redox state is known to be involved in regulation of gene expression, and ROS may act as chemical messengers modulating gene expression via the activation of transduction pathways (15Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar, 16Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Dröge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Currently, the biological effects resulting from PDT-induced changes in gene expression and signal transduction are largely unknown. As a further step toward understanding modulation of gene expression by PDT, we report here the mechanism of NF-κB activation in colon cancer cells by pyropheophorbide-a methyl ester (PPME), a second generation photosensitizer showing great promise in PDT. Since cytokine release during PDT may have important biological effects for surrounding cells, we decided to focus our attention on transcription factor NF-κB because it is a redox-activated transcription factor involved in the control of genes encoding several important cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α as well as chemokines such as IL-8, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (see Ref. 17Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar for review). NF-κB complexes bind DNA as dimers constituted from a family of proteins designated as the Rel/NF-κB family. In mammals, this family contains proteins p50, p52, p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel (Rel) (18Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4599) Google Scholar, 19Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These five proteins harbor a related, but non-identical 300-amino acid long Rel homology domain that is responsible for dimerization, nuclear translocation, and specific DNA-binding. In addition, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel, but not p50 or p52, contain one or two transactivating domains. p50 and p52 derive from cytoplasmic precursors named p105 and p100, respectively. NF-κB complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm of most resting cells by inhibitory proteins belonging to the IκB family (20Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 21Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson- Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

The members of the IκB family are IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, p100, and p105. Following various stimuli, including the interaction of TNF-α and IL-1β with their receptors, IκBα is first phosphorylated on serines 32 and 36, then ubiquitinated at lysines 21 and 22, and rapidly degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB nuclear translocation and gene activation (24Brown K.

In the case of these two types of cytokines, the signal transduction pathways leading to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins have recently been clarified in HeLa and L293 cells (26Régnier C.H.

Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α or IL-1β or the bacterial outer membrane component (lipopolysaccharide) are potent activators of NF-κB, which mediate several of their biological activities such as stimulation of the transcription in lymphocytes through the intracellular generation of oxidative stress (32Satriano J.A. Shuldiner M. Hora K. Xing Y. Shan Z. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 92: 1564-1571Crossref Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 33Feng L. Xia Y. Garcia G.E. Hwang D. Wilson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, the assumption that a similar mechanism is effective in other cell lines has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, we report that PPME-mediated PDT of colon cancer cells activates NF-κB, by triggering the signaling pathway controlled by the IL-1 receptor likely without involvement of ROS. By increasing IL-1 receptor internalization, PPME photosensitization also leads to the activation of the acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase) with intracellular release of ceramide. Furthermore, our data suggest that, as a consequence of PPME-mediated PDT, surviving colon cancer cells could influence surrounding cells by releasing factors whose encoding genes are controlled by NF-κB. Pyropheophorbide methyl ester (PPME) was from Sigma and was used without any further purification. A stock solution was made in ethanol (1 mm) and kept in the dark at −20 °C. PPME was diluted in the culture medium just before use and added to exponentially growing cells. The fluorescent probes used for cellular localization studies were purchased from Molecular Probes-Europe (Leiden, The Netherlands). Radiolabeled nucleotides were from ICN (United Kingdom), and 125I-labeled IL-1β and TNF-α were from NEN Life Science Products (United Kingdom) or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (United Kingdom). Deuterium oxide was 99.8% pure from Merck (Germany). All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Anti-IκBα monoclonal antibody was obtained from C. Dargemont (Curie Institute, Paris); anti-IκBβ was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-p100 monoclonal and anti-p105 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from U. Siebelnist (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The human colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 was grown in McCoy's 5A medium (Life Technologies, Inc., United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Before photosensitization with PPME, HCT-116 cells were grown for 1 week in 2% FCS. HCT-116 cells overexpressing IκBα mutated either at serines 32 and 36 (S32A, S36A) or at tyrosine 42 (Y42F) were obtained after transfection with the corresponding expression plasmids bearing a gene conferring resistance to neomycin. After a classical selection procedure (500 μg/ml neomycin), cells were cloned and expanded in the presence of neomycin (250 μg/ml). pNF-κB-Luc reporter construct contains 5 κB sites from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 long terminal repeat cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (Stratagene). pTRAF6, pΔ TRAF6-(289–522) (34Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), pΔ TRAF2-(87–501) (35Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and pIKK-α or -β constructs were gifts from D. Goeddel (Tularik). pIκBα S32A,S36A was obtained from A. Israel (Pasteur Institute, France) and pIκBαY42F was obtained from J-F. Peyron (Nice, France). All plasmids were purified using Qiagen column chromatography (Qiagen, The Netherlands), and integrity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Before photosensitization with PPME, HCT-116 cells were cultivated for 1 week in McCoys 5A medium with 2% FCS and incubated with 2 μmPPME during the last 20 h. Prior to irradiation, HCT-116 cells were washed twice with PBS and then irradiated with red light (λ >600 nm) at a fluence rate of 160 watts/m2 in Petri dishes covered with PBS. After irradiation, HCT-116 cells were put back in culture at 37 °C in McCoys 5A medium supplemented with 2% FCS. Cell survival was determined after 24 h using trypan blue exclusion. Photosensitization with PPME was carried out to attain 50% cell survival after 24 h. Co-localization experiments and intracellular fluorescence spectroscopy were carried out with a proprietary microspectrofluorometer constructed around a Leitz “Diavert” inverted microscope equipped with a heated stage which was maintained at 37 ± 1 °C (36Geze M. Morliere P. Maziere J.C. Smith K.M. Santus R. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1993; 20: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Gaullier J.M. Geze M. Santus R. Sa E. Melo T. Maziere J.C. Bazin M. Morliere P. Dubertret L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorescence excitation was performed over the whole microscope field with 405 nm light from a 100-watt super-high pressure mercury lamp (∼1 watt/cm2without neutral filter). A bidimensional adjustable slit in the primary image plane limited the area in the microscopic field from which the fluorescence could be collected through a selected filter. In the topographic mode, fluorescence light was reflected by a mirror to the bidimensional cooled CCD target (1024 × 1024 pixels), which was coupled to signal recording and processing software (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Images of 400 × 400 superpixels (2 × 2 binning) corresponding to a 46 × 46-μm field were recorded, and the exposure time was equal to 4 s. In the spectrotopographic mode, 150 grooves/nm grating replaced the mirror. The slit was reduced to a narrow strip and used as the entrance to the grating, delineating in the object plane a 2-μm-wide strip along the whole field from which fluorescence was collected. This slit provided a spectral resolution of about 5 nm. Fluorescence photons received by the bidimensional detector produced a spectrotopographic image. Such images (335 × 335 superpixels) recorded with a 2 × 2 binning can be interpreted as either a succession, in the x direction, of linear monochromatic images of a 2-μm-wide strip or a succession of spectra along the y axis (46 μm), each corresponding to an area of 2 × 0.15 μm2 of the strip. Exponentially growing HCT 116 cells were grown as monolayers in custom-made glass-bottom chambers designed for use with this microspectrofluorometer. Nuclear extracts were isolated as described by a rapid micropreparation technique derived from the large scale procedure of Dignam et al. (38Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) based on the use of a lysis with detergent (Nonidet P-40) followed by high salt extraction of nuclei (39Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed for 25 min at room temperature with 7.5 μg of total protein in 20 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 2 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, U. K.), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (Eurogentech, Belgium). Oligonucleotides were labeled by end-filling with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase I (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) with [32P]dATP, [32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products or ICN, United Kingdom), and cold dTTP + dGTP. Labeled probes were purified by spin chromatography on G-25 columns. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probe on native 6% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V in 0.25 m Tris, 0.25m sodium borate, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray film at −80 °C for 16–24 h. The amounts of specific complexes were determined either by counting the radioactivity with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or by photodensitometry (LKB, Sweden) of the autoradiography. Supershift experiments were carried out as described (40Franzoso G. Bours V. Park S. Tomita-Yamagushi M. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Nature. 1992; 359: 207-210Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar), using the same EMSA protocol as described above except for the gel concentration being 4%. The sequences of the probes (Eurogentech, Belgium) used in this work are as shown in Sequence 1.

Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at various times after the photosensitization by cell lysis with a detergent (Nonidet P-40), pelleting the nuclei, and collecting the supernatant fraction (41Legrand-Poels S.

Cytoplasmic proteins were added to a loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue), boiled, and electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and electro-transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, United Kingdom). Filters were incubated with anti-IκBα (1:500 dilution), anti-IκBβ (1:500 dilution), anti-p105 (1:1700 dilution), or anti-p100 (1:2000 dilution) antibodies for 60 min at room temperature, then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution) for 60 min at room temperature, and finally analyzed using Amersham's enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom) with Fuji x-ray film. Cytokine receptor internalization was carried out as described (42Solari R. Smithers N. Kennard W. Ray K. Grenfell S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In short, HCT-116 cells were first washed in PBS, trypsinized, and counted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer (McCoy's 5A-10% FCS plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin) and 1 μl of125I-labeled cytokine (20,000 Bq/assay) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with shaking before being placed at 37 °C to initiate internalization. Cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 30 s, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of acidic buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 3.0) and placed on ice for 90 s. Binding buffer (600 μl) was then added to the cells, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 s, and the supernatant recovered and counted. The pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of binding buffer and loaded on 300 μl of 20% (w/v) sucrose, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 × g, the pellet was recovered and counted. Internalization was evaluated by determining the ratio between the radioactivity measured in the cell pellet versus the total radioactivity (outside + inside cells). HCT-116 cells were grown in 6-well plates for 2 days in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected with 0.1 μg of κB-Luc reporter plasmid and various amounts of expression plasmids. The total concentration of plasmid was kept at 1 μg with pRC-CMV. Plasmids were mixed in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., United Kingdom), added to Fugene liposomes (2 μl) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature, and loaded on cells in 2 ml of McCoy's 5A containing 10% FCS for 24 h. Then HCT-116 were treated either with TNF-α or IL-1β for 24 h or with PPME (2 μm) for 6 h and irradiated with red light (120 s). After irradiation, cells were cultivated for 15 h and then washed twice in PBS, lysed for 15 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 4 min. Luciferase activities corrected for protein amounts (Bio-Rad protein assay) were measured in supernatants. For total ceramide quantification, HCT-116 cells were incubated before treatment for 24 h in McCoy's 5A medium with 2% FCS and 2 μCi/ml of 9,10-[3H]palmitic acid (ICN, United Kingdom). After lipid extraction (43Levade T. Tempesta M.-C. Salvayre R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and mild alkaline hydrolysis, the lower phase of the Folch extract containing the labeled sphingolipids was evaporated. Lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), spotted, and separated on an analytical TLC. Ceramide was visualized by I2 staining, and the corresponding spots were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Sphingomyelinase (SMase) assays were performed as described previously (44Wiegmann K. Schü tze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 45Jaffrézou J.P. Levade T. Bettaı̈eb A. Andrieu N. Bezombes C. Maestre N. Vermeersch S. Rousse A. Laurent G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). HCT-116 cells were treated with or without 150 units/ml TNF-α or with 2 μm PPME and light and then incubated for various times. To measure acidic SMase activity, 50 μg of proteins were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.2 mCi/ml [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (ICN, United Kingdom; 20,000 Bq per assay). To measure neutral SMase activity, 100 μg of proteins were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mCi/ml [choline-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom; 20,000 Bq per assay). Released radioactive phosphocholine was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Since it has been previously demonstrated that many hydrophobic derivatives of porphyrin localize at the cell membrane (46Kessel D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether PPME exhibited a similar cellular distribution. Incubation of HCT-116 cells in the presence of 2 μm PPME for 17 h allowed us to detect a strong PPME fluorescence at the cytoplasmic membrane and in several internal compartments (Fig.1 B). To characterize the nature of the intracellular compartments where PPME accumulated, cells were co-incubated with PPME and various fluorescent probes. Using rhodamine 123 as a fluorescent stain of mitochondria (47Kim M. Cooper D.D. Hayes S.F. Spangrude G.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4106-4117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was evident that no PPME accumulated inside the mitochondria, even after long incubation times, e.g. overnight incubation (data not shown). Cells were incubated with 1 μm PPME for 18 h and then with 2 μm neutral red for the last 30 min prior to irradiation. Under this condition, in the absence of a prolonged wash, neutral red was expected to stain mainly the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex (48Sousa C. Sa E. Melo T. Geze M. Gaullier J.M. Maziere J.C. Santus R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A demonstrates that, whereas the red fluorescence of PPME could be easily observed, practically no fluorescence was recorded using a green filter that allowed detection of neutral red emission (48Sousa C. Sa E. Melo T. Geze M. Gaullier J.M. Maziere J.C. Santus R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This was further illustrated in Fig.2 B with spectrotopographic images. At the onset of irradiation, red fluorescence of PPME at 677 nm was observed without any strong contribution in the 500–550 nm range. Twenty seconds after the beginning of the irradiation, virtually all the PPME fluorescence was bleached, but a significant increase in the green fluorescence with a maximum toward 570 nm was observed. Such a maximum was in agreement with neutral red localization in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex (48Sousa C. Sa E. Melo T. Geze M. Gaullier J.M. Maziere J.C. Santus R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that neutral red as well as some PPME co-localized in this environment, leading to the quenching of neutral fluorescence probably by singlet-singlet energy transfer from neutral red to PPME. Irreversible PPME photobleaching inhibited the energy transfer process and restored neutral red fluorescence. Cells were also incubated with 0.25 μm PPME and 1 μm lucifer yellow for 18 h. Under these conditions and as expected, the lysosomotropic dye lucifer yellow accumulated into lysosomes as shown in Fig. 2 C. This figure also demonstrated that, in addition to weak uniform fluorescence, spots that perfectly match those obt"
https://openalex.org/W2051933316,"We previously identified a Fas ligand regulatory element (FLRE) in the Fas ligand (fasL) promoter that binds Egr family proteins and demonstrated that Egr-3 (PILOT) but not Egr-1 (NGFI-A, Krox-24, Tis-8, and Zif-268) induces transcription offasL. The aberrant CD4−CD8− T cells from lpr/lpr and gld/gld mice, which have mutations in the genes encoding Fas and FasL, respectively, have an activated phenotype and constitutively express high levels offasL mRNA, prompting us to ask what role if any the FLRE and Egr family proteins have in this aberrant expression offasL. Unstimulated MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld CD4−CD8− T cells constitutively contained high levels of two proteins that bound to the FLRE. Supershift analysis revealed these proteins to be Egr-1 and Egr-2 (Krox-20); Egr-3 was not detected. Activation of normal lymph node cells resulted in increased expression of Egr-1, -2, and -3. As withegr-3, expression of egr-2 was blocked by cyclosporin A. Although overexpressed Egr-1 was ineffective, overexpressed Egr-2 was as potent as Egr-3 in inducing fasLpromoter-dependent reporter constructs in T cell hybridomas and HeLa cells, and both up-regulated endogenous fasLmRNA in HeLa cells. FasL-dependent reporter constructs in MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gldCD4−CD8− T cells were constitutively active, and this activity was largely prevented by mutation of the critical Egr family binding element. Thus, Egr-2, in addition to Egr-3, regulates FasL expression in activated normal T cells, and Egr-2 is likely to play a direct role in aberrant fasL up-regulation inlpr/lpr and gld/gldCD4−CD8− T cells.

Although activated T cells are initially resistant to death signals mediated by Fas, prolonged activation increases their sensitivity, presumably owing to down-regulation of such cellular inhibitors of the Fas/FADD/caspase 8 cascade as c-FLIPs (2Irmler M.

As a result, these mice lack a functional Fas death pathway, preventing deletion of activated T cells and leading to the accumulation of large numbers of abnormal CD4−CD8−, B220+, TCR+lymph node cells (referred to as double-negative (DN) T cells). Humans with defects in Fas-mediated killing have an lpr-like syndrome, with accumulation of DN (TCR+CD4−CD8−) T lymphocytes and autoimmune phenomena (9Rieux-Laucat F. Le Deist F. Hivroz C.

Med. 1996; 335: 1643-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). MRL-lpr/lpr(lpr) and C3H-gld/gld (gld) cells have many features characteristic of activated T cells, and their presence is associated with the development of autoimmunity. As a presumed consequence of being chronically activated, lpr and gld lymph node cells constitutively express high levels of fasL mRNA (12Watanabe D. Suda T. Hashimoto H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,13Chu J.L. Ramos P. Rosendorff A. Nikolic-Zugic J. Lacy E. Matsuzawa A. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Control of fasL transcription in different settings has been attributed to several transcription factors. For example,fasL can be induced by DNA-damaging agents such as UV irradiation or topoisomerase inhibitors (14Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 1: 543-551Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In this case, mutant reporter constructs have indicated that control of fasLtranscription can be attributed directly to NF-κB- and AP-1-binding sites located more than 1 kilobase upstream of the coding region. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of the NF-κB inhibitor I-κB blocked the induction of thefasL-dependent reporter by these treatments. Some correlative evidence has suggested that NF-κB also has a role in TCR-induced fasL expression. For example, NF-κB activity, which is increased by proteasome-mediated degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor I-κB (15Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar), and fasL expression are both blocked by proteasome inhibitors (16Matsui K. Omura S. Cui H. Schauer S.L. Sonenshein G.E. Ju S.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, induction of both NF-κB transcriptional activity and fasL transcription by TCR signals is sensitive to antioxidants, and pro-oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide can induce both (17Williams M.S. Henkart P.A. J Immunol. 1996; 157: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol.

Both activation- and peroxide-induced apoptosis were inhibited by overexpression of dominant negative I-κB (18Bauer M.K.A. Vogt M. Los M. Siegel J. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8048-8055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the NF-κB site that apparently takes part in stress-induced fasL up-regulation lies outside of the region that confers TCR inducibility of fasLtranscription, and a potential NF-κB site that does lie in this region (19Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Inazawa J. Abe T. Suda T. Nagata S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) is dispensable for TCR-mediated fasLup-regulation (20Mittelstadt P.R.

There are a number of lines of evidence to suggest that NF-AT plays a critical role in fasL up-regulation. First, fasLinduction by TCR-mediated stimulation is sensitive to cyclosporin A (CsA) (23Rouvier E. Luciani M.-F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 24Brunner T. Yoo N.J. LaFace D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, anti-TCR-induced up-regulation offasL in vivo is impaired in NF-ATp knockout mice (25Hodge M.R. Ranger A.M. Charles de la Brousse F. Hoey T. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H.

The distal site, located at −275 relative to the coding region, was found to contribute to fasL reporter activity in Jurkat cells (22Latinis K.M. Norian L.A. Eliason S.L. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, we found that mutation or deletion of the NF-AT site at −275 did not have a substantial effect onfasL up-regulation and described a fasLregulatory element (FLRE) located from −214 to −207 in thefasL promoter (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The FLRE conferred the majority of TCR-inducible fasL promoter activity in a murine T cell hybridoma and in human T cell blasts and proved to be a binding site for Egr-1 and Egr-3, members of the Egr (earlygrowth response) family of transcription factors. Overexpression of Egr-3 but not Egr-1 was sufficient to induce an FLRE-dependent reporter construct as well as an increase in cellular fasL mRNA. TCR-mediated induction of Egr-3 but not Egr-1 was sensitive to inhibition by CsA, suggesting that Egr-3 may be a transcriptional target of NF-AT. These data indicated that Egr-3 rather than the more abundant Egr-1 is likely to be a direct mediator of fasL transcription in activated T cells. Transcription of Egr family genes is up-regulated after TCR activation (27Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Mages H.W. Stamminger T. Rilke O. Bravo R. Kroczek R.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These Zn2+ finger-containing proteins have similar DNA-binding domains and similar DNA sequence preference (29Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2275-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Other domains of the proteins differ, and the expression of Egr family genes can be differentially regulated, suggesting that individual members fulfill nonredundant biological roles (30Topilko P. Levi G. Merlo G. Mantero S. Desmarquet C. Mancardi G. Charnay P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 50: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report we examine MRL-lpr/lpr and C3H-gld/gld DN T cells for the presence of FLRE-binding proteins that might contribute to the constitutive activation of the fasL promoter. The results indicate that Egr-2, like Egr-3, can directly mediate TCR-induced transcription of fasL, and it is this member of the Egr family that appears to be responsible for the aberrant up-regulation of this gene in lpr and gld mice. 2B4.11 is a murine T cell hybridoma specific for peptide 81–104 of pigeon cytochromec presented by I-Ek (31Hedrick S.M.

HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids) with the foregoing supplements. C3H (10 weeks of age), and C3H-gld/gld MRL-lpr/lpr mice (4–5 months of age) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). In some experiments, interbred (C57BL/6 × DBA2)F1 mice maintained in our animal facility were used. CsA was obtained from Sandoz. Protein A-purified antisera against Egr-1, Egr-3, WT-1, and an unknown protein (anti-Egr-2) were obtained from Santa Cruz Technologies (Santa Cruz, CA). An antiserum against Egr-2 was obtained from Berkeley Antibody (Berkeley, CA). The 16-mer plasmid, with a 16-bp FLRE-containing element (from −220 to −205, relative to the initiating codon) appended to a fasL minimal promoter (from −137 to −1), the “m16-mer” plasmid, in which a 4-bp substitution in the FLRE (−214 to −211: GTGG → CACC) was made, the 305-mer, the 225-mer, and the 212-mer plasmids, all driving the luciferase reporter gene of the vector pGL3 (Promega), were described (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids encoding NGFI-A (Egr-1), Egr-2, and Egr-3 were described (32Russo M.W. Matheny C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In cotransfection experiments, a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) was used to electroporate 2B4.11 cells (2 × 106) in 0.2 ml of complete medium in 4-mm cuvettes, with 7.5 μg of expression plasmid and 2.5 μg of reporter plasmid, by using 960 microfarads at 220 V. The plasmid pCB6 (33Boshart M. Weber F. Jahn G. Dorsch-Hasler K. Fleckenstein B. Schaffner W. Cell. 1985; 41: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) was used as a control for the expression plasmids. Each transfection was cultured in 1-ml volumes in complete medium and, the luciferase activity in 20% of each was measured. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the fold inductions (Egr-expressing plasmid relative to empty plasmid) of duplicate samples. MRL-lpr/lprlymph node cells (4 × 107) were electroporated with 10 μg of fasL-dependent luciferase-encoding reporter plasmid by using 960 microfarads at 250 V. Each transfection was cultured in 4 ml of complete medium, and the luciferase activity in 20% of it was measured. Error bars represent the standard deviation of duplicate transfections. HeLa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 9. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). In reporter assays, triplicate 200-μl cultures were transfected with 150 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid and 150 ng of expression plasmid, and the amount of luciferase activity in 40% of each culture was measured. In RT-PCR assays, 4-ml cultures were transfected with 7.5 μg of expression plasmid, and 20% of the resulting RNA was used for synthesis of cDNA. Whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and subjecting them to three rounds of freezing on dry ice followed by rapid thawing in a 37 °C water bath. Extracts were obtained from the supernatants after 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. Binding reactions were carried out at 22 °C for 30 min by combining 3-μl extracts with 12 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 0.02 pmol of 32P end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. In antibody supershift assays, 1–2 μl (1–2 μg) of total antiserum or phosphate-buffered saline was added to the binding reaction. Complexes and unbound probe were separated on 4.5% polyacrylamide gels with the use of 0.5 × TBE running buffer. Total RNA (1 μg) isolated using the Trizol denaturant (Life Technologies, Inc.) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and buffered with MOPS (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After transfer to a HyBond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), RNA was covalently bound by UV cross-linking. Hybridization with32P-labeled cDNA probes was carried out at 65 °C in 0.5 m sodium, 7% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA and buffered to pH 7.2 with phosphate (35Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding the extracellular part of mouse FasL and the Pst-1 fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (36Yang Y. Mercep M. Ware C.F. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) were used as probes. Final washes were performed at 60 °C in 80 mmsodium, phosphate-buffered as before, with 1% SDS and 1 mmEDTA. After exposure to detect fasL, the membrane was stripped by boiling in 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS and probed forgapdh. cDNA was synthesized with the use of random hexamers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The PCR primers, which were designed to amplify cDNA and not genomic DNA, were: human fasL, ATGTTTCAGCTCTTCCACCTACAGA (forward) and CCAGAGAGAGCTCAGATACGTTGACA (reverse), and human gapdh, AGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTT (forward) and CAGCAGAGGGGGCAGAGATG (reverse). 1 μl of cDNA was amplified in a 25-μl PCR reaction with the use of “Ready To Go” PCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with MgCl2 supplemented to 2 mm. Products derived from 40 amplification cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C were separated by electrophoresis through a 2% agarose gel and transferred to a HyBond-N membrane. The membrane was probed with the 32P-labeled human fasL cDNA. To control for the integrity and uniformity of the sample preparations, gapdh was amplified with 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and the products were transferred and probed as before. Mice of the C3H-gld/gld (gld) and MRL-lpr/lpr (lpr) background acquire massive numbers of CD4−CD8− T cells that bear characteristics indicative of chronic activation and express constitutively elevated levels of fasL mRNA (12Watanabe D. Suda T. Hashimoto H. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Chu J.L. Ramos P. Rosendorff A. Nikolic-Zugic J. Lacy E. Matsuzawa A. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because we have recently found that the fasL promoter is under the direct control of the activation-inducible and CsA-sensitive transcription factor Egr-3 (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we asked whether T cells from lpr and gld mice contain elevated levels of FLRE-binding proteins. Extracts derived from freshly isolated lymph nodes from 3–5-month-old lpr and gld mice, which consist almost entirely of DN T cells (Ref. 37Giese T. Davidson W.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3097-3106PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), were examined by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (gel shift). Incubating extracts from either mouse with the labeled FLRE revealed a major retarded species (Fig. 1, bands I and II). The center of migration of this band was slightly faster than that of a band previously identified as Egr-1 in activated 2B4.11 T hybridoma cells (Fig. 1, stimulated 2B4.11 cells) and corresponded to the migration of Egr-1 and Egr-2 generated by transient expression in HeLa cells (data not shown). Addition of a nonspecific antiserum or an antiserum specific for the distantly related Egr family member WT-1, the product of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene locus, did not affect the gel shift patterns. In contrast, antisera specific for Egr-1 caused a reduction in the intensity of the major shifted band I, and the remaining material (band II) migrated slightly more rapidly than the mean of bands I and II. The anti-Egr-1 antibodies also caused the appearance of supershifted antibody-antigen-DNA complexes of slower mobility. Antibodies against Egr-2 also reduced the intensity of the principal band; in this case the remaining material (band I) migrated more slowly than the combined bands I and II. Anti-Egr-2 caused the appearance of a supershifted complex of mobility different from that of the Egr-1 supershifted complex. Simultaneous addition of both Egr-1 and Egr-2-specific antisera caused the complete disappearance of the major retarded species. Only a very small amount of material migrated more rapidly than band II, and, unlike activated 2B4.11 cells (Fig. 1 and Ref. 20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), antisera against Egr-3 had little effect on this band III in lpr and gld cell extracts. Finally, as with 2B4.11 cells, band IV is constitutively present and is not eliminated by the unlabeled FLRE oligonucleotide (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, unstimulated DN T cells from both lpr and gld mice have little if any Egr-3 but, unlike normal unactivated T cells (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), constitutively express Egr-1 and Egr-2, as evidenced by binding to the FLRE. The expression of the different Egr family transcription factors in DN T cells was further analyzed by Northern blot analysis. RNA from freshly isolated lpr and gld DN T cells had elevated levels ofegr-1 and egr-2 when compared with unactivated normal C3H T cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, the level of egr-3 in DN T cells was, although slightly higher than that in unstimulated normal T cells, substantially lower than that in activated normal T cells. These data demonstrate that lpr and gld lymph node DN T cells have an activated phenotype with regard to Egr family protein expression, with constitutively high levels of Egr-1 and Egr-2 and relatively little Egr-3. The expression of Egr-2 in a T hybridoma cell line and normal T cells was examined. Egr-2, whose migration is only slightly faster than Egr-1, was not previously recognized by gel shift analysis in extracts of activated 2B4.11 T hybridoma cells, and no supershifted material was detected with a commercially available putative anti-Egr-2 polyclonal antiserum (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reexamination of cell extracts from activated 2B4.11 cells revealed, however, that supershifting with anti-Egr-1 and anti-Egr-3 antibodies left a faint band that migrated slightly faster than the bulk of the Egr-1 material and co-migrated with recombinant Egr-2 (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Furthermore, addition of a different anti-Egr-2 antiserum, which we have found supershifts recombinant Egr-2 (data not shown) removed this band entirely (Fig. 1), indicating that the FLRE binding activity in activated 2B4.11 cells consists of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3. To determine what FLRE-binding proteins are induced in normal T cells, C3H lymph node cells were studied. Small amounts of shifted material in the region corresponding to bands I, II, and III could be seen in untreated lymph node cells (Fig. 3). All of these bands, in particular the slower species corresponding to bands I and II, were increased in cells stimulated for 3 h with PMA and ionomycin. Antisera against Egr-1 removed most, but not all, of the more slowly migrating species and caused the appearance of supershifted material, and antisera against Egr-2 removed a part of the more slowly migrating species and caused the appearance of a correspondingly smaller amount of supershifted material. The combination of the two antisera completely removed bands I and II. As with 2B4.11 cells, an antiserum against Egr-3 specifically removed band III. Consistent with the gel shift data, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that mRNA for all three Egr family members was induced by activation (Fig. 2). Therefore, in normal lymph node T cells, activation induces the appearance of Egr-1, -2, and -3. TCR-mediated induction of FasL expression is inhibited by CsA, which blocks activation of the NF-AT transcription factor as a consequence of inhibiting the phosphatase calcineurin (38Liu J. Farmer J.D.J. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar, 39Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation-induced activity of the FLRE reporter and induction of Egr-3, but not Egr-1, are sensitive to CsA (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The issue of whether induced Egr-2 expression is sensitive to inhibition by CsA is controversial. In one study with peripheral blood cells (28Mages H.W. Stamminger T. Rilke O. Bravo R. Kroczek R.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), CsA was found to have a relatively small effect on egr-2 induction, whereas in another study on a thymocyte cell line, CsA was found to inhibit activation-induced egr-2 (40Shao H. Kono D.H. Chen L.Y. Rubin E.M. Kaye J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 731-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine whether Egr-2 induction in normal murine T cells is CsA-sensitive, normal lymph node cells were activated by PMA plus ionomycin in the presence or absence of CsA (Fig. 4). Egr-2 mRNA levels were substantially increased by activation, a response that was inhibited by CsA. Thus, in normal T cells Egr-2, like Egr-3 (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is a CsA-sensitive T cell activation-inducible transcription factor. Egr family transcription factors contain no known dimerization domains, and their genetic target sites are asymmetrical. Therefore, they are thought to bind to DNA and activate transcription as monomers. In addition, their transcriptional activity is not thought to depend on post-translational modification (41Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Accordingly, transient overexpression of Egr-3 was previously found to be sufficient for induction of a fasL promoter reporter plasmid in the absence of any TCR-mediated activation (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Egr-2 was likewise tested for its ability to independently induce fasL-specific transcription. 2B4.11 cells were transfected with a reporter construct encoding the luciferase gene driven by a minimal fasLpromoter to which was appended the region from −220 to −205, which contains the FLRE. Enforced expression of Egr-1 had little effect on the activity of the intact reporter (Fig.5 A). As previously shown (20Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the Egr-3 expression plasmid induced significantly higher activity. Overexpression of Egr-2 resulted in a response that was similar to that induced by Egr-3. Cotransf"
https://openalex.org/W2006624692,"Ligation of either CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2), two principal ligands for CD28, is thought to skew the immune response toward Th1 or Th2 differentiation. We have examined early signal transduction pathways recruited following T cell stimulation with either CD80 or CD86. Purified human peripheral T cells or Jurkat T cells were stimulated with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing either human CD80 (CHO-CD80) or human CD86 (CHO-CD86) or with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb). In the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, both CHO-CD80 and CHO-CD86, like anti-CD28 mAb, were capable of stimulating cytokine production from both human peripheral T cells and Jurkat T cells. Both CHO-CD80 and CHO-CD86, in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb, costimulated NFAT-dependent transcriptional activation. Several intracellular signaling proteins, such as CBL and VAV, were phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to CD80, CD86, and anti-CD28 mAb. Surprisingly, although stimulation of Jurkat T cells with either CHO-CD80 or anti-CD28 mAb resulted in robust tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 itself, ligation with CHO-CD86 was unable to induce detectable CD28 tyrosyl phosphorylation over a range of stimulation conditions. In addition, the association of phosphoinositide 3-kinase with CD28 and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ were seen after anti-CD28 mAb and CHO-CD80 stimulation but to a much lesser extent after CHO-CD86 stimulation. Thus, ligation of CD28 with either CD80 or CD86 leads to shared early signal transduction events such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL and VAV, to NFAT-mediated transcriptional activation, and to the costimulation of interleukin-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production. However, CD80 and CD86 also induce distinct signal transduction pathways including the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 and phospholipase Cγ1 and the SH2-dependent association of phosphoinositide 3-kinase with CD28. These quantitative, if not qualitative, differences between signaling initiated by these two ligands for CD28 may contribute to functional differences (e.g. Th1 or Th2 differentiation) in T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2003381179,"We have identified type VI collagen (Col VI) as a primary subendothelial extracellular matrix component responsible for von Willebrand factor (vWF)-dependent platelet adhesion and aggregation under high tensile strength. Intact tetrameric Col VI was the form of the collagen found to be capable of promoting vWF-mediated platelet adhesion/aggregation under this shear condition, whereas removal of the predominant portion of the terminal globules by pepsin treatment abrogated its activity. The inability of the pepsin-digested Col VI to support any platelet interaction at high flow was because of the failure of the A3(vWF) domain to bind to this form of collagen, suggesting a stringent requirement of a tridimensional conformation or of intactness of its macromolecular structure. In contrast, the A1(vWF) domain bound to both intact and pepsin-digested Col VI tetramers but, in accordance with the cooperating function of the two vWF domains, failed to support platelet adhesion/aggregation under high shear onto Col VI by itself. The putative A1(vWF) binding site resided within the A7(VI) module (residues 413-613) of the globular amino-terminal portion of the alpha3(VI) chain. Soluble recombinant A7(VI) polypeptide strongly perturbed the vWF-mediated platelet adhesion to Col VI under high shear rates, without affecting the binding of the vWF platelet receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha to its cognate ligand A1(vWF). The findings provide evidence for a concerted action of the A1(vWF) and A3(vWF) domains in inducing platelet arrest on Col VI. This is accomplished via an interaction of the A1(vWF) domain with a site contained in the alpha3 chain A7(VI) domain and via a conformation-dependent interaction of the A3(vWF) domain with the intact tetrameric collagen. The data further emphasize that Col VI microfilaments linking the subendothelial basement membrane to the interstitial collagenous network may play a pivotal role in the hemostatic process triggered upon damage of the blood vessel wall."

Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10282-10288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that the two rodent mdr1 genes are differentially regulated. For example, pgp1/mdr1a and pgp2/mdr1b show divergent tissue regulation with some organs, such as murine intestine and brain, expressing exclusively mdr1a while adrenal and placenta express predominantly mdr1b (5Croop J.M.

Smit J.J. Borst P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31A: 1295-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, the rat pgp2/mdr1b and pgp1/mdr1a are divergently regulated during hepatocarcinogenesis in rats (7Teeter L.D. Becker F.F. Chisari F.V. Li D.J. Kuo M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5728-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In order to extrapolate rodent studies to humans it is critical to determine the molecular controls regulating the rat and human MDR1genes. Previous studies have suggested that human and rodent MDR1genes are also distinctly regulated. For instance, in many cell lineages from rodents (liver, kidney, intestine, etc.) short exposures to chemotherapeutic agents lead to dramatic increases inmdr1 expression, an effect that appears secondary to specific increases in mdr1 transcription (8Chin K.-V. Chauhan S.S. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 361-365PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, transient exposure to these chemotherapeutic agents had no effect on the expression of MDR1 in human cells (8Chin K.-V. Chauhan S.S. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 361-365PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies, using primary cultured hepatocytes also showed a divergence in rodent and human MDR1 expression after exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (9Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Thompson M.T. Fisher R.A. Madariage J.R. Strom S.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 12: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Teeter L.D. Petersen D.D. Nebert D.W. Tien Kuo M.

These studies suggest that fundamental differences in MDR1 regulation exist between rodent and humans. Recent studies suggest that events linked to transcription are important in controlling MDR1 expression. For instance, Scotto and co-workers (12ince T.A. Scotto K.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2021-2024PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that a conserved cis-element and binding proteins may be important in hamster Pgp1transcriptional initiation in Pgp expressing cells. A different conserved sequence in the mouse mdr1b gene and humanMDR1 gene, functionally important for both promoters (13Cohen D. Piekarz R.L. Hsu S.I.-H. DePinho R.A. Carrasco N. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2239-2244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yu L. Cohen D. Piekarz R.L. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29715-29719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to be activated in the MDR1 promoter by a member of the C/EBP family (15Combates N.J. Rzepka R.W. Chen Y.-N. Cohen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29715-29719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human and rodent MDR1promoters also contained a common stretch of GC-rich nucleotides. The conservation of this GC region across species suggests that it is important for regulation of the MDR1 genes. In the humanMDR1 promoter, Sp1 binds to a portion of the GC element and activates the MDR1 promoter (16Cornwell M.M. Smith D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19505-19511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This MDR1 GC element also binds the transcription factor Egr-1 (17McCoy C. Smith D.E. Cornwell M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6100-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Egr-1 mediates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate activation of the MDR1 promoter in K562 hematopoietic cells. More recent studies have suggested that the human MDR1 promoter has multiple Sp1 sites that may not be functionally equivalent (18Sundseth R. MacDonald G. Ting J. King A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the importance in general of Sp1 and Egr1 to regulation of the endogenous rat mdr1b gene and to its expression in tissues that highly express this gene, such as liver, have not been examined. These studies were undertaken to evaluate the functional importance of Sp1 and Egr-1 to the regulation and expression of the ratmdr1b gene in the rat H35 hepatoma cell line. In this report we identify a Sp1/Egr-1 binding site in the promoter ofpgp2/mdr1b that is similar to the Sp1/Egr-1 site in humanMDR1 (16Cornwell M.M. Smith D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19505-19511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using transfection and DNA binding assays of thepgp2/mdr1b promoter and ectopic overexpression of the Egr-1 and Sp1 transcription factors these studies revealed regulation ofpgp2/mdr1b expression by Egr-1 and Sp1 that is unique from what has been reported for regulation of human MDR1. Restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD), Promega (Madison, WI), and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). [α-32P]Deoxcytosine triphosphate and [γ-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Wilmington, DE). PCR reagents were from Perkin-Elmer (Norwalk, CT). Cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were from Biowhittaker (Piscataway, NJ). G418 sulfate (geneticin) was from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). Prime-It II kits were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Affinity-purified Sp1 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies to Egr-1 and Sp1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech, and the mdr1 (Ab-1) and actin antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). -250WT was generated by PCR amplification using the sense oligonucleotide (−250 to −228) 5′-gaagatctATGCAACCGTGCACTATCCAGGT-3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide (+137 to +150) 5′-gaagatctCTCACGTAACACCTCCGGGTTTACCAT-3′ using the promoter region of rat pgp2/mdr1b gene and represents nucleotides −250 to +150 of the rat pgp2/mdr1bgene. The PCR amplified product was digested with BglII and subcloned into pGL2 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. The Sp1 mutation was introduced into the −36 to −60 region of thePgp2/mdr1b promoter by the overlap-extension method used previously (19Furuya K.N. Thottassery J.V. Schuetz E.G. Sharif M. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11518-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to generate −250MT. Briefly, two independent PCR products spanning nucleotides −250 to −36 and −60 to +150 were made that overlap at the mutated region. The 5′-half was made using the sense oligonucleotide −250 to −228 (above) and the antisense oligonucleotide (−60 to −36) 5′-CCGGCGGCCGAACTGTTGCCTAGC-3′ with the underlined base substitutions. The 3′-half was made using the sense oligonucleotide (−60 to −36) 5′-GCTAGGCAACAGTTCGGCCGCCGG-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide (+137 to +150) (above). The two PCR products were combined, denatured, and re-annealed at their common overlapping 24-bp sequence. Extension of this overlap followed by PCR amplification using the two outer primers gave a recombined molecule with four specific base changes in the GC region. This fragment was digested withBglII, ligated into pGL2Basic, and the mutations confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The −250 Sp1mt/Egrmtexpression plasmid was developed by digestion of the −250MT plasmid with NgoMI followed by treatment with mung bean nucelase, gel purification, and re-ligation. The mammalian Sp1 expression vector was constructed by subcloning a 4.4-kilobase XbaI fragment encoding the full-length Sp1 cDNA from pBS-Sp1-fl (a gift of Dr. R. Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, CA) into the XbaI site of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and orientation confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. TheDrosophila Sp1 expression construct (pPACSp1) and COOH-terminal deletion (pPACSp1N539) (from R. Tjian) were subcloned downstream of the Drosophila actin promoter in pPAC0 (20Courey A.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The wild-type (wtEgr-1) and mutant (mtEgr-1) expression vectors have been described elsewhere (21Cao X. Koski R.A.

The Egr-1-GST fusion was constructed by subcloning Egr-1, from wtEgr-1 into the EcoRI site in pGEX-5X-1 (Pharmacia, Milwaukee, WI). Reuber H35 hepatoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained as described previously (19Furuya K.N. Thottassery J.V. Schuetz E.G. Sharif M. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11518-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with 10 μg of QIAGEN (Qiagen Corp., Chatsworth, CA) purified plasmid DNA for 16–18 h. Cultures were then washed with serum-free medium, refed with fresh medium, harvested after 24 h, and assayed for luciferase.Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Insect Medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin plus streptomycin. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate for 16–18 h then refed with medium, and harvested 24 h later and assayed for luciferase. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 15 min at room temperature with agitation in 400 μl of Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega) and scraped from the culture dishes. Luciferase activity was assayed on 20–40 μl of lysate using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer instructions and utilizing a Opticomp Luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden CT) with a 10-s counting window, and normalized to protein. H35 cells were transfected with Sp1-pcDNA3, Egr-1-pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 by the calcium phosphate for 16 h, washed, refed, and after the 24-h expression period, the cells were expanded and selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. Individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated after 3–4 weeks drug selection. To obtain growth curves of the pcDNA3, Sp1, and Egr-1 clones, cells were plated in duplicate on 60-mm dishes and allowed to attach. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and counted in a hemocytometer on consecutive days. Population doubling times were calculated as described previously (23McMaster M.L. Gessler M. Stanbridge E.J. Weissman B.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1609-1617PubMed Google Scholar, 24Matherly L.H. Schuetz J.D. Westin E. Goldman I.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from H35 cells plated on 100-mm tissue culture dish (19Furuya K.N. Thottassery J.V. Schuetz E.G. Sharif M. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11518-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and analyzed by slot bot or Northern blot with a cDNA encoding Sp1 (20Courey A.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) or a pgp2/mdr1b oligonucleotide (25Schuetz J.D. Silverman J.A. Thottassery J.V. Furuya K.N. Schuetz E.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1321-1332PubMed Google Scholar). Prehybridization, hybridization with random primer-labeled probes, and washing conditions were as described previously (25Schuetz J.D. Silverman J.A. Thottassery J.V. Furuya K.N. Schuetz E.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1321-1332PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to PhosphorImager screens and band intensities were quantitated by the Image Quant software or densitometry as described previously (25Schuetz J.D. Silverman J.A. Thottassery J.V. Furuya K.N. Schuetz E.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1321-1332PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of Pgp, cell lysates (35 μg) were analyzed by immunoblot with an anti-Mdr polyclonal antibody (Ab-1) and developed as described previously (19Furuya K.N. Thottassery J.V. Schuetz E.G. Sharif M. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11518-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Intensity of bands was quantified by densitometry and values were expressed relative to untreated controls. For Egr-1 or Sp1, nuclear extracts from H35 cell lines (prepared as below) were analyzed by immunoblot using specific polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of Egr-1 or anti-Sp1 polyclonal PEP2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used in EMSAs: pgp2GC, 5′-gaagatctGCGGGGGCAACAGGGCGGCCGCCGgagatctag-3′; mtpgp2GC, 5′-gaagatctGCGTAGGCAACAGTTCGGCCGCCGgagatctag-3′; Sp1mt/Egrmt, 5′-gaagatctGCGTAGGCAACAGTTCGGCCGXXXagatctag-3′; Egr, 5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′; EgrMT, 5′-GGATCCAGCTAGGGCGAGCTAGGGCGA-3′; Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG-3′. The Xs in Sp1mt/Egrmt indicate deletion of the corresponding nucleotides. The pgp2GC, mtpgp2GC, and the Sp1mt/Egrmt oligonucleotides were obtained from Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The consensus and mutant Egr oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. and the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide was obtained from Promega. All oligonucleotides were purified by agarose electrophoresis, annealed with the complementary oligonucleotide, and then end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligos were purified by Nuc-trap (Stragene, CA). EMSAs were performed as described previously (26Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Thottassery J.V. Guzelian P.S. Strom S. Sun D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar). Protein (either H35 nuclear extract or affinity purified Sp1 or the recombinant Egr-1-GST fusion protein) was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 20 mmTris-HCl, 80 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Unlabeled specific competitor was then added and specific radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added last. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels with 0.25 × TBE as gel running buffer at room temperature. Gels were dried and bands visualized by autoradiography. Competitor oligo was added at 2-, 50-, or 200-fold excess and concurrent with the radiolabeled probe. When antibody to Egr-1 was used, the nuclear extract and antibody were preincubated at 4 °C for 25 min before the radiolabeled probe was added. Nuclear Extracts were prepared from H35 cells essentially as described by Latchman (27Dent C.L. Latchman D.S. Latchman D.S. Transcriptional Factors: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1994: 1-26Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on 60-mm dishes were washed 1 × with phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested in 1 ml of chilled phosphate-buffered saline, spun down, and resuspended in 50–100 μl of nuclear harvest buffer (20 mm Hepes, 450 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was then frozen and thawed three times in a dry-ice ethanol bath, spun down at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant used in gel-shift assays. Recombinant Egr-1 was prepared using the Egr-1-GST fusion vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia, Milwaukee, WI). Briefly, an overnight culture of Escherichia colitransformed with the expression vector was diluted 1:10 into fresh LB medium containing glucose and grown until an OD of 1–2 was reached. Expression of the fusion protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After growing for an additional 2–6 h, the bacteria were pelleted, and resuspended in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 2 mm and the suspension sonicated on ice with six 30-s bursts. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 10%. The suspension mixed, allowed to sit on ice for another 30 min, spun down, and the supernatant used in gel-shift assays. Egr1-pcDNA3, the plasmid used in in vitro transcription-translation contains Egr1 downstream of the T7 promoter in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Egr-pcDNA3 was translated using a TNT T7 quick coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Preliminary studies determined that 1/10 to 1/50 of the in vitro translation mixture could be used in EMSA with a consensus Egr probe. The proportion of total cellular lactate dehydrogenase released into the culture medium was used to measure cytotoxicity of various antitumor drugs and has been previously described (28Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 31-40PubMed Google Scholar). 3–5 × 105 cells of each of the H35 clones stably expressing Egr-1 or neo vector were plated onto 60-mm dishes. Cells were then cultured for 48 h in the presence of either 100 nm vinblastine or 100 μm fluorodeoxyuridine. After this interval aliquots of medium were sampled. The medium was then aspirated and the remaining attached cells lysed. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in the medium and cell lysate by using a Cytotoxicity Assay kit as described previously (29Thottassery J.V. Zambetti G.P. Arimori K. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The proportion of lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium as a fraction of the total lactate dehydrogenase was then determined. Sequence comparison of the 5′ promoter regions of the rat, hamster, human, and murine MDR1 genes revealed within each of the promoters a cluster of GC bases containing a consensus site for Sp1 (Fig. 1). Because of the phylogenetic conservation of the GC region in the MDR1 genes and the fact that a number of transcription factors bind to GC-rich regions (e.g. Sp1, Egr-1, and Ap-2) we hypothesized that the interactions between these factors and Sp1 in this GC region are important in basal regulation of the MDR1 promoters. We first tested whether the GC region in thepgp2/mdr1b promoter could bind Sp1 by preparing a wild-type oligonucleotide (pgp2GC) and a mutant (mtpgp2GC) that contained a 2-base pair mutation in the GC box that we predicted would disrupt Sp1 binding. EMSA demonstrated that wild type olignucleotide was effectively shifted by purified Sp1 and that the mutations in thepgp2/mdr1b Sp1 site resulted in a complete loss of Sp1 binding (Fig. 2 A). The functional significance of Sp1 mutation upon pgp2/mdr1bconstitutive promoter activity were assessed in vivo by introducing the identical mutations of the mtpgp2GC oligonucleotide into the pgp2/mdr1b reporter (−250MT). H35 hepatoma cells were chosen for transfection because they express pgp2/mdr1b(19Furuya K.N. Thottassery J.V. Schuetz E.G. Sharif M. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11518-11525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and maintain normal liver characteristics such as production of bile and expression of cytochromes P450 (30Hus J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The introduction of two point mutations in the pgp2/mdr1b promoter decreased basal promoter activity of −250MT to approximately 40% of the activity of −250WT in transfected H35 cells (Fig. 2 B). The finding that Sp1 mutations in the mdr1b promoter decreased its basal activity suggested Sp1 might play a role in positively regulating pgp2/mdr1b. This possibility was evaluated by transient transfection of −250WT or −250MT intoDrosophila Schneider cells (that are Sp1 negative) along with various amounts of either a wild-type Sp1 expression vector or an inactive COOH-terminal Sp1 mutant (N539) (20Courey A.J. Tijan R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Sp1 (200–300 ng) readily increased pgp2/mdr1b promoter activity from 7–25-fold. In contrast, cells co-transfected with N539, a zinc-finger deletion mutant showed no dose-related increase in the activity of the pgp2/mdr1b promoter. Finally, thepgp2/mdr1b promoter with the mutated Sp1 site was not appreciably activated by Sp1 (Fig. 2 C) thus demonstrating that an intact Sp1 site is required for Sp1 dependent transactivation. Although thepgp2/mdr1b promoter requires Sp1 for full basal activity (Fig. 2) it is unknown if ectopic overexpression of Sp1 can affect basal Pgp expression. In preliminary studies, we found that co-transfection of the cytomegalovirus-driven Sp1 expression vector (see “Methods”) and the −250WT plasmid into H35 cells lead to an Sp1-dependent transactivation in H35 cells (not shown). This Sp1 expression vector was then transfected into H35 cells and G418-resistant colonies were isolated. Several independent clones were selected and evaluated for immunoreactive Sp1, the amount of Sp1 DNA binding activity and the amount of immunoreactive Pgp. Compared with the Neo (pc2) clone, immunoreactive Sp1 expression increased from 1.8-fold to almost 5-fold in Sp1 clones 20 and 9, respectively (Fig.3 A). Further analysis of representative Sp1 clones revealed increased Sp1 DNA binding complexes compared with the Neo cell line (Fig. 3 B). The expression of Pgp in Sp1 cell lines 9, 18, and 20 increased 3–6-fold above the Neo control line (Fig. 3 C). Finally, we have shown that the transcriptional activity of the pgp2/mdr1b promoter increased 4.3-fold in the Sp18 cell line, compared with its activity in the Neo control line (not shown), a value comparable to the increase in Sp1 expression. These studies are the first to forge a direct link between enforced overexpression of Sp1 in cells and increased Pgp expression. To first test whether the pgp2GC region interacts with Egr1, H35 cell extracts were prepared. EMSA analysis demonstrated a specific DNA-protein complex formed with pgp2GC that was specifically reduced by incubation with either unlabeled consensus pgp2GC or Egr consensus and not by unrelated oligonucleotides such as Oct-1 and Sp1 (Fig. 4 A). To evaluate whether pgp2GC bound Egr-1, we in vitrotranslated Egr-1 and then performed EMSA analysis utilizing either radiolabeled pgp2GC or Egr as probes. Egr-1 readily bound the pgp2GC and Egr probes. The nonspecific competitor Oct-1 did not displace bound Egr-1 from either pgp2GC or Egr probes. In contrast, pgp2GC readily displaced Egr-1 as did the 100-fold excess wild-type Egr competitor. A small displacement was seen with 200-fold excess mutant Egr competitor. To evaluate the biological importance of Egr-1 in regulating thepgp2/mdr1b promoter, we co-transfected H35 cells with −250WT and either a wild-type Egr-1 expression plasmid (wtEgr-1) or a mutant Egr-1 that has a zinc-finger deleted and is incapable of binding DNA (mtEgr-1) (Fig. 5). Egr-1 suppressed the −250WT promoter in a dose-dependent manner reaching nearly complete suppression at 5 μg of Egr-1. Egr-1 suppression of the pgp2/mdr1b promoter was specific and not secondary to squelching because Egr-1 did not repress thymidine kinase promoter activity (not shown). Thus, the potent suppression ofpgp2/mdr1b by wtEgr-1 but not mtEgr-1 indicates that an intact Egr-1 DNA-binding domain is required. Furthermore, Egr-1 suppressed the pgp2/mdr1b promoter in both human colon carcinoma cells (LS180) and in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) (not shown). Thus, Egr-1 potently transrepressed thepgp2/mdr1b promoter regardless of cell context. Because Egr-1 and Sp1 have opposing effects on the pgp2/mdr1b promoter activity (Figs. 2 and 5) we assessed by EMSA whether Egr-1 and Sp1 might competitively interact at the pgp2GC site (Fig. 6). The Egr-1·pgp2GC complex migrates between Sp1 and the free probe. As a control for the specificity of the complexes, the Egr-1·DNA complex was competed with excess pgp2GC and the Sp1·DNA complex was competed with a consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (not shown). In preliminary EMSA studies using limiting amounts of radiolabeled pgp2GC, we determined that recombinant Egr-1 and Sp1 do not simultaneously bind to pgp2GC because a third slower migrating complex was not observed when the two proteins were added together and then compared with separate Sp1 or Egr-1 complexes individually (not shown). To test whether Egr-1 and Sp1 share an overlapping site, the pgp2GC probe was incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant Egr-1 in the presence of a fixed amount of Sp1. As the concentration of Egr-1 was increased, the amount of Egr-1 and pgp2GC complex increased while the Sp1·pgp2GC complex decreased (Fig. 6). However, when the amount of recombinant Egr-1 was held constant and Sp1 changed incrementally, the Egr-1·pgp2GC complex showed only minimal displacement. Clearly, the inability to displace Egr1 is not due to excess probe because in the adjacent Egr1 versus Sp1 competition experiment (left panel) the free probe is"
https://openalex.org/W2090417724,"The production and regulated secretion of bioactive peptides require a series of lumenal enzymes to convert inactive precursors into bioactive peptides plus several cytosolic proteins to govern granule formation, maturation, translocation, and exocytosis. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme essential for biosynthesis of many peptides, is an integral membrane protein with trafficking information in both its lumenal and cytosolic domains. Kalirin, a PAM cytosolic domain interactor protein with spectrin-like repeats and GDP/GTP exchange factor activity for Rac1, is expressed with PAM in neurons but is not expressed in the anterior pituitary or AtT-20 corticotrope cells. Expression of Kalirin alters the cytoskeletal organization of Chinese hamster ovary and AtT-20 cells expressing membrane PAM. Expression of membrane PAM also alters cytoskeletal organization, demonstrating the presence of endogenous proteins that can mediate this effect. Significant amounts of both PAM and Kalirin fractionate with cytoskeletal elements. Since cytoskeletal organization is critical for exocytosis, constitutive-like and regulated secretions were evaluated. Whereas the constitutive-like secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is increased by expression of membrane PAM, regulated secretion is eliminated. Expression of Kalirin in AtT-20 cells expressing membrane PAM restores stimulated secretion of ACTH. Thus, Kalirin or its homologue may be essential for regulated secretion, and the PAM-Kalirin interaction may coordinate intragranular with cytosolic events. The production and regulated secretion of bioactive peptides require a series of lumenal enzymes to convert inactive precursors into bioactive peptides plus several cytosolic proteins to govern granule formation, maturation, translocation, and exocytosis. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme essential for biosynthesis of many peptides, is an integral membrane protein with trafficking information in both its lumenal and cytosolic domains. Kalirin, a PAM cytosolic domain interactor protein with spectrin-like repeats and GDP/GTP exchange factor activity for Rac1, is expressed with PAM in neurons but is not expressed in the anterior pituitary or AtT-20 corticotrope cells. Expression of Kalirin alters the cytoskeletal organization of Chinese hamster ovary and AtT-20 cells expressing membrane PAM. Expression of membrane PAM also alters cytoskeletal organization, demonstrating the presence of endogenous proteins that can mediate this effect. Significant amounts of both PAM and Kalirin fractionate with cytoskeletal elements. Since cytoskeletal organization is critical for exocytosis, constitutive-like and regulated secretions were evaluated. Whereas the constitutive-like secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is increased by expression of membrane PAM, regulated secretion is eliminated. Expression of Kalirin in AtT-20 cells expressing membrane PAM restores stimulated secretion of ACTH. Thus, Kalirin or its homologue may be essential for regulated secretion, and the PAM-Kalirin interaction may coordinate intragranular with cytosolic events.

Kalirin, a novel member of the Dbl family of GDP/GTP exchange factors, was identified as a protein that interacts with routing determinants in the COOH-terminal cytosolic domain of membrane PAM (10Alam M.R.

The 200-kDa Kalirin protein consists of 9 spectrin-like repeats, a Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology domain, an SH3 domain, and a COOH-terminal domain (Fig.1). The region of Kalirin that interacts with PAM is contained within the spectrin-like repeats. The DH domain is typical of GDP/GTP exchange factors specific for members of the Rho subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, and Kalirin interacts with Rac1 (11Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N.

The disposition of amidated peptide products differs with cell type, with polarized secretion from neuronal processes, prolonged storage and tightly regulated release from pituitary cells, and rapid secretion from endothelial cells and glia (21Milgram S.L.

The identification of PAM interactors whose expression is limited to a subset of the PAM-producing cells was thus anticipated. Consistent with this, our initial studies indicated that Kalirin expression was high in the central nervous system but low in anterior pituitary and heart atrium, tissues in which PAM is highly expressed (10Alam M.R.

Anticipating that the cell type selected would affect the responses observed, we sought an appropriate system in which to investigate the mechanisms through which Kalirin affects the trafficking of PAM.

AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells were explored because they exhibit regulated release of ACTH and express a number of neuronal markers (33Tooze J. Hollinshead M. Fuller S.D. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 49: 259-273PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, our earlier studies demonstrated that overexpression of Kalirin in AtT-20 cells caused extension of long, branched neuritic processes and accelerated the cleavage of membrane PAM (11Alam M.R.

We first established that PAM and Kalirin expression are essentially coincident in the adult rat central nervous system. We next determined that AtT-20 cells, like anterior pituitary corticotropes, lack significant levels of Kalirin but do express a related Dbl family member, Trio (34Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.-H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S .A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). After using a non-neuroendocrine cell line to establish the ability of Kalirin to alter the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we explored the hypothesis that expression of Kalirin in AtT-20 cells could also alter the actin cytoskeleton. We next explored the hypothesis that expression of PAM-1, acting through endogenous proteins, might also alter cytoskeletal organization. Finally, we evaluated the functional consequences of this altered cytoskeletal organization by measuring ACTH secretion from cells expressing Kalirin and PAM-1. Poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was fractionated on denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and visualized after hybridization with radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for the DH domain of rat Kalirin (nt 3790–4635) or rat Trio (nt 3925–4199, using human Trio numbering) (34Debant A.

The blots were stripped and reprobed using radiolabeled cDNA probes specific for the spectrin-like domains of rat Kalirin (nt 1364–2600) or rat Trio (nt 1335–2642). A probe specific for ribosomal protein S26 was used for normalization (35Vincent S. Marty L. Fort P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar).

Then 30-min collections were performed in control medium, in medium containing 100 nmcorticotropin-releasing hormone (Sigma), or 1 mmBaCl2. Medium was gently centrifuged to remove the few non-adherent cells, protease inhibitors were added, and cell extracts were prepared using 5 n acetic acid with protease inhibitors. Samples were subjected to radioimmunoassays using COOH-terminal ACTH antiserum Kathy, which reacts equally with ACTH biosynthetic intermediate and ACTH but does not detect intact POMC (39Schnabel E.

Western blots were carried out after transfer of proteins to Immobilon-P, and primary antibodies were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CHO cells were maintained in the same manner as nontransfected AtT-20 cells and passaged weekly. CHO cell lines stably expressing Myc-Kalirin were established as described for AtT-20 cells (11Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Cultures were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 60 min, dehydrated, and embedded in an Epoxy resin. Inverted Beem capsules with the bottom cut off were placed overselected areas of the cultures, and after polymerization overnight the capsules were filled with resin and polymerized for an additional 24 h. The bottom of the culture vessel was broken off, and the cells were sectioned in the horizontal plane. The sections were poststained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and photographed with a Jeol 100S electron microscope. A glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein encompassing spectrin-like repeats 4–7 of Kalirin (amino acids 517–976) was expressed using pGEX.4T2. Upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside, glutathioneS-transferase-Kalirin4/7 was purified by adsorption to a glutathione-agarose column. The protein eluted with glutathione was dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, digested with thrombin, and the reaction mixture adsorbed to aglutathione-agarose column. The flow-through containing Kalirin4/7 was used to immunize rabbits (Covance, Denver, PA). The antisera (JH2581 and JH2582) failed to detect recombinant glutathione S-transferase (250 ng) on Western blots. Protein bands detected during Western analyses for Kalirin, including the endogenous Kalirin-related proteins, were all eliminated when excess purified Kalirin4/7 was included.

Photographs of control cells and transfected cells were taken under identical conditions and printed in an identical fashion. The paired use of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry has allowed us to examine the presence of Kalirin and PAM in neurons in various regions of the brain. We had previously established that Kalirin and PAM could be found in the same neurons (11Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

We could not find significant numbers of PAM-expressing neurons that lacked Kalirin nor could we find Kalirin-expressing neurons that lacked PAM. In certain regions of the adult rat brain, such as cerebellum, both PAM and Kalirin transcripts are undetectable (11Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

By contrast, in other regions of the brain (e.g. the hippocampus; olfactory bulb; hypothalamus; cingulate, piriform, and parietal regions of the cortex; frontal cortex), a very high percentage of the neurons was positive for both PAM and Kalirin. In the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus (Fig. 2 D), and among the magnocellular (neuroendocrine) neurons of the hypothalamus, all of the neurons were positive for PAM and Kalirin.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 222-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were very abundant in several parts of the central nervous system. Although Northern blot analysis indicated that pituitary was not a major site of Kalirin expression (11Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Hand T.A. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we used in situhybridization to determine whether a few Kalirin-expressing cells could be identified among a majority of non-expressing cells (Fig.2 B). We failed to find any evidence for Kalirin-expressing cells in the pituitary. Thus expression of Kalirin in the adult rat appears to be limited to the central nervous system. The fact that Kalirin is not highly expressed in the anterior pituitary suggests that Kalirin per se is not essential for PAM to function as a peptide α-amidating enzyme nor for the formation and storage of large dense core vesicles. Since AtT-20 cells are derived from anterior pituitary corticotropes and store products derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in large dense core vesicles, we evaluated the expression of Kalirin in this cell line. As observed for rat anterior pituitary, Kalirin mRNA was not detectable when AtT-20 cells were examined (Fig. 1). In contrast, rat cortex yielded a robust signal with several different forms of Kalirin mRNA. Trio was examined because it is the closest known homologue of Kalirin; a single 12-kilobase pair Trio transcript was apparent in both anterior pituitary and AtT-20 cells. Trio transcripts are expressed at similar levels in anterior pituitary and cortex. Since Kalirin contains spectrin-like domains and is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1 (45Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Lucas M. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abst. 1997; : 904.8Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether its expression would affect the actin cytoskeleton. The effects of Dbl family members on cytoskeletal organization are routinely examined in non-neuroendocrine cells, so we expressed Kalirin in CHO cells (Fig. 3). CHO cells expressing Kalirin exhibited a morphology substantially different from that of nontransfected CHO cells; they were more rounded, making less contact with the culture dish, and spike-like structures could be seen extending from their surface. Staining of nontransfected CHO cells with FITC-phalloidin, a mushroom toxin that binds selectively to filamentous actin, revealed a highly ordered array of stress fibers extending from one margin of the cell to the other; nontransfected CHO cells were thin, exhibiting extensive contact with the substrate (Fig. 3). Stress fibers were less prevalent in the CHO cells expressing Kalirin; instead, isolated patches of filamentous actin could be identified near the cell surface. Our previous studies demonstrated that expression of Kalirin in AtT-20 cells expressing exogenous membrane PAM altered the morphology of the cells and increased the speed with which PAM underwent endoproteolytic cleavage within the regulated secretory pathway (11Alam M.R.

At the time the original studies were performed, our antisera did not allow us to determine the subcellular localization of exogenous Kalirin expressed in AtT-20 cells. By using two new rabbit polyclonal antisera generated to a recombinant protein consisting of spectrin-like repeats 4–7 of rat Kalirin, we were able to visualize transfected Kalirin in the perinuclear region of AtT-20 cells (Fig.4, B, D, and F). Kalirin staining was punctate rather than diffuse throughout the cytosol, suggesting that much of the Kalirin was associated with structural elements. Kalirin was clearly most concentrated in a region near the Golgi, as identified by staining with a monoclonal antibody to γ-adaptin (Fig. 4 E). In addition, Kalirin staining extended through a broader region of the cytosol. We next evaluated the effect of Kalirin on the actin cytoskeleton. Staining nontransfected AtT-20 cells with FITC-phalloidin revealed a fairly disordered pattern of actin filaments; some staining was apparent at the margins of the cells, and speckles of staining were apparent throughout much of the cytoplasm (Fig.5). Although AtT-20 cells produce fully amidated product peptides from POMC (46Eipper B.A. Park L. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8686-8694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Mains R.E. Bloomquist B.T. Eipper B.A. Mol.

Using an in situelectroporation system which permits the introduction of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins into cells, we found that c-CrkII bound to p130cas, but not to paxillin in serum-starved rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing the human insulin receptor (HIRc cells) in vivo. 17 nm insulin stimulation dissociated the binding of c-CrkII to p130cas, whereas 13 nm insulin-like growth factor-I, 16 nm epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 10% serum each showed little or no effect. We found that stress fiber formation is consistent with a change in the p130cas·c-CrkII interactions before and after growth factor stimulation. Microinjection of either GST-Crk-SH2 or -Crk-(N)SH3 domains, or anti-Crk antibody each inhibited stress fiber formation before and after insulin-like growth factor-I, EGF, and serum stimulation. Insulin stimulation by itself caused stress fiber breakdown and there was no additive effect of microinjection. Microinjection of anti-p130cas antibody also blocked stress fiber formation in quiescent cells. Microinjection of the Crk-inhibitory reagents also inhibited DNA synthesis after insulin-like growth factor-I, EGF, and serum stimulation, but not after insulin.

Crk, a member of a family of adapter proteins, was originally reported from an avian retrovirus encoding the oncogene product v-Crk (1Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The mammalian cellular homologues of v-Crk have been subsequently identified as c-CrkI and c-CrkII, which are alternatively spliced forms of a single gene (2Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshav S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another closely related gene product, c-Crk-L has been isolated (4ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for Crk in the regulation of the mammalian actin cytoskeleton has been suggested. In v-Crk-expressing cells, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of a limited number of specific cellular proteins is increased, despite the lack of any tyrosine kinase catalytic domain in v-Crk itself (5Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Among these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, components of focal adhesions, p130cas and paxillin, known to associate with actin stress fiber formation (6Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H.

DOCK180, which was cloned as an SH3 domain-binding partner of c-Crk, alters cell morphology upon translocation to the cell membrane (9Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Gotoh N.

Thus, c-Crk has been implicated in actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways, but the detailed mechanisms of its actions are still unclear. In this study, to examine the mechanism of c-Crk function in growth factor-induced actin cytoskeleton organization and mitogenic pathways, we have examined Crk interactions with several signal transduction molecules in rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing human insulin receptor (HIRc cells). The functional involvement of c-Crk in these cellular functions was directly assessed by single cell microinjection analysis in the presence and absence of several growth factors in HIRc cells. Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing 1 × 106 human insulin receptors per cell (HIRc cells) were cultured as described previously (10McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ulrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were found to express c-CrkII but not c-CrkI by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Porcine insulin and IGF-I were kindly provided by Lilly, and EGF was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), a monoclonal rat anti-BrdUrd antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from Amersham Corp. A mouse monoclonal anti-Crk antibody, a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pY) antibody, a mouse monoclonal anti-p130cas antibody (against carboxyl terminus), a mouse monoclonal anti-Sos antibody, and a mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody were from Transduction laboratories (Lexington, KY). A rabbit polyclonal anti-CrkII antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-cbl antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-C3G antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-c-abl antibody, a rabbit polyclonal anti-p130cas antibody (against carboxyl terminus) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse IgG and fluorescent isothiocyanate or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rat IgG antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, NY). Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. TRITC-phalloidin and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The GST fusion proteins containing SH2 domain or (N)SH3 domain of c-Crk were a generous gift of R. B. Birge and H. Hanafusa (8Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The purified proteins were concentrated using a Centricon-30 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and the buffer was exchanged to 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 100 mm KCl for microinjection or to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for electroporation. Cell monolayers were starved for 36 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were then treated with 17 nm insulin, 13 nm IGF-I, 16 nm EGF, or 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated times at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmleupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μm pepstatin (pH 7.4). The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies or precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 3 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Protran (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. The membranes were blocked in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% BSA (pH 7.5) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then probed with specified antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the membranes in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.5), blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using the ECL reagent according to the manufacture's instructions (Amersham Corp.). HIRc cells were plated on glass slides coated with conductive indium tin oxide and grown within windows (7 × 15 mm) framed by nonconducting adhesive. Cells approaching confluence were starved for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA. Electroporation was performed with an Epizap pulse generator and electrode manufactured by Ask Science (12Raptis L.H. Liu S.K. Firth K.L. Stiles C.D. Alberta J.A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 104-114PubMed Google Scholar). Plated cells were subjected to six consecutive electrical pulses, each at 25 V to a capacitance of 16 microfarads. During pulsations, the cells were submerged in PBS containing 7 mm of the indicated GST fusion protein. The cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA and incubated in the same medium for 12 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed as described above. The cell lysates from 10 slides (400 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-CrkII antibody and for precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Corp.). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and rendered quiescent by starvation for 36 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA. Anti-Crk antibody and GST fusion proteins were solubilized in microinjection buffer consisting of 5 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4), and then microinjected using glass capillary needles. Immunofluorescent staining as described below of the injected cells indicated that about 80% of the cells were successfully microinjected. In all injection experiments, results represent the mean of at least three identical experiments in which at least 250 cells were injected. One hour after microinjection, cells were stimulated with 17 nm insulin, 13 nmIGF-I, 16 nm EGF, or 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 min and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed in PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with TRITC-phalloidin (0.5 μg/ml) in PBS. Fluorescent isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100) was added to the incubation mixture for coverslips containing injected cells. One hour after microinjection, cells were incubated with BrdUrd plus vehicle, 17 nm insulin, 13 nm IGF-I, 16 nm EGF, or 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked with a solution containing 5% BSA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. The cells were incubated with rat polyclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody in a buffer containing 10 mmMgCl2 and DNase I for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then stained by incubation with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-rat IgG antibody, fluorescent isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody, and Heuchst (Sigma), which stains all nuclei, for 1 h at room temperature. After staining, coverslips were washed successively in PBS and deionized H2O for 5 min and mounted in PBS containing 15% polyvinyl alcohol, 33% glycerol, and sodium azide. After the coverslips were mounted, the cells were analyzed with a Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). For actin localization, individual cells displaying parallel actin fibers that colocalized with the nucleus were then scored as positive for stress fibers. Cells that showed actin staining at the periphery were scored as positive for membrane ruffles. The percentage of total counted cells displaying each phenotype is represented by the stress fiber and ruffling indexes, respectively. We first evaluated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which are co-immunoprecipitated with c-Crk in the basal state in HIRc cells. Immunoprecipitation by anti-CrkII antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-pY antibody showed a tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa band (pp130 in Fig. 1). This band was also immunoprecipitated by another anti-Crk antibody which recognizes a distinct epitops (Fig. 1). The pp130 was identified as p130cas by subsequent anti-p130cas blotting of the anti-Crk antibodies immunoprecipitants (Fig. 1, middle panel). c-CrkII was faintly tyrosine phosphorylated (pp40) in the basal state (Fig. 1). c-CrkI was not detected by Western blotting with anti-Crk antibody in HIRc cell lysates (data not shown). A quantitative analysis of p130cas·c-CrkII binding using Western blotting and densitometry showed that an estimated 43% of total c-CrkII binds to p130cas, and 21% of total p130cas binds to c-CrkII in quiescent and serum-starved HIRc cells. To determine which signaling molecules bind to which domain(s) of c-CrkII in vivo, we electroporated GST fusion proteins containing either the Crk SH2 domain or the Crk-(N)SH3 domain. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-CrkII antibody (Fig. 2,lanes 1–3) and the supernatants from this procedure were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). The final supernatants are seen in Fig. 2, lanes 7–9. The CrkII antibody precipitates >95% of endogenous CrkII (Fig. 2, panel A), and since this antibody is directed against the COOH-terminal CrkII SH3, as predicted, it does not precipitate either the GST-Crk-SH2 or GST-Crk-(N)SH3 (Fig. 2,panel B, lanes 1–3). The GST fusion proteins were efficiently electroporated into the cells and were quantitatively precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B, as seen in Fig. 2,panel B, lanes 4–6. Control studies using immunostaining of cells and Western blotting with GST antibody showed that >90% of the cells incorporate GST fusion proteins at an average level of 10 pmol of GST protein/mg of total cellular protein under our electroporation conditions (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2, panels C andD, when the electroporated cells are precipitated with CrkII antibody, which does not recognize the GST fusion proteins, incorporating GST-Crk-SH2 into the cells completely disrupts the association between endogenous CrkII and a tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas (lane 2), whereas GST-Crk-(N)SH3 is without effect (lane 3). In addition, precipitation of the GST fusion proteins from the c-CrkII immunodepleted supernatants revealed that p130cas was now associated with GST-Crk-SH2, but not GST-Crk-(N)SH3 (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 4–6). Cells electroporated with PBS alone showed the same results as the cells electroporated with GST alone (data not shown). These results indicate that endogenous CrkII binds to p130cas via its SH2 domain and that GST-Crk-SH2 is able to displace endogenous CrkII from p130cas in vivo. Crk-SH2 domain preferentially binds to (p)YXXP motifs (13Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Paxillin possesses (p)YXXP motifs as does p130cas(14Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated in these cells in the basal state (data not shown and Ref. 15Baron V. Calleja V. Ferrari P. Alengrin F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7162-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). v-Crk has been shown to bind to paxillin in v-Crk transformed cells (8Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and GST-Crk-SH2 binds to paxillin (pp68) in vivo (Fig. 2, C and E, lane 5), however, anti-CrkII antibody failed to co-immunoprecipitate any detectable paxillin (Fig. 2, C andE, lanes 1–3). In vitro GST fusion protein precipitation studies showed that 1 μg of GST-Crk-SH2 precipitated both p130cas and paxillin but 0.1 μg of GST-Crk-SH2 did not, while anti-CrkII antibody immunoprecipitated only p130cas but not paxillin (data not shown). Another anti-Crk antibody also did not immunoprecipitate the pp68 band (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the full-length c-CrkII protein binds only to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas, and not to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin, although GST-Crk-SH2 can bind to both docking proteins similarly, even in vivo. In the basal state, c-cbl, which also has been reported to bind to the Crk-SH2 domain (16Ribon V. Hubbell S. Herrera R. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Panchamoorthy G. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Druker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), did not bind to c-CrkII or to the GST fusion proteins (data not shown). The electroporated GST-Crk-(N)SH3 partially blocked the association between c-CrkII and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, or between c-CrkII and c-abl in vivo (Fig. 2, F and G). Sos, another exchange factor, was not detected in anti-CrkII antibody immunoprecipitants, whereas a small amount of Sos was precipitated with the GST-Crk-(N)SH3 in vivo (Fig. 2 H). As shown in Fig. 1, there is a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CrkII in the basal state and it has been shown that Tyr221 can undergo phosphorylation in response to growth factors (18Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Fajardo J.E. Birge R.B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7295-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To assess this and the effect of growth factor stimulation on c-CrkII interactions, we stimulated HIRc cells with 17 nm insulin, 13 nm IGF-I, 16 nm EGF, or 10% serum followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CrkII antibody and Western blotting of the precipitates with anti-pY antibody, anti-CrkII antibody, anti-p130cas antibody, anti-paxillin antibody, or anti-c-cbl antibody. All three growth factors caused a time-dependent increase in c-CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas serum was without effect (Fig. 3 A). As regards the interactions of c-CrkII, as shown in Fig. 3 C, c-CrkII strongly associates with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa band in the basal state, and this association is almost completely disrupted after 5 min of insulin stimulation. p130cas blotting confirmed that this tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-kDa molecule is p130cas(Fig. 3 D). A slight effect of IGF-I on dissociation of c-CrkII·p130cas was also detected, and EGF caused a transient (1 min only) effect which was coinduced with the transient appearance of an 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band. This EGF-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated band was identified as c-cbl by anti-c-cbl antibody blotting (Fig. 3 E). Serum stimulation had no significant effect (Fig. 3, C-E). There were no other detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated bands in the anti-CrkII antibody immunoprecipitants before or after growth factor stimulation (data not shown). We then evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation state of c-CrkII binding molecules by stimulation with growth factors, followed by precipitation with anti-p130cas and anti-c-cbl antibodies and Western blotting with anti-pY antibody. p130cas was strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state, and insulin led to marked dephosphorylation of this protein, which was almost complete by 5 min, while IGF-I had a more modest effect. EGF led to a transient dephosphorylation of p130cas, which peaked at 1 min, and returned to basal level by 5 and 20 min (Fig.4, right panels). Taken together, our results indicate that c-CrkII binds to p130casvia the CrkII SH2 domain in the basal state, and this c-CrkII·p130cas complex can be disrupted by the tyrosine dephosphorylation of p130cas induced by insulin, weakly by IGF-I, and transiently by EGF stimulation. With respect to c-cbl, insulin, IGF-I, and serum stimulation had no effect on c-cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. EGF had a measurable, but transient effect which peaked at 1 min (Fig. 4, left panels), and this event may induce the formation of the c-CrkII·c-cbl complex seen in Fig. 3, C andE. As seen in Fig. 2,C and D, electroporation of GST-Crk-SH2 into the cells almost completely inhibited the endogenous CrkII SH2 domain binding to p130cas, whereas GST-Crk-(N)SH3 was less competitive for the endogenous CrkII-(N)SH3 domain binding to C3G and to c-abl (Fig. 2, F and G). To see if these interactions were important for actin cytoskeleton signaling and for mitogenic signaling, we carried out single cell microinjection studies in which GST-Crk-SH2, GST-Crk-(N)SH3, and anti-Crk antibody were introduced into HIRc cells followed by stimulation with insulin, IGF-I, EGF, or serum. Following stimulation, actin cytoskeletal organization and BrdUrd incorporation into newly synthesized DNA were monitored by immunofluorescence staining. As can be seen in Fig. 5, Aand B, 62% of serum-starved HIRc cells have stress fibers. The stress fiber response to growth factor stimulation in preimmune mouse IgG-injected cells (Fig. 5 B, white bars) was quite comparable to the changes in the association between c-CrkII and p130cas by growth factor stimulation (Fig. 3). Microinjection of the anti-Crk reagents induced partial stress fiber breakdown in the basal state, and even after IGF-I, EGF, or serum stimulation (Fig. 5,A and B), while control injections of the same concentration of GST, GST-Grb2-SH2, or GST-Grb2-(N)SH3 domain had no effect (Fig. 5 C). Insulin stimulation by itself caused marked stress fiber breakdown, and there was no additive effect, or inhibition, resulting from microinjection of these reagents. Microinjection of anti-p130cas antibody also decreased actin stress fiber formation, indicating that the p130cas·c-Crk-II pathway is important in maintenance of the cytoskeletal structure (Fig.5 C). We next evaluated the effect of microinjection of these anti-Crk reagents on membrane ruffling of HIRc cells. Insulin and IGF-I led to a membrane ruffling response in 81 and 65% of the cells, respectively (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas EGF and serum stimulation were without effect (data not shown). All of the injected anti-Crk reagents inhibited membrane ruffling induced by insulin and IGF-I (Fig. 6 B). Taken together with the data in Fig. 5, it seems likely that c-CrkII plays a role in the signaling pathway leading to stress fiber formation and membrane ruffling. As can be seen in Fig. 7, none of these anti-Crk reagents had any influence on basal rates of DNA synthesis. Microinjection of the anti-Crk reagents did not inhibit insulin-stimulated BrdUrd labeling, whereas all three anti-Crk reagents partially inhibited IGF-I, EGF, and serum stimulated BrdUrd labeling (Fig. 7, A and B). Thus, ongoing c-CrkII function as an adapter protein is necessary for IGF-I, EGF, and serum to exert their mitogenic stimulatory effects, but not for insulin in HIRc cells. The adapter protein p130cas was originally identified as a prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Crk- and v-Src-transformed cells (20Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). p130cas contains an SH3 domain, two proline-rich regions, and a substrate domain consisting of 15 potential SH2-binding motifs (20Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In fact, 9 of these 15 tyrosine phosphorylation sites conform to the SH2-binding motif for Crk ((p)YXXP), suggesting that Crk is the primary adapter protein for p130cas. Paxillin also has three (p)YXXP motifs at tyrosine positions 31, 118, and 181. Tyrosines at positions 31 and 118 of paxillin may be important in binding the v-Crk-SH2 domain (14Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In the present study, c-CrkII is shown to bind to p130cas, but not to paxillin, although both p130cas and paxillin are members of focal adhesions and tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state. c-CrkL competes with c-CrkII to bind to paxillin at phosphorylated tyrosine residues 31 and 118 in rat uterus cells, because c-CrkL is more abundant in these cells (21Butler A.A. Blakesley V.A. Koval A. deJong R. Groffen J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27660-27664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We could not detect any association between paxillin and c-CrkII, even after growth factor stimulation, thus, paxillin does not seem to have an important function through binding to c-CrkII, in contrast to p130cas·c-CrkII interaction, in HIRc cells. Several studies have recently suggested that Crk may regulate the actin cytoskeleton through activation of the Rho/Rac family of small GTPases (6Nievers M.G. Birge R.B. Greulich H. Verkleij A.J.

In the present study, we directly demonstrated that c-CrkII plays an important role in the cytoskeletal organization of stress fiber formation and membrane ruffling. Both the SH2 domain and (N)SH3 domain of c-CrkII are required for these effects. Although c-CrkII transiently binds to c-cbl after EGF stimulation, stress fiber formation was correlated with the association between p130casand c-CrkII via the SH2 domain of c-CrkII. Our results are also consistent with a role for p130cas in the maintenance of stress fibers. Furthermore, a recent report showed that the p130casknockout embryo exhibits decreased stress fiber formation (27Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Taken together with the previous reports noted above, c-CrkII is now implicated in the regulation of the Rho/Rac family of small GTPases via p130cas and Crk-(N)SH3 interaction. The introduction of activated Rho into cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and p130cas, placing one or more tyrosine kinase downstream of Rho activity (28Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D inhibits p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, Rho activation followed by stress fiber formation seems to be essential for p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation (29Casamassima A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9363-9370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the treatment of cells with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin, blocks Rho activation specifically at an upstream step (30Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine kinases seem to be required at signaling steps both upstream and downstream of Rho. Recently, v-Crk was reported to activate Rho GTPase in PC12 cells (7Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. De Graaf P. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that c-CrkII binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas, and then activates Rho GTPase, which is important in the production of phosphorylated 4,5-phosphatidylinositol (PIP2) and mediates stress fiber formation (7Altun-Gultekin Z.F. Chandriani S. Bougeret C. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. De Graaf P. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3044-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rho activation followed by stress fiber formation seems to be interdependent with p130cas·c-CrkII association. The present study strongly suggests that a p130cas·c-CrkII complex acts in the maintenance of stress fibers. Insulin stimulation of HIRc cells induces stress fiber breakdown and dissociation of p130cas and c-CrkII. Insulin-induced stress fiber breakdown appears to involve the conversion from PIP2 to PIP3 by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (31Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This conversion decreases the amount of PIP2, necessary for stress fiber maintenance, in the plasma membrane (32Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation causes c-Src inactivation through the activation of Csk and tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins (33Tobe K. Sabe H. Yamamoto T. Yamauchi T. Asai S. Kaburagi Y. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kimura H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Hanafusa H. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because c-Src activity is important for the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas (34Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), its inactivation may lead to tyrosine dephosphorylation of p130cas following insulin stimulation. Insulin-induced p130cas dephosphorylation followed by disruption of the p130cas·c-CrkII complex may also contribute to insulin-induced breakdown of stress fibers. The membrane ruffling induced by insulin or IGF-I stimulation is inhibited by microinjection of Crk inhibitory reagents. These data are consistent with a previous report which showed that anti-Crk antibody microinjection inhibited insulin-induced membrane ruffling (36Ishiki M. Sasaoka T. Ishihara H. Imamura T. Usui I. Takata Y. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The breakdown of stress fibers in the basal state induced by microinjection of anti-Crk reagents suggests that the CrkII complex may regulate activation of Rho GTPase, which stimulates production of PIP2 through the activation of PIP-5-kinase (32Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 37Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Membrane ruffling induced by insulin stimulation is dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (38Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Hara K. Ueda H. Kitamura Y. Sakaue H. Ando A. Chavanieu A. Calas B. Grigorescu F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2313-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which converts PIP2 to PIP3. Thus, microinjection of Crk inhibitory reagents may lead to a decrease in PIP2 in the plasma membrane through Rho GTPase inactivation. This effect would be expected to reduce PIP3 production, preventing membrane ruffling. Ishiki et al. (36Ishiki M. Sasaoka T. Ishihara H. Imamura T. Usui I. Takata Y. Kobayashi M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported that c-CrkII·c-cbl complex formation induced by EGF stimulation may be important for mitogenic signaling. Our results with EGF are consistent with these observations, however, we also demonstrated that c-CrkII·c-cbl complex independent signaling in response to IGF-I or serum is also blocked by microinjection of anti-Crk reagents (Fig. 7). This suggests that c-CrkII plays a c-cbl-independent role in mitogenic signaling in response to IGF-I or serum. The activation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, members of Rho/Rac family of small GTPases, regulates actin cytoskeleton organization and is required for S phase progression (39Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the formation of a p130cas·c-CrkII complex, which may localize at focal adhesions, paralleled both stress fiber formation and DNA synthesis after growth factor stimulation in HIRc cells. Thus, a c-CrkII containing complex may mediate signals to actin cytoskeleton organization and to DNA synthesis through the regulation of Rho/Rac family small GTPases. HIRc cells possess a DNA synthesis response to 17 nminsulin stimulation (Fig. 7), although 17 nm insulin stimulation causes almost complete breakdown of stress fibers (Fig. 5,A and B) and tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesions (40Pillay T.S. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Insulin receptor overexpression in 184B5 epithelial cells led to ligand-dependent transformation, and these cells grow in an anchorage-independent manner (41Frittitta L. Vigneri R. Stampfer M.R. Goldfine I.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin-stimulated HIRc cells may be deficient in normal anchorage-dependent growth control (Fig.8). This hypothesis is consistent with the ability of HIRc cells to retain high DNA synthesis activity in the absence of stress fibers, which may be accomplished through the robust activation of Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras in this cell type (42Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF receptor overexpressing rat-1 fibroblasts also demonstrated growth in the absence of stress fibers after EGF stimulation (43Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We established an in vivo GST fusion protein binding system using in situ electroporation in this study. Compared with the transfection of GST fusion protein constructs, the advantages of this in vivo system are the rapid and homogeneous introduction of fusion proteins into cells, and the facility of controlled fusion protein concentration. This system also permits the subsequent assay of biological functions. Thus, this can be a powerful and simple method to analyze signal transduction pathways."

Immediate early genes (IEGs) 1The abbreviations used are: IEG, immediate early gene; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CREM, CRE modulator protein; pCREB, phosphorylated CREB. encode transcription factors that are induced rapidly by extracellular signals and regulate expression of target genes. IEGs have been implicated in many neuronal functions including neuronal plasticity (1Demmer J. Dragunow M. Lawlor P.A. Mason S.E. Leah J.D. Abraham W.C. Tate W.P. Mol.

Cell. 1988; 55: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The CRE motif is constitutively bound with the CRE-binding protein (CREB) and the CRE modulator protein (CREM) that are activated through phosphorylation (12Dey A. Nebert D.W. Ozato K.

First, there appears to be cross-talk between the AP-1 and CRE motifs (16Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Jun proteins were found to bind to the CRE motif (17Ivashkiv L.B. Liou H.C. Kara C.J. Lamph W.W. Verma I.M. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and recent reports showed that CREB is also a component of the AP-1 DNA-protein complex (19Pennypacker K.R. Hudson P.M. Hong J.S. McMillian M.K. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 86: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the non-conserved 5′- and 3′- flanking regions of the consensus AP-1 sequences play an important role in determining binding affinity with IEG proteins (20Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, gene specificity may occur in the composition of Fos/Jun dimers binding to the AP-1 site. Third, DNA-protein binding activities show tissue specificity as well as developmental and excitation-dependent regulation that may be attributed to IEG expression varying between brain regions and level of stimulation (5Icard-Liepkains C.

The latter study also demonstrated that, whereas the CRE was solely responsible for cAMP-mediated regulation of TH promoter activity, both CRE and AP-1 sites were capable of mediating the effects of calcium influx on TH promoter activity.

Neurol. 1983; 214: 427-440Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These neurons receive innervation from olfactory receptor cells and regulate the activities of mitral and tufted cells (34Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1990Google Scholar). In the developing olfactory bulb, TH phenotypic expression begins after precursor cells migrate from the subventricular zone to the glomerular region where they receive sensory afferent stimulation (32McLean J.H. Shipley M.T. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3658-3669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Baker H. Farbman A.I. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In adult rodents, either olfactory deafferentation or odor deprivation, the latter produced by unilateral naris closure, results in a significant loss of TH expression (30Baker H. Kawano T. Margolis F.L. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 69-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Baker H. Morel K. Stone D.M. Maruniak J.A.

Neurol. 1991; 311: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that olfactory input from receptor cells is necessary for both the initiation and maintenance of TH expression in the periglomerular neurons but do not define the molecular mechanisms underlying TH gene regulation. Lacking is evidence that supports a role for either TH AP-1 or CRE activity in TH gene expression in the dopaminergic periglomerular neurons. Recent studies demonstrated that c-fos message and c-Fos protein are partially colocalized with TH in the glomerular layer (41Guthrie K.M. Gall C.M. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42Jin B.K. Franzen L. Baker H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 14: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In parallel to the decreased TH expression, drastic down-regulation of c-fos expression occurred in periglomerular neurons in the odor-deprived olfactory bulb (42Jin B.K. Franzen L. Baker H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 14: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting a correlation between the c-fos and TH gene regulation. However, a direct interaction between the c-fosgene product and the TH AP-1 motif remains to be demonstrated. Moreover, it is unknown whether the CRE motif on the TH promoter has a role in TH gene regulation in periglomerular neurons of olfactory bulb in response to alterations in either primary afferent innervation or stimulation. To elucidate some of the cis- and trans-acting elements important in regulating TH expression in the olfactory bulb periglomerular neurons, the current studies employed immunocytochemical, Western blot, and gel shift analyses to investigate the composition of the AP-1 and CRE binding complexes. Adult male CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratory (Kingston, NY) and housed under a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. Unilateral naris closure was produced with a spark-gap electrocautery under pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/kg Nembutal). Closure was confirmed visually at the time of sacrifice. Studies were carried out at least 2 months post-closure. All procedures were performed under protocols approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines. Polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Fos, Fos-B, and Jun-D were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Additional polyclonal c-Fos antisera were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies (Woodlands, TX) and Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Polyclonal antibodies for CREB, pCREB, and CREM were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal TH antisera were prepared in the laboratory (43Joh T.H. Geghman C. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1973; 39: 342-348Google Scholar). Mice were perfused under deep pentobarbital anesthesia with saline containing 0.5% sodium nitrite and 10 units/ml heparin followed by 4% buffered (0.1 msodium phosphate, pH 7.2) formaldehyde. Following 1 h of post-fixation, olfactory bulbs were infiltrated overnight with 30% sucrose. Frozen sections (40 μm) were incubated with antisera overnight at room temperature followed by incubation with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antiserum, the Vector Elite kit (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA), and with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-HCl (0.05%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.003%) as chromogen (38Cho J.Y. Min N. Franzen L. Baker H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 369: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were isolated from olfactory bulbs according to the method of Roy et al. (44Roy R.J. Gosselin P. Guerin S.L. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 770-777PubMed Google Scholar). For each extraction, 0.3–0.5 g was employed, representing about 20 olfactory bulbs. Samples were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The oligonucleotides containing the TH AP-1 and CRE motifs (synthesized by Gene Link; Thornwood, NY) were identical to the regions of the TH 5′ upstream sequence ranging from −189 to −212 and from −32 to −54, respectively, and they had the following sequences: AP-1, 5′-TGAGGGTGATTCAGAGGCAGGTGC-3′ and 3′-ACTCCCACTAAGTCTCCGTCCACG-5′; CRE, 5′-GAGGGGCTTTGACGTCAGCCTGG-3′ and 3′-CTCCCCGAAACTGCAGTCGGACC-5′. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and end-labeled with32P using bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to Sambrook et al. (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) as described previously. The specific activity of the probes was routinely ∼150,000 cpm/ng. To measure changes in AP-1 binding activity induced by naris closure, optical density of the film autoradiograms was determined on an automated image analysis system (IBAS, Thornwood, NY) as described previously (46Cubells J.F. Kim K.S. Baker H. Volpe B.T. Chung Y.-I. Houpt T.A. Wessel T.C. Joh T.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). DNA-protein reaction mixtures (20 μl) were established as follows: buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 15 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.28 ng of radiolabeled probe in presence or absence of molar excess cold probe. Mixtures were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min. Samples were loaded onto nondenaturing high ionic strength polyacrylamide gels (8% bisacrylamide). After running at 100 V for 3 h, the gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat films (Kodak; Rochester, NY) with one intensifying screen. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were mixed with appropriate antibodies (anti-c-Fos, -Fos-B, -Jun-D, -CREB, and -CREM, 0.1 μg of each). The mixtures were incubated on ice for 20 min and then subjected to gel retardation assay as described above. Nuclear proteins (10∼30 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% bisacrylamide) electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44933) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated in blocking solution (BS; 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, 5% non-fat milk, 0.5% Tween 20) at room temperature for 15 min. Blots were then incubated with polyclonal antibodies (1:2000 diluted in BS) for 2 h. After three 5-min washes in BS, blots were incubated in the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 diluted in BS) for 1 h. Blots were washed four times, 5 min each, in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and detected with ECL reagents (Amersham; Arlington Heights, IL) according to manufacturer instructions. As previously shown (38Cho J.Y. Min N. Franzen L. Baker H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 369: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in the control olfactory bulb TH was concentrated in cell bodies and processes of periglomerular neurons located in the glomerular layer of olfactory bulb (Fig.1 A). TH expression was drastically reduced in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the naris closure (Fig. 1 B). The IEG proteins, c-Fos (Fig. 1,C and D) and Fos-B (Fig. 1, E andF), were localized to nuclei distributed in the glomerular, mitral, and granule cell layers. The number of both c-Fos and Fos-B immunopositive neurons showed dramatic reductions in the periglomerular cells of olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the closure. c-Fos expression was absent in the glomerular layer (Fig. 1 D). Fos-B expression, which was more widely distributed, showed a 50% reduction in response to odor deprivation (mean number of cells per unit area ± S.E.: contralateral to naris closure 287.3 ± 11.97versus ipsilateral to naris closure 155.2 ± 6.06;p < 0.001, n = 4). Expression of these early genes also was reduced in the granule, but not the mitral, cell layer. Double label immunofluorescence studies showed that a subpopulation of Fos-B immunoreactive cells in the glomerular layer also expressed TH (data not shown). In contrast to c-Fos and Fos-B, naris closure did not alter the expression of CREB (Fig. 2, Aand B) and Jun-D (Fig. 2, E and F) in the olfactory bulb. Whereas c-Fos, Fos-B, and Jun-D were present primarily in neurons, CREB (Fig. 2, A and B) displayed a broader distribution, that is, this IEG product appeared to be expressed in both neurons and glia. The phosphorylated form of CREB, pCREB, showed a primarily neuronal localization in the olfactory bulb. Levels of pCREB were variably increased by odor deprivation (Fig. 2,C and D). Because naris closure produced down-regulation in expression of some IEG products in parallel to that observed for TH in periglomerular neurons, gel retardation assays were performed to determine whether TH AP-1 and CRE binding activities in olfactory bulb were altered by odor deprivation. TH AP-1 and CRE probes formed distinctive DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extracts isolated from control olfactory bulbs (Fig.3). The TH AP-1 complex was identified as a single band. Competition assays demonstrated that this binding activity was completely blocked by excess cold AP-1 probe. Also, the AP-1 binding activity was blocked by excess cold TH CRE probe. Compared with the normal olfactory bulb, nuclear extracts from the odor-deprived olfactory bulb showed a 32% decrease (mean optical density in arbitrary units ± S.E.: ipsilateral, 0.094 ± 0.003versus contralateral, 0.140 ± 0.006; p< 0.003, n = 5) in AP-1 binding activity in parallel with the decline in Fos protein found immunocytochemically. Interactions of nuclear extracts with the TH CRE probe produced two DNA-protein complexes with distinctive migration rates during gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). The intensity of the lower band was higher than the upper band. As predicted, excess cold CRE probe abolished the CRE binding activity. Excess cold AP-1 probe only partially blocked the CRE/protein binding. In contrast to the AP-1 binding activity which was down-regulated by odor deprivation and in agreement with the immunocytochemical findings, CRE binding activity remained unchanged with differing olfactory experience. Supershift assays were performed to identify the nuclear proteins that formed complexes with TH AP-1 and CRE motifs. Polyclonal antibodies for c-Fos, Fos-B, Jun-D, CREB, and CREM were used to examine the AP-1 complex. Antibodies for Fos-B and Jun-D produced a shift of the AP-1 complex to species with lower migration rates (Fig. 4). Fos-B antibody shifted the whole AP-1 complex, whereas the Jun-D antibody shifted a major portion of the complex. Relative to the control, the Fos-B- as well as the Jun-D-associated binding activities decreased in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the naris closure. In contrast, antibodies for c-Fos, CREB, or CREM did not produce a supershift from the AP-1 complex (Fig. 4). Antibodies for CREB, CREM, Fos-B, and Jun-D, but not c-Fos, supershifted the CRE-protein complexes (Fig.5). Although the CREB antibody was somewhat more efficient than the CREM antibody, they produced similar supershift patterns retarding all of the upper band and part of the lower band. The antibody for Fos-B supershifted part of the lower band, resulting in a band overlapping the original upper band. The Jun-D antibody supershifted only a small portion of the CRE complexes (Fig.5). Finally, c-Fos antibodies did not retard the CRE-binding complexes. Western blot analyses were performed to demonstrate the specificity of polyclonal antibodies that produced retardation in the supershift studies. Fos-B antibody recognized a protein with a molecular mass of 40–42 kDa (Fig.6). Consistent with the immunocytochemical findings and gel retardation assays, Fos-B immunoreactivity decreased in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the closed naris. The Fos-B antibody also recognized two polypeptides with molecular masses of 27 and 14 kDa. These two polypeptides might represent alternative splicing products of the Fos-B gene and/or proteolytic products of the Fos-B protein. The Fos-B antibody did not recognize c-Fos, which in mouse had a molecular mass of 56 kDa when detected with several c-Fos antibodies (data not shown). The Jun-D antibody recognized a doublet with molecular masses of 39 and 43 kDa. The CREB antibody recognized a 45-kDa polypeptide, and the CREM antibody recognized 44- and 32-kDa polypeptides. Regulation of TH gene expression in the rodent olfactory bulb displayed unique activity dependence (30Baker H. Kawano T. Margolis F.L. Joh T.H. J.

TH expression was rapidly down-regulated following unilateral naris closure, a procedure that prevents odorant access to the olfactory receptor epithelium resulting in reduced stimulation of the olfactory bulb. Previous studies revealed both cell line- (27Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15689-15695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Lazaroff M. Patankar S.

Brain Res. 1993; 17: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 55Min N. Joh T.H. Kim K.S. Peng C. Son J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting differences in either expression or binding of transcription factors to specific cis-acting elements. The current study investigated the composition and specificity of binding complexes with putative AP-1 and CRE sites in the regulation of TH gene expression in the olfactory bulb. The present study demonstrated that Fos-B, CREB, pCREB, and Jun-D are present in the periglomerular cells of the glomerular layer and likely colocalize with TH as previously shown for c-Fos (41Guthrie K.M. Gall C.M. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 42Jin B.K. Franzen L. Baker H. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1996; 14: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that Fos expression reflects neuronal activity, both c-Fos and Fos-B immunoreactivities were down-regulated in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the naris closure. The parallel reductions in Fos proteins and TH suggested that these two IEGs may be involved in TH gene regulation in an activity-dependent manner. In contrast, naris closure had no effect on immunoreactivities for either Jun-D or CREB and may actually have induced pCREB. The presence of these IEGs may be necessary for the activation of cis-acting elements in the TH gene promoter, but may not directly induce TH gene expression. Thus, the unique expression of the IEGs in the glomerular layer suggested that they may play different roles in regulating gene expression in these dopaminergic neurons. Gel mobility shift assays in the present study revealed that Fos-B is the only member of the Fos family present in the TH AP-1-protein complex in the olfactory bulb. Fos-B may form heterodimers with both Jun-D and other members of the Jun family because Jun-D antibody only partially supershifts the AP-1-protein complex. The specificity of the TH AP-1 motif for Fos-B may result from the specific 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the AP-1 sequence, previously shown to be critical for binding activity (20Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription factor affinity with cis-acting elements mediates in part the differential promoter sensitivity of genes to the same extracellular signals. The reductions in the TH AP-1 binding activity and Fos-B immunoreactivity, shown in tissue staining and Western blots in the naris-closed olfactory bulb, suggest a significant role of Fos-B in the TH gene regulation in this brain region. Although c-Fos is present in the periglomerular neurons and down-regulated by naris closure, this IEG product does not appear to contribute to the TH AP-1-protein complex. The Western blot analyses showing that the Fos-B antibody does not cross-react with c-Fos, which has a molecular mass of 56 kDa, further supports the concept that Fos-B, but not c-Fos, may be involved in down-regulation of the TH gene in periglomerular dopaminergic neurons in the naris-closed olfactory bulb. The absence of c-Fos in the TH AP-1-protein complex in the olfactory bulb may reflect tissue specificity of TH gene regulation and/or differential affinities of the Fos proteins with the TH AP-1 motif. It has been recently reported that the AP-1 motif is involved in the induction of TH gene transcription by reserpine treatment in the rat adrenal medulla but not in the sympathetic ganglia, suggesting tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms for this gene (56Trocme C. Mallet J. Biguet N.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell line specificity of TH gene transcription also was shown to involve the AP-1 motif (51Lazaroff M. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the inability to detect c-Fos in the DNA-protein complex may be because of low affinity of this IEG product with the TH AP-1 motif. It is possible that c-Fos can bind to the TH AP-1 motif only when it is overexpressed. Both c-Fos and Fos-B expression as well as AP-1 binding activity can be increased by activation of glutamate receptors in the brain (57Sonnenberg J.L. Mitchelmore C. MacGregor-Leon P.F. Hempstead J. Morgan J.I. Curran T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and by nerve growth factor treatment in PC12 cells (58Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, c-Fos was identified in the TH AP-1-protein complex shortly after growth factor treatment, but it was replaced gradually by Fos-B which was induced by prolonged treatment (58Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating a transient effect of c-Fos and a long-lasting effect of Fos-B on TH gene transcription. Indeed, Fos-B and Fos-B-like proteins have been implicated in the long-term biochemical adaptations observed following chronic treatment (59Chen J. Nye H.E. Kelz M.B. Hiroi N. Nakabeppu Y. Hope B.T. Nestler E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 880-889PubMed Google Scholar, 60Hope B.T. Nye H.E. Kelz M.B. Self D.W. Iadarola M.J. Nakabeppu Y. Duman R.S. Nestler E.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1235-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In sum, the demonstration that the AP-1-protein complex is composed primarily of Fos-B and Jun proteins in the adult mouse olfactory bulb suggests that Fos-B may play an essential role in the TH gene regulation in this brain region. The present study demonstrated that excess TH CRE oligonucleotide completely blocked TH AP-1 binding activity. One explanation for this finding is that the TH CRE is also the binding site for the protein complexes in the olfactory bulb extracts that bind to TH AP-1,e.g. Fos/Jun. This competition for transcription factors may occur because the consensus AP-1 and CRE motifs in many genes including TH are very similar in structure, displaying only one nucleotide difference. However, note that the putative TH AP-1 motif differs from that in other genes by one nucleotide located in the middle of the sequence (24Harrington C.A. Lewis E.J. Krzemien D. Chikaraishi D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2363-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that CRE competes with AP-1 for only certain components that are essential to formation of AP-1-protein complexes. For instance, binding of Jun/CREB to the excess CRE added to the binding reaction might deplete free Jun, thus resulting in a decrease in availability of Fos/Jun complexes. Jun proteins were localized to complexes binding to CRE sequences presumably as Jun/Jun homodimers and/or Jun/CREB heterodimers (16Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 18Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that CREB was present in the AP-1-protein complex (19Pennypacker K.R. Hudson P.M. Hong J.S. McMillian M.K. Dev. Brain Res. 1995; 86: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The finding that AP-1 oligonucleotide partially blocks CRE binding activity suggested that some proteins such as CREB and CREM only bind to the TH CRE. In contrast, the supershift assays show that Fos-B/Jun heterodimers bound both TH AP-1 and CRE sequences. Although the effect of binding of Fos-B/Jun to CRE motif on the TH promoter activity is unknown, the ability of this protein complex to bind to both TH AP-1 and CRE motifs suggests cross-talk between these two cis-acting elements. The present studies also suggested that the CRE motif may play only a minor role in TH down-regulation in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to naris closure. The gel shift assays revealed no detectable change in CRE binding activity between the normal and naris-closed olfactory bulbs. Whereas gel supershift assays showed that CREB/CREM proteins are major components of the TH/CRE protein complexes, immunocytochemistry confirmed the binding data that CREB was unchanged in response to naris closure. Although CREB, thought to constitutively bind to the CRE motif, can be activated upon phosphorylation (12Dey A. Nebert D.W. Ozato K. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 15Lamph W.W. Dwarki V.J. Ofir R. Montminy M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4320-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), pCREB was, if anything, variably increased in response to naris closure. Although Fos-B/Jun-D are present in the CRE-protein complexes, they represent only minor components. Therefore, it is unlikely that naris closure reduces TH expression in the periglomerular neurons primarily through the CRE motif. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated unique activity-dependent expression of immediate early genes in the glomerular layer of mouse olfactory bulb. Fos proteins exhibited reduced immunoreactivities in the periglomerular neurons in the olfactory bulb ipsilateral to the naris closure. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated a decrease in the TH AP-1 binding activity. Fos-B was found to be a major component of the TH AP-1-protein complexes and a minor component of the CRE-protein complexes, suggesting that Fos-B may be involved in the activity-dependent gene regulation of TH in the olfactory dopaminergic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2019562364,"The objective of the current study was to examine the functional importance of the N-terminal domains of surfactant protein A (SP-A) including the N-terminal segment from Asn1 to Ala7 (denoted domain 1), the N-terminal portion of the collagen domain from Gly8 to Gly44 (domain 2), and the C-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain from Gly45 to Pro80(domain 3). Wild type recombinant SP-A (SP-Ahyp; where hyp indicates hydroxyproline-deficient) and truncated mutant (TM) SP-As containing deletions of domain(s) 1 (TM1), 2 (TM2), 1 and 2 (TM1–2), and 1, 2, and 3 (TM1–2-3) were synthesized in insect cells and purified by mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography. N-terminal disulfide-dependent dimerization was preserved at near wild type levels in the TM1–2 (at Cys−1) and TM2 proteins (at Cys−1 and Cys6), and to a lesser extent in TM1 (at Cys−1), but not in TM1–2-3. Cross-linking analyses demonstrated that the neck + CRD was sufficient for assembly of monomers into noncovalent trimers and that the N-terminal segment was required for the association of trimers to form higher oligomers. All TM proteins except TM1–2-3 bound to phospholipid, but only the N-terminal segment containing TM proteins aggregated phospholipid vesicles. The TM1, TM1–2, and TM2 but not the TM1–2-3 inhibited the secretion of surfactant from type II cells as effectively as SP-Ahyp, but the inhibitory activity of each mutant was blocked by excess α-methylmannoside and therefore nonspecific. TM1 and TM1–2-3 did not enhance the uptake of phospholipids by isolated type II cells, but the TM1–2 and TM2 had activities that were 72 and 83% of SP-Ahyp, respectively. We conclude the following for SP-A: 1) trimerization does not require the collagen-like region or interchain disulfide linkage; 2) the N-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain is required for specific inhibition of surfactant secretion but not for binding to liposomes or for enhanced uptake of phospholipids into type II cells; 3) N-terminal interchain disulfide linkage can functionally replace the N-terminal segment for lipid binding, receptor binding, and enhancement of lipid uptake; 4) the N-terminal segment is required for the association of trimeric subunits into higher oligomers, for phospholipid aggregation, and for specific inhibition of surfactant secretion and cannot be functionally replaced by disulfide linkage alone for these activities. The objective of the current study was to examine the functional importance of the N-terminal domains of surfactant protein A (SP-A) including the N-terminal segment from Asn1 to Ala7 (denoted domain 1), the N-terminal portion of the collagen domain from Gly8 to Gly44 (domain 2), and the C-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain from Gly45 to Pro80(domain 3). Wild type recombinant SP-A (SP-Ahyp; where hyp indicates hydroxyproline-deficient) and truncated mutant (TM) SP-As containing deletions of domain(s) 1 (TM1), 2 (TM2), 1 and 2 (TM1–2), and 1, 2, and 3 (TM1–2-3) were synthesized in insect cells and purified by mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography. N-terminal disulfide-dependent dimerization was preserved at near wild type levels in the TM1–2 (at Cys−1) and TM2 proteins (at Cys−1 and Cys6), and to a lesser extent in TM1 (at Cys−1), but not in TM1–2-3. Cross-linking analyses demonstrated that the neck + CRD was sufficient for assembly of monomers into noncovalent trimers and that the N-terminal segment was required for the association of trimers to form higher oligomers. All TM proteins except TM1–2-3 bound to phospholipid, but only the N-terminal segment containing TM proteins aggregated phospholipid vesicles. The TM1, TM1–2, and TM2 but not the TM1–2-3 inhibited the secretion of surfactant from type II cells as effectively as SP-Ahyp, but the inhibitory activity of each mutant was blocked by excess α-methylmannoside and therefore nonspecific. TM1 and TM1–2-3 did not enhance the uptake of phospholipids by isolated type II cells, but the TM1–2 and TM2 had activities that were 72 and 83% of SP-Ahyp, respectively. We conclude the following for SP-A: 1) trimerization does not require the collagen-like region or interchain disulfide linkage; 2) the N-terminal portion of the collagen-like domain is required for specific inhibition of surfactant secretion but not for binding to liposomes or for enhanced uptake of phospholipids into type II cells; 3) N-terminal interchain disulfide linkage can functionally replace the N-terminal segment for lipid binding, receptor binding, and enhancement of lipid uptake; 4) the N-terminal segment is required for the association of trimeric subunits into higher oligomers, for phospholipid aggregation, and for specific inhibition of surfactant secretion and cannot be functionally replaced by disulfide linkage alone for these activities. Pulmonary surfactant lines the distal airspaces and stabilizes the gas exchanging alveolar units of the lung by reducing surface tension (1Goerke J. Clements J.A. Handbook of Physiology. 3. American Physiological Society, Bethesda1986: 247-261Google Scholar). Surfactant is composed of phospholipids and proteins that are organized as lattice-like arrays (e.g. tubular myelin) and vesicular aggregates within the alveolar lining fluid, and as a film at the alveolar air-liquid interface. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) 1The abbreviations used are: SP-A, surfactant protein A; TM, truncated mutant; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; IKC, isoleucine-lysine-cysteine; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; DPPC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a hydrophilic, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that is secreted into the airspace by alveolar type II cells (2King R.J.

The function of SP-A is not fully understood, but reports that SP-A binds to a high affinity receptor on the surface of alveolar type II cells (3Wright J.R. Borchelt J.D. Hawgood S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The notion that SP-A is also a pulmonary host defense protein is supported by membership in the structurally homologous collectin family of antibody-independent opsonins (including mannose-binding protein A) (9Drickamer K.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1143-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), reports that SP-A binds to, aggregates, and opsonizes multiple microorganisms (for review see Ref. 11McCormack F.X.

Rat SP-A is a large oligomer composed of 18 very similar subunits that are distinguished by variable glycosylation at one or bothN-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (13Whitsett J.A. Ross G.

The latter most probably arises by alternative site cleavage by signal peptidase, which results in a slightly elongated variant containing an Ile-Lys-Cys (IKC) sequence upstream of the predicted N terminus of Asn1(15Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the SP-A subunits are otherwise identical, composed of several discrete domains including the following (16White R.T. Damm D. Miller J. Spratt K. Schilling J. Hawgood S.

Trimeric association of monomeric subunits occurs by the folding of the collagen-like domains into triple helices (18King R.J. Simon D. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The role of the neck domain in the oligomeric assembly of SP-A has not been reported, but in related collectins, the formation of α-helical coiled coil bundles in this region is critical for trimerization (19Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fully assembled SP-A is a hexamer of trimers that are laterally associated through the N-terminal segment and the first half of the collagen-like domain and stabilized by inter- and intratrimeric interchain disulfide bonds at Cys−1 and Cys6 (18King R.J. Simon D. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Voss T. Eistetter H. Schafer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The domains of SP-A that interact with type II cells and surfactant phospholipids have been mapped by site-directed mutagenesis. The CRD of the molecule contains binding sites for carbohydrate, the major surface glycoprotein of the pulmonary pathogen Pneumocystis carinii, the high affinity SP-A receptor on type II cells, and surfactant phospholipids, especially dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (21McCormack F.X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29785-29792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the N-terminal domains that contribute to oligomeric assembly, including the interchain disulfide bond at Cys6 and the collagen-like region, are essential for SP-A function (25McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The collagen-like region was required for competitive binding to the SP-A receptor and the specific inhibition of surfactant secretion from type II cells. Disruption of the Cys6 interchain disulfide bond, by substitution of serine for cysteine, blocked the aggregation of liposomes by SP-A and reduced the inhibitory effect of SP-A on surfactant secretion from isolated alveolar type II cells. Recent analyses indicate that the N-terminal IKC sequence, and specifically the interchain disulfide-forming cysteine at Cys−1, is not essential for the interactions of SP-A with type II cell or surfactant phospholipids (26Zhang M. Damodarasamy M. Elhalwagi B.M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16481-16488Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used truncated mutant forms of SP-A to examine the role of the N-terminal segment and defined regions of the collagen-like domain in oligomeric assembly, phospholipid binding and aggregation, and SP-A receptor-mediated functions. The synthesis of the mutant recombinant proteins TM1, TM2–3, and TM1–2-3 has been previously reported (15Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The TM2 protein was generated by similar methods. Briefly, the TM2 mutant cDNA encoding the deletion of amino acids Gly8-Gly44 of rat SP-A was produced using mutagenic oligonucleotides by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 1.6-kilobase pair rat SP-A cDNA (27Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar, 28Sano K. Fisher J. Mason R.J. Kuroki Y. Schilling J. Benson B. Voelker D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The TM2 cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of PVL 1392 (Invitrogen), and the correct orientation was confirmed using KpnI. Nucleotide sequencing of the Gly8-Gly44 coding region of the TM2 cDNA confirmed the intended deletion and the absence of spurious mutations (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). A recombinant baculovirus containing the TM2 cDNA for SP-A was produced by homologous recombination in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells following contransfection with linear viral DNA and the PVL 1392/TM2 construct (BaculoGold, PharMingen). Fresh monolayers of 107 Trichoplusia ni(T. ni) cells were infected with plaque-purified recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and then incubated with serum-free media (IPL-41) supplemented with 0.4 mm ascorbic acid and antibiotics for 72 h. Recombinant SP-A was purified from the culture media by adsorption to mannose-Sepharose 6B columns in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ and elution with 2 mm EDTA (30Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant SP-A was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and stored at −0 °C. Surfactant was isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage of silica-pretreated Sprague-Dawley rats (31Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and floated on NaBr gradients (32Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 33Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A was isolated and purified from the surfactant pellicle by delipidation, mannose-Sepharose affinity chromatography (30Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and gel permeation chromatography with Bio-Gel A-5m. The SP-A content of tissue culture media containing recombinant SP-A was determined with a rabbit polyclonal IgG against rat SP-A using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (34McCormack F.X. Fisher J.H. Suwabe A. Smith D.L. Shannon J.M. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay was 0.20 ng/ml, and the linear range extended from 0.16 to 10.0 ng/ml. Routine protein concentrations were determined with the bicinchoninic protein assay kit (BCA) (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The effects of mutations on the oligomeric structure of the recombinant proteins were assessed by chemical cross-linking. Variant SP-As (10 μg) were incubated with the 5 mm disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Pierce) in 20 mm HEPES containing 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.15m NaCl, and 100 mm KCl at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of reducing sample buffer, and the proteins were size-fractionated on 8–16% gradient SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. Experiments to assess the effect of N-terminal deletions on the SP-A-mediated inhibition of surfactant secretion were performed as described previously (14McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, alveolar type II cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by tissue dissociation with elastase and purification on metrizamide gradients (35Dobbs L.G. Mason R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The type II cells were seeded into tissue culture flasks and incubated overnight in [3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum (D10) at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. After washing, SP-A variants were tested for their ability to antagonize 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10−7m)-stimulated surfactant secretion by coincubation with the monolayer for 3 h. In some experiments, 0.125 mα-methylmannoside was added simultaneously with the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and SP-A to determine if the SP-A effect was reversible with excess monosaccharides. Secretion was measured using [3H]phosphatidylcholine (PC) as a marker for surfactant and expressed as percent secretion (radioactivity in the media/radioactivity in the cells + media). A whole cell competitive binding assay was performed to determine the ability of various recombinant forms of SP-A to compete with 125I-rat SP-A for receptor occupancy on the surface of isolated type II cells (36Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17596-17602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following isolation, 2 × 106 type II cells/35-mm dish were incubated overnight in D10 at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. The following morning, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing the monolayers three times at 4 °C with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The monolayers were then incubated with 1 μg/ml 125I-rat SP-A and various recombinant SP-As in D10 for 3 h at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. After washing three times on ice with buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA, the cells were solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was quantified in a gamma radiation counter. Liposome binding and aggregation experiments were performed using lipids purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, as described previously (14McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unilamellar vesicles were produced by probe sonication of lipid mixtures composed of DPPC:egg PC:phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 9:3:2, and equilibrated with SP-As (lipid:protein ratio 20:1 by weight) in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl buffer (buffer A) at 20 °C. Aggregation was determined by measuring light scattering (A 400 nm) at 1-min intervals after the addition of 5 mm Ca2+ (final). For lipid binding, multilamellar liposomes produced by vigorous vortexing of the same lipid mixture were incubated with 10 μg/ml SP-A (lipid:protein ratio 50:1) in buffer A containing 2.0% BSA and 5 mmCa2+. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g av for 10 min and washed once, and the SP-A content of the pellet and pooled supernatant fractions were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Percent binding was defined as SP-Apellet/(SP-Apellet + supernatant) × 100. Control experiments in which liposomes or Ca2+ were individually deleted were also performed. Uptake of phospholipid liposomes by type II cells was performed according to the method of Wright et al. (37Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (38McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated alveolar type II cells (1 × 106/tube) were incubated with unilamellar liposomes (100 μg/ml) composed of [3H]DPPC (1600 cpm/nmol):egg PC:PG, 7:2:1, and SP-A variants in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C. The media and cells were separated by centrifugation at 160 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml BSA. An additional volume of 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was added to each tube, and the cells and media were transferred to separate liquid scintillation vials and counted. Percent uptake was calculated according to the equation: [3H]DPPCcells/([3H]DPPCcells+ 3[H]DPPCmedia) × 100. The structures of the mutant recombinant proteins used in this study are shown in Fig.1. Recombinant SP-A that is overproduced in insect cells has functional characteristics that are comparable to the natural protein, despite incomplete hydroxylation of prolines in the collagen-like region (designated “hyp” for hydroxyproline-deficient) (14McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the purposes of this study we have designated the domains of SP-A from N to C terminus as the follows: I-K-C domain, domain 1 (N-terminal segment), domain 2 (N-terminal half of the collagen-like domain), domain 3 (C-terminal half of the collagen-like domain), neck, and CRD. The synthesis and physical characterization of the mutant recombinant SP-As containing telescoping deletions from Asn1 through the end of the N-terminal segment (TM1 or ΔAsn1-Ala7), the midpoint of the collagen-like region (TM1–2 or ΔAsn1-Gly44), and end of the collagen region (TM1–2-3 or ΔAsn1-Pro80) have been previously reported (15Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For this study, an additional mutant SP-A containing a nested deletion of the proximal collagen-like region (TM2 or ΔGly8-Gly44) was produced using similar methods. The TM2 migrated slightly more rapidly than the SP-Ahyp on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions, consistent with the deletion of 37 amino acids (Fig.2). Like the SP-Ahyp, the TM2 formed disulfide-linked multimers at least as large as tetramers under non-reducing conditions. This migration profile is consistent with interchain disulfide bond formation at both sulfhydryls which are available for interchain linkage, at Cys−1 and Cys6. We have previously reported that disulfide bond formation at Cys−1 in TM1 and TM1–2 results in 17 and 51% dimers, respectively, based on densitometry of nonreducing SDS-PAGE gels. SP-Ahyp, by comparison, is 60% dimers and higher oligomers (15Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The TM1–2-3 is monomeric due to the near-absence of the Cys−1-containing tripeptide sequence at the N terminus (<3% of polypeptide chains), presumably because the mutations introduced lead to exclusive signal peptidase cleavage site at the Cys−1-Ala81 bond rather than the alternative site cleavage that occurs in SP-Ahyp, TM1, and TM1–2 (15Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The preservation of partial and near wild type levels of Cys−1-dependent disulfide cross-linking at the N terminus of TM1 and TM1–2, respectively, allows for evaluation of the functional consequences of the peptide sequence deletions that are distinct from those that are due to loss of covalent interchain linkage. Noncovalent interactions that also contribute to the assembly of the SP-A oligomer were analyzed by DSG cross-linking, and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Treatment of the SP-Ahyp with DSG followed by size fractionation on reducing SDS-PAGE resulted in the appearance of a series of 8–9 distinct bands, indicating that the same number of polypeptide chains were closely associated in the soluble protein, most likely as three trimers. Previously reported gel filtration chromatography data are also consistent with nonameric assembly of SP-Ahyp (25McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cross-linking analyses further revealed that the TM1–2-3 was a noncovalent trimer, demonstrating that collagen-like region and interchain disulfide bond formation are not required for triple-stranded folding of SP-A during synthesis or to maintain the association of three chains in the fully processed protein. The TM1 and TM1–2 did not form detectable oligomers greater than trimers, but the TM2 was at least hexameric. These results indicate that N-terminal interchain disulfide linkage is not sufficient for the association of trimers and that either the N-terminal segment itself or two interchain bridge-forming cysteines are required for the interaction. We have recently reported that individual disruption of Cys6 or Cys−1 by substitution with Ser did not prevent the assembly of large SP-A oligomers, based on cross-linking analyses 2F. X. McCormack, unpublished data. and gel exclusion chromatography (25McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16481-16488Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the neck + CRD are sufficient for trimerization of SP-A, and that the N-terminal segment plays an important role in the association of trimeric subunits in solution that is not solely attributable to disulfide bond formation.Figure 2Electrophoretic analysis of TM2 SP-A.Rat SP-A, wild type recombinant SP-A (SPAhyp), and TM2 SP-As were subjected to 8–16% SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. hyp, hydroxyproline-deficient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Cross-linking analysis of oligomeric association of polypeptide chains of TM SP-As.

Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding was defined by subtracting Ca2+-independent sedimentation of SP-A (i.e. in the presence of EDTA) from total Ca2+-dependent binding. As shown in Fig.4, 53.8 ± 2.2% of SP-Ahyp specifically bound to the liposomes, compared with 32.2 ± 2.5% of TM1 and 43.8 ± 1.6% of TM1–2. The TM2 protein exhibited wild type levels of phospholipid binding activity (54.5 ± 2.6%), but binding by TM1–2-3 was negligible (2.1 ± 1.3%). We have previously reported that the binding of TM2–3 to lipid is about half that of SP-Ahyp (25McCormack F.X. Pattanajitvilai S. Stewart J. Possmayer F. Inchley K. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data indicate that domain 2 of SP-A does not contribute to lipid binding and that domain 3 is required for wild type levels of lipid binding activity. The finding that TM1–2 bound to lipid approximately 80% as effectively as SP-Ahyp demonstrates that N-terminal disulfide linkage can functionally replace the N-terminal segment with respect to lipid binding. We have previously determined that the Cys6 interchain disulfide bond but not the collagen-like domain of rat SP-A is required for aggregation of phospholipid liposomes (25McCormack F.X.

https://openalex.org/W2058036485,"Pituitary tumor-transforming gene (PTTG) is a recently characterized proto-oncogene that is expressed specifically in adult testis. In this study, we have used <i>in situ</i>hybridization and developmental Northern blot assays to demonstrate that PTTG mRNA is expressed stage-specifically in spermatocytes and spermatids during rat spermatogenic cycle. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with PTTG in testicular cells. Two positive clones were characterized. One of the clones is the ribosomal protein S10, the other encodes a novel human DnaJ homologue designated HSJ2. Northern blot analysis showed that testis contains higher levels of HSJ2 mRNA than other tissues examined, and the expression pattern of HSJ2 mRNA in postnatal rat testis is similar to PTTG. S10 mRNA levels do not vary remarkably among different tissues and remains unchanged during testicular germ cell differentiation. <i>In vitro</i> binding assays demonstrated that both S10 and HSJ2 bind to PTTG specifically and that PTTG can be co-immunoprecipitated with S10 and HSJ2 from transfected cells. Moreover, the binding sites for both proteins were located within the C-terminal 75 amino acids of the PTTG protein. These results suggest that PTTG may play a role in spermatogenesis."

Upon exposure to insulin, IRS-1 phosphorylation increased by 12-fold in both the Mut and WT cells. IRS-2 was constitutively phosphorylated in Mut cells and not further phosphorylated by insulin. The maximal phosphorylation of IRS-2 in basal Mut cells was paralleled by a 4-fold increased binding of the kinase regulatory loop binding domain of IRS-2 to the Arg1152 → Gln receptor. Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase association to IRS-1 and IRS-2 reflected the phosphorylation levels of the two IRSs. Mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and [3H]thymidine incorporation closely correlated with IRS-1 phosphorylation in Mut and WT cells, while glycogen synthesis and synthase activity correlated with IRS-2 phosphorylation. The Arg1152 → Gln mutant did not signal Shc phosphorylation or Shc-Grb2 association in intact L6 cells, while binding Shc in a yeast two-hybrid system and phosphorylating Shc in vitro. Thus, IRS-2 appears to mediate insulin regulation of glucose storage in Mut cells, while insulin-stimulated mitogenesis correlates with the activation of the IRS-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in these cells. IRS-1 and Shc-mediated mitogenesis may be redundant in muscle cells.

Similar to IRS-1, the oncoprotein Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor followed by binding to Grb2·SOS and MAP kinase activation (13Yonezawa K. Ando A. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R.

Therefore, IRS-1 and Shc represent distinct links conveying insulin signal through the MAP kinase machinery and evoking proliferative responses. In Rat1 fibroblasts expressing human insulin receptors (15Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in other cells, most SOS guanylnucleotide exchange activity co-precipitated with Shc rather than IRS-1, suggesting a major role of Shc in Ras activation by insulin. However, in 32-D cells expressing insulin receptors, MAP kinase activation by insulin requires Grb2 binding to IRS-1 (16Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Zang Y. Yenush L. Shlessinger J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative role of IRS-1 and Shc in mediating proliferative response through the Ras·MAP kinase cascade remains controversial and may be cell- and tissue-specific. IRS-2 is another cellular substrate for the insulin receptor kinase, which has been more recently identified in liver and skeletal muscle cells (17Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). IRS-2 shares many structural features with IRS-1 (2Kahn C.R. Alberti K.G.M.M. Zimmet P.

In IRS-1 knock-out mice, IRS-2 phosphorylation is substantially increased as compared with the wild-type animals, suggesting that this increase may compensate for the lack of IRS-1 thus improving insulin action on glucose metabolism (20Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Yamamoto-Honda R. Takahashi Y. Yoshizawa F. Aizawa S. Akanuma Y. Sonenberg N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3074-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been reported that IRS-2 mediates insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 in a fashion similar to IRS-1(2, 3). However, whether each of these two substrates specializes in mediating certain insulin bioeffects or whether they are largely redundant into the cells has not been conclusively established. Additionally, it remains unclear whether variability exists in the relative role of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in mediating insulin action in the different target tissues. In the present report, we have studied insulin signaling in L6 skeletal muscle cells expressing the IR1152 insulin receptor. This mutant receptor maximally activates metabolic responses, preventing further insulin stimulation, but normally transduces insulin mitogenic signals. In addition, as we show in this work, IR1152differentially phosphorylates IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc, enabling us to address their relative function in mediating proliferative and metabolic signals in skeletal muscle, a major insulin-responsive tissue. L6 cell clones expressing 3 × 103 insulin receptors were selected and transfected with either the mutant IR1152 or the wild-type insulin receptors and have been previously characterized and described (21Caruso M. Miele C. Formisano P. Condorelli G. Bifulco G. Oliva A. Auricchio R. Riccardi G. Capaldo B. Beguinot F. J. Biol.

In the present study, two clones of transfected cells expressing 3.2 × 104 or 9 × 103 wild-type IRs/cell and 3.1 × 104 or 9.5 × 103 mutant IRs/cell were used. At these low levels, overexpression of wild-type receptors in L6 as in other cells (22Maegawa H. McClain D.A. Freidenberg G. Olefsky J.M. Napier M. Lipari T. Dull T.J. Lee J. Ullrigh A. J. Biol.

However, a 3–10-fold decrease in the ED50 for insulin effect on IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation and on glycogen synthase activity and thymidine incorporation could be consistently detected (Table I).

Precipitated proteins were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose and the immobilized proteins further incubated with wild-type or mutant insulin receptors (250 fmol/assay). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 2 mm CTP, 2 μm ATP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.02% Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.02 μm[γ-32P]ATP (final concentrations), and prolonged for 30 min at 22 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Lysates were prepared from L6 skeletal muscle cells expressing the constitutively active Arg1152 → Gln insulin receptors (Mut cells) (21Caruso M. Miele C. Formisano P. Condorelli G. Bifulco G. Oliva A. Auricchio R. Riccardi G. Capaldo B. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7290-7297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of these lysates (Mut1 cell clone, 3.1 × 104 IR/cells) with IRS-1 Abs followed by blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies (Tyr(P) Abs) revealed a slight increase (35%, p < 0.001) in basal IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation as compared with lysates from control cells, either those expressing a comparable number of wild-type hIRs or those from parental cells (WT, L6 cells, respectively; Fig. 1, top panel). A 20% basal increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation was also detectable in cells expressing smaller number of mutant receptors (Mut3; 9 × 103 receptors/cell;p < 0.05). Exposure to insulin produced a similar 10–12-fold increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation in all of the cell lines. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRSs bind different SH2 proteins, including the Grb2 adaptor and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, which propagate insulin signal (2Kahn C.R. Alberti K.G.M.M. Zimmet P. DeFronzo R.A. International Textbook of Diabetes Mellitus. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 437-467Google Scholar, 3White M.F.

In parallel with IRS-1 phosphorylation, Grb2 co-precipitation with IRS-1 was also slightly increased in Mut as compared with WT cells (Fig. 1, middle panel, p < 0.05). Likewise, recovery of PI 3-kinase activity in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitates was 20–30% increased in cells expressing IR1152 (Fig. 1,bottom panel, p < 0.001). After insulin addition to both WT and Mut cells, Grb2 association with IRS-1 and IRS-1-bound PI 3-kinase were stimulated by almost 3-fold. At variance with IRS-1, basal phosphorylation of IRS-2 in Mut cells was constitutively increased by almost 4-fold as compared with control cells (Fig. 2, top panel). These phosphorylation levels were comparable to those of wild-type cells after maximal insulin stimulation. Exposure of Mut cells to insulin concentrations up to 100 nm did not further increase IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, however, while increasing that in control cells by 5-fold. Grb2 co-precipitation with IRS-2 and recovery of PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-2 immunoprecipitates also increased by 4- and 2-fold, respectively, in the insulin-stimulated control cells, while exhibiting high basal levels and no insulin sensitivity in the mutant cells (Fig. 2,middle and bottom panels). It appeared therefore that the IR1152 mutant phosphorylated IRS-1 and 2 and induced their binding to SH2 intracellular proteins differentially both in the absence and in the presence of insulin. This effect could not be ascribed to differences in IRS-1, IRS-2, PI 3-K (Fig.3), or Grb2 (Fig. 7) levels since these were comparable in all of the cell clones analyzed. The relative levels of endogenous, wild-type, and mutant insulin receptors in the cell clones are also shown in Fig. 3. Data similar to those in the L6 cells were also obtained with NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing the mutant and wild-type insulin receptors (data not shown). As in the intact cells,in vitro phosphorylation of immobilized IRS-2 by affinity-purified IRWT showed a 3-fold increase upon insulin addition, while phosphorylation of immobilized IRS-2 by basal IR1152 exhibited a 2.8-fold increase as compared with the wild-type receptors and was not further stimulated by insulin (Fig.4, top panel).In vitro phosphorylation of immobilized IRS-1 by the mutant receptors showed a slight 30% basal increase compared with that by the wild-type receptor (p < 0.05) and was fully phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation, suggesting that the IR1152 mutation mainly enhances the interaction of the receptor with IRS-2. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the ability of IR1152 to bind the kinase regulatory loop binding (KRLB) domain of IRS-2. This insulin receptor binding region has been previously reported to be unique to IRS-2 and not present in IRS-1 (38Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). IRWT and IR1152 were incubated with immobilized GST-IRS-2-KRLB and KRLB-bound receptors were then immunoblotted with insulin receptor antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4(middle panel), almost no wild-type receptors bound to the KRLB domain in basal conditions while insulin activation of these receptors determined a 4-fold increase in KRLB binding. At variance, with the IR1152 mutant, binding to the KRLB domain was already maximal in the absence of insulin and did not further increase upon insulin addition. In this same assay, there was no difference in IR1152 and IRWT binding to the IRS-2 PTB domain (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Thus, the constitutive IR1152 kinase activity toward IRS-2 is accompanied by an enhanced binding of the mutant receptor to the KRLB domain of IRS-2, independent of insulin.Figure 3IR, IRS, and PI 3-kinase levels in Mut cells. The myotubes were lysed and cell proteins separated by SDS-PAGE as described under “Materials and Methods.” Proteins were then blotted using specific IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, or p85 antibodies and revealed by 125I-protein A and autoradiography.

We previously identified one such protein in studies of gastric parietal cells. This protein was referred to as pp66 because it migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The phosphorylation of pp66 is increased by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, and by the PKC activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, in a calcium-independent manner. In this study, we have purified pp66 to homogeneity and cloned the complete open reading frame. GenBankTM searches revealed a 45% homology with theDictyostelium actin-binding protein, coronin, and ∼67% homology with the previously cloned human and bovine coronin-like homologue, p57. pp66 appears to be most highly expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa and in kidney and lung. Confocal microscopic studies of an enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion construct of pp66 in cultured parietal cells and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells indicate that pp66 preferentially localizes in F-actin-rich regions. On the basis of our findings, we propose that pp66 may play an important, PKC-dependent role in regulating membrane/cytoskeletal rearrangements in epithelial cells.

We have tentatively named this protein coroninse, because it appears to be highly expressed in secretory epithelia. Actin-binding proteins play important roles in regulating diverse activities in nonmuscle cells including, for example, cytoskeletal remodeling, signal transduction, cell adhesion, migration, and motility (see Refs. 1Ayscough K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 1: 102-111Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 438-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Holt M.R.

Coronin, which is expressed by the unicellular eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum (4De Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), is one such protein. There is compelling evidence that coronin is involved in the regulation of variety of actin-associated activities inDictyostelium, including phagocytosis, cytokenesis, and cellular locomotion (5Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Coronin translocates into the phagocytic cup region during phagocytosis and is recruited to the leading edge of newly formed cell processes in migrating cells (4De Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Gerisch G. Albrecht R. Heizer C. Hodgkinson S. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1280-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, in coronin null mutants, the rate of phagocytosis is reduced by ∼70% (6Maniak M. Rauchenberger R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Cell. 1995; 83: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and these mutants also exhibit reduced chemotaxis and motility (7de Hostos E.L. Rehfueß C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Since Dictyostelium takes up all nutrients by endocytosis and since coronin has been found to be present in the actin-coated, endosomal phagocytic compartment that also contains V-type H+-ATPase subunits and Rab proteins, it has been suggested that coronin also plays a role in regulating endocytotic processes (8Rauchenberger R. Hacker U. Murphy J. Niewohner J. Maniak M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 215-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, a mammalian homologue of coronin, p57, was isolated from calf thymocytes as a 57-kDa contaminant of phospholipase C-containing cellular fractions (9Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of cDNA from both the human peripheral blood leukocyte HL60 cell line and bovine spleen indicated ∼40% homology between p57 and coronin. p57, which is also referred to as mammalian coronin, appears to be highly conserved among mammalian species, with 95% identity between the human and bovine homologues (9Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the function of p57 has not been defined, the homology between coronin and p57 and the observation that p57 co-precipitates with F-actin in vitro has prompted Suzuki and colleagues (9Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to propose that this protein may also play a role in regulating cell migration and motility. Western blot analyses have shown that p57 is highly expressed in immune tissues but weakly expressed in lung and intestine. There is also little to no detectable expression of p57 in stomach, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle (9Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, a 57-kDa protein in neutrophils was found to bind to the COOH-terminal region of the oxidase-specific protein, p40phox, and to accumulate around phagocytic cups. On the basis of partial peptide sequence analysis, this protein was identified as the human coronin homologue, p57 (10Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J. Segal A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mammalian p57 protein may, like coronin in Dictyostelium, play an important role in regulating phagocytosis in the mammalian immune system. In the present study, we report the isolation, cloning, and characterization of a new mammalian coronin family member, which we have named coroninse because, in contrast to p57, it is highly expressed in a variety of secretory-type epithelial tissues including stomach, intestine, kidney, and lung. Coroninse contains numerous PKC phosphorylation consensus sites as well as a putative membrane-spanning region, characteristic of type 1b membrane proteins, near the amino terminus. Interestingly, although this latter region was not previously identified in either coronin or p57, it is highly conserved in all three protein sequences. Coroninse was initially identified as pp66, a cholinergically regulated, PKC-dependent phosphoprotein in the HCl-secreting gastric parietal cell (11Brown M.R. Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G99-G110PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chew C.S. Zhou C.-J. Parente Jr., J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G246-G256PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that pp66/coroninse is primarily located in an intracellular canalicular region of parietal cells, which is the site of active HCl secretion. In the parietal cell, the onset of HCl secretion is correlated with dramatic morphological transformations in which internal tubulovesicles containing the proton-transporting H+,K+-ATPase appear to fuse, by an exocytotic-like process, with the canalicular membrane to form elongated microvilli that extend into the canalicular lumen (13Forte J.G. Yao X. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cessation of secretion is correlated with the endocytotic-like retrieval and return of the H+,K+-ATPase to subcanalicular tubulovesicles (13Forte J.G. Yao X. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because coroninseappears to localize in an intracellular region associated with active membrane fusion/retrieval events and because the phosphorylation of pp66/coroninse is increased by the secretory agonist carbachol, we hypothesize that this novel phosphoprotein may play a role in directing membrane/cytoskeletal rearrangements in the gastric parietal cell. Coroninse might also play a similar role in other ion-transporting secretory epithelial cells such as kidney and lung in which secretion is regulated by exocytotic/endocytotic cycles that direct ion transporters and channels to and from the active sites (14Morris A. Frizzel R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 371-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M. Holliday L.S. Kostrominova T.Y. Lee B.S. Annu. Rev.

A. 1995; 92: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In addition, other data presented in this study indicate that coroninse translocates to the leading edge of actively developing cellular processes. Thus, this novel PKC 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.-dependent phosphoprotein may also play a role in regulating epithelial cell adhesion. Parietal cells were isolated from the gastric mucosae of pathogen-free, male New Zealand White rabbits (2–4 kg) using sequential Pronase/collagenase digestion (17Chew C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 640-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These cells were enriched to 70–85% purity by density gradient separation (Accudenz®, Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY) or to 95–98% purity using combined density gradient separation followed by centrifugal elutriation (17Chew C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 640-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated cells were used for metabolic labeling experiments and for pp66 isolation and purification. For transfection experiments, cells were placed in primary culture by plating on Matrigel®-coated glass coverslips or glass-bottomed 35-mm culture dishes immediately after isolation (18Chew C.S.

In brief, cells were equilibrated in a low bovine serum albumin, phosphate-free incubation medium containing 1.5–2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 90 min, 37 °C. After exposure to various agents as indicated under “Results,” cells were rapidly pelleted, washed once in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed in hot SDS/β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to analytical or preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing; pH 5–8; 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) as described previously (11Brown M.R.

For phosphoamino acid analysis, pp66 was phosphorylated in 32P-labeled parietal cells by maximal stimulation with carbachol (100 μm, 10 min). Cells were rapidly pelleted, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, extracted, and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described above. 32P-Labeled pp66 was detected by autoradiography, excised from dried gels, subjected to acid hydrolysis under N2, and resolved by high voltage, two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously (20Chew C.S. Parente Jr., J.A. Zhou C.-J. Baranco E. Chen X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ninhydrin-stained phosphoamino acid standards were used to locate radiolabeled amino acids, which were detected by autoradiography (20Chew C.S. Parente Jr., J.A. Zhou C.-J. Baranco E. Chen X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pp66 was purified to apparent homogeneity using a combination of detergent extraction and preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. 32P-Labeled parietal cells (∼100 × 106) were diluted to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml, temperature-equilibrated (30 min, 37 °C), and then stimulated for 10 min with 1 μm phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate to induce maximal pp66 phosphorylation. Cells were rapidly pelleted, rinsed one time with ice-cold extraction buffer (as above), and then extracted in the same buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% Empigen BB (Calbiochem) (v/v) for 15 min on ice. Detergent-insoluble pellets were lysed in reducing solubilizing buffer and subjected to preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (19Parente Jr., J.A. Goldenring J.R. Petropoulos A.C.

Co-migrating Coomassie Blue-stained spots were excised, pooled, and concentrated to a single band on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis minigel. This band was then excised and subjected to “in gel” tryptic digestion (19Parente Jr., J.A. Goldenring J.R. Petropoulos A.C. Hellman U. Chew C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Chew C.S. Parente Jr., J.A. Zhou C.-J. Baranco E. Chen X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides from tryptic digests were resolved on a reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography column, and selected peaks were sequenced at the Emory University Microsequencing Facility (Atlanta, GA). Initially, a reverse transcription-PCR strategy, employing peptide sequence information obtained from tryptic digests of the purified pp66 protein, was used to generate a specific cDNA product. Messenger RNA was prepared from >95% pure gastric parietal cells, using biotinylated oligo(dT) and streptavadin Magnesphere® particles from the Poly(A)Ttract System 1000 (Promega, Madison, WI). This mRNA was then used in a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (Life Technologies, Inc.) to synthesize a tagged cDNA as described previously (19Parente Jr., J.A. Goldenring J.R.

Chen X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare a specific probe for pp66, two degenerate primers were synthesized using peptide sequences obtained from the tryptic digest as a template and using OligoPrimer Analysis software (version 5.0; National Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth, MN) to assist in primer design. The sense primer (24-fold degeneracy) was based on the amino acid sequence IVTWHPT (ATHGTGACTTGGCAYCCNAC, SP-406). The antisense primer (64-fold degeneracy) was based on the amino acid sequence CEIARFYK (TTRTARAAICKGGCNATCTCRCA, ASP-997). Approximately 40 ng of cDNA were amplified (95 °C for 20 s, 48 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; 35 cycles) in a reaction mixture containing these primers (800 nm), 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After amplification of the cDNA, a 620-base pair PCR product was generated, subcloned into pCR-Script SK+ (Stratagene). Sequencing was performed by the Molecular Biology Core Facility at the Medical College of Georgia using an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer and ABI Prism Cycle Sequencing Dye Terminator Ready Reaction kits. To obtain the complete open reading frame of pp66, the 620-base pair fragment obtained in the initial PCR amplification of cDNA with SP-406 and ASP-997 was PCR-labeled with digoxigenin dNTPs (Life Technologies) and used as a probe to screen 500,000 plaques from a Uni-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene; derived from rabbit mRNA isolated from 98% pure parietal cells) as described previously (19Parente Jr., J.A.

The two longest inserts were selected for sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from calf spleen, and tagged cDNA was synthesized by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as described above for pp66 cloning. Sense (amino acid positions 1–6; ATGAGCCGGCAGGTGGGTC) and antisense (amino acid positions 457–462; CTTGGCCTGGACTGTCTCC) primers were designed based on the calf spleen sequence (GenBankTMaccession number D44496) and synthesized in the Medical College of Georgia Molecular Biology Core Facility. p57 double-stranded DNA was generated using PCR amplification with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR-generated band of the expected size was subcloned into pCR-Script. Positive plaques were detected by blue-white screening (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and cDNA from plasmids was sequenced as described above. Tagged cDNA was synthesized from total RNA isolated from rabbit spleen by the same methods used to prepare bovine spleen cDNA. Highly conserved regions of p57 cDNA were identified by comparing the bovine and human sequences in GenBank (accession numbers D44496 and D44497, respectively) to the rabbit pp66 sequence. The 19-mer sense primer (TTCTTTGACCCTGACACCA) was based on amino acid positions 277–282. The 17-mer antisense primer (amino acid positions 433–439) was designed to anneal to p57 and not pp66. A 495-base pair product was generated by PCR amplification as described for bovine spleen p57. The resulting product was subcloned and sequenced as described above. A 32P-labeled probe for pp66 mRNA was prepared by radiolabeling the cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame of pp66 by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Ready-To-Go kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using an RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), separated on 1.25% formaldehyde-agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and transferred to Magnagraph (Micron, Inc., Westboro MA) nylon membranes and probed as described previously (19Parente Jr., J.A.

Baranco E. Chen X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSPE, 1% SDS, 65 °C) and then subjected to autoradiography (Hyperfilm-MP; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at −70 °C with intensifying screens. Parietal cells were extracted with Triton X-100 and Empigen BB as described above. The detergent-insoluble portion of these extracts (50 μg/assay tube) was resuspended in phosphorylation buffer (final concentration: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm Mg(C2H3O2), 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg of phosphatidylserine, 2 μg of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, and 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP) and incubated with or without (control) recombinant PKCε (50 units; PanVera, Madison, WI) for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of hot SDS/β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to analytical two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described above. pp66 was identified based on co-migration of in vitro radiolabeled spots with authentic pp66 labeled in vivo by stimulation of intact 32P-labeled parietal cells with carbachol. Parietal cells plated on Matrigel®-coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes were cultured for ∼24 h as described previously (18Chew C.S. Ljungström M. Smolka A. Brown M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 25: G254-G263Google Scholar) and then transiently transfected with either pEGFP-N2 NH2-terminal protein fusion vector (CLONTECH) or the same vector into which the complete open reading frame for pp66 containing the initiating ATG codon had been cloned, in frame, into the multiple cloning site. Vectors were purified using an EndofreeTMplasmid kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Transfections were performed with either the cationic lipid, EffecteneTM, and a manufacturer-supplied enhancer (Qiagen) at a ratio of 1:8 (DNA to enhancer) and 1:25 (DNA to Effectene) or DMRIE-C (Life Technologies) using 0.8 μg of DNA per 5 μg DMRIE-C. Transfection efficiencies with these reagents ranged from 5 to 20% in different cell preparations. EGFP-pp66 fusion protein was localized by confocal microscopy in living and paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. In the latter case, cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 15 min at room temperature in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. For F-actin localization, fixed cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.15%, 4 min) and then stained with AlexaTM 568 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing the fluorescent EGFP-pp66 fusion protein were optically sectioned using a krypton/argon laser at 488-nm excitation wavelength, and fluorescence was detected with a photomultiplier at a 530-nm (emission filter, long pass) emission wavelength. Cells counterstained for F-actin were scanned at 488–568-nm excitation using a 565-nm beam splitter and 530 ± 30-nm (short pass) and 590-nm (long pass) wavelength emission filters to detect the EGFP and Alexa 568 phalloidin signals, respectively. For each dual label experiment, laser power, gains, and photomultiplier tube settings were adjusted so that there was no cross-over between the signals. Three-dimensional image reconstructions (0.2–0.4-μm sections) were performed using Molecular Dynamics ImageSpaceTM software running on a Silicon Graphics O2 computer platform. For Golgi localization, living cells were loaded with the fluorescent Golgi marker, Bodipy FL C5 ceramide (1 μm), for 30 min at 37 °C and then scanned at 488-nm excitation and 530-nm emission wavelengths. Mitochondria were localized in living cells using the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye, Mitotracker (Molecular Probes; 500 nm, 30 min, 37 °C; 568-nm excitation and 600-nm emission wavelengths). We previously demonstrated that carbachol increases pp66 phosphorylation in parietal cells and that this response is 1) mimicked by the PKC activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; 2) calcium-independent; and 3) inhibited by the bisindolylmaleimide PKC inhibitor, Ro 318220 (11Brown M.R. Chew C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G99-G110PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chew C.S. Zhou C.-J. Parente Jr., J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G246-G256PubMed Google Scholar). Since these studies focused solely on the 5-min time point, we expanded the analysis in this study to determine more precisely the temporal pattern of carbachol-dependent pp66 phosphorylation. The data in Fig.1 A show that pp66 phosphorylation is maximal within 5 min of stimulation. In addition, although the level of phosphorylation declined after approximately 15 min of stimulation, it remained significantly elevated above control for at least 30 min. Fig. 1 B shows the autoradiographic localization of pp66 in analytical two-dimensional gels before and after carbachol stimulation of 32P-labeled parietal cells, and data in Fig. 1 C show that carbachol stimulation leads to a strong phosphorylation of pp66 on serine residues with a barely detectable level of phosphorylation on threonine residues and no detectable phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Several experimental approaches were undertaken in the attempt to identify pp66. In situ 32P-labeling studies indicated that the phosphorylated form of pp66 was enriched in a Triton X-100-insoluble cell fraction; however, because pp66 was not only NH2-terminally blocked but also highly resistant to extraction from polyvinylidine fluoride membranes, it was not possible to isolate a sufficient amount of pp66 from this fraction to obtain reliable sequence information (not shown). Subsequently, a combined detergent extraction (0.5% Triton X-100 plus 1% Empigen BB) was found to yield a detergent-insoluble fraction that was highly enriched in pp66. pp66 was identified as a row of two major and two minor Coomassie Blue-stained spots with the major spots migrating immediately basic to the minor spots that co-migrated with endogenously32P-labeled pp66 (Fig. 2). Amino acid analyses of the major spots confirmed that they were isoforms of the same protein (not shown). At least two additional minor32P-labeled spots that were more acidic than the two major phosphorylated spots could be detected in preparative gels (Fig. 2,arrows) as well as in analytical gels with longer exposure times (not shown). Of the seven peptides sequenced from these tryptic digests, a GenBankTM search indicated that these peptides possessed varying degrees of homology with the predicted amino acid sequences of previously cloned human and bovine p57 actin-binding proteins (GenBankTM accession numbers X89109, U34690, and D44497; Figs. 3 and4). The p57 protein from human and bovine immune tissues (9Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) bears ∼64% similarity and 42% sequence identity with coronin, an actin-binding protein in D. discoideum(GenBankTM accession number X61480). Interestingly, coronin has also been detected in Triton X-100-insoluble cell fractions (4De Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G.

All living organisms respond to elevated temperature and a variety of chemical treatments by a rapid increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins. These protect the structure and activity of proteins from denaturation under environmental stresses (2Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1151-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lindquist S.

HSF is encoded by a single-copy gene in some species and by several genes in others, but only one HSF, designated HSF1, appears to be sensitive to the heat stress signal. In metazoans, HSF is present in an inactive monomeric form under normal conditions and converts to a trimeric form with high DNA binding affinity after stress induction. The activated HSF trimer also gains transcriptional competence and undergoes hyperphosphorylation. Under certain conditions, the DNA binding activity of HSF can be uncoupled from the acquisition of transcriptional activity (9Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). All HSFs contain two highly conserved regions: a DNA-binding domain at the amino terminus and an adjacent trimerization domain with clusters of hydrophobic heptad repeats (HR-A/B) separated by a short spacer (9Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of HSF forms a compact structure resembling the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (10Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C.M.

The trimerization domain has been proposed to resemble the hemagglutinin trimer of influenza virus, where the long array of heptad repeats self-associates as a parallel triple-stranded, α-helical coiled-coil structure (12Wilson I.A.

To test these mechanisms, we established an in vitro assay for reversible trimerization and DNA binding of Drosophila HSF purified from nonshocked or heat-shocked Sf9 cells (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This in vitro system enabled analysis of DNA binding and the equilibrium distributions of monomer and trimer forms of HSF in vitro under a variety of inducing conditions. Using this system, we observed direct and reversible effects of heat and oxidation on HSF trimerization and DNA binding activity, revealing a physico-chemical mechanism for signal transduction of the heat shock response (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the changes in trimerization and DNA binding induced by heat and hydrogen peroxide treatments in vitro were not as pronounced as those observed after heat shock in cells (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This prompted us to search for additional conditions that could further enhance HSF activationin vitro. Here, we report that moderately low pH in the physiological range directly and reversibly induces trimerization and DNA binding of purified Drosophila HSF. Such a change of pH may play an additional regulatory role in heat shock response in vivo. The Drosophila HSFs were expressed in Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells infected with baculovirus (multiplicity of infection of 5–10) carrying the Drosophila hsf cDNA inserted with no additional residues in pBlueBac (Invitrogen) (44Zhong M. Wisniewski J. Fritsch M. Mizuguchi G. Orosz A. Jedlicka P. Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from either the nonshocked or heat-shocked (36 °C, 30 min) Sf9 cells, and HSFs were purified to 95% homogeneity by using heparin Sepharose CL-6B, HSE-agarose, and Mono S chromatography (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The purity of HSF protein was estimated by reverse phase chromatography and SDS-polyacylamide gel electrophoresis. Absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the concentration of HSF. The extinction coefficient of HSF, 35970 m−1 cm−1 at 276 nm, was calculated according to Pace et al. (45Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation of HSFs was performed using a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge at a rotor speed of 12,000 rpm at 20 °C. The buffer used was in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.6 or 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol (v/v). Equilibrium was considered to have been attained when the absorbance scans at 230 nm were invariant for 12 h. The models for fitting the absorbance data matrix are: monomer only, A 230,r=A b·exp(ς) + E; dimer only,A 230,r=A b·exp(2ς) + E; trimer only,A 230,r=A b·exp(3ς) + E; monomer ⇔ trimer equilibrium, A 230,r=A b·exp(ς) + 3A b3/ε2302·exp(3ς) + lnK a + E, where ς =M(1 −ν̄ρ)ω2(r 2−r b2)/2RT, and K a is the trimer equilibrium association constant. ς is absorbance at 230 nm at the radial positionr, and A b is absorbance at the cell bottom. M refers the molecular mass of the monomer protein, 76,933 daltons, calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry with an error of ± 200 daltons; E is the base line; ε230 is the molar extinction coefficient of the monomer at 230 nm. ν̄ is the partial specific volume, 0.723 ml/g, calculated according to Perkins (46Perkins S.J.

The trimer dissociation constantK d equals to 1/K a. Precision columns (PC 3.2/30, 2.4 ml) and a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for gel filtration analysis. 0.5 μm purified HSF samples (in 30 μl) were fractionated on a Superose 6 column equilibrated in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol at a flow rate of 40 μl/min and 8 °C. This low temperature was utilized to minimize trimer dissociation upon sample dilution during the 1-h chromatography; we have shown previously that trimer dissociation is time- and temperature-dependent (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa) (Bio-Rad) were used in parallel as standards. The elution profiles at 215 nm were recorded. The trimer equilibrium dissociation constant is defined as K d = [M]3/[T], where for a known polypeptide concentration C, the monomer concentration is [M] = C × [area]M/([area]M + [area]T), and the trimer concentration is [T] = (C − [M])/3. Gel mobility shift assays of Drosophila HSF were according to Zhong et al. (44Zhong M. Wisniewski J. Fritsch M. Mizuguchi G. Orosz A. Jedlicka P. Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), using 32P-5′-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to a HSE. After induction, about 30 ng of HSF was mixed with labeled HSE and held on ice before agarose gel electrophoresis at room temperature. Western blotting was performed as described previously (48Rabindran S.K. Wisniewski J. Li L. Li G.C. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6552-6560Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), using polyclonal antibodies against Drosophila HSF and enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Typically, 10–20 ng of HSF was analyzed per sample. SL2 cells were grown at room temperature (22–24 °C) in spinner culture with Schneider's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. Cell suspensions (typically 3–5 × 106 cells/ml) were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in S-medium containing 25 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm MgSO4, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm glucose, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm PIPES/Tris (pH 6.8–6.9). This solution was designed to approximate the ionic composition of Schneider's medium (49Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with 5 μm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF/AM, Molecular Probes) in S-medium (∼1.5 × 107 cells/ml) for 30 min at 23 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with S-medium. Aliquots of cells were centrifuged, resuspended at ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in S-medium in the presence or absence of chemical inducers. At room temperature, cells remained viable with little leakage of BCECF for several hours. The BCECF fluorescence was monitored with a SLM8000C spectrofluorometer as the ratio of emission at 530 nm for excitation at 500 nm, to the emission upon excitation at 450 nm (slit width 2 nm). The fluorescence signal was calibrated with the nigericin-high K+ technique (50Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in a series of solutions containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 μm nigericin (Molecular Probes) and 10 mmMES/Tris (pH range 5.5–6.0) or PIPES/Tris (pH range 6.2–7.8). The calibration curves were fitted by polynomial regression of degree 3 [F 500/F 450 =a + b(pH) + c(pH)2 +d(pH)3], and pHi values were calculated using the fitted parameters. Several lines of evidence have previously suggested that there is a change in intracellular pH during heat shock of living cells (51Drummond I.A.S. McClure S.A. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1767-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 52Findly R.C. Gillies R.J. Schulman R.G.

Pilatus U. Rensing L. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 159: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A substantial increase in DNA binding of HSF was also reported when crude extracts were subjected to moderately acidic pH conditions (pH 6.0) (42Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 43Zimarino V. Wilson S. Wu C. Science. 1990; 249: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test whether low pH could induce the change in the oligomeric state of HSF directly, or if the pH signal was sensed and transduced by other factors present in the crude extracts, we analyzed the oligomeric states of purified Drosophila HSF as a function of pH. The Drosophila HSF used was overexpressed in either nonshocked or heat-shocked Sf9 cells and purified by chromatography to 95% homogeneity. Fig.1 A shows the pH dependence of the monomer-trimer equilibrium of HSF as measured by gel filtration chromatography. At 0.5 μm HSF concentration and 20 °C, the HSF trimer population showed a sigmoidal increase from ∼26% to ∼78% over a pH drop from pH 8.3 to pH 5.6, with the greatest increase occurring in the range of pH 7.5 to pH 6.5. Importantly, the induction of HSF trimerization by the pH decrease was reversible. When the HSF sample in pH 6.6 buffer was re-equilibrated in pH 7.4 buffer, the percentage of trimers decreased from ∼63% to the original level, ∼40% (Fig. 1 B). This reversibility indicates that the observed changes in state of HSF are unlikely to be due to irreversible effects of acidic pH on the activity of misfolded protein. We conclude that a moderate decrease of pH is able to make a direct contribution to HSF trimerization. In addition to gel filtration chromatography, the oligomeric states of purified HSFs were measured by analytical ultracentrifugation, which is rigorously based upon the reversible thermodynamics of protein-protein association. As shown in Fig.2, the equilibrium concentration distribution of HSF at 230 nm could not be fitted as a homogeneous monomer, dimer, or trimer but did fit well to a monomer-trimer equilibrium. Western blotting also shows no significant protein degradation when samples were analyzed after equilibrium sedimentation at 20 °C for 72 h (Fig. 2 (inset)). The sedimentation data confirm that purified Drosophila HSF is distributed as a mixture of monomers and trimers at submicromolar concentration, neutral pH (7.4), and room temperature (20 °C). We were able to derive the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of HSF from analytical ultracentrifugation at pH 7.4 and compare this value with the K d for HSF at pH 6.6. As shown in Table I, a drop from pH 7.4 to pH 6.6 led to a 10-fold decrease in the K d(i.e. increased trimerization). While theK d values derived from gel filtration chromatography are generally 2–3-fold larger than those from analytical centrifugation (probably due to trimer dissociation during chromatography), the magnitude of the change in K dvalues induced by a pH drop from 7.4 to 6.6 is nonetheless similar for both techniques. Interestingly, as was shown by gel filtration (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Table I), no significant difference of the K d values were observed for nonshocked and heat-shocked HSF, indicating that covalent modifications of HSF induced by heat shock in this expression system have no effect on trimer formation.Table IComparison of equilibrium dissociation constants of HSFs determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatographyHSFpHAnalytical ultracentrifugationGel filtrationlnK aK dK d,pH 7.4/K dK dK d,pH 7.4/K dμm2μm2HSF (NS)7.429.30.191.00.551.06.631.60.01910.00.0609.26.6 → 7.41-a∼8 μm HSF samples in pH 6.6 buffer were diluted more than 10-fold into pH 7.4 buffer and equilibrated at 20 °C overnight before taking the measurements.29.40.171.10.391.4HSF (HS)7.429.50.151.00.521.06.631.80.01510.00.04411.86.6 → 7.41-a∼8 μm HSF samples in pH 6.6 buffer were diluted more than 10-fold into pH 7.4 buffer and equilibrated at 20 °C overnight before taking the measurements.29.70.131.20.391.3Measurements were performed with 0.5–0.8 μm HSF (in monomer) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol at 20 °C. The K d values are averages of 3–10 independent measurements and are within ±10% experimental error.1-a ∼8 μm HSF samples in pH 6.6 buffer were diluted more than 10-fold into pH 7.4 buffer and equilibrated at 20 °C overnight before taking the measurements.

The K d values are averages of 3–10 independent measurements and are within ±10% experimental error. The effect of low pH on the DNA binding of HSF at 20 °C was further investigated using the gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig.3, both purified nonshocked and heat-shocked HSF showed enhanced DNA binding activity when the buffer pH was decreased, consistent with increased HSF trimerization. The maximal DNA binding of HSF at 20 °C occurred at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3,lanes c and h). The magnitude of the increase in HSF DNA binding activity caused by lowering the pH from 7.4 to 7.0 was comparable with the increase caused by heat treatment alone (Fig. 3, lanes b and g). Interestingly, a further drop of buffer pH to 6.2 led to a decrease of DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, lanes e andj); this effect is likely to be due to partial denaturation of HSF brought about by increasingly acidic pH. Previously, we identified heat and oxidation as two direct inducers of HSF trimerization and DNA binding in vitro. Each individual inducing signal decreases theK d of Drosophila HSF by 8∼11-fold, leading to a 30∼40% increase of the HSF trimer population at physiological concentrations (1Zhong M. Orosz A. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 101-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To evaluate if low pH could act synergistically with heat and/or oxidation, we measured theK d values of HSF under multiple inducing conditions using gel filtration chromatography. As shown in TableII, treatments with heat/H2O2, heat/low pH (pH 6.6) or H2O2/low pH (pH 6.6) decreased theK d values of HSF by about 30.6-, 25.0-, and 20.4-fold, respectively, somewhat more than the sum of individual changes. In a triple induction by heat, H2O2and low pH (pH 6.6), the K d value of HSF decreased by 45.8-fold (Table II), increasing the HSF trimer population by 50∼60%. The synergistic effect of low pH on heat-induced HSF trimerization in vitro may have a role in the heat shock response in vivo.Table IISynergistic effects of heat, oxidation, and low pH on the equilibrium dissociation constants of Drosophila HSFInducerK dFold induction2-aFold induction =K d(pH 7.4, control)/K d.μm2None (pH 7.4, control)0.551.0Heat (pH 7.4)2-bSamples were incubated at 36 °C for 30–120 min before gel filtration analysis.0.05110.8H2O2 (pH 7.4)0.0678.2Heat/H2O2 (pH 7.4)2-bSamples were incubated at 36 °C for 30–120 min before gel filtration analysis.0.01830.6None (pH 6.6)0.0609.2Heat (pH 6.6)2-bSamples were incubated at 36 °C for 30–120 min before gel filtration analysis.0.02225.0H2O2 (pH 6.6)0.02720.4Heat/H2O2 (pH 6.6)2-bSamples were incubated at 36 °C for 30–120 min before gel filtration analysis.0.01245.80.5 μm nonshocked HSF samples were incubated in 30 μl 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 or 6.6) with or without 2 mm H2O2 at 20 °C for 12 h and analyzed by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography.

To investigate the physiological significance of the low pH-induced trimerization and DNA binding of HSF, we measured the intracellular pH (pHi) change in Drosophila SL2 cells during heat or chemical stresses, using the fluorescent indicator BCECF as a marker of the intracellular pH (55Dixon S.J. Wilson J.X. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 196-213Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SL2 cells were grown in spinner culture with Schneider's medium (pH 6.8) at 22–24 °C. The fluorescence signal was calibrated using the nigericin-high K+ technique (50Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). After exposure of the BCECF-loaded cells to a series of solutions (pH ranging from 5.5 to 7.8) in the presence of nigericin, the ratio of fluorescence intensities (at 530 nm) was measured for the excitation wavelengths of 500 and 450 nm. Fig.4 A shows the BCECF fluorescence ratio as a function of intracellular pH. Data were fitted with a polynomial regression of degree three; the fitted parameters were then used to convert fluorescence ratios to pHivalues. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the resting pHi of SL2 cells under normal conditions was 7.36 ± 0.02 at 23 °C. After heat shock for 10 min at 37 °C, the pHi dropped to 7.05 ± 0.02. The magnitude of pHi change in SL2 cells is consistent with the pHi decrease reported previously in salivary glands upon heat shock (from pH 7.38 to 6.91) (51Drummond I.A.S. McClure S.A. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1767-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to heat shock (37 °C, 10 min), chemical inducers of the heat shock response such as ethanol, sodium salicylate, arachidonate, and indomethacin (group I inducers) lowered the pHi of SL2 cells by 0.15–0.36 units (Table III). Interestingly, sodium arsenite, cadmium sulfate, and canavanine (group II heat shock inducers) had no significant effects on the intracellular pH value (Table III). Among the group I inducers, heat shock and sodium salicylate have been shown to rapidly activate HSF DNA binding, induce chromosomal puffing or HSP synthesis in Drosophila (56Ritossa F.M. Exp.

This seven-iron ferredoxin contains two different types of [Fe-S] clusters: one [3Fe-4S]+/0cluster and one [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster. The first half of the polypeptide chain folds around these two clusters in a manner similar to most eight-iron ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters. This NH2-terminal region therefore represents a core structural frame shared among different classes of ferredoxins (7Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg.

Biochem. 1982; 123: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the fpr gene is activated in response to oxidative stress by the SoxRS regulon (23Liocher S.I. Hausladen A.

InA. vinelandii, the fpr gene is similarly activated in response to oxidative stress; however, in that case the system is very specific for AvFdI (24Yannone S.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

As confirmed by both chemical cross-linking and spectroscopic characterization,AvFdI forms a complex with AvFPR at the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 and the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster ofAvFdI is specifically reduced by NADPH via FPR. Recently, the x-ray structures of both E. coli and A. vinelandii FPR have been determined (26Ingelman M. Bianchi V. Eklund H. J. Mol.

This seven-iron ferredoxin contains two different types of [Fe-S] clusters: one [3Fe-4S]+/0cluster and one [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster. The first half of the polypeptide chain folds around these two clusters in a manner similar to most eight-iron ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters. This NH2-terminal region therefore represents a core structural frame shared among different classes of ferredoxins (7Matsubara H. Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, AvFdI contains an additional ∼60-amino acid extension at the COOH terminus that is unique to this class of seven-iron ferredoxins. Proteins homologous to AvFdI have been reported from a number of organisms including Azotobacter chroococcum, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas ovalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Caulobacter crescentus, Rhodobacter capsulatus, Streptomyces griseus, Thermus thermophilus, and Bacillus schlegelii with the pseudomonas protein sequences showing >90% identity toAvFdI (8Iismaa S.E.

Although it has been known for some time that FdI has a metabolic function unrelated to nitrogen fixation that is important for cell growth (14Morgan T.V. Lundell D.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the specific cellular function of FdI and related seven-iron ferredoxins in other organisms has yet to be determined. In 1988, it was reported that disruption of the fdxA gene that encodes FdI in A. vinelandii led to a dramatic increase in the levels of another small acidic protein (13Dupont C. Jouanneau Y. Vignais P.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the mechanism of regulation by FdI, the small acidic protein that is overexpressed in response to fdxA deletion was purified and characterized (15Isas J.M. Burgess B.K. J.

The protein was shown to be aM r ∼29,000 NADPH-ferredoxin reductase that was designated FPR because its physical properties and amino acid sequence showed striking similarity to the FPR from Escherichia coli(15Isas J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2031114300,"Human l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AT) shows large structural changes of the 300-flap and of helix H9 upon binding of l-arginine andl-ornithine, described as a closed and an open conformation (Humm, A., Fritsche, E., Steinbacher, S., and Huber, R. (1997)EMBO J. 16, 3373–3385). To elucidate the structural basis of these induced-fit movements, the x-ray structures of AT in complex with the amidino acceptor glycine and its analogs γ-aminobutyric acid and δ-aminovaleric acid, as well as in complex with the amidino donor analogs l-alanine, l-α-aminobutyric acid, andl-norvaline, have been solved at 2.6-, 2.5-, 2.37-, 2.3-, 2.5-, and 2.4-Å resolutions, respectively. The latter three compounds were found to stabilize the open conformer. The glycine analogs bind in a distinct manner and do not induce the transition to the open state. The complex with glycine revealed a third binding mode, reflecting the rather broad substrate specificity of AT. These findings identified a role for the α-amino group of the ligand in stabilizing the open conformer. The kinetic, structural, and thermodynamic properties of the mutants ATΔM302 and ATΔ11 (lacks 11 residues of H9) confirmed the key role of Asn300 and suggest that in mammalian amidinotransferases, the role of helix H9 is in accelerating amidino transfer by an induced-fit mechanism. Helix H9 does not add to the stability of the protein. Human l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AT) shows large structural changes of the 300-flap and of helix H9 upon binding of l-arginine andl-ornithine, described as a closed and an open conformation (Humm, A., Fritsche, E., Steinbacher, S., and Huber, R.

Creatine and its phosphorylated form provide a dynamic reservoir of high energy phosphate in several tissues, most prominently in skeletal muscle and heart (1Walker J.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 172-242Google Scholar). Most vertebrates are able to synthesize creatine de novo from l-arginine and glycine (2Van Pilsum J.F. Stephens G.C. Taylor D. Biochem.

Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 172-242Google Scholar), whereas most invertebrates must obtain creatine from their diet. In higher vertebrates, creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver, pancreas, and kidney, transported by the bloodstream and taken up by Na+-dependent creatine transporters into muscle and neural tissues (3Loike J.D.

Enzymol. 1979; 50: 172-242Google Scholar). The de novo biosynthesis of creatine is controlled at the level of AT (1Walker J.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 172-242Google Scholar), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of creatine biosynthesis: the transfer of an amidino group froml-arginine to glycine, resulting in l-ornithine and guanidinoacetic acid, the immediate precursor of creatine. AT is regulated in a variety of ways, including product inhibition of its catalytic activity by ornithine (5Sipilä I. Simell O. Arjomaa P. J. Clin.

Berson E.L. Mandell R. Schmidt S.Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1978; 30: 174-179PubMed Google Scholar), which is associated with type II muscle fiber atrophy and gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, a disease that progressively leads to blindness (16Sipilä I. Simell O. Rapola J. Sainio K. Tuuteri L. Neurology. 1979; 29: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ornithine is a strong competitive inhibitor of AT, its 10–20-fold increased plasma concentration in hyperornithinemia results in inhibition of AT, suggesting impaired de novo creatine biosynthesis as the cause of the aforementioned pathogenesis of the eye and muscle (16Sipilä I. Simell O. Rapola J. Sainio K. Tuuteri L. Neurology. 1979; 29: 996-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sipilä I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). AT exhibits a rather broad substrate specificity and can utilize a wide variety of amidino donors, such as l-canavanine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, 3-guanidinopropionate, and hydroxyguanidine, and amidino acceptors, such as l-canaline, 4-aminobutyrate, 3-aminopropionate, and hydroxylamine, in addition to the physiological substrates (1Walker J.B. Adv. Enzymol. 1979; 50: 172-242Google Scholar). Biochemical data suggested a ping-pong mechanism for the transamidination reaction (18Ronca G. Vigi V. Grazi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2589-2595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fritsche E. Humm A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), including a transient covalent attachment of an amidino group to Cys407 (20Humm A. Fritsche E. Mann K. Göhl M. Huber R.

Chem. 1968; 243: 538-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human AT at high resolution revealed that the nucleophilic Cys407 is located at the bottom of an narrow active site channel (23Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The enzyme adopts open and closed conformations during the reaction cycle. The crystal structures of AT in complex with l-arginine and l-ornithine showed that binding is accompanied by large conformational changes, with shifts of up to 5 Å for the 300-flap and for helix H9 compared with the unliganded enzyme (Fig. 1) (23Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, highly homologous amidinotransferases are also found in certain strains ofStreptomyces sp., in which they catalyze two transamidination reactions in the biosynthesis of the streptomycin family of antibiotics (24Walker J. Boyer P.D. The Enzyme s. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1973: 497-509Google Scholar, 25Walker J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Ohnuki T. Imanaka T. Aiba S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 85-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Piepersberg W. Strohl W.R. Bio/Technology of Antibiotics. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 81-163Google Scholar). These amidinotransferases lack the flexible helix H9 in human AT as the most prominent difference, indicating distinctly different ligand and intermediate binding. The crystal structure of l-arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase StrB1 from Streptomyces griseus (StrB1) was solved recently at 3.1 Å (28Fritsche E. Bergner A. Humm A. Piepersberg W. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) and revealed a fold closely related to AT. However, major changes were found in loops surrounding the active site, resulting in an open and solvent exposed cavity. These differences can be largely attributed to the deletion of AT helix H9 and to the deletion of one residue in the AT 300-loop. The conformation of the 300-loop implies that StrB1, in contrast to AT, adopts a single conformation during catalysis. The aim of the work described here was to establish a role for the induced-fit movements of AT and in particular for AT helix H9. In addition, the properties of a ligand molecule inducing the large conformational changes upon binding should be clarified. The crystal structures of AT in complex with the amidino acceptor analogs γ-aminobutyric acid and δ-aminovaleric acid on the one hand, and the amidino donor analogs l-alanine,l-α-aminobutyric acid, and l-norvaline on the other hand (Fig. 2), revealed two distinct binding modes. A third binding mode was found for glycine, reflecting the rather broad substrate specificity of AT. The ability of these compounds to trigger the induced-fit movements was investigated and led to the identification of the required chemical groups. A multiple sequence alignment revealed that residue Met302 and helix H9 are deleted in the bacterial amidinotransferases. To investigate the role of helix H9 and of residue Met302, we prepared appropriate deletion mutants of human AT and examined their kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural properties. The implications of these results for the structure and the induced-fit mechanism of AT are discussed. Wild-type AT, the AT deletion mutants ATΔM302 and ATΔ11, and StrB1 were overexpressed as N-terminal hexahistidine fusion proteins and purified by nitrilotriacetate-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (20Humm A. Fritsche E. Mann K. Göhl M. Huber R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Fritsche E. Bergner A. Humm A. Piepersberg W. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In order to obtain highly pure StrB1 for spectroscopic experiments, an additional purification step was essential. Briefly, the pooled fractions from the nitrilotriacetate-agarose affinity column were dialyzed against Buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m ammonium sulfate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GSH) and applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a 24-ml column of phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing with Buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a linear salt gradient (0.8–0 m) of ammonium sulfate in Buffer B (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GSH). The fractions containing StrB1 were combined and dialyzed against 30 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.7, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm GSH. Purity of the enzyme preparations were assessed by SDS-PAGE through 12% polyacrylamide gels (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10468) Google Scholar) followed by staining with Coomassie Briliant Blue R-250. The identity of the isolated proteins was verified by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry, and enzymatic activity. The deconvoluted mass spectra revealed major peaks for wild-type AT of 45,812 Da (electrospray ionization MS, calculated mass, 45,777 Da), for ATΔM302 of 45,659 Da (electrospray ionization MS, calculated mass, 45,646 Da), for ATΔ11 of 44,540 Da (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization MS, calculated mass, 44,491 Da), and for StrB1 of 40,170 Da (electrospray ionization MS, calculated mass, 40,163 Da). The yields of electrophoretically homogeneous protein per liter of culture were 2–3 mg for AT and ATΔM302 and 0.2–1 mg for ATΔ11 and StrB1. For preparation of the mutant ATΔM302 (lacks Met302) the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), the plasmid pRSETAT38H (20Humm A. Fritsche E. Mann K. Göhl M. Huber R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the primers 5′-GGTAGCATCAATATGGGGATTGGGATC-3′ and 5′-GATCCCAATCCCCATATTGATGCTACC-3′ were used. The deletion mutant ATΔ11 (lacks amino acids Ile229–Ala239) was prepared using the ExSiteTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers 5′P-GGGATAATCCTGGTTATAAAGC-3′ and 5′P-GCTCAGGGAAAATTTGTGACAACTGAATTCGAGCCATGC-3′ (both primers contained a 5′-phosphate group). The primers were purchased from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). The deletions were verified by DNA sequencing of the whole coding region in both directions. The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a specific absorption coefficient at 280 nm of 2.0 cm2·mg−1 for AT and its variants, and 1.46 cm2·mg−1 for StrB1. The activity of AT and StrB1 was measured by the method of Van Pilsum et al. (30Van Pilsum J.F. Taylor D. Zakis B. McCormick P. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), by incubating the enzyme with 20 mml-arginine and 20 mm of glycine or hydroxylamine, as amidino donor and acceptor, respectively, and determining the formedl-ornithine by a ninhydrin color reaction. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol ofl-ornithine/h at 37 °C. The purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon-30, Amicon) to approximately 13 mg/ml. Crystals of AT and ATΔM302 were grown by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. The droplets were made from 7 μl of a protein solution (13 mg/ml in 30 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm GSH) and 14 μl of a reservoir solution (3% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0) and equilibrated against the reservoir solution. Tetragonal-bipyramidal-shaped crystals of AT (approximately 0.7 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm) appeared after 2 days. Crystals from the mutant ATΔM302 grew from precipitated protein within 5 days. ATΔM302 crystallized isomorphously to the wild-type enzyme in the tetragonal space group P43212, with lattice constants ofa = b = 83.71 Å, c = 200.41 Å, and a = b =c = 90° (Table I). The asymmetric unit contained one molecule with a solvent content of 68% (V m = 3.83 Å3/Da) (31Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Crystals were transferred from the mother liquor to droplets of harvesting buffer (20% polyethylene glycol 6000, 267 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0) containing either glycine (0.5 m), γ-aminobutyric acid (0.1 m), δ-aminovaleric acid (1.0 m), l-alanine (0.5m), l-α-aminobutyric acid (0.5m), or l-norvaline (saturated), and soaked for 15–50 h. The chemical structures of the soaked compounds are presented in Fig. 2. X-ray measurements were performed on a MAR Research imaging plate detector system at 18 °C mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator with λ= CuKα = 1.542 Å. Images were processed with MOSFLM (32Leslie A.G.W. Mosflm user guide, Mosflm Version 5.30, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Cambridge, United Kingdom1994Google Scholar) and data were scaled and reduced using ROTAVATA/AGROVATA/TRUNCATE (33Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19745) Google Scholar). The statistics of data collection are given in Table I. As the crystals of the AT deletion mutant ATΔM302 and of all complexes were isomorphous with those of the wild-type protein, the wild-type structure was used as a model for initial Fourier (2F o − F c) and difference Fourier (F o − F c) maps. Subsequently, the substrates and inhibitors were fitted to the electron density using FRODO (34Jones T.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 11: 268-272Crossref Google Scholar) on an ESV-30 Graphic system workstation (Evans & Sutherland, Salt Lake City, UT), and the model was refined with XPLOR (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the parameter set of Engh and Huber (36Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). The final model comprises residues 64–423. The region from residue 230 to residue 242 displays average main chain B values, which are about 10 Å2 (AT in closed conformation) and 45 Å2 (AT in open conformation) above the B value for the whole protein and correlate with poor electron density. Water molecules were built into 1 ς peaks of the (2F o − F c) map. Water molecules with B factors above 50 Å2 were removed from the model prior to the last refinement. The models show good geometry with R-factors below 20% and root mean square deviations for a bond length of 0.010–0.011 Å and for bond angles of 1.56–1.62°. Two of the three Ramachandran outliers (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK, Version 3.3. Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) (Met184 and His303) are well defined and are also observed in the wild-type AT structure (23Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas Ser231 is poorly defined and is observed as outlier solely in the structures adopting an “open” state. The final refinement statistics and stereochemical parameters are presented in Table I. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Mark-IV (Jobin Yvon) spectropolarimeter. The spectra were recorded from 195 to 250 nm in a thermostated 0.01-cm quartz cuvette at 10 °C. A protein concentration of about 0.15 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm GSH was used. All spectra were accumulated four times and corrected for the buffers. Mean molar residue ellipticities (θR) were calculated based on a mean residue molecular weight of 113. The thermal unfolding curves were determined by monitoring the changes in dichroic intensity at 216 nm as a function of temperature. The measurements were carried out in the temperature range of 10–80 °C with a temperature gradient of 0.5 °C/min using an oil-thermostatted cylindrical 0.01-cm quartz cell connected to a thermoprogrammer. The T m values were derived by fitting the temperature-induced unfolding curves using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, ΔG(T)=ΔHm·(1−T/Tm)−ΔCp·(Tm−T+T·ln(T/Tm))Equation 1 where ΔG is the free energy of unfolding,T m is the temperature at which 50% of the protein molecules are unfolded, ΔH m is the enthalpy of unfolding at T m, and ΔCp is the heat capacity. A ΔCp value of 2.7 kcal·mol−1K−1 was estimated from the amino acid composition (38Makhadzde G.L. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Because the thermal transitions of all studied proteins were irreversible, a quantitative evaluation of thermodynamic parameters was not possible. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column mounted on a SMARTTM system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For all measurements a flow rate of 40 μl/min and phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol as buffer was used. The following marker proteins were used for calibration: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumine (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Spinco Model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a photoelectric scanner. Double-sector cells with sapphire windows were used in an An-G rotor. Initial protein concentrations were about 0.2 mg/ml (ATΔM302 and ATΔ11) and 0.27 mg/ml (StrB1), corresponding to an initial absorbance at 280 nm of 0.4. Prior to the experiments, the protein samples were equilibrated against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Sedimentation coefficients were determined at 20 °C and 44,000 rpm, plotting lnr versus time. The scanning wavelength was 280 nm. The partial specific volume was calculated using the partial specific volumes of the component amino acids, yielding a value of 0.735 ml/g. The solvent density was estimated to be 1.000 g/ml. High-speed sedimentation equilibria measurements (40Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) were performed at 22 °C and 16,000 rpm. The molecular weight was calculated from lnc versus r 2 plots using a computer program written by G. Böhm (University of Regensburg). The scanning wavelengths were 230 and 280 nm. The crystal structures of AT and of its complexes with l-arginine andl-ornithine have been described (23Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and they show that AT exists in at least two different conformations: (i) a closed conformation of ligand-free AT, and (ii) an open conformation induced by the binding of l-arginine (to AT mutant C407S) andl-ornithine (Fig. 1). In order to evaluate the molecular basis of these ligand-induced conformational changes, the structures of the binary complexes of AT with the amidino donor analogs l-norvaline,l-α-aminobutyric acid, and l-alanine (Fig.2) were solved at resolutions of 2.4, 2.5, and 2.3 Å, respectively. These amino acids differ in the number of side chain carbon atoms, and they are not substrates because they lack the terminal amino group. In the presence of substrate concentrations of 10 mm, only l-norvaline was found to inhibit amidine transfer (41Ratner S. Rochovansky O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1956; 63: 296-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Takeda M. Kiyatake I. Koide H. Jung K.Y. Endou H. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1992; 30: 325-331PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structures ofl-norvaline, l-α-aminobutyric acid, andl-alanine provide a clue for the inhibition mechanism at atomic resolution. All these ligands induce the transition from the closed to the open state and bind similar to thel-ornithine and l-arginine co-crystal structures (Fig. 1). The carboxylate and α-amino groups of these compounds would clash with the side chain of Asn300 in the closed conformer. This leads to a displacement of the 300-flap (residues Asp298-Pro299-Asn300-Pro301) toward helix H9 (residues Val232–Gln241). A concomitant repositioning of helix H9 prevents steric collision of Pro299 with His236 and of Asn300with Arg235. The shifts are as large as 5.1 Å for the Cα position of Pro299 and about 3.3 Å for the Cα positions of helix H9 (Fig. 1). These motions open the active site and may facilitate ligand binding and dissociation of reaction products. In agreement with the canonical binding, the carboxylate oxygen OT1 of l-norvaline accepts a hydrogen bond from Ser355 Oγ (2.8 Å) and is fixed via a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Nη1 and Nη2 (both 2.9 Å) of Arg322 (Fig.3 A). The amide nitrogen of Ser355 donates a hydrogen bond to the OT2carboxylate oxygen (2.8 Å). The α-amino group is a hydrogen bond donor to the carbonyl oxygen of Met302 (2.8 Å). In contrast to the substrate binding residues, the 300-flap was not unambigously defined in the l-alanine complex, indicating a partial occupation of two (open and closed) positions. This could be attributed to a decreased binding affinity of l-alanine due to its small side chain. In accordance, l-norvaline is the best of these amino acid inhibitors and is identical tol-ornithine in the length of the carbon side chain. In contrast to l-alanine, l-ornithine is a strong competitive inhibitor (K i, 0.253 mm), and the plasma l-ornithine levels in hyperornithinemia may be sufficient to inhibit AT, resulting in gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (17Sipilä I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of unligated AT, as well as of AT in complex with the amidino acceptor or analogs glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and δ-aminovaleric acid (Fig. 2), were found in closed conformation. γ-Aminobutyric acid and δ-aminovaleric acid bind differently tol-norvaline, l-α-aminobutyric acid, andl-alanine. The carboxylate group of the ligand is shifted 1.2 Å away from Asn300, which allows binding without inducing conformational changes (Fig. 3 B). The carboxylate oxygen OT1 of δ-aminovaleric acid is a hydrogen bond acceptor to Nη1 of Arg322 (3.2 Å). OT2 shares a hydrogen bond to Ser355Oγ (2.5 Å), to the amide nitrogen of Ser355(2.9 Å), and to Nδ2 of Asn300 (2.9 Å). A buried water molecule bridges OT1 (2.8 Å) to the side chain of Thr307 (2.8 Å), and to Ala306 N (2.9 Å) and His303 O (2.7 Å), respectively. The δ-amino group of δ-aminovaleric acid is surrounded by Asp305, Cys407, His303, and Asp170. A comparison of the structures in complex with γ-aminobutyric acid and δ-aminovale"

Variations in the extent of proenkephalin processing in vivo suggest involvement of endogenous protease inhibitors. This study demonstrates that “protease nexin 2 (PN2),” the secreted form of the kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), potently inhibited the proenkephalin processing enzyme known as prohormone thiol protease (PTP), with a K i,app of 400 nm. Moreover, PTP and PN2 formed SDS-stable complexes that are typical of kunitz protease inhibitor interactions with target proteases. In vivo, KPI/APP (120 kDa), as well as a truncated form of KPI/APP that resembles PN2 in apparent molecular mass (110 kDa), were colocalized with PTP and (Met)enkephalin in secretory vesicles of adrenal medulla (chromaffin granules). KPI/APP (110–120 kDa) was also detected in pituitary secretory vesicles that contain PTP. In chromaffin cells, calcium-dependent secretion of KPI/APP with PTP and (Met)enkephalin demonstrated the colocalization of these components in functional secretory vesicles. These results suggest a role for KPI/APP inhibition of PTP in regulated secretory vesicles.

Peptide neurotransmitters and hormones are synthesized as protein precursors that require proteolytic processing to generate active neuropeptides. Proneuropeptide precursors are routed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus and secretory vesicles (1Gainer H. Russel J.T. Loh Y.P.

The presence of proneuropeptides and processed peptide products within secretory vesicles indicates that corresponding proteases for proneuropeptide processing are largely present within such vesicles.

Proenkephalin processing in chromaffin granules is also mediated, to a lesser degree, by the subtilisin-like prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) and PC2 enzymes (17Azaryan A.V. Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol.

Schiller M.R. Mende-Mueller L. Hook V.Y.H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1771-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is known that the extent of proenkephalin processing in adrenal medulla, in vivo, is limited, because only 10% of (Met)- enkephalin exists as completely processed pentapeptide, and approximately 90% of enkephalins in this tissue are present as high molecular mass intermediates of 10–25 kDa (19Fleminger G.

Science. 1984; 225: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, in vitro processing of proenkephalin by PTP proceeds completely, with extensive conversion of proenkephalin into peptide products. These observations suggest that endogenous protease inhibitors of PTP are present in vivo to limit the extent of proenkephalin processing.

Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), provides biochemical rationale for inhibition of PTP by KPI/APP. In this study, potent inhibition of PTP by the secreted form of KPI/APP (APP-751 form), protease nexin 2, is demonstrated; in addition, inhibition of PTP by the KPI domain itself is compared. The colocalization of KPI/APP and PTP within secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine chromaffin cells suggests protease and protease inhibitor interactions of PTP and KPI/APP in vivo. Purified PTP, PN2, and recombinant KPI were prepared for in vitro inhibition assays of PTP activity. PTP was purified from chromaffin granules isolated from bovine adrenal medulla as described previously (12Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8376-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protease nexin 2 was purified as described previously (45Van Nostrand W.E. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8508-8514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); recombinant KPI was expressed in yeast and purified as described previously (46Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T. Raschke W.C. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For inhibition assays, purified PTP (3 ng, 5 nm) was preincubated with protease nexin 2 (5–50 nm) or recombinant KPI (1–80 μm) in PTP assay buffer (described previously (12Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J.

PTP activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of 35S-(Met)-preproenkephalin (50,000 cpm) to trichloroacetic acid-soluble35S-radioactivity that represents small peptide products, or by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, as described previously (12Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8376-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition constant, K i,app, was calculated by the equation [I]/(1 − a) =K i,app(1/a) + [E] (31Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9591-9594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed twice, in duplicates that varied by less than 10%. For detection of PTP/PN2 complexes, PTP (1.5 ng) was incubated with PN2 (50–400 ng) at 37 °C for 10 min and placed on ice, and sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol was added (5 mmTris-glycine, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS with bromphenol blue). The sample was immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blots (performed as described previously (13Schiller M.R. Mende-Mueller L. Moran K. Meng M. Miller K.W. Hook V.Y.H.

For electron microscopy, chromaffin granules were isolated by centrifugation of fresh bovine adrenal medulla homogenate (in 0.32 m sucrose) at 400 × g, and the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g to pellet chromaffin granules, which were washed three times in an equal volume of 0.32m sucrose. Chromaffin granules were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 60 min and washed three times in the cacodylate buffer. Granule samples were dehydrated in 70% ethanol solution and embedded in LR white embedding medium at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections were prepared with a diamond knife, mounted on nickel grids, and stained with lead citrate for examination in a JEOL 100 CX II transmission electron microscope. For Western blot analyses of KPI/APP in chromaffin granules, granules were purified from bovine adrenal medulla by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation and separated into soluble and membrane components, as described previously (12Krieger T.J.

In addition, ultracentrifugation of chromaffin granules on a multistep discontinuous sucrose gradient of 2.2–1.0 m sucrose was performed (as described previously described (47Yasothornsrikul S. Toneff T. Hwang S. Hook V.Y.H. J.

To further assess the localization of KPI/APP to secretory vesicles, neuropeptide-containing secretory vesicles of bovine posterior pituitary (50Norris D.O. Norris D.O. Vertebrate Endocrinology.

Commun. 1992; 183: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, pituitary homogenates were prepared from fresh bovine pituitary in 25 mm histidine-HCl, pH 6.5, with a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μm chymostatin, 10 μmpepstatin A, and 10 μm leupeptin). KPI/APP in purified posterior pituitary secretory vesicles and homogenates of bovine pituitary were analyzed by Western blots with the R7 antiserum. Protein content of samples was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (52Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of chromaffin cells were prepared from fresh bovine adrenal medulla and plated in fibronectin-coated plates (Falcon 6-well plates) at 2.0 × 106 cells/well, as described previously (14Tezapsidis N.

SRM without calcium included 2.2 mmMgCl2 (to replace 2.2 mm CaCl2) and 2.0 mm EGTA. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with fresh SRM buffer in the presence or absence of calcium, or with 50 mm KCl in SRM buffer in the presence or absence of calcium. The media were collected with addition of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmchymostatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μmpepstatin A, and 1 μm E64c), and concentrated (Millipore Biomax 10K concentrator) with buffer exchange into immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of 50 mm citric acid, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmchymostatin, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm E64-c). Immunoprecipitation of KPI in the medium with R7 antibody (29Beeson J.G. Shelton E.R. Chan H.W. Gage F.H. J. Comp.

To assess secretion of (Met)enkephalin and PTP, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with fresh SRM buffer with or without calcium, or with 50 mm KCl in SRM buffer with or without calcium. The medium was collected with addition of protease inhibitors (as above); brought to pH 6.0 by addition of an equal volume of 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA; and concentrated with a Millipore Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter (Biomax-10K NMWL membrane). The medium was analyzed for (Met)enkephalin by radioimmunoassay, as described previously (14Tezapsidis N. Noctor S. Kannan R. Krieger T.J. Mende-Mueller L. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol.

The proneuropeptide processing enzyme known as PTP represents the major proenkephalin processing enzyme in enkephalin-containing secretory vesicles of adrenal medulla (2Hook V.Y.H. Azaryan A.V.

PTP in vitro converts proenkephalin into smaller enkephalin-containing peptide fragments that resemble enkephalin peptide products in vivo (12Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y.H. J. Biol.

In addition, the parallel P1 Arg residue within the reactive site loop of the KPI domain and the parallel cleavage specificity of PTP at Arg or Lys basic residues predict that the KPI form of APP can inhibit PTP. The ability of KPI/APP to inhibit PTP was assessed in in vitro assays that tested the ability of PN2, the secreted form of KPI/APP that contains the KPI domain, to inhibit purified PTP. PN2 effectively inhibited PTP activity by 30–60% at PN2 concentrations of 100–500 nm.

The transition can also be modulated by the presence of salt. From our earlier studies it was shown that three distinct species are populated in the pH range 6–9. At acidic pH, a low-spin six-coordinate structure predominates. At neutral and at alkaline pHs, in addition to a small population of a hexacoordinate high-spin species, a pentacoordinate species is significantly populated. Isotope difference spectra clearly show that the heme group in the latter species has a hydroxide ligand and thereby is not coordinated by the proximal histidine. The stretching frequency of the Fe-OH moiety is 578 cm−1 and shifts to 553 cm−1 in H218O, as would be expected for a Fe-OH unit. On the other hand, the ferrous form of the protein shows substantial stability over a wide pH range. These observations suggest that Scapharca hemoglobin has a unique heme structure that undergoes substantial redox-dependent rearrangements that stabilize the Fe-proximal histidine bond in the functional deoxy form of the protein but not in the ferric form.

The stretching frequency of the Fe-OH moiety is 578 cm−1 and shifts to 553 cm−1 in H218O, as would be expected for a Fe-OH unit. On the other hand, the ferrous form of the protein shows substantial stability over a wide pH range. These observations suggest that Scapharca hemoglobin has a unique heme structure that undergoes substantial redox-dependent rearrangements that stabilize the Fe-proximal histidine bond in the functional deoxy form of the protein but not in the ferric form. The homodimeric hemoglobin (HbI) 1The abbreviations used are: HbI, homodimeric hemoglobin; HbA, human adult hemoglobin; Hb, hemoglobin; Mb, myoglobin; metHb, ferric hemoglobin; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid. isolated from arcid clam Scapharca inaequivalvis possesses unique structural features (1Spagnuolo C.

It displays a unique structural basis for cooperative ligand binding in that the two hemes face each other across the intersubunit contact and are able to communicate directly through their propionate groups (2Rousseau D.L.

As a consequence of this unusual structural linkage, cooperativity is accompanied by major tertiary changes in the heme environment with only minor rearrangements of the quaternary structure, in contrast to mammalian Hbs (2Rousseau D.L.

Biol. 1983; 164: 627-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The heme structure in the ferric form undergoes a spin transition that is dependent on pH and salt concentration (17Spagnuolo C. De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boffi A. Takahashi S. Spagnuolo C. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20437-20440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From our earlier studies by optical and resonance Raman spectroscopy, it was shown that a mixture of three distinct species are populated in the pH range 6–9 (17Spagnuolo C. De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boffi A. Takahashi S. Spagnuolo C. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20437-20440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a six-coordinate low-spin heme is favored at acidic pH and high ionic strength and is accompanied by the reversible dissociation of the HbI dimer into monomers. This species is likely to be formed by coordination of the distal histidine to the heme (in addition to the proximal histidine) as shown by EPR studies (18Boffi A. Takahashi S. Spagnuolo C. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20437-20440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At neutral pH values, a dimeric pentacoordinate species appears and becomes the dominant form at alkaline pH and low salt. A population of dimeric six-coordinate high-spin heme exists over the entire 6–9 pH-range and in both low and high salt. This six-coordinate high-spin species is a typical aquomet form (18Boffi A. Takahashi S. Spagnuolo C. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20437-20440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as that commonly observed in mammalian myoglobins (Mb) and hemoglobins (19Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Asher S.A. Schuster T.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5377-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The occurrence of a low-spin bishistidine heme has been proposed to exist in some invertebrate Hbs (21Arrendondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Sarath G. Moran J.F. Lohrman J. Olson J.S. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. (Rockville). 1997; 115: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Duff S.M. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D. J. Biol.

Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, conversion of a hexacoordinate species into a pentacoordinate form, as seen in HbI, is very rare in Mbs and Hbs, and the structure of the pentacoordinate species in HbI is not known. The ferric Mb from the molluskAplysia limacina is also reported to contain a pentacoordinate species at acidic pH (5.9) in which the proximal histidine is proposed to serve as the fifth ligand (24Rousseau D.L. Ching Y. Brunori M. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7878-7881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation of a strong pH-dependence of the ferric form ofAplysia Mb was suggested to be the consequence, in part, of the absence of a distal histidine (24Rousseau D.L. Ching Y. Brunori M. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7878-7881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scapharca HbI, on the other hand, contains a distal histidine yet also shows a strong pH dependence of the heme ligation structure. The optical spectrum and the relative intensity of the Raman marker line (ν3) of the pentacoordinate species in Aplysia Mb, however, are very different from the pentacoordinate species seen in ScapharcaHbI. Furthermore, as described above, the nature of the pH-dependent transition in Scapharca HbI is very unique as compared with the aquo-hydroxy transition in vertebrate Mbs and Hbs. Hence, it is important to determine whether the unique optical properties reflect some unanticipated axial ligation states in ferricScapharca HbI. Studies on the ferric form of Hbs (metHb) have significantly advanced our understanding of the structural basis for the cooperative transition in Hb. Under physiological conditions, metHb is formed by spontaneous autoxidation, and the redox equilibrium is shifted toward the reduced form by the metHb reductase system. Recently it was shown that the formation of metHb may result also from interaction with NOin vivo (25Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In addition, metHbs are extremely useful to study because numerous ligands form stable ferric heme complexes that have a wide range of electronic properties. Therefore, several studies on metHbs have been carried out as a means of understanding the mechanism of allosteric control (26Perutz M.F. Sanders J.K. Chenery D.H. Noble R.W. Pennelly R.R. Fung L.W.

In the present study, we have characterized the pentacoordinate form of oxidized Scapharca HbI by resonance Raman spectroscopy and identified the fifth ligand to the heme unambiguously as hydroxide rather than histidine. This finding, which provides direct evidence for cleavage of the Fe-proximal His bond in ferric HbI, is discussed in the framework of known manifestations of strain in that bond in ferrous HbI and in liganded T-state human hemoglobin crystals (34Paoli M. Dodson G. Liddington R.C. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The HbI from S. inaequivalvis was isolated and purified as described elsewhere (5Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The protein samples were oxidized by addition of potassium nitrite to the oxygenated protein. The excess oxidant was removed by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the desired buffer. The protein was stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The concentration of the protein samples used for the Raman measurements was 35 μm in 40 mm buffer (MES, pH 6.0; phosphate, pH 7.4; CHES, pH 9.0). To prepare the protein samples in isotopic water, the following composition was used: 35 μm ferric HbI, 40 mm buffer, 80% H218O or D2O (using 98% H218O from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA; D2O from Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI), and 20% H216O. Deoxy samples were prepared by adding an aliquot of dithionite solution to an anaerobic HbI solution prepared in buffers at the desired pH values. Absorption spectra were recorded before and after the Raman measurements to ensure the stability of the species studied. The samples were placed in a spinning cylindrical cell with a 2-mm light path. An incident laser frequency of 413.1 nm (Kr-ion laser, Spectra Physics) was used, and the Raman scattered light was dispersed through a polychromator (Spex, Metuchen, NJ) equipped with a 1200-grooves/mm grating and detected by a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments, Princeton, NJ) as described elsewhere in detail (35Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Resonance Raman Scattering: A Probe for Heme Protein-Bound Nitric Oxide. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). A holographic notch filter (Kaiser, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to remove the laser scattering. Typically, five 30-s spectra were recorded and averaged after removal of cosmic ray spikes by a standard software routine (CSMA, Princeton Instruments, NJ). The resonance Raman spectra of ferric Scapharca HbI, shown in Fig. 1, were measured at acid (pH 6.0) and alkaline (pH 9.0) pHs in 40 mm buffer. At alkaline pH, the pentacoordinate heme species is very prominent as judged by its ν3 band at 1490 cm−1. The spectrum shows also the presence of a six-coordinate low-spin (ν3 = 1506 cm−1) species and a small population of six-coordinate high-spin (ν3 = 1480 cm−1) species. At acid pH, however, the low-spin species is dominant. To identify the nature of the pentacoordinate species, the low frequency region of the spectra were measured at alkaline pH as a function of the isotopic composition of the water. The low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectrum is very useful in identifying metal-ligand vibrations as it can directly demonstrate the presence of a particular ligand and the nature of its interactions in the heme pocket (35Wang J. Caughey W.S. Rousseau D.L. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Resonance Raman Scattering: A Probe for Heme Protein-Bound Nitric Oxide. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., New York1996: 427-454Google Scholar). In particular, a line in the 490–560 cm−1region has been assigned to the Fe-OH stretching frequency in alkaline ferric hemoglobin, myoglobin, and horseradish peroxidase (19Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Asher S.A. Schuster T.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5377-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The position of this line is sensitive to the spin state of the metal and the strength of hydrogen bonding to the hydroxide moiety of these proteins. Fig. 2 shows the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra of ferric ScapharcaHbI in alkaline-buffered solutions of water of various isotopic composition. The Raman line at 578 cm−1 in H216O (Fig. 2, spectrum a) shifts to 553 cm−1 in H218O (spectrum b), and yields a clear difference spectrum (spectrum d). However, the spectrum in D2O (spectrum c) does not change appreciably compared with that in H2O as also seen from the difference spectrum shown inspectrum e. We assign the line with the oxygen isotope sensitivity as the iron-hydroxide stretching mode (νFe-OH) arising from the Fe-OH moiety of the five-coordinate heme in HbI. As expected for this assignment, the feature at 578/553 cm−1 is absent at pH 6 (data not shown), where the population of the five-coordinate heme is negligible. No isotope sensitivity was observed for any other line in the spectra at pH 6. It is important to note that the 25 cm−1 isotope shift (16O/18O) corresponds to a nearly ideal value (23.8 cm−1 assuming that the two oscillating units are the Fe and the OH) that would be expected from an “isolated” Fe-OH harmonic oscillator. In the event the OH group had strong hydrogen-bonding or strong non-bonding interactions, the expected isotope shift would not be observed because of a deviation from a perfect two-body oscillator (19Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One intriguing observation is that the Fe-OH moiety did not show any appreciable D2O effect. We postulate that such a situation could arise if the Fe-O-H unit exists in a significantly bent configuration so that the vibration of the O-H unit is not coupled with that of the Fe-O unit. In such a case, the Fe-O-H oscillator would show an isotope shift in H218O but would not be responsive to replacement of the hydrogen by deuterium (in D2O). In summary, the three heme species identified by optical and resonance Raman spectroscopy can be schematically represented as shown in Fig. 3. The pentacoordinate high-spin species (Fig. 3 a) is unambiguously assigned in the present work as a hydroxide form. Therefore, the proximal histidine bond is no longer retained; instead, the hydroxyl group binds to the iron accounting for the fifth ligand. The species shown in Fig. 3,b and c are, respectively, the high- and low-spin hexacoordinated forms, both of which retain their proximal Fe-His bond, but have water and the distal histidine, respectively, as their sixth ligands. The identity of the high-spin hexacoordinate form (Fig.3 b) is based on the similarity of its optical and resonance Raman spectra to those of aquomet Mbs and Hbs. The assignment of the low-spin hexacoordinate form (Fig. 3 c) relies on our previous EPR study (18Boffi A. Takahashi S. Spagnuolo C. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20437-20440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that determined g-values similar to those of the bishistidine heme complexes. Hence, it was inferred that the distal histidine binds the heme iron at acidic pH. In six-coordinate hydroxy complexes of hemeproteins with histidine or imidazole as an axial ligand, the νFe-OH mode is located in the 450–560-cm−1 region (19Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Asher S.A. Schuster T.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5377-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36Han S. Ching Y.C. Rousseau D.L. Nature. 1990; 348: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the five-coordinate form of HbI, νFe-OH appears at a significantly higher frequency. We attribute the high frequency to two origins. First, the absence of a ligand trans to the hydroxide can strengthen the Fe-OH bond in comparison with the case when the proximal histidine is present. Second, the higher frequency of the line as compared with the five-coordinate hydroxide species in the H175G mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase (37Sun J. Fitzgerald M.M. Goodin D.B. Loehr T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2064-2065Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as well as it being significantly narrower, indicates that there are no strong interactions between it and any neighboring residues in its binding pocket. The similarity of the very high frequency for νFe-OH in the hydroxide-bound heme in HbI to that in H93G Mb, also shown to be a five-coordinate hydroxide complex, 2T. K. Das, S. Franzen, A. Pond, J. H. Dawson, and D. L. Rousseau, unpublished results. suggest that the hydroxide group has a hydrophobic environment and there is a partially collapsed structure of the proximal cavity in HbI just as in H93G Mb. Thus, on cleavage of its bonding to the heme iron, the proximal histidine undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement resulting in a partial collapse of the proximal cavity. In turn, the heme, which remains inside the heme pocket because of stabilization by hydrophobic interactions, has an altered orientation as indicated by the changes in the polarized absorption spectra of ferric HbI crystals brought to alkaline pH (38Mozzarelli A. Bettati S. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Colotti G. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3627-3632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to ferric HbI, the ferrous form remains quite stable over a wide pH range, as judged from the invariance of all its properties, including the resonance Raman spectrum (data not shown). One specific feature is of interest, namely the very low Fe-His stretching frequency (203 cm−1) of the deoxygenated protein, which indicates a high degree of proximal strain (39Song S. Boffi A. Chiancone E. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6330-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite the proximal strain, the protein is able to bind oxygen cooperatively even if that leads to movement of the iron into the heme plane presumably straining the Fe-histidine bond even further. However, ligand-binding to the ferrous protein is facilitated by movement of Phe-97 that swings out of contact with the heme and the proximal histidine on ligand binding in the ferrous protein, hence performing a dual task of information transfer to the contralateral subunit and partially reducing the extra strain on the proximal histidine. We postulate that such structural rearrangements characteristic of the deoxy ↔ oxy transition do not take place in the hydroxide form in the ferric protein. If binding hydroxyl leaves the protein in its “T-like” state, Phe-97 does not reorient and will cause steric crowding of the proximal histidine destabilizing the Fe-His bond. The aftermath of the Fe-His bond rupture is a partial collapse of the proximal cavity that retains the heme group as a pentacoordinate hydroxide-bound species. Observation of a pentacoordinate ferric heme in native myoglobins or hemoglobins is uncommon (19Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Paoli M. Dodson G. Liddington R.C. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol.

North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). A pentacoordinate species observed in the Aplysia Mb at acidic pH values has a much broader and less intense ν3 line at 1495 cm−1, which is suggested to arise because of the destabilization of water binding to the heme and not to the breakage of the proximal histidine (24Rousseau D.L. Ching Y. Brunori M. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7878-7881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the proximal-histidine mutant of sperm whale Mb (H93G) on the other hand, the ν3 line appears at 1490 cm−1. In the absence of the proximal histidine, H93G stabilizes the heme as a pentacoordinate hydroxide-bound species2. Horseradish peroxidase stabilizes a pentacoordinate heme but without cleaving the proximal bond. Similarly, in freshly prepared native cytochrome c peroxidase, a five-coordinate heme is the stable form, coordinated by the proximal histidine (41Dasgupta S. Rousseau D.L. Anni H. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 654-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a mutant (H175G) of cytochrome cperoxidase, where the proximal histidine was mutated to a non-coordinating ligand, the heme showed a mixture of aquomet complexes including a pentacoordinate species that was suggested to be a heme-hydroxide complex (37Sun J. Fitzgerald M.M. Goodin D.B. Loehr T.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 2064-2065Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cleavage of the Fe-proximal His bond in alkaline ferric HbI is particularly intriguing in light of recent crystallographic observations on human cyano-met T-state ferric HbA (34Paoli M. Dodson G. Liddington R.C. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quite unexpectedly, the analysis of the heme geometry and coordination state revealed that the distance between the iron and the nitrogen of the proximal histidine in the cyanide-bound α-chains is much too long to allow for covalent bond formation (2.9–3.1 Å). Thus, the α-chains in ferric, cyanide-bound T-state HbA is another example of a pentacoordinate species in which the proximal bond is broken because of the presence of a strong iron ligand on the distal side. Yet, in the β chains, cyanide binding leaves the proximal bond unaltered, indicating that its effective strength does not depend solely on the presence of a strong distal ligand. Moreover, in contrast to the behavior of the hydroxide adduct, in the cyano complex of HbI, there is no evidence for rupture of the proximal histidine bond (12Boffi A. Chiancone E. Takahashi S. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4505-4509Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this connection, it should be noted that a number of spectroscopic markers point to a strained, distorted coordination of the heme iron in ferrous HbI, e.g. the broad anisotropic EPR signal of the Co-porphyrin protein (42Verzili D. Santucci R. Ikeda-Saito M. Chiancone E. Ascoli F. Yonetani T. Antonini E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 704: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the small hyperfine shift of the Nδ proton resonance (43Inubushi T. Yonetani T. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and the unusually low frequency of the Fe-His mode (39Song S. Boffi A. Chiancone E. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6330-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these features are shared by the α chains in the ferrous HbA tetramer (44Takahashi S. Lin A.K. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5196-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 45Yonetani T. Yamamoto H. Izuka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2168-2174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the heme coordination geometry and the properties of the exogenous ligand both determine whether or not the proximal histidine bond will be ruptured. In several ferrous heme proteins, rupture of the proximal histidine bond has been observed when NO adducts are formed (13Coletta M. Boffi A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. Chiancone E. J. Biol.

In deoxy hemoglobin, a five-coordinate NO complex forms in the α-chains in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, and in myoglobin, the five-coordinate NO complex forms at low pH (pH ∼4). The five-coordinate form of ferrous guanylate cyclase, generated by the coordination of NO, has been postulated as the active structure that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP (47Fan B. Gupta G. Danziger R.S. Friedman J.M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 49Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S.

Thus, determination of the factors that lead to the rupture of the proximal histidine bond are essential for the full understanding of the functional forms of these proteins. In conclusion, the present data on HbI and the comparison with liganded T-state HbA suggest that pentacoordinate derivatives which lack the proximal iron-histidine bond do not occur solely in selected hemoglobin and myoglobin mutants but may have a general significance in the native proteins. The biochemical consequences of this unique heme coordination on the kinetics and thermodynamics of anionic ligand binding to ferric hemoproteins remain to be determined and will be the object of future investigations."

The structure of an isolated domain 1 of human annexin I has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. The sequential assignments of the 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances of the isolated domain 1 were established by multinuclear, multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The solution structure of the isolated domain 1 was derived from 1,099 experimental NMR restraints using a hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol. The root mean square deviation of the ensemble of 20 refined conformers that represent the structure from the mean coordinate set derived from them was 0.57 ± 0.14 Å and 1.11 ± 0.19 Å for the backbone atoms and all heavy atoms, respectively. The NMR structure of the isolated domain 1 could be superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 1.36 Å for all backbone atoms with the corresponding part of the crystal structure of a truncated human annexin I containing all four domains, indicating that the structure of the isolated domain 1 is highly similar to that when it folded together with the other three domains. The result suggests that in contrast to isolated domain 2, which is largely unfolded in solution, isolated domain 1 constitutes an autonomous folding unit and interdomain interactions may play critical roles in the folding of annexin I.

Most proteins in nature are large multidomain proteins (1Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 387-390Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). While a great deal of knowledge on the folding properties of small single-domain proteins has been acquired (2$$Google Scholar), our understanding of the folding of multidomain proteins is still poor. It has been suggested that the domains of large proteins fold independently and subsequently assemble to form the native structures (3Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 4Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3147-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 5Jaenicke R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 209-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Annexins are a large family of ubiquitous proteins that bind to phospholipids in the presence of calcium ions (6Barton G.J. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Morgan R.R. Fernádez M.-P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 967-979PubMed Google Scholar). Although their physiological functions are not clear, these proteins are implicated in many important cellular processes (8Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) such as exocytosis (9Creutz C.E. Science. 1992; 258: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 10Donnelly S.R. Moss S.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and ion channeling (11Voges D. Berendes R. Demange P. Benz J. Gottig P. Liemann S. Huber R. Burger A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1995; 71: 209-239PubMed Google Scholar). All annexins contain four homologous repeats of ∼70 residues (see Fig. 1, a and c) and a variable N terminus, with the exception of annexin VI, which has four additional repeats. The crystal structures of annexins I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and XII have been determined (12Liemann S. Huber R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As revealed by x-ray crystallography, each repeat forms a compact domain consisting of five helices. All the domains are highly similar in structure, as illustrated in Fig. 1 b with the four domains of annexin I. The four domains of each annexin are arranged in a planar-cyclic manner with domain 4 in contact with domain 1, as depicted in Fig.1 a. Domains 1 and 4 as well as domains 2 and 3 have many tight hydrophobic contacts, mainly involving helices B and E, constituting two two-domain modules. The interactions between the two modules are mostly hydrophilic via helices A and B of domains 2 and 4, forming a central hydrophilic channel. With the well defined domains and the simple and elegant structure, annexins are excellent models for studying the folding mechanisms of multidomain proteins. Using synthetic peptides and more recently recombinant peptides, Sanson and co-workers (13Macquaire F. Baleux F. Huynh Dinh T. Rouge D. Neumann J.M. Sanson A.

Biol. 1998; 279: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been systematically studying the folding properties of domain 2 of human annexin I. They have clearly shown, with CD and NMR, that isolated domain 2 of annexin I is largely unfolded in aqueous solution (15Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Chaffotte A. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10347-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A preliminary study on the folding properties of domain 1 has also been reported (17Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Russo-Marie F. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our approach to dissect the folding mechanism of annexin I is to compare the folding properties of the intact protein and the four isolated domains. We have expressed the entire annexin I and the four individual domains in Escherichia coli. Using multidimensional NMR techniques, we have determined the solution structure of domain 1 (residues 14–86, according to the numbering of the crystal structure of an N-terminal truncated human annexin I (18Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)). The NMR structure of the isolated domain 1 is highly similar to the corresponding part of the crystal structure of a truncated human annexin I containing all four domains (18Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The result shows that in contrast to isolated domain 2, which is largely unfolded in solution, isolated domain 1 constitutes an autonomous folding unit. Comparative structural analysis suggests that interdomain interactions may play critical roles in the folding of annexin I. The E. coli clone containing the cDNA encoding human annexin I was purchased from ATCC (ATCC number 65114, deposited by Joel Ernst). The expression vector pET-17b was purchased from Novagen. DNA sequencing kit was obtained from United States Biochemical. Enzymes for recombinant DNA experiments were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or New England Biolabs.15NH4Cl and [13C6]-d-glucose were purchased from ISOTEC. Other chemicals were analytical or reagent grade from commercial sources. The amino acid sequence of domain 1 of human annexin I is shown in Fig. 1 c. The portion of human annexin I cDNA that encodes domain 1 was cloned into the expression vector pET-17b by polymerase chain reaction and other standard recombinant DNA techniques. The primers used for the polymerase chain reaction cloning were 5′-GGAATTCCATATGACCTTCAATCCATCCTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGGATCCTTATTTTAGCAGAGCTAAAACAAC-3′ (reverse). The correct amino acid sequence was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing of the DNA insert in the expression construct pET-17b-ANX1D1. Unlabeled protein was produced by growing the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing the expression construct pET-17b-ANX1D1 in LB media in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C without IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DQF-COSY, double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RMSD, root mean square deviation; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HCCH-TOCSY, proton-carbon-carbon-proton correlation using carbon TOCSY; HNCACB, amide proton to nitrogen to α/β carbon correlation; CBCA(CO)NH, α/β proton to α/β carbon (via carbonyl carbon) to nitrogen to amide proton correlation. induction. Uniformly15N-labeled protein was produced by growing the same expression strain in M9 media with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source, and uniformly15N/13C-labeled protein was produced in M9 media with 15NH4Cl and [13C6] d-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Protein production in the M9 media was induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mm when the cultures reached an A 600of ∼1.0. The culture was incubated for 4 more h after addition of IPTG. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in buffer A (40 mm acetate, pH 5.3). The bacterial suspension was sonicated on ice and centrifuged (27,000 × g) at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a CM-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A until A 280 of the eluent was less than 0.05. Elution of the column was achieved by a linear NaCl gradient (0–500 mm in buffer A) and monitored byA 280 and 15% SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing domain 1 of annexin I were pooled and concentrated by an Amicon ultrafiltration cell using a YM3 membrane. The protein preparations were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. Isotopically labeled proteins were further purified by a Sephadex G-50 column. The protein solutions were dialyzed against double distilled water, lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein in 20 mm[2-2H]acetate, pH 5.2 (pH meter reading without correction for isotope effects), in H2O/2H2O(9/1) or2H2O. The protein concentrations of the NMR samples were 2–5 mm. NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker DMX 600 spectrometer at The Ohio State University, a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer at Bruker, Billerica, MA, or a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer at Varian Application Laboratories. Homonuclear two-dimensional spectra recorded were DQF-COSY (D2O) (19Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar,20Rance M.

Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the program PIPP (36Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Briefly, solvent suppression was improved by convolution of time domain data (37Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar). The data size in each indirectly detected dimension of the three-dimensional data was extended by backward-forward linear prediction (38Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 100: 202-207Google Scholar). A 45°-shifted sine bell and single zero-filling were generally applied before Fourier transformation in each dimension. Approximate interproton distance restraints were derived from sequentially assigned NOEs. NOE cross-peaks between aliphatic protons were picked from the homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY spectrum, and those involving amide protons were from the three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum. The NOE intensities obtained by the program PIPP were converted into approximate interproton distances by normalizing them against the calibrated intensities of NOE peaks between backbone amide protons (dNN) within the identified α-helices. The upper limits of the interproton distances were calibrated according to the equation Va =Vb(rb/ra)6, where Va and Vb were the NOE intensities and ra andrb were the distances. The distance bounds were then set to 1.8–2.7 Å (1.8–2.9Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons), 1.8–3.3 Å (1.8–3.5 Å for NOE cross-peaks involving amide protons), and 1.8–5.0 Å corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. Pseudoatom corrections were made for nonstereospecifically assigned methylene and methyl resonances (39Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bounds for methyl protons. NMR structures were calculated with a hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol (40Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) using the program X-PLOR (Version 3.1) (41Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) on an SGI Indigo II workstation. A square-well potential function with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 was applied for the distance restraints. The X-PLOR frepel function was used to simulate van der Waals interactions, with atomic radii set to 0.80 times their CHARMM values (42Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar) and a force constant of 4.0 kcal mol−1Å−4. A total of fifty structures were generated using this protocol. The structures were inspected by the programs MOMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and QUANTA96 (Molecular Simulations) and analyzed by PROCHECK-NMR (Version 3.4.4) (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 45Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). An iterative strategy was used for the structure refinement. In each round of structure refinement, newly computed NMR structures were employed to assign more NOE restraints, to correct wrong assignments, and to loosen the NOE distance bounds if spectral overlapping was deduced. Then another round of structure refinement was carried out with the modified NMR restraints. All structures were converged after several rounds of such refinement. An ensemble of 20 structures was selected according to their best fit to the experimental NMR restraints and the low values of their total energies. Total sequential resonance assignments of the isolated domain 1 were achieved by the combined analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR data, including three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY. The sequential assignments of the backbone and side-chain amide resonances are shown in Fig. 2. Stereospecific assignments were made for about 70% of β-methylene protons and the methyl groups of valine and leucine residues based on qualitative estimations of3Jαβ constants from the DQF-COSY spectrum in conjunction with the NOE data (46Basus V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 132-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A total of 1099 structurally useful distance restraints were obtained from the analyses of the homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY (D2O) and three-dimensional 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectra (Table I), 707 of which were medium and long range NOEs. In average, each residue had ∼15 NOE restraints. A superposition of 20 calculated structures with no NOE restraint violations above 0.5 Å is shown in Fig. 3 a. The statistics of the structures are summarized in Table I. The precision of the structures (RMSD of the ensemble of the 20 NMR structures from its mean coordinate) was 0.57 Å for the backbone (N, Cα, C', O) and 1.11 Å for all heavy atoms. The distribution of the average backbone RMSDs is shown in Fig.4 a. The structure of domain 1 consists of five α-helices: helix A, residues 5–15; helix B, residues 22–30; helix C, residues 34–47; helix D, residues 52–58; and helix E, residues 63–70 (numbering according to the isolated domain 1). Helices A, B, D, and E are assembled in a bundle with two nearly parallel helix-loop-helix motifs. Helix C lies approximately perpendicular to the helical bundle with one end close to the N terminus and the other to the C terminus of domain 1.Table IStructural statisticsRestraints for structure calculationsTotal NOE restraints1099Intraresidue392Medium range (1 ≤ ‖i − j‖ ≤ 4)549Long range (‖i − j‖ > 4)158Statistics for structure calculations{SA}1-a{SA} is the ensemble of 20 NMR solution structures of domain 1. 〈SA〉 is the mean atomic structure obtained by averaging the individual structures following a superimposition of the backbone heavy atoms. 〈SA〉r is the energy-minimized average structure.〈SA〉rNOE violations (>0.5 Å)00RMSD from distance restraints (Å)0.026 ± 0.0010.027RMSD from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0034 ± 0.00010.0033Angle (°)0.56 ± 0.010.54Impropers (°)0.39 ± 0.020.36X-PLOR potential energies (kcal/mol)1-bThe distance constraints were used with a square-well potential (F noe = 50 kcal mol−1Å−2).

Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The truncated annexin I lacks the N-terminal 32 residues but has four domains all intact (Fig. 1 a). Six calcium ions are found to bind to the truncated annexin I, two each in domains 1 and 4 and one each in domains 2 and 3. The solution structure of the isolated domain 1 is highly similar to the corresponding part of the crystal structure of the truncated annexin I containing all four domains. Thus, the minimized average NMR structure of the isolated domain 1 can be superimposed very well with the corresponding x-ray structure as shown in Fig. 3 b. There are 1–2 residue differences in the lengths of some helices but the five helices are assembled in the same way. The distribution of the average backbone RMSDs of the ensemble of the 20 NMR structures from the corresponding x-ray structure is shown in Fig. 4 b. The largest differences are found at the N terminus and in the AB loop. It should be noted that the NMR structure of the isolated domain 1 was determined in the absence of Ca2+. The difference in the conformations of the AB loop could be because of binding of Ca2+ because the carbonyls of Gly-32 and Val-33 in the AB loop along with the carboxylate of Glu-35 at the N terminus of helix B form a calcium-binding site. However, binding of Ca2+ to the second calcium-binding site apparently does not cause any significant conformational change because the conformation of the DE loop that constitutes the second site is essentially the same as that found in the crystal structure, probably because the second site has lower affinity for Ca2+ than the first site. As described earlier, the four domains of annexin I are highly homologous in structure when folded together (Fig. 1, a and b). The hydrophobic cores are highly conserved among all annexin domains. Surprisingly, isolated domain 2 is largely unfolded in aqueous solution and thus is not an independent folding unit (15Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Chaffotte A. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10347-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Its helical content is less than 25% compared with ∼80% when the domain is folded together with the rest of the protein. In contrast to domain 2, our work presented here clearly demonstrates that the isolated domain 1 is fully folded in solution with little change in structure from that in the native state, and thus constitutes an autonomous folding unit. The results present an interesting question of why the domains with high sequential and structural homologies exhibit totally different folding behaviors. The failure of the isolated domain 2 to form its native structure is likely because of the removal of the interdomain interactions that exist in the whole protein. As mentioned earlier, according to the crystal structure of annexin I (18Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), domains 2 and 3 form a modular structure with many hydrophobic interactions, and so do domains 1 and 4. Thus, it is unlikely that the removal of the hydrophobic contacts with domain 3 is the cause for the folding failure of the isolated domain 2. By default then, the removal of the interactions with domain 4 may be the cause for the failure of the isolated domain 2 to fold to its native structure. Indeed, there are many interactions between domain 2 and domain 4 as shown in Fig. 5. This explanation is supported by the NMR studies of the isolated domain 2 and its components helices A and B (14Odaert B. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12820-12829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Chaffotte A. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10347-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has been shown by NMR that a stable nonnative N-terminal cap, with the sequence F91D92A93D94E95L96(numbering according to the crystal structure of the truncated annexin I), is formed in helix A in a peptide fragment containing helices A and B of domain 2 (14Odaert B. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12820-12829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With the carboxyl groups of Asp-92 and Glu-95 hydrogen-bonded to their reciprocal backbone amides and many hydrophobic contacts between Phe-91 and Leu-96, it is a canonical N-terminal cap (47Harper E.T. Rose G.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 48Seale J.W. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the nonnative cap persists in isolated domain 2 (15Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Chaffotte A. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10347-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Lirsac P.-N. Russo-Marie F. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the nonnative N-terminal cap serve as a very potent initiation site for folding (14Odaert B. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12820-12829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it may be more likely that the formation of the nonnative N-terminal cap prevents the isolated domain 2 from reaching the native state for two reasons although its role in the folding of entire annexin I is not known. First, it disrupts a pair of hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl group of Asp-92 and the guanidinium group of Arg-117 that helps to lock helices A and B in place (18Weng X. Luecke H. Song I.S. Kang D.S. Kim S.H. Huber R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The breakage of the hydrogen bond also makes it possible for Arg-117 to form nonnative salt bridges as found in the isolated domain 2 (16Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Lirsac P.-N. Russo-Marie F. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, as shown in Fig. 5, in the native structure, Leu-96 is roughly at the center of the hydrophobic core. It is surrounded by as many as seven core residues: Met-100 from helix A; Leu-110, Ile-113, and Ile-114 from helix B; Ile-125 and Tyr-129 from helix C; and Leu-137 from helix D. On the other hand, the side-chains of Phe-91 and Leu-96 are >10 Å apart. Thus, the nonnative hydrophobic interactions between Phe-91 and Leu-96 in the isolated domain may not only take out the side-chain of Leu-96 from the hydrophobic core structure but also disrupt the packing of the other hydrophobic core residues. The nonnative conformation of the isolated domain 2, however, may not necessarily have a lower energy than the native conformation. The nonnative N-terminal cap may act as a kinetic trap that keeps the isolated domain 2 from reaching the native structure. Why does the nonnative N-terminal cap form in the isolated domain 2? The separation of domain 2 from the rest of the protein has two structural consequences that may bear on the formation of the nonnative N-terminal cap as shown in Fig. 5. First, it breaks four hydrogen bonds between domains 2 and 4, namely Glu-95/Lys-267, Asp-108/Lys-254, and Glu-112/Arg-271 (two hydrogen bonds). The salt bridge between Glu-107 of domain 2 and Lys-235 of domain 3 is also broken. This leaves a cluster of negatively charged residues without positively charged partners, including Glu-95, Asp-106, Glu-107, Asp-108, and Glu-112. The carboxyl group of Glu-95 is ∼6.7 Å away from that of Asp-106 and ∼7.1 Å away from that of Glu-112. It is likely that the negative charge potential generated by the cluster of acidic residues may push away the carboxyl group of Glu-95 so that it forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Asp-92. Second, Phe-91 is almost completely buried in the whole protein but its side-chain becomes mostly exposed to solvent in the isolated domain 2. Thus, Phe-91 in the isolated domain 2 seeks hydrophobic partners, and it finds Leu-96. It is noted that Phe-91 and Glu-95 are replaced by a serine and an alanine, respectively, in domain 1 (Fig. 1 c). Therefore, the nonnative N-terminal cap is unlikely to form in the folding process of the isolated domain 1. The hypothesis may be tested by replacing Phe-91 and Glu-95 of domain 2 with the corresponding amino acids of domain 1 by site-directed mutagenesis. Refolding at a higher salt concentration may also help the isolated domain 2 to reach the native conformation by reducing the effects of the negative charges of the cluster of acidic residues and strengthening the hydrophobic interactions to drive formation of the hydrophobic core. For multidomain proteins, the formation of a native structure requires not only the correct folding of each domain but also the appropriate assembly of the domains via interdomain interactions. However, little is known about the roles of interdomain interactions during the folding process. As discussed above, interdomain interactions may play a critical role in the folding of domain 2 of annexin I. It is interesting to note that among the four domains of annexin I, only domain 1 is folded and soluble when expressed in E. coli. Domain 2 is soluble but largely unfolded. Expression of separated domains 3 and 4 in E. coli results in inclusion bodies (data not shown). It has been reported that domain 3 is easily degraded, but domain 4 forms inclusion bodies when expressed as fusion proteins of glutathione transferase (17Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Guerois R. Russo-Marie F. Neumann J.-M. Sanson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It appears that only domain 1 is an autonomous folding unit, although it is not known at present whether domains 3 and 4 can be solubilized and refolded to their native structures. As described earlier, annexin I is composed of two modules. One module consists of domains 1 and 4, and the other domains 2 and 3. Each module has a hydrophobic interface between its constituents. The two modules are assembled with mostly hydrophilic interactions between domains 2 and 4. It is tempting to speculate that folding of annexin I follows a sequential process with domain 1 as an autonomous initial folding unit. The folded structure of domain 1 facilitates the folding of domain 4 through the hydrophobic interface. Then, the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between domains 4 and 2 help domain 2 to get rid of the nonnative cap and reach the native structure. Domain 2, in turn, assists the folding of domain 3 through many hydrophobic interdomain interactions. This proposal can be tested by systematic studies of the folding properties of the entire protein and separated domains of annexin I. We are indebted to Drs. Charles Cottrell, Clemens Anklin, and George Gray for assistance in acquiring the NMR data. We thank Drs. Xiangwei Weng and Sung-Hou Kim for providing us the unpublished coordinate of the refined crystal structure of annexin I at 1.8-Å resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1979694688,"We reported recently that a rabbit reticulocyte 66-kDa protein (termed RF-hsp 70 by our laboratory and p60 and hop by others) functions as a hsp 70 recycling protein and markedly enhances the renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70 (Gross, M., and Hessefort, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 16833–16841). In this report, we confirm that the ability of RF-hsp 70 to promote the conversion of hsp 70·ADP to hsp 70·ATP, thus enhancing the protein folding activity of hsp 70, is caused by the purified 66-kDa protein and not by a trace DnaJ/hsp 40 protein contaminant. To determine the relationship between RF-hsp 70 and the DnaJ/hsp 40 heat shock protein family, which also enhances protein renaturation by hsp 70, we purified a 38-kDa protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate based upon its ability to stimulate renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70. Partial amino acid sequencing of this 38-kDa protein has indicated, unexpectedly, that it is the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D) and that it does not contain detectable sequences corresponding to the DnaJ/hsp 40 protein family. In addition, immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal antibody made to HeLa cell hsp 40 (from StressGen) confirms that our purified ALA-D contains no hsp 40, although hsp 40 is present in relatively crude rabbit reticulocyte protein fractions. Rabbit reticulocyte ALA-D is about as active in converting δ-aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen and as Zn2+-dependent as ALA-D purified from other sources. Rabbit reticulocyte ALA-D stimulates the renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70 up to 10-fold at concentrations that are the same as or less than that of hsp 70, and it has no renaturation activity in the absence of hsp 70. The renaturation effect of ALA-D is additive with that of RF-hsp 70 at limiting or saturating concentrations of each, and, unlike RF-hsp 70, ALA-D does not promote the dissociation of hsp 70·ADP in the presence of ATP. The renaturation-enhancing effect of ALA-D may be caused by a region near its carboxyl terminus which has sequence homology to the highly conserved domain of the DnaJ protein family, which is similar to the sequence homology between this domain and a carboxyl-terminal region in auxilin, a DnaJ-like protein that requires this region for its hsp 70-dependent function (Ungewickell, E., Ungewickell, H., Holstein, S. E. H., Lindner, R., Prasad, K., Barouch, W., Martin, B., Greene, L. E., and Eisenberg, E. (1995) Nature 378, 632–635).

Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with a recycling function, RF-hsp 70 increases by 10-fold the rate of renaturation of heat-denatured luciferase by hsp 70 (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Extensive amino acid sequence analysis of RF-hsp 70 demonstrated (2Gross M. Hessefort S. Olin A. Reddy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16842-16849Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that it is structurally homologous to human IEF SSP 3521 (3Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J.

However, when recombinantly expressed (in bacteria) IEF SSP 3521 was tested, it failed to enhance the renaturation of luciferase (6Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O.

Further testing of the recombinant human homolog of RF-hsp 70 (termed hop) by Johnson et al. (8Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recombinant hop failed to stimulate the ATPase activity of hsp 70, the dissociation of hsp 70·ADP, and the binding of ATP to hsp 70 (8Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O.

In addition, several recent reports have demonstrated that members of the DnaJ/hsp 40 protein family, YDJ-1 and Hdj-1, do promote, respectively, the renaturation of luciferase (9Schumacher R.J.

Because of these contrasting findings and the finding that trace amounts of DnaJ/hsp 40 protein can contaminate other proteins involved in the renaturation process and influence their activity (9Schumacher R.J.

To determine the relationship between the effects of RF-hsp 70 and the DnaJ protein family, we purified a protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate which stimulates the hsp 70-mediated renaturation of denatured luciferase by a mechanism that is distinct from that of RF-hsp 70. This protein migrates as a 38-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the size characteristic of the DnaJ protein family. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of this protein has demonstrated, however, that it is the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA-D), and immunoblot analysis has confirmed that it is free of any hsp 40. In addition, enzymatic assay has demonstrated that the purified 38-kDa protein converts δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen (PBG). We will show that the ability of this protein to enhance renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70 may be caused by a region near its carboxyl terminus which has considerable sequence homology to the highly conserved J domain characteristic of the DnaJ protein family. In this regard, the protein folding enhancement we have observed with ALA-D may be similar to the role that auxilin is believed to play in the hsp 70-mediated uncoating of reconstituted clathrin baskets (12Ungewickell E.

Auxilin action is believed to be mediated by a region near its carboxyl terminus which shows the same degree of homology to the DnaJ consensus sequence (12Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H.

The purification of hsp 70 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate was as described previously (14Gross M. Olin A. Hessefort S. Bender S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22738-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its purity is demonstrated in Fig. 1 B (lane 9). Its migration upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequencing of a 35-amino acid polypeptide containing its carboxyl terminus, obtained by limited chymotrypsin digestion, indicate that this hsp 70 is the constitutively expressed form or hsc 73 (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, this was the hsp 70 preparation used in all experiments. The purification of hsp 90 and RF-hsp 70 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate was as described (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except that the final purification step (step 6) for RF-hsp 70 employed chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (1.0 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Step 5 RF-hsp 70 (0.50 ml and up to 4 mg/ml protein) was applied, and the column was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.50 ml/min using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system. The absorbance at 280 nm was monitored, and 0.50-ml fractions were collected. This step 6 RF-hsp 70 appears homogeneous even when a large excess (2 μg) is subjected to gel electrophoresis and silver staining (see Fig. 1 A). We have found recently that chromatography on Mono Q, used previously to prepare step 6 RF-hsp 70 (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), may result in a major loss of activity. The initial purification of a 38-kDa protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, involving preparation of the postribosomal supernatant (step 1), precipitation at pH 5.2 (step 2), 0–40% ammonium sulfate precipitation (step 3), and then chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (step 4), was as described for the initial purification of ProHCR (15Gross M. Mendelewski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 520: 650-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Up to 10 mg of step 4 protein was then applied to a 0.5 × 5.0-cm (1.0 ml) Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After washing with 3.0 ml of equilibration buffer, the column was developed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and brought to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 240 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA in 3.0 min and then to 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA over an additional 14.0-min period. The 38-kDa protein, eluting at about 380 mm KCl, was pooled from multiple runs and concentrated by ultrafiltration to about 1.0 mg/ml (Amicon; YM-5 membrane) and made 10% (v/v) with glycerol to give step 5 protein. This preparation (0.50 ml) was then chromatographed on Superdex 200 exactly as described above for preparing step 6 RF-hsp 70. The 38-kDa protein (step 6) was pooled from multiple runs, concentrated by ultrafiltration to about 1.5 mg/ml, made 10% (v/v) with glycerol, and stored in liquid nitrogen. It appears homogeneous when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (see Fig. 1 B). The ability of specific proteins to promote the renaturation of heat-denatured luciferase was determined as described previously (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, firefly luciferase was diluted to about 0.5 nm, duplicate aliquots were removed for determination of the initial activity, and the remainder was heated at 40 °C for 20 min, reducing luciferase activity to about 6% of its initial activity. When samples were renatured for a single time period, renaturation reactions, in duplicate, contained 2.5 μl of heated luciferase, 0.50 mm ATP, 15 mm creatine phosphate, 45 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and the protein additions indicated in the figure and table legends in a final volume of 25 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 4 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. When renaturation was followed with time, samples were similar but scaled up to 110 μl. Incubation was at 32 °C and for the indicated times. Luciferase activity was measured in 25-μl samples by mixing with 100 μl of 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.7 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmd-luciferin, 0.25 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm ATP and counting immediately in a TM Analytic model 6895 liquid scintillation spectrometer (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the percentage of the initial activity of unheated luciferase. Partially purified or pure preparations of the 38-kDa protein were assayed for ALA-D activity under conditions that were similar to those used for assessing the effect of the 38-kDa protein on the renaturation of luciferase described above. Duplicate samples contained up to 60 μg/ml 38-kDa protein and 2 mm ALA in a final volume of 150 μl of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5.0 μm ZnCl2. Incubation was at 37 °C, and 50-μl aliquots were removed at 7.5, 15, and 30 min to determine the rate of formation of PBG. In one experiment (see Fig. 4), the concentration of added ZnCl2varied, and in another (see Fig. 5), samples were incubated in 5 mm dithiothreitol and either 50 mm Tris-HCl or sodium phosphate at the indicated pH values. PBG was determined as described by Sassa (16Sassa S. Enzyme. 1982; 28: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) by mixing 50-μl aliquots with 125 μl of 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.1 m HgCl2, centrifugation, and removal and mixing of 150 μl of each supernatant with 150 μl of modified Ehrlich's reagent (16Sassa S. Enzyme. 1982; 28: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). After maximal color development (10–15 min at room temperature), the absorbance at 553 nm was determined and converted to μmol of PBG formed/h using a molar absorption coefficient of 6.1 × 104 (16Sassa S. Enzyme. 1982; 28: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of pH on the enzymatic activity of ALA-D. The rate of formation of PBG from ALA by 40 μg/ml step 6 ALA-D was determined at the indicated pH values in samples buffered with 50 mm sodium phosphate (closed circles) or Tris-HCl (open circles). All samples contained a final concentration of 5.0 μm ZnCl2. Aliquots were removed at 7.5, 15, and 30 min to determine the rate of reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequencing was performed in an Applied Biosystems 473A sequencer equipped with an on-line ATZ to phenylthiohydantoin autoconverter, a gradient-programmable microbore chromatography system, and a Macintosh-based 610A data system to identify and quantitate the amino acid residues. Amino-terminal sequencing of the intact, step 6, 38-kDa protein was performed (see Fig. 2). In addition, 90 μg of this protein was digested with 7.5 μg of trypsin for 9.2 h at 34 °C, and the tryptic peptides were isolated by reverse phase chromatography on an Aquapore RP-300 column as described previously (2Gross M. Hessefort S. Olin A. Reddy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16842-16849Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of protein samples on 7% polyacrylamide-SDS slab gels (17Gross M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2073-2079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been described previously. Reagents for the renaturation and assay of firefly luciferase were all from Sigma, except that dithiothreitol was obtained from Calbiochem. All protein standards and ALA were purchased from Sigma, and [α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN. Reagents for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad, and electrophoresis equipment was from Hoefer. To verify that the activity of RF-hsp 70 is attributable to its 66-kDa component, which is homologous to human IEF SSP 3521 (3Honoré B. Leffers H. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Vandekerckhove J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and not to a possible DnaJ protein contaminant, we subjected a large excess of several step 6 RF-hsp 70 samples to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The results (Fig. 1 A) demonstrate that these preparations contain no protein migrating faster than the 66-kDa band, indicating that they are devoid of a DnaJ protein member, which would migrate at about 40 kDa. In addition, immunoblot analysis of an excess of steps 5 and 6 RF-hsp 70, using a polyclonal antibody made against HeLa cell hsp 40 (see Fig. 3, lanes 10and 8, respectively), confirms that these preparations are devoid of any hsp 40. To investigate the relationship between the action of RF-hsp 70 and the DnaJ protein family, we attempted to purify the corresponding DnaJ protein from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Using the stimulation of the renaturation of heat-denatured luciferase by hsp 70 as our assay, we purified a relatively abundant protein that migrates as a 38-kDa band on a denaturing gel, a size that is consistent with a DnaJ protein family member. The purification of this protein, based upon its ability to enhance hsp 70-mediated renaturation of luciferase, is shown in Table I, under “Luciferase renaturation,” and gel analysis of the protein at different steps in the purification is shown in Fig. 1 B. The results indicate that this 38-kDa protein is purified to near homogeneity at step 5 (Mono Q) and to apparent homogeneity at step 6 (Superdex 200), as seen in Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 7, respectively. For comparison, purified RF-hsp 70 and hsp 70 have been run in lanes 8 and 9, respectively (Fig.1 B). We chose to purify the 38-kDa protein from the pH 5.2 precipitate and 0–40% ammonium sulfate fractions (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 3, respectively) because the pH 5.2 soluble fraction (not shown) and the 40–80% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) have virtually no 38-kDa protein. In contrast, RF-hsp 70 is found almost entirely in the 40–80% ammonium sulfate fraction, which was used for its purification (1Gross M. Hessefort S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16833-16841Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results in Table I, “Luciferase renaturation,” indicate that the 38-kDa protein, based upon its ability to enhance the renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70, has been purified 29-fold from the ammonium sulfate fraction (step 3) with a yield of 12%. We are not able to determine the activity of the 38-kDa protein in steps 1 and 2 because they also contain RF-hsp 70.Table IPurification of a rabbit reticulocyte 38-kDa protein (ALA-D)StepVolumeConcentrationLuciferase renaturationALA conversion to PBGUnits/mlUnits/mgPurificationYieldUnits/mlUnits/mgPurificationYieldmlmg/ml-fold%-fold%1.

One unit of renaturation activity is defined as the amount required to renature luciferase to 25% of its initial activity when incubated for 60 min under renaturation conditions and in the presence of 1.0 μm hsp 70 in a final volume of 25 μl. One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount required to produce 1 μmol of PBG/h at 37 °C and pH 7.5. Both assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab A 38-kDa protein (ALA-D) was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and its activity was assessed by the stimulation of the renaturation of luciferase (left) or the enzymatic conversion of ALA to PBG (right). One unit of renaturation activity is defined as the amount required to renature luciferase to 25% of its initial activity when incubated for 60 min under renaturation conditions and in the presence of 1.0 μm hsp 70 in a final volume of 25 μl. One unit of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount required to produce 1 μmol of PBG/h at 37 °C and pH 7.5. Both assays are described under “Experimental Procedures.” We had presumed that the 38-kDa protein may be a rabbit reticulocyte lysate DnaJ protein (hsp 40) member because of its size, relative abundance (an estimated concentration of 0.1 mg/ml as indicated below), and ability to enhance luciferase renaturation by hsp 70. However, when we subjected the purified 38-kDa protein to NH2-terminal sequence analysis, we obtained a single amino acid sequence (20 residues) that corresponds to the protein ALA-D (see Fig. 2), the enzyme (EC 4.2.1.24) that catalyzes the synthesis of PBG from two molecules of ALA. The sequence of the NH2-terminal 20 amino acid residues of the rabbit reticulocyte 38-kDa protein is identical to the translated cDNA sequence of human ALA-D at all but the 18th residue, where serine replaces alanine, as is the case with mouse ALA-D. Because this finding was unexpected, we subjected the purified 38-kDa protein to trypsin digestion, peptide separation (by reverse phase chromatography), and additional amino acid sequence analysis to determine whether the 38-kDa preparation might also contain a known DnaJ protein, whose size is identical to that of ALA-D but whose amino terminus is blocked. The sequences of three of these tryptic peptides corresponded to residues 18–39, 61–74, and 91–118 in ALA-D (Fig. 2), confirming that the purified 38-kDa component is ALA-D and, apparently, only ALA-D. Sequencing of 81 of a total of 330 residues demonstrates that the rabbit reticulocyte protein has 88% identity to human and mouse ALA-D (Fig. 2). Careful examination of the sequencing analyses of the 38-kDa protein revealed no detectable polypeptides corresponding to the DnaJ/hsp 40 protein family, although we did detect small amounts of two polypeptides derived from the added trypsin. Nevertheless, other laboratories have found that small amounts of the DnaJ/hsp 40 protein family may contaminate preparations of other proteins that promote protein folding and renaturation and contribute to their effect (9Schumacher R.J.

Ueda M. Kaneda T. Kobayashi T. Tanabe K. Ohtsuka K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and obtained from StressGen, and immunoblot analysis (20Gross M. Wing M. Rundquist C. Rubino M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6899-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to try to verify that the renaturation effect of the purified 38-kDa protein (Table I “Luciferase renaturation”) is caused by ALA-D and not contaminating hsp 40. This analysis (Fig.3) demonstrated that relatively crude fractions (steps 1–3, 38 kDa) do contain hsp 40. However, this hsp 40 is almost completely removed in the preparation of step 4, 38 kDa, and it is totally absent in steps 5 and 6, 38 kDa, demonstrating that the renaturation effect of the purified 38-kDa protein is not caused by contaminating hsp 40 and confirming that it is the result of ALA-D itself. Comparison of the immunoblot (Fig. 3) with a silver-stained gel run in parallel showed that ALA-D migrates slightly further than hsp 40, consistent with the fact that ALA-D is 330 amino acid residues in length, whereas hsp 40 is 340 (21Ohtsuka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that it is rabbit reticulocyte ALA-D that promotes the renaturation of luciferase by hsp 70 (Table I), an activity that is characterized in greater detail below, it was important to determine whether the same protein is also enzymatically active. The results in Table I indicate that the same fractions"
