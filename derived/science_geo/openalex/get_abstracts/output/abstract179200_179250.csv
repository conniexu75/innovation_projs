https://openalex.org/W2015132841,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play important roles in maintaining the silent state of HOX genes. Recent studies have implicated histone methylation in long-term gene silencing. However, a connection between PcG-mediated gene silencing and histone methylation has not been established. Here we report the purification and characterization of an EED-EZH2 complex, the human counterpart of the Drosophila ESC-E(Z) complex. We demonstrate that the complex specifically methylates nucleosomal histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3-K27). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that H3-K27 methylation colocalizes with, and is dependent on, E(Z) binding at an Ultrabithorax ( Ubx ) Polycomb response element (PRE), and that this methylation correlates with Ubx repression. Methylation on H3-K27 facilitates binding of Polycomb (PC), a component of the PRC1 complex, to histone H3 amino-terminal tail. Thus, these studies establish a link between histone methylation and PcG-mediated gene silencing."

These fluidic devices are analogous to electronic integrated circuits fabricated using large-scale integration. A key component of these networks is the fluidic multiplexor, which is a combinatorial array of binary valve patterns that exponentially increases the processing power of a network by allowing complex fluid manipulations with a minimal number of inputs. We used these integrated microfluidic networks to construct the microfluidic analog of a comparator array and a microfluidic memory storage device whose behavior resembles random-access memory."
https://openalex.org/W2011210301,"Insulin resistance contributes importantly to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus. One mechanism mediating insulin resistance may involve the phosphorylation of serine residues in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), leading to impairment in the ability of IRS-1 to activate downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathways. Insulin-resistant states and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are associated with the activation of the inhibitor κB kinase (IKK) complex. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which IKK may contribute to the development of insulin resistance are not well understood. In this study, using phosphospecific antibodies against rat IRS-1 phosphorylated at Ser307 (equivalent to Ser312 in human IRS-1), we observed serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to TNF-α or calyculin A treatment that paralleled surrogate markers for IKK activation. The phosphorylation of human IRS-1 at Ser312 in response to tumor necrosis factor-α was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with the IKK inhibitor 15 deoxy-prostaglandin J2 as well as in cells derived from IKK knock-out mice. We observed interactions between endogenous IRS-1 and IKK in intact cells using a co-immunoprecipitation approach. Moreover, this interaction between IRS-1 and IKK in the basal state was reduced upon IKK activation and increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Data from in vitro kinase assays using recombinant IRS-1 as a substrate were consistent with the ability of IRS-1 to function as a direct substrate for IKK with multiple serine phosphorylation sites in addition to Ser312. Taken together, our data suggest that IRS-1 is a novel direct substrate for IKK and that phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser312 (and other sites) by IKK may contribute to the insulin resistance mediated by activation of inflammatory pathways.

Interestingly, insulin-sensitizing drugs such as thiazolidinediones inhibit NFκB activity (11Ghanim H. Garg R. Aljada A. Mohanty P. Kumbkarni Y. Assian E. Hamouda W. Dandona P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1306-1312Google Scholar). Adiponectin, a cytokine secreted by adipose cells whose plasma levels are negatively correlated with insulin resistance (12Maeda K. Okubo K. Shimomura I. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 286-289Google Scholar), inhibits IKK activity in cells (13Ouchi N. Kihara S. Arita Y. Okamoto Y. Maeda K. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nishida M. Takahashi M. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1296-1301Google Scholar). Moreover, diet-induced insulin resistance is ameliorated in IKK2-deficient mice (14Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Google Scholar). Because IKK and NFκB are major components of the intracellular inflammatory pathway, a cross-talk between metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways may play an important role in the development of insulin resistance and the pathophysiology of major public health problems such as diabetes and obesity. However, molecular mechanisms by which IKK may specifically interact with metabolic insulin signaling pathways are not well understood. IKK is a serine kinase that controls the activation of NFκB, a ubiquitous transcription factor closely associated with inflammation (15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Google Scholar, 16Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (Suppl.): S81-S96Google Scholar). In addition to inflammation, NFκB also involves in other biological actions including apoptosis, oncogenesis, and cell differentiation (16Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar). Before activation, NFκB is bound to the inhibitor κB (IκB) protein whose isoforms include IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBγ (16Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar, 17Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar). This association between IκB and NFκB results in the cytosolic localization of NFκB. In response to inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-α and interleukin-1, IκB proteins are degraded in the proteasome, leading to nuclear translocation of NFκB. IκBα degradation is controlled by inducible phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 in the IκBα protein. The phosphorylation of these two serines is directly catalyzed by the IKK complex, which is composed of at least three subunits (IKK1/α, IKK2/β, and NEMO/IKKγ) (18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (Suppl.): S81-S96Google Scholar). Although both IKK1 and IKK2 can phosphorylate IκB proteins in vitro, IKK2 is indispensable for NFκB activation in vivo (19Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Google Scholar). Dominant negative mutants of IKK2 are frequently used to block NFκB pathways in intact cells. Activation of IKK can be initiated by a variety of kinases including protein kinase C (20Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K.

In some cases, NFκB can be activated in the absence of IκB protein degradation (e.g.vanadium-induced NFκB activation) (25Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Google Scholar). Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are crucial signaling molecules mediating metabolic actions of insulin (26White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar, 27Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Google Scholar). Four IRS isoforms (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4) have been identified that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (26White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar). The activated insulin receptor phosphorylates IRS proteins on multiple tyrosine residues (28Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Google Scholar) that serve as docking sites for downstream mediators of metabolic actions including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (26White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar). IRS proteins also undergo serine phosphorylation, which regulates its function (26White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar, 29Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Google Scholar). For example, the phosphorylation of rodent IRS-1 at Ser307or Ser612 (Ser312 and Ser616 in human IRS-1, respectively) results in the impairment of metabolic insulin signaling pathways (30Aguirre V.

However, IRS-1 has not previously been identified as a direct substrate for kinases that participate in inflammatory pathways related to activation of NFκB. In the this study, we evaluate the possibility that IRS-1 is a direct substrate for IKK that can provide a mechanism for cross-talk between metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Cell lines including human hepatoma HepG2 (HB-8065), human embryo kidney (HEK) 293 (CRL-1573) and mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 (CL-173) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For 3T3 cells, 4 mm glutamine was used in the culture medium. Wild-type and IKK1/2 double knock-out (IKK1/2−/−) cell lines were a gift from Dr. Inder Verma at the Salk Institute (La Jolla, CA). Antibodies against phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307) (number 07-247) and IKK2 (number 05-535), and λ-protein phosphatase number 14-405) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against IRS-1 (sc-7200), IRS-2 (sc-8299), IKK1 (sc-7182), HA (sc-7392), IκBα (sc-371), IκBβ (sc-945), and pJUN (sc-822) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). β-actin antibody (ab6276) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Calyculin A (EI-192) and SP600125 (EI-305) were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). TNF-α (210-TA-010) was obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). 15-Deoxy-prostaglandin J2(15dPGJ2, 538927) was from Calbiochem. Whole cell lysates were made by sonication in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 125 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Samples (100 μg of total protein) in 50 μl of reducing sample buffer were boiled for 3 min and resolved on 6% mini-SDS-PAGE for 90 min at 100 v. The contents of the gel were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (162–0184, Bio-Rad) at 21 v for 120 min. The membrane was pre-blotted in milk buffer for 20 min and then immunoblotted with primary antibody for 1–24 h followed by secondary antibody for 30 min. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (NA934V or NA931, Amersham Biosciences) were used in conjunction with chemiluminescence reagent (NEL-105, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To detect multiple signals from a single membrane, membranes were treated with a stripping buffer (59 mmTris-HCI, 2% SDS, 0.75% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 37 °C prior to re-blotting with a different antibody. λ-Protein phosphatase (number 14-405) was used to dephosphorylate IRS-1 in whole cell lysates of calyculin-treated HepG2 cells. The reaction was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. 100 μg of protein was incubated with 500 units of enzyme in λ-phosphatase reaction buffer at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Western blot sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. The dephosphorylated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using whole cell lysate (400 μg of total protein), 2–4 μg of antibody, and 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After treatment, cells were lysed by sonication in a cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). IP was conducted by incubating whole cell lysates with antibody for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was washed five times in cell lysis buffer before being used for immunoblotting or for the kinase assay. To conduct the kinase assay, the immune complex was washed two more times in a kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmcreatine phosphate). The kinase assay was conducted at room temperature for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The product was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for autoradiography or immunoblotting. An oligonucleotide containing the NFκB binding sequence in the human interleukin-6 gene promoter (−74TGGGATTTTCCCATGAGTCT−54) was synthesized as a NFκB binding probe. Nuclear extracts were prepared with a three-step procedure (48Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The DNA-protein binding reaction was conducted in a 24-μl reaction mixture including 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Sigma), 3 μg of nuclear protein extract, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 × 104 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 12 μl of reaction buffer (24% glycerol, 24 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 8 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol). After the addition of radiolabeled probe, the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel that had been pre-run at 170 V for 30 min with 0.5 × Tris borate buffer. The loaded gel was run at 200 V for 90 min, dried, placed on Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and the film was developed after overnight exposure at −70 °C. HA-tagged fusion proteins of IKK1, IKK2, IRS-1, IRS-2, and Akt were expressed in HEK 293 cells by transient transfection. The plasmids for HA-IKK1, HA-IKK2, and kinase-dead HA-IKK2 were a gift from Dr. Michael Karin (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, CA). The expression plasmids for HA-IRS-1 and HA-IRS-2 were constructed by inserting human IRS-1 or IRS-2 cDNA into pCIS2 expression vector (41Ravichandran L.V. Esposito D.L. Chen J. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3543-3549Google Scholar). Kinase-dead HA-Akt expression plasmid was from Dr. Bin-Hua Jiang (BMC Cancer Center, West Virginia University). Transient transfection was conducted using LipofectAMINE as reported previously (45Ye J. Zeidler P. Young S.H. Martinez A. Robinson V.A. Jones W. Baron P. Shi X. Castranova V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5360-5367Google Scholar). GST-IRS-1 expression plasmid for rat IRS-1 (amino acids 117–513) was from Dr. Xiao-Jian Sun (Endocrinology Division, University of Vermont College of Medicine). The purified GST-IRS-1 was prepared using a protocol described previously (48Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Google Scholar). TNF-α treatment of cells causes increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as activation of IKK and NFκB (1Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Google Scholar,15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Google Scholar). To explore the relationship between IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and IKK activation, HepG2 cells were treated with TNF-α, and IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser312 was examined using the phosphospecific antibody developed against phosphoserine 307 of rat IRS-1 (equivalent to Ser312 in human IRS-1). The IRS-1 phosphorylation was induced by TNF-α at 5 min, and this phosphorylation was sustained over 120 min (Fig. 1A, top panel). This phosphorylation of IRS-1 correlated with the disappearance of IκBα at 5 min (Fig. 1A, third panel), which is an indication of IKK activation. After 30 min, the level of IκBα started to increase and returned to the basal levels by 60–120 min. Calyculin is an inhibitor of protein serine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (49Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Google Scholar) that induces NFκB activity by activating IKK (50Sun S.C. Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18347-18351Google Scholar). In calyculin-treated HepG2 cells, both IκBα degradation and IRS-1 phosphorylation were observed after 15 min (Fig. 1B,panels 1 and 5). IκBβ expression was also reduced slightly after 30 min of calyculin treatment. In addition, a mobility shift in IKK1 and IKK2 was observed at 30 and 60 min that is consistent with the serine phosphorylation and activation of these two kinases by calyculin (Fig. 1B, panels 3 and4). The IKK1 signal also increased in a time-dependent manner after calyculin treatment. The serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 exhibited reduced mobility on the gel, and this change resulted in two bands detected by the phosphospecific antibody. One band migrated at a level of ∼180 kDa, whereas the other band migrated at the level of 165 kDa. The intensity of both bands increased in a time-dependent manner. In addition, of the two forms of serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 (pIRS-1) seen in Fig. 1B, only the bottom band, not the top band, was recognized by the regular IRS-1 antibody. The bottom band was reduced significantly at the time points of 30 and 60 min when the serine phosphorylation was increased dramatically. In calyculin-treated cells, the signal intensity of the total IRS-1 was reduced at 15, 30, and 60 min (Fig. 1B, panel 2). This reduction may result from decreased antibody affinity to the pIRS-1 or a reduction in IRS-1 protein abundance. To distinguish between these two possibilities, whole cell lysates derived from calyculin-treated HepG2 cells were incubated with λ-protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate pIRS-1. The result shows that the IRS-1 protein signal was restored along with the gel mobility after dephosphosphorylation at serine residues (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the loss of IRS-1 signal is a result of reduced antibody affinity to the phosphorylated IRS-1. This is also supported by studies using a different IRS-1 antibody or using proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). Vanadate is a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that induces the DNA binding of NFκB through an alternative pathway in which IKK is not activated (25Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Google Scholar). As expected, in vanadate-treated cells, IκBα protein levels and IKK mobility were not altered (Fig. 1B), whereas the DNA binding of NFκB was induced (Fig. 1D). Moreover, vanadate treatment did not result in phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser312 (Fig. 1B). To investigate the relationship between serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IKK activity more directly, we used the IKK inhibitor 15dPGJ2 (51Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Google Scholar). When HepG2 cells were pre-treated with 15dPGJ2, the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser312in response to TNF-α treatment was inhibited (Fig. 2A). In line with previously published results (30Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar, 32Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar), the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (52Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar) also inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser312 (Fig. 2A). Pre-treatment with both 15dPGJ2 and SP600125 resulted in more complete inhibition of serine phosphorylation on IRS-1 than treatment with either inhibitor alone (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the ability of 15dPGJ2 to inhibit IKK activity in a specific manner, IκBα degradation in response to TNF-α treatment was inhibited by 15dPGJ2 but not SP600125 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, SP600125 but not 15dPGJ2 inhibited phosphorylation of c-JUN in response to TNF-α (Fig. 2C). Thus, specific suppression of IKK activity is associated with the inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser312 in response to TNF-α. Based on the close relationship between IKK activity and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 described above, we next inquired whether IRS-1 could serve as a direct substrate for IKK. As a first step to test this hypothesis, the physical association between IRS-1 and the IKK complex was examined using co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3). In HepG2 cells, IRS-1 was detected in the immune complex precipitated with anti-IKK-1 antibody (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the association between IKK-1 and IRS-1 observed in the basal state was reduced by calyculin treatment but not by vanadate treatment (Fig. 3A). Consistent with immunoblotting results shown in Fig. 1B, the intensity of the IKK1 signal was increased and the intensity of the IRS-1 signal was decreased by calyculin in a time-dependent manner. As expected, IKK2 was also detected in the IKK1 immunoprecipitate. Similar results were obtained when IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were probed with the IKK antibody (Fig. 3B). These results suggest an association between IRS-1 and IKK1 that was observed in the basal state and reduced dramatically after calyculin treatment. It is interesting to note that the dynamics of the association between IRS-1 and IKK1 were different depending on whether anit-IKK1 or anti-IRS-1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. With the anti-IKK1 antibody, the association of IRS-1 disappeared at 60 min (Fig. 3A). By contrast, with the anti-IRS-1 antibody, the association of IKK1 became undetectable at 5 min (Fig. 3B). These differences may be attributed to a change in antibody affinity for the phosphorylated IRS-1 as described above (Fig. 1). Thus, less IRS-1 may be immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibody after calyculin treatment. Consistent with this explanation is the fact that the intensity of the IRS-1 signal detected by the regular IRS-1 antibody was decreased in the IRS-1 immunoprecipitate after calyculin treatment (Fig. 3B). In 293 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged IKK2, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3C). Similar to results from HepG2 cells, this association between IKK2 and IRS proteins was abolished after calyculin treatment of the cells. TNF-α treatment also abolished the interaction between IKK and IRS proteins (data not shown). To demonstrate that the immunoprecipitation results are specific, non-immune IgG as well as an unrelated antibody against p38 was used to immunoprecipitate samples in control experiments (Fig. 3D). These two controls did not give the results observed with the IRS-1 or IKK1 antibody. Taken together, these data suggest that IRS-1 and IKK directly interact in intact cells and that this interaction is reduced by activation of IKK and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. To further examine the possibility that IRS-1 is a novel substrate for IKK, we performed immune complex kinase assays using recombinant IKK2 derived from transiently transfected 293 cells. Expression vectors for HA-tagged IRS-1 and HA-tagged IKK2 were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells, and then recombinant proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitating with the anti-HA antibody. After being extensively washed, the immune complex was used in an in vitro kinase assay (46Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Google Scholar). Three major phosphoproteins were observed in the HA immunoprecipitates when wild-type IKK2 was used (Fig. 4A). The identity of these phosphoproteins was determined by immunoblotting. They are HA-IRS-1 with a mobility of 160 kDa, HA-IKK2 with a mobility of 89 kDa, and NEMO/IKKγ with a mobility of 48 kDa. Importantly, these phosphoproteins were absent or significantly reduced when an empty vector or the kinase-dead IKK2 was used instead of wild-type IKK2 (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with the wild type IKK1 with the exception that phosphorylation of IKK2 and NEMO was much weaker (Fig. 4A, lane 4). The phosphorylation of IKK2 is consistent with autophosphorylation (53Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Google Scholar), and NEMO is known to be a substrate for IKK2 (54Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Google Scholar). More importantly, these results suggest that IRS-1 is capable of functioning as a direct substrate for IKKin vitro because IRS-1 phosphorylation was only observed in the immune complexes with wild-type IKK2 but not with kinase-dead IKK2 or the empty vector. The effect of calyculin treatment on the ability of IRS-1 to undergo phosphorylation by IKK was also investigated (Fig. 4B). Calyculin treatment resulted in increased IRS-1 phosphorylation by wild-type but not kinase-dead IKK2. This finding suggests that calyculin increased the activity of IKK2 to phosphorylate IRS-1. Consistent with this possibility, the autophosphorylation of IKK2 was incr"

To provide insight into the role of PTENmutations in prostate cancer, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells. These studies revealed that adenoviral overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line resulted in apoptosis and induced the expression of many genes that affect cellular proliferation or survival. The expression of one of these FOXO-regulated genes,TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic member of the tumor necrosis factor family, was decreased in human metastatic prostate tumors. The altered expression of TRAIL in these tumors correlated directly with decreasedPTEN expression and the resultant loss of FKHRL1 and FKHR activity. Analysis of the effects of FOXO proteins on theTRAIL promoter localized the FKHRL1 responsive element of the TRAIL promoter to nucleotides −138 to −121 and demonstrated that TRAIL is a direct target of FKHRL1. These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells.

These findings suggest that the decreased activity of FKHRL1 and FKHR in prostate cancers resulting from loss of PTEN leads to a decrease in TRAIL expression that may contribute to increased survival of the tumor cells. The forkhead transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved 110-amino acid winged helix DNA binding domain (1Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Google Scholar). They play important roles in embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, and maintenance of differentiation status. In Caenorhabditis elegans the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16 is under control of the insulin receptor/PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; qRT, quantitative reverse transcriptase; NAP, normal adjacent prostate; PCA, localized prostate cancer; MET, prostate cancer metastasis; nt, nucleotide(s) pathway (2Ogg S. Ruvkun G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 887-893Google Scholar). The human orthologs of DAF-16 include FKHRL1, FKHR, and AFX and belong to the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors. The PI 3-kinase pathway, via activation of its downstream kinase Akt, phosphorylates each of the FOXO proteins at three different Ser/Thr residues (3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar). These phosphorylated FOXO proteins interact with 14-3-3 proteins and are subsequently sequestered in the cytoplasm where they are inactive. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase pathway by PTEN overexpression or pharmacologic means leads to dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of active FKHRL1, FKHR, and AFX, which in turn leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (4Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar). Conversely, loss of PTEN activity results in increased Akt activity leading to inhibition of FOXO protein activity through their phosphorylation and cytoplasmic sequestration. In addition, the expression of dominant negative FKHRL1 results in the inhibition of apoptosis, demonstrating that FOXO transcriptional activity controls cellular proliferation and apoptosis downstream of PTEN (5Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Google Scholar). The PTEN gene was initially identified by its frequent loss in glioblastomas (6Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H.

In prostate tumors, the loss of PTEN occurs late in the tumorigenic process, suggesting that it is more important for tumor progression than tumor initiation (13McMenamin M.E. Soung P. Perera S. Kaplan I. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4291-4296Google Scholar, 14Rasheed B.K. Stenzel T.T. McLendon R.E. Parsons R. Friedman A.H. Friedman H.S. Bigner D.D. Bigner S.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4187-4190Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene. First,PTEN overexpression in tumor cell lines results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (4Nakamura N. Ramaswamy S. Vazquez F. Signoretti S. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8969-8982Google Scholar, 15Wick W. Furnari F.B. Naumann U. Cavenee W.K. Weller M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3936-3943Google Scholar, 16Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M.

Second, heterozygous deletion of the PTEN gene in mice leads to the spontaneous development of multiple neoplasias (21Di Cristofano A. De Acetis M. Koff A. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 222-224Google Scholar). Finally, germline mutation ofPTEN in humans results in an increased incidence of endometrial, thyroid, and breast tumors (22Liaw D. Marsh D.J. Li J. Dahia P.L. Wang S.I. Zheng Z. Bose S. Call K.M. Tsou H.C. Peacocke M. Eng C. Parsons R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 64-67Google Scholar, 23Marsh D.J. Dahia P.L. Zheng Z. Liaw D. Parsons R. Gorlin R.J. Eng C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 333-334Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that cell cycle arrest downstream ofPTEN occurs via the transcriptional induction of p27kip by AFX and FKHRL1 (24Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Google Scholar). The resulting increased level of p27kip inhibits cyclin E-cdk2 and causes G1/S-phase arrest. However, the mechanism of apoptosis induced by FOXO proteins is less well understood. In T-cells FKHRL1 has been shown to induce Fas ligand, but this phenomenon has not been reproduced in prostate cancer cell lines (25Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, AFX induces the transcriptional repressor BCL-6, which then suppresses the expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-X L and leads to apoptosis (26Tang T.T. Dowbenko D. Jackson A. Toney L. Lewin D.A. Dent A.L. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14255-14265Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that FOXO proteins are important downstream effectors of PTEN tumor suppressive activity; however, their molecular targets and mechanisms of action in prostate cancer are not understood. To delineate the molecular events that are perturbed by PTENmutation in prostate carcinoma cells, we focused on identifying genes that are regulated by FOXO proteins in the prostate. Overexpression of FKHRL1 and FKHR in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cells using adenoviral vectors induced dramatic apoptosis. Furthermore, expression profiling of LAPC4 cells overexpressing FKHRL1 and FKHR revealed that they regulate many genes encoding proteins involved in survival and proliferation, including TRAIL, a pro-apoptotic factor of the TNF family. Meta-analysis of microarray data of human prostate specimens showed that TRAIL expression is decreased in metastatic prostate tumors but not in normal prostate or localized prostate cancer. We further demonstrated that FOXO proteins directly induce TRAIL expression by an element located between 121 and 138 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using the Taqman model 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described earlier (27Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (960, 962): 954-958Google Scholar, 28Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Google Scholar, 29Schneeberger C. Speiser P. Kury F.

To quantify relative amounts ofFKHRL1, FKHR, and AFX mRNA in the prostate, four specimens of normal prostate and six specimens containing prostate cancer were obtained from the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center Tissue Procurement Core Facility, Washington University. The prostate tumor samples had greater than 70% tumor tissue by histology. Fifty-μm sections of the tissues were prepared using a cryostat and total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. LAPC4 human prostate carcinoma cells (gift from C. Sawyers, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) were cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells (ATCC, Rockville MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum. Adenovirus recombinants expressing FKHR-TSSA and FKHRL1-TM were prepared as described below (31He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). FKHR-TSSA and HA-tagged FKHRL1-TM were gifts from T. Unterman, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, and M. Greenberg, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, respectively (25Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 32Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were subcloned into the AdtrackGFP vector and inserted into the adenoviral backbone by recombination with AdEasy vector (31He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). The AdtrackGFP vector itself was recombined into the AdEasy vector to produce a virus that only expresses GFP for use as a negative control in all experiments. Adenoviral recombinants were purified on a cesium chloride gradient, titrated, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until further use. For gene delivery, purified adenovirus was added to LAPC4 cells at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50–100 for 2 h and washed twice with medium. Thereafter, cells were cultured for the indicated periods of time before harvest. For immunoblot analyses, lysates were harvested from cells infected for the indicated times, resolved by polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to Western blotting. Antibodies used were anti-FKHR (New England Biolabs) or anti-HA (monoclonal 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for FKHRL1 or anti-TRAIL (R & D Systems Inc.). Cell survival assays were performed with the MTS assay (Promega Corp.) as per the manufacturer's instructions using untreated LAPC4 cells and 2% formaldehyde-fixed cells as controls. DNA ladders were visualized as described (33Ferris C.D. Jaffrey S.R. Sawa A. Takahashi M. Brady S.D. Barrow R.K. Tysoe S.A. Wolosker H. Baranano D.E. Dore S. Poss K.D. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 152-157Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was isolated from LAPC4 cells infected with either AdGFP (negative control) or AdFKHRL1-TM or AdFKHR-TSSA for 12 or 15 h. The RNA was subjected to GeneChip analysis using U95A Affymetrix chips as per the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix Inc.) at the Siteman Cancer Center GeneChip core facility. Analysis of the arrays was performed using the Dchip software, which pools information across multiple arrays to obtain probe-specific indices that reduce errors because of cross-hybridization and image contamination (34Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Google Scholar). To analyze expression data, chip intensities were normalized and pooled into sets of duplicate chip experiments prior to comparison analysis. The differences in the profiles were generated by two-way analysis using the pooled duplicate chip values of LAPC4 cells infected with control virus (AdGFP) as baseline (data referred as B) against pooled duplicate chips representing LAPC4 cells infected with either AdFKHR-TSSA or AdFKHRL1-TM or either 12 or 15 h (data referred as E). The filtering criteria were as follows. 1) Each gene must be called “present” (i.e. expression above the level of detection on either E or B). 2) The p value by unpaired ttest for testing E≠B should be less than 0.05. 3) The -fold change in expression between E and B should be greater than 1.2. After applying these filters there were 63 genes in AdFKHRL1-TM and 55 genes in AdFKHR-TSSA whose expression was found to be altered 15 h after infection. To reliably detect differential expression during the qRT-PCR confirmation assays, we selected genes that were differentially expressed >3-fold at the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval calculated by the Dchip software. Twenty-six genes in AdFKHRL1-TM- and 21 genes in AdFKHR-TSSA-infected cells met these filtering criteria (Tables I and II).Table IFKHRL1 target genesUnigene IDGene symbolUnigene description-Fold changeLower bound of FCUpper bound of FCp valueCategoryHs.17839GG2–1TNF-induced protein4.063.125.740.05Anti-apoptosisHs.132955BNIP3LBCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3-like4.573.825.650.03ApoptosisHs.83429TNFSF10Tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 10 ( TRAIL )9.727.1714.850.03ApoptosisHs.79069CCNG2Cyclin G24.823.896.250.04Cell cycleHs.198689BPAG1Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1 (230/240 kDa)4.153.305.580.04Extracellular matrixHs.1369DAFDecay accelerating factor for complement (CD55, Cromer blood group system)5.234.037.380.04Membrane proteinHs.77348HPGDHydroxyprostaglandin dehyddrogenase 15-(NAD)6.545.238.670.03MetabolismHs.100293OGTO-LinkedN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase (UDP-N- acetylglucosamine:polypeptide-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase)4.443.386.470.04MetabolismHs.28491SATSpermidine/spermineN1-acetyltransferase5.925.286.670.03MetabolismHs.75969PROL2Proline-rich protein with nuclear targeting signal9.016.1716.290.04Nuclear proteinHs.3144CBLBCas-Br-M (murine) ectropic retroviral transforming sequence8.726.4313.250.04SignalingHs.83070GRB14Growth factor receptor-bound protein 146.454.2413.240.05SignalingHs.50651JAK1Janus kinase 1 (a protein-tyrosine kinase)4.003.374.900.03SignalingHs.197751DAAM1Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 14.923.886.590.05SignalingHs.278589GTF21General transcription factor II, i4.893.557.850.04Transcription factorHs.10882HBP1Human menopausal gonadotropin box-containing protein 14.633.686.220.03Transcription factorHs.75862MADH4MAD (mothers against decapentaplegic, Drosophila) homolog 43.673.154.350.04Transcription factorHs.74592SATB1Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (binds to nucleaus)4.273.465.480.05Transcription factorHs.170133FOXO1AForkhead box O1A (rhabdomyosarcoma) (FKHR)4.533.446.510.05Transcription factorHs.144931ATP8A1ATPase, aminophospholipid transporter (APLT) Class I, type15.0310.2328.000.03TransportHs.301350FXYD3FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 34.273.325.900.05TransportHs.278428DD5Progestin-induced protein3.633.014.500.05UbiquitinHs.93675DEPPDecidual protein induced by progesterone506.1019.38100,000.000.03UnknownHs.99824BCE-1BCE-1 protein6.014.967.600.02UnknownHs.180737Homo sapiens clone 23664 and 23905 mRNA sequence7.706.1110.320.03UnknownHs.12702H. sapiens mRNA; cDNA DKFZp586N012 (from clone DKFZp586N012)3.993.464.690.03UnknownChanges in LAPC4 prostate carcinoma cell gene expression after 15 h of infection with AdFKHRL1-TM were assessed by dChip analysis.

Barrette T.R. Ghosh D. Shah R. Varambally S. Kurachi K. Pienta K.J. Rubin M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Nature. 2001; 412: 822-826Google Scholar) were downloaded from www.nature.com/cgitaf/DynaPage.taf?file=/ nature/journal/v412/n6849/abs/412822a0_fs.html&dynoptions= d-oi1011638302 and entered into MSAccess data base software (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). These genes were compared with genes that were differentially regulated in LAPC4 cells overexpressing FKHR and FKHRL1 using MSAccess software. One gene, TRAIL, was found to be common between the two groups. The raw expression values of TRAIL in the different prostate specimens were extracted from data provided at the web address above. These TRAIL expression values in normal adjacent prostate (NAP), localized prostate cancer (PCA), and prostate cancer metastasis (MET) were assigned to their respective groups (32 samples total). The relative differences in TRAIL expression between PCA and NAP or MET and NAP were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test using Sigmastat software (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, IL). Nuclear extract preparation from AdFKHRL1-TM or Ad-GFP-infected HEK293 cells and EMSA analysis were performed as described earlier (36Modur V. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13094-13102Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were quantified by the NanoOrange protein assay (Molecular Probes Inc., Portland, OR). For EMSA, 5 μg of nuclear extract protein was mixed with 2.25 pmol of32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (∼30,000 cpm) and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The mixture was electrophoresed through either 6 or 8% polyacrylamide gels and the shifted fragments were visualized by autoradiography or using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Corp). The sequences of the probes used are: −79 to −35 probe, 5′-GGAAGGGGGAGGGACAGTTGCAGGTTCAATAGATGTGGGTGGGGC-3′; −115 to −69 probe, 5′-GACTACTTTGAGACAAGAGCTGTCCCTGGGCAGTAGGAAGGGGA-3′; −141 to −98 probe, 5′-TTCTTTCAGTTTCCCTCCTTTCCAACGACTACTTTGAGACAAGA-3′; −165 to −130 probe, 5′-AGGGCAAGGAGAGGAGCTTCTTTCAGTTTCCCTCC-3′; FKHR binding element, 5′-CAGGCTGTTTTTGTGTGCCTGTTTTTCTATTTTACGTAA; and theTRAIL promoter GAS-like sequence, 5′-GACTACTTTGAGACAAGA-3′. LAPC4 cells were transfected using Tfx-20 transfection reagent (Promega Corp.) and HEK293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were performed in 12-well plates seeded with 3.5 × 104 cells/well using 250 ng of TRAIL promoter luciferase reporter, 100 ng of CMVLacZ reporter (control), 50 ng of plasmid expressing wild type or FKHRL1-TM expression vector (pcDNA3.1), and 600 ng of Bluescript plasmid (Stratagene). The −1523 to +23 TRAIL promoter luciferase reporter deletion plasmids were described previously (37Wang Q. Ji Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-4671Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter assays were performed as described (38Sevetson B. Svaren J. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9749-9757Google Scholar, 39Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Golda T. Stanton J.J. Swirnoff A.H. Milbrandt J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6010-6019Google Scholar). Mutation of the forkhead binding site in the −165 to +23TRAIL promoter luciferase construct was generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene Corp.) and complementary primers 5′-GAGGAGCTTCAGACAGAGACCCTCCAGACCAACGCCAACG-3′ and CGTTGGCGTTGGTCTGGAGGGTCTCTGTCTGAAGCTCCTC. The sequence of the mutant promoter construct was verified prior to use. The frequent loss of PTEN in human prostate tumors decreases the activity of the FOXO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors, as they become sequestered in the cytoplasm. To determine the members of the FOXO subfamily that are expressed in human prostate, we performed qRT-PCR on normal human prostate and prostate tumors as well as the prostate carcinoma cell lines LAPC4, LnCAP, DU145, and PC3. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that FKHRL1 and FKHR were expressed at much higher levels than AFX in all the analyzed samples (Fig.1). FKHR and FKHRL1were expressed at similar levels in normal prostate and prostate tumors; however, FKHRL1 expression was increased in the LnCAP, LAPC4, and DU145 cell lines. This expression data indicates thatFKHRL1 and FKHR are the predominant FOXO transcription factors in the prostate, thus they are good candidates for mediating transcriptional changes resulting from the loss of PTEN activity. The preferential expression of FKHRL1 andFKHR in the prostate suggested that they would be important in mediating changes caused by the loss of PTEN activity in prostate carcinomas. To examine this role, we developed an in vitromodel to examine the effects of increased FKHRL1 and FKHR transcriptional activity in prostate cancer cells. First, we generated replication deficient adenoviruses that express constitutively active mutants of these proteins (AdFKHR-TSSA and AdFKHRL1-TM, respectively). The FKHRL1-TM and FKHR-TSSA mutants have each of the three Akt phosphorylation sites mutated to Ala residues, thus leading to nuclear localization and constitutive transcriptional activity (25Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 32Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar). Additionally, these recombinant adenovirus coexpress GFP so that the efficiency of infection can be readily assessed. Second, the LAPC4 cell line was selected for adenoviral gene delivery because it is androgen responsive and maintains many characteristics of prostate cancer cells (40Whang Y.E. Wu X. Suzuki H. Reiter R.E. Tran C. Vessella R.L. Said J.W. Isaacs W.B. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5246-5250Google Scholar). These cells have low levels of functional PTEN and therefore endogenous FKHRL1 and FKHR are cytoplasmically sequestered and inactive (Ref. 40Whang Y.E. Wu X. Suzuki H. Reiter R.E. Tran C. Vessella R.L. Said J.W. Isaacs W.B. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5246-5250Google Scholar, and data not shown). Additionally, LAPC4 cells were readily infected with adenovirus and showed little evidence of adenoviral toxicity even at high multiplicity of infection (see below and data not shown). Infection of LAPC4 cells with increasing amounts of AdFKHRL1-TM or AdFKHR-TSSA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in protein expression (Fig. 2 A). Infection with a m.o.i. of 50–100 resulted in >95% infection of LAPC4 cells after 16 h (as monitored by GFP expression). This multiplicity of infection was therefore used in all subsequent experiments (Fig. 2 B). Infection of LAPC4 cells with AdFKHR-TSSA or AdFKHRL1-TM resulted in detectable protein expression by 8 h and achieved a maximal level by 12 h (Fig.2 C). Thus, infection with AdFKHR-TSSA and AdFKHRL1-TM results in a rapid, controlled and efficient expression of FKHR-TSSA and FKHRL1-TM in LAPC4 cells. FKHRL1-TM and FKHR-TSSA overexpression in these cells resulted in membrane blebbing and detachment from the plate over time (data not shown). This corresponded with a decrease in cellular viability within 24 h (Fig.3 A). Analysis of DNA morphology showed a classic DNA laddering pattern consistent with the process of apoptosis (Fig. 3 B).

The JH2 domain has been implicated in regulation of Jak activity, but its function remains poorly understood. Here, we found that the JH2 domain negatively regulates the activity of Jak2 and Jak3. Deletion of JH2 resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak2- and Jak3-JH2 deletion mutants as well as of coexpressed STAT5. In cytokine receptor signaling, the deletion of the Jak2- and Jak3-JH2 domains resulted in interferon-γ and interleukin-2-independent STAT activation, respectively. However, cytokine stimulations did not further induce the JH2 deletion mutant-mediated STAT activation. The deletion of the Jak2 JH2 domain also abolished interferon-γ-inducible kinase activation, although it did not affect the reciprocal Jak1-Jak2 interaction in 293T cells. Chimeric constructs, where the JH2 domains were swapped between Jak2 and Jak3, retained low basal activity and cytokine inducible signaling, indicating functional conservation between the two JH2 domains. However, the basal activity of Jak2 was significantly lower than that of Jak3, suggesting differences in the regulation of Jak2 and Jak3 activity. In conclusion, we found that the JH2 domain has a conserved function in Jak2 and Jak3. The JH2 domain is required for two distinct functions in cytokine signaling: (i) inhibition of the basal activity of Jak2 and Jak3, and (ii) cytokine-inducible activation of signaling. The Jak-JH2 deletion mutants are catalytically active, activate STAT5, and interact with another Jak kinase, but the JH2 domain is required to connect these signaling events to receptor activation. Thus, we propose that the JH2 domain contributes to both the uninduced and ligand-induced Jak-receptor complex, where it acts as a cytokine-inducible switch to regulate signal transduction.

Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar). The Jak kinases bind to the cytoplasmic tails of receptors belonging to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily. Ligand-induced receptor aggregation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak kinases and their substrate proteins, such as transcription factors called signal transducers and activators of transcription, STATs (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 3Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Google Scholar). Each Jak kinase specifically binds to only a subset of cytokine receptors. Jak2 associates with single chain receptors for erythropoietin, growth hormone and prolactin, type two cytokine receptors (IFNγRII, IL-10R), and the β chain of receptors for IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Google Scholar). Lack of Jak2 causes embryonic lethality in mice because of absence of definitive erythropoiesis, and these cells also fail to respond to interferon-γ (IFN-γ), IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (4Neubauer H. Cumano A. Muller M. Wu H. Huffstadt U. Pfeffer K. Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Google Scholar, 5Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Google Scholar). On the other hand, Jak3 has been found as the only signaling molecule so far to associate with the common γ chain of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 receptors (6Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Google Scholar). Lack of functional Jak3 results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with varying defects on T and B cells both in human and mice (7Macchi P. Villa A.

Science. 1995; 270: 794-797Google Scholar). The Jak kinases are characterized by the presence of seven regions of sequence similarity found between Jak kinases and designated as Jak homology (JH) domains (11Ziemiecki A. Harpur A. Wilks A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 207-212Google Scholar). JH1 is a catalytically active tyrosine kinase domain located in the C terminus of Jak kinases and next to it is JH2, also called the pseudokinase or kinase-like domain. The JH2 domain has conserved sequence motifs found in protein kinases, but these motifs are subtly modified and consequently, the JH2 domain is catalytically inactive. Interestingly, the modifications are conserved between the JH2 domains of different Jak kinases, suggesting that the JH2 domain has an important function in Jak kinases. Recently, sequence-based predictions have indicated the existence of an SH2-like and a FERM domain in the JH3-JH4 and JH4-JH7 regions of Jak kinases, respectively (12Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar, 13Kampa D. Burnside J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 175-182Google Scholar, 14Al-Lazikani B. Sheinerman F.B. Honig B. Proc.

The FERM domain mediates specific binding of Jak kinases to cytokine receptors (16Kohlhuber F. Rogers N.C. Watling D. Feng J. Guschin D. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B.A. Kotenko S.V. Pestka S. Stark G.R.

Migone T.S. Bazan F. Hanson E.P. Chen M. Candotti F. O'Shea J.J. Johnston J.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Google Scholar). The FERM domain of Jak3 was recently also found to positively regulate kinase activity, whereas no such function has been assigned to this domain in Jak2 or Tyk2 (21Gauzzi M.C. Barbieri G.

The function of the SH2 domain in Jak kinases is currently unknown. In cytokine receptors, Jak activation is achieved through ligand-induced aggregation of receptor chains bringing the associated Jak kinases in close contact. Ligand binding most likely induces a conformational change in the receptor cytoplasmic domains allowing formation of a multimeric receptor complex and further induction of signal transduction. The activity of Jak kinases is induced by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the kinase activation loop (A-loop) through auto- or transphosphorylation by another Jak kinase. The A-loop in Jak kinases contains a conserved YY motif and the functional role of these tyrosines varies between different Jaks. Phosphorylation of the first tyrosine in the YY motif greatly increases the activity of Jak1 and Jak2, but has a less pronounced effect in Jak3 (22Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C.

Mutation of the second tyrosine in the YY motif increases the activity of Jak3, whereas similar mutations in Jak1 or Jak2 have no effect (22Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr.

The double tyrosine motif is also a target for negative regulation of Jaks. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and SOCS-3 directly bind to the activation loop of Jak2 to down-regulate kinase activity, and in the case of SOCS-1 interaction has been shown to induce ubiquitination of Jak2 (27Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Google Scholar, 28Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3316-3326Google Scholar). Also, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B down-regulates IFN-γ and IFN-α signaling by recognizing and specifically dephosphorylating the double tyrosine motifs of Jak2 and Tyk2 (30Myers M.P. Andersen J.N. Cheng A. Tremblay M.L. Horvath C.M. Parisien J.P. Salmeen A. Barford D. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47771-47774Google Scholar). Jak3 and Jak1, on the other hand, are negatively regulated through the T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) (31Simoncic P.D. Lee-Loy A. Barber D.L. Tremblay M.L. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 446-453Google Scholar). Although catalytically inactive, the JH2 domain has been found to be a critical regulator of Jak kinases. We have previously found that JH2 is a negative regulatory domain in Jak2, and deletion of JH2 leads to activation of Jak2 (23Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Google Scholar). A mutation in the JH2 domain ofDrosophila Jak kinase, Hop, has been found to up-regulate kinase activity and result in leukemia in the fly, also supporting a role for JH2 in negative regulation of Jaks (32Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in the Jak3-JH2 domain have been found to inactivate the kinase, and result in abrogation of IL-2 signaling leading to SCID (33Candotti F. Oakes S.A. Johnston J.A. Giliani S. Schumacher R.F. Mella P. Fiorini M. Ugazio A.G. Badolato R. Notarangelo L.D. Bozzi F. Macchi P. Strina D. Vezzoni P. Blaese R.M. O'Shea J.J. Villa A.

Similarly, mutations in the JH2 domain of Tyk2 have been shown to interfere with Tyk2 activity, and deletion of JH2 resulted in inactivation of the kinase (35Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Google Scholar, 36Yeh T.C. Dondi E. Uze G. Pellegrini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8991-8996Google Scholar). Thus, the JH2 domain has been found to regulate Jak activity either positively or negatively, leaving the role of the JH2 domain in Jaks still unclear. Furthermore, it is currently not known if the JH2 domain has a conserved function in regulating Jak activity or if the role of the JH2 domain is distinct in different Jaks. In this study we have compared the JH2-mediated regulation of Jak2 and Jak3 to elucidate the function of the JH2 domain in cytokine signaling. Our results demonstrate that the JH2 domain is required to maintain low basal activity of both Jak2 and Jak3. Furthermore, the results show that JH2 specifically mediates cytokine receptor-induced Jak activation and cytokine-inducible activation of downstream signaling. Chimeric constructs, where the JH2 domains are swapped between Jak2 and Jak3, show low basal activity and cytokine-inducible signaling, indicating functional conservation of the two JH2 domains. In the absence of JH2, the Jak JH2 deletion mutants are catalytically active, activate STAT5, and interact with another Jak kinase, but are still unable to respond to cytokine stimulation. Based on these findings we propose that in addition to suppressing basal Jak activity in the uninduced Jak-receptor complex, the JH2 domain is an integral part of the ligand-activated receptor complex by mediating specific protein-protein interactions required for cytokine responsiveness of cells. 293T, COS, 293 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and γ2A (Jak2-deficient fibrosarcoma cell line (37Watling D.

The immunoprecipitation protocol has been described (44Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting or used for kinase assay. For kinase assay, the immunoprecipitates were washed four times with kinase lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). The immunoprecipitates were suspended in kinase assay buffer containing dithiothreitol (1 mm). The following peptides (1 mg/ml) were used as substrates: STAT5 (AKAADGYVKPQIKQVV), Jak1YY (AIETDKEYYTVKDDRDS), Jak2YY (VLPQDKEYYKVKEPGES), or Jak3YY (LLPLDKDYYVVREPGQK). 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP was added to the reactions followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature and boiling in reducing Laemmli sample buffer. The reactions were separated in 20% SDS-PAGE followed by quantification of radioactivity using PhosphorImager (Fuji). Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were always used for immunoprecipitations and Western blotting of cell lysates. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay system. Immunodetection was performed using specific primary antibodies, biotinylated anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), and streptavidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) followed by ECL. Luciferase activity was determined using dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The STAT-dependent luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the co-transfected plasmid constitutively expressingRenilla luciferase. We have previously investigated the role of the different JH domains in regulation of Jak2 and found that the pseudokinase domain, JH2, negatively regulates the activity of Jak2 (23Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Google Scholar). Because the JH2 domain is conserved within the Jak family, we wanted to investigate the function of the JH2 domain also in other Jak kinases. In addition, we sought to determine whether the JH2 domains regulate different Jak kinases similarly or if this domain mediates distinct functions in different Jak kinases. We started the analysis by comparing the activities of Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3. HA-tagged Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 kinases were expressed in 293T cells and the Jak proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitrokinase assay using four different peptide substrates corresponding to the double tyrosine motifs in the kinase activation loop of Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 and the tyrosine phosphorylation site in STAT5 (Y694) (22Liu K.D.

The activity of Jak2 toward any of the substrate peptides was extremely low when compared with the activities of either Jak1 or Jak3 (Fig. 1 A), although Jak2 was expressed at much higher levels than Jak1 or Jak3 (Fig. 1 B). The expression of Jak3 was repeatedly very low, and difficult to detect using the monoclonal anti-HA antibody, but could be detected using polyclonal Jak3 antiserum (not shown). Despite the lower level of expression, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 was very similar to that of Jak2, indicating that Jak3 was phosphorylated at a higher level than Jak2 (Fig. 1 B). Also Jak1 had higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation than Jak2. Interestingly, Jak1 and Jak3 showed clear differences in phosphorylation of the substrate peptides. The STAT5-derived peptide was the best substrate for Jak1, whereas Jak3 showed preference for the A-loop-derived peptides of Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 kinases (Fig. 1 A). The results from the kinase assay indicated that the activity of Jak2 was clearly lower than the activity of either Jak1 or Jak3. We considered two possible explanations for this finding. The difference in kinase activity might be because of different activities of the tyrosine kinase domains. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the kinase domains might be differentially regulated by other domains, such as the pseudokinase domain, in full-length Jak kinases. We first analyzed the activities of the isolated tyrosine kinase domains, and chose to compare the activities of Jak2 and Jak3, which showed the greatest difference in the kinase assay. A construct coding for the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak3, JH1-Jak3, and JH1-Jak2 (23Saharinen P. Takaluoma K. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3387-3395Google Scholar), was expressed in 293T cells. The JH1 domains were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody and subjected to in vitro kinase assay with STAT5 peptide as a substrate (Fig.2 A) or to immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Despite lower level of expression, JH1-Jak3 had both higher kinase activity and higher level of tyrosine phosphorylation than JH1-Jak2, indicating that the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak3 was more active than that of Jak2. We previously found that deletion of JH2 resulted in activation of Jak2. To compare the pseudokinase domain-mediated regulation of Jak2 and Jak3, we created deletion constructs including JH2Δ-Jak3, a Jak3 protein lacking the pseudokinase domain, JH1-2-Jak3 coding for the double kinase domain, and JH1-Jak3 coding for the tyrosine kinase domain of Jak3 (Fig.3 A). Jak3, JH2Δ-Jak3, JH1-Jak3, and JH1-2-Jak3 constructs were expressed in COS cells, Jak3 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 3, Band C). The protein levels in the immunoprecipitates as well as in the cell lysates were found to be equal. JH2Δ-Jak3, lacking the pseudokinase domain, as well as JH1-Jak3 showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation when compared with Jak3 (Fig. 3, B andC). However, the presence of the pseudokinase domain in JH1-2-Jak3 resulted in phosphorylation comparable with Jak3 (Fig.3 C). This result indicated that the pseudokinase domain acted to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3. To analyze if the JH2 domain also inhibited downstream signaling by Jak3, we co-expressed the different Jak3 deletion mutants with STAT5A. The ability of the Jak3 kinases to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was analyzed after STAT5 immunoprecipitation by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 3 D). When compared with Jak3, JH2Δ-Jak3 as well as JH1-Jak3 induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 3 D). The JH1-2-Jak3, on the other hand, resulted in STAT5 phosphorylation comparable with Jak3 (Fig. 3 D). Thus, the JH2 domain also inhibited the abil"

However, the nature of pathogenic aggregates and the biological consequences of their formation remain elusive. Here, we describe (i) a model cellular system in which prefibrillar α-synuclein aggregates and fibrillar inclusions are naturally formed in the cytoplasm with distinctive kinetics and (ii) a tight correlation between the presence of prefibrillar aggregates and the Golgi fragmentation. Consistent with the structural abnormality of Golgi apparatus, trafficking and maturation of dopamine transporter through the biosynthetic pathway were impaired in the presence of α-synuclein aggregates. Reduction in cell viability was also observed in the prefibrillar aggregate-forming condition and before the inclusion formation. The fibrillar inclusions, on the other hand, showed no correlation with Golgi fragmentation and were preceded by these events. Furthermore, at the early stage of inclusion formation, active lysosomes and mitochondria were enriched in the juxtanuclear area and co-aggregate into a compact inclusion body, suggesting that the fibrillar inclusions might be the consequence of an attempt of the cell to remove abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles. These results support the hypothesis that prefibrillar α-synuclein aggregates are the pathogenic species and suggest that Golgi fragmentation and subsequent trafficking impairment are the specific consequence of α-synuclein aggregation.

Many human neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, are characterized by amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein, such as Lewy bodies (LBs) 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Lewy body; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EM, electron microscopy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GA, Golgi apparatus; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; MSA, multiple system atrophy; DAT, dopamine transporter; endoH, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Lewy body; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EM, electron microscopy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GA, Golgi apparatus; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; MSA, multiple system atrophy; DAT, dopamine transporter; endoH, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.and Lewy neurites (1Hardy J.

Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Google Scholar). A causative role of fibrillar α-synuclein inclusions in neurodegeneration has been suggested in a mouse model in which formation of intracytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusions coincided with the severe motor impairment (7Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study in a transgenic fly model that express human α-synuclein has shown that co-expression of molecular chaperone hsp70 alleviated the neurodegenerative phenotype but did not reduce the formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusion bodies (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). This result raised a question as to whether the fibrillar inclusions play a causative role in neurodegenerative process. Furthermore, recentin vitro studies revealed various non-fibrillar species during the course of fibrillation and suggested a possibility that these metastable intermediate species, not the fibrils themselves, might elicit cytotoxicity (9Conway K.A. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Google Scholar, 10Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Google Scholar). Elucidating which particular aggregate species possess the principal cytotoxic effect holds the key to understanding the etiologic role of protein aggregation in the disease pathogenesis. Study of this problem, however, has been hampered by the lack of an experimental system in which intermediates of the endogenous fibrillation process can be biochemically defined and analyzed. Here, we have established such a system and have assessed the effects of prefibrillar intermediates that are formed naturally in the cytoplasm. In this report, we refer to prefibrillar aggregates as non-fibrillar oligomeric assemblies that precede the formation of fibrils and to inclusions as large deposits of aggregates that are usually found in juxtanuclear location.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report two biological effects of cytoplasmic α-synuclein aggregates; fragmentation of the GA and cell death. The fact that these effects correlate only with the formation of aggregates, and not with the monomer level, suggests that occurrence of these effects depends on the formation of higher order, quaternary structures. The prefibrillar intermediates seem to be responsible for these effects, because both of the effects occur in the presence of small prefibrillar aggregates, and before the formation of fibrillar inclusions. We were able to distinguish specific effects of prefibrillar intermediates from those of monomers and fibrillar inclusions by taking advantage of the following features of our experimental system. First, once the monomer level reaches a plateau, only aggregates increase in response to an increasing amount of α-synuclein cDNA without changing the monomer level. This phenomenon provides an effective means to distinguish the effects of aggregates from those of monomers. Second, the ability to define naturally occurring prefibrillar aggregates and fibrillar inclusions biochemically, allowed kinetic analysis of each species. This study showed that the aggregation process of α-synuclein in cells, similar to the findings in test tube, involves prefibrillar intermediates in the course of forming fibrillar inclusions (43Lee H.-J. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Google Scholar). More importantly, such a kinetic delay of the inclusion formation enabled us to distinguish the cytophysiological effects of prefibrillar intermediates and fibrillar inclusions.Earlier examinations of human brain tissues and animal models have shown that the Golgi fragmentation was associated with the neurodegenerative phenotypes. Fragmentation of the GA has been found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, ALS, CJD, and MSA (16Gonatas N.K. Gonatas J.O. Stieber A. Histochem.

Okamoto K. Yaguchi M. Fujita Y. Mizuno Y. Nakazato Y. Gonatas N.K. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 550-554Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenic mice expressing ALS-linked mutant superoxide dismutase 1 showed Golgi fragmentation in spinal cord motor neurons in an early, preclinical stage, implicating the role of Golgi fragmentation in the early stage of neurodegeneration (30Mourelatos Z. Gonatas N.K. Stieber A. Gurney M.E. Dal Canto M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5472-5477Google Scholar). Our present study links this well-documented pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases, the Golgi fragmentation, to the prefibrillar aggregate form of α-synuclein. Although our results imply the correlation between Golgi fragmentation and cell death, they are not sufficient to suggest the cause/effect relationship between these two. Nevertheless, given the importance of the GA in maturation and trafficking of essential proteins and lipids, we speculate that synaptic sites might be particularly vulnerable to Golgi dysfunction. It is, therefore, noteworthy that transgenic mice producing non-fibrillar α-synuclein aggregates in neurons suffer from presynaptic degeneration in nigrostriatal system (31Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Google Scholar).Whether inclusion bodies are toxic entities or harmless by-products or even a part of a protective mechanism has been one of the central issues in amyloid-associated disorders. Our present study shows that (i) Golgi fragmentation and cell death are observed before the formation of inclusion bodies in mixed cell populations and that (ii) α-synuclein aggregates are pulled into the “pre-inclusion” area in the juxtanuclear region along with cellular defense organelles, such as autophagic/lysosomal vesicles and mitochondria. These results are consistent with the notion that inclusion bodies per semight not be directly harmful to cells, rather, they are consequences of the efforts to remove abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles from the cytoplasm. In a recent study using aDrosophila model in which exogenous expression of human α-synuclein induced Lewy body-like inclusions and dopaminergic neuronal loss, overproduction of a molecular chaperone hsp70 alleviated the neurodegenerative phenotype without reducing the number of inclusion bodies (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). This study also argues against the direct role of α-synuclein-positive inclusion body in the degenerative process. The non-causal relationship of inclusion bodies and cell death has also been proposed in other protein aggregation systems. A degenerative phenotype and the formation of detectable inclusion bodies have been dissociated in cell and animal models that overexpress expanded polyglutamine-containing proteins (32Klement I.A.

In another study using a transgenic mouse model that expresses familial ALS-associated mutant superoxide dismutase 1, small detergent-insoluble protein complex occurs before the onset of disease phenotype, whereas the inclusion bodies can be detected once the clinical symptom is evident (37Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12571-12576Google Scholar). Therefore, regardless of the constituent protein, the presence of inclusion bodies itself does not seem to be directly responsible for the cell death. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that the “process” of inclusion body formation might damage the cells; here, we refer to the process as the cellular events related to the inclusion formation after the diffusion-limited peripheral aggregation. For example, sequestration and depletion of vital proteins and organelles, such as proteasomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes, from the cytoplasm, as seen in the early stage of α-synuclein inclusion formation, could make the cells vulnerable to any secondary stresses. The sequestration, thus the reduced cellular activity, of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has indeed been proposed to be a general consequence of protein aggregation that can lead to cell death (38Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Google Scholar).Interfering with the microtubule-mediated transport could also lead to the Golgi fragmentation. For example, microtubule-disrupting agents, such as nocodazole, cause a redistribution of Golgi proteins to ER exit sites (39Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Google Scholar). Thus, the Golgi fragmentation observed in our study could be a secondary consequence of overloading the microtubule-dependent transport system with the aggregates or of halting the trafficking at the negative ends of microtubules due to the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, rather than the direct effect of the α-synuclein aggregates. We do not have conclusive evidence to support either of these possibilities, but the architecture of the fragmented Golgi indicates that more complex mechanism may underlie the α-synuclein aggregate-induced Golgi fragmentation than the interference of microtubule-dependent transport. In case of the aggregate-induced Golgi fragmentation, components of different Golgi compartments seem to stay together in the Golgi fragments with the intact cis-trans polarity. This finding disagrees with what was observed during the nocodazole-induced Golgi fragmentation, in which trans-Golgi proteins were scattered more rapidly than mid-Golgi proteins, suggesting the separation of Golgi subcompartments from each other prior to the scattering (40Yang W. Storrie B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 191-207Google Scholar).Unlike the small punctate aggregates, juxtanuclear inclusion bodies contain α-synuclein fibrils. No evidence has been obtained for the presence of fibrillar α-synuclein aggregates outside the juxtanuclear inclusions. These findings implicate that, although the mechanism is not understood at present, the structural transition of prefibrillar intermediates into thermodynamically more stable fibrils occurs after they are transported and deposited in the inclusion-forming site (43Lee H.-J. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Google Scholar). A recent study showed that α-synuclein fibrils were far less efficient in disrupting bilayer membranes than protofibrils (41Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Google Scholar), suggesting an inert nature of fibrils. In other studies using recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides that are not implicated in any disease, fibrils were non-toxic when treated to cultured cells, whereas the same treatment with non-fibrillar aggregates, which precede formation of fibrils, resulted in cell death (42Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of fibrillar inclusion bodies might protect the cells from the cytotoxicity of aggregates, not only by removing the prefibrillar aggregates from the cytoplasm but also by providing the right environment for converting them to inert fibrils.In conclusion, the results presented in this report suggest that the pathogenic property of α-synuclein may not stem from its primary structure but from its ability to form toxic aggregates, particularly the prefibrillar aggregates. Importantly, fibrillar inclusions may not be directly toxic, rather, they may represent the outcome of the natural way the cell handles abnormal protein aggregates that are formed randomly throughout the cytoplasm. Thus, both preventing the formation of aggregates and accelerating the conversion of prefibrillar intermediates to fibrillar inclusions might be logical strategies for intervening the pathogenic progress of LB diseases. Many human neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, are characterized by amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein, such as Lewy bodies (LBs) 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Lewy body; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EM, electron microscopy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GA, Golgi apparatus; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; MSA, multiple system atrophy; DAT, dopamine transporter; endoH, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. 1The abbreviations used are: LB, Lewy body; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EM, electron microscopy; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GA, Golgi apparatus; AD, Alzheimer's disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; MSA, multiple system atrophy; DAT, dopamine transporter; endoH, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.and Lewy neurites (1Hardy J.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that is enriched in presynaptic terminals of neurons (3Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Google Scholar). In the test tube, this protein forms fibrils, which resemble the ones isolated from postmortem brains with LB diseases (4Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Google Scholar, 5Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Google Scholar, 6Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Google Scholar). A causative role of fibrillar α-synuclein inclusions in neurodegeneration has been suggested in a mouse model in which formation of intracytoplasmic α-synuclein inclusions coincided with the severe motor impairment (7Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study in a transgenic fly model that express human α-synuclein has shown that co-expression of molecular chaperone hsp70 alleviated the neurodegenerative phenotype but did not reduce the formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusion bodies (8Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). This result raised a question as to whether the fibrillar inclusions play a causative role in neurodegenerative process. Furthermore, recentin vitro studies revealed various non-fibrillar species during the course of fibrillation and suggested a possibility that these metastable intermediate species, not the fibrils themselves, might elicit cytotoxicity (9Conway K.A. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Google Scholar, 10Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Google Scholar). Elucidating which particular aggregate species possess the principal cytotoxic effect holds the key to understanding the etiologic role of protein aggregation in the disease pathogenesis. Study of this problem, however, has been hampered by the lack of an experimental system in which intermediates of the endogenous fibrillation process can be biochemically defined and analyzed. Here, we have established such a system and have assessed the effects of prefibrillar intermediates that are formed naturally in the cytoplasm. In this report, we refer to prefibrillar aggregates as non-fibrillar oligomeric assemblies that precede the formation of fibrils and to inclusions as large deposits of aggregates that are usually found in juxtanuclear location. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report two biological effects of cytoplasmic α-synuclein aggregates; fragmentation of the GA and cell death. The fact that these effects correlate only with the formation of aggregates, and not with the monomer level, suggests that occurrence of these effects depends on the formation of higher order, quaternary structures. The prefibrillar intermediates seem to be responsible for these effects, because both of the effects occur in the presence of small prefibrillar aggregates, and before the formation of fibrillar inclusions. We were able to distinguish specific effects of prefibrillar intermediates from those of monomers and fibrillar inclusions by taking advantage of the following features of our experimental system. First, once the monomer level reaches a plateau, only aggregates increase in response to an increasing amount of α-synuclein cDNA without changing the monomer level. This phenomenon provides an effective means to distinguish the effects of aggregates from those of monomers. Second, the ability to define naturally occurring prefibrillar aggregates and fibrillar inclusions biochemically, allowed kinetic analysis of each species. This study showed that the aggregation process of α-synuclein in cells, similar to the findings in test tube, involves prefibrillar intermediates in the course of forming fibrillar inclusions (43Lee H.-J. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Google Scholar). More importantly, such a kinetic delay of the inclusion formation enabled us to distinguish the cytophysiological effects of prefibrillar intermediates and fibrillar inclusions.Earlier examinations of human brain tissues and animal models have shown that the Golgi fragmentation was associated with the neurodegenerative phenotypes. Fragmentation of the GA has been found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, ALS, CJD, and MSA (16Gonatas N.K. Gonatas J.O. Stieber A. Histochem.

Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Google Scholar). Thus, the Golgi fragmentation observed in our study could be a secondary consequence of overloading the microtubule-dependent transport system with the aggregates or of halting the trafficking at the negative ends of microtubules due to the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, rather than the direct effect of the α-synuclein aggregates. We do not have conclusive evidence to support either of these possibilities, but the architecture of the fragmented Golgi indicates that more complex mechanism may underlie the α-synuclein aggregate-induced Golgi fragmentation than the interference of microtubule-dependent transport. In case of the aggregate-induced Golgi fragmentation, components of different Golgi compartments seem to stay together in the Golgi fragments with the intact cis-trans polarity. This finding disagrees with what was observed during the nocodazole-induced Golgi fragmentation, in which trans-Golgi proteins were scattered more rapidly than mid-Golgi proteins, suggesting the separation of Golgi subcompartments from each other prior to the scattering (40Yang W. Storrie B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 191-207Google Scholar). Unlike the small punctate aggregates, juxtanuclear inclusion bodies contain α-synuclein fibrils. No evidence has been obtained for the presence of fibrillar α-synuclein aggregates outside the juxtanuclear inclusions. These findings implicate that, although the mechanism is not understood at present, the structural transition of prefibrillar intermediates into thermodynamically more stable fibrils occurs after they are transported and deposited in the inclusion-forming site (43Lee H.-J. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48976-48983Google Scholar). A recent study showed that α-synuclein fibrils were far less efficient in disrupting bilayer membranes than protofibrils (41Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Google Scholar), suggesting an inert nature of fibrils. In other studies using recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides that are not implicated in any disease, fibrils were non-toxic when treated to cultured cells, whereas the same treatment with non-fibrillar aggregates, which precede formation of fibrils, resulted in cell death (42Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of fibrillar inclusion bodies might protect the cells from the cytotoxicity of aggregates, not only by removing the prefibrillar aggregates from the cytoplasm but also by providing the right environment for converting them to inert fibrils. In conclusion, the results presented in this report suggest that the pathogenic property of α-synuclein may not stem from its primary structure but from its ability to form toxic aggregates, particularly the prefibrillar aggregates. Importantly, fibrillar inclusions may not be directly toxic, rather, they may represent the outcome of the natural way the cell handles abnormal protein aggregates that are formed randomly throughout the cytoplasm. Thus, both preventing the formation of aggregates and accelerating the conversion of prefibrillar intermediates to fibrillar inclusions might be logical strategies for intervening the pathogenic progress of LB diseases.

Recent identification of several IL-10 homologs has defined a cytokine subfamily that includes AK155, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-24. Within this subfamily, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 exhibit substantial sharing of receptor complexes; all three are capable of signaling through IL-20RA/IL-20RB, and IL-20 and IL-24 both can also use IL-22R/IL-20RB. However, the biological effects of these three cytokines appear quite distinct: immune activity with IL-19, skin biology with IL-20, and tumor apoptosis with IL-24. To more fully elucidate their interactions with the receptor complexes, we have performed a series of in vitro assays. Reporter, proliferation, and direct STAT activation assays using cell lines expressing transfected receptors revealed differences between the receptor complexes. IL-19 and IL-24 also exhibited growth inhibition on a cell line endogenously expressing all three receptor subunits, an effect that was seen at cytokine levels two orders of magnitude above those required for STAT activation or proliferation. These results demonstrate that, although this subclass exhibits receptor complex redundancy, there are differences in ligand/receptor interactions and in signal transduction that may lead to specificity and a distinct biology for each cytokine.

The IL-10 receptor (for review, see Ref. 7Donnelly R.P. Dickensheets H. Finbloom D.S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 563-573Google Scholar) consists of two subunits, a private alpha subunit (IL-10RA) and a beta subunit (IL-10RB), previously known as CRF2–4, that is also part of the IL-22 receptor complex (4Xie M.-H.

Recently, extensive cross-reactivity of the IL-10 subfamily ligands IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24 with two different receptor complexes consisting of IL-20RA/IL-20RB and also IL-22R/IL-20RB was observed (13Dumoutier L.

Although activation of a single receptor complex by multiple ligands is not unusual (e.g. the interferon α/β system), sharing of single receptor subunits between distinct ligand-specific complexes is more common. The sharing of identical receptor complexes within the IL-10 ligand subfamily raises the question of signal specificity. Each of the three ligands we have studied, IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24, appears to have unique biological activity. IL-20 has shown in vitroactivity on keratinocytes, and the IL-20 transgenic phenotype has led to further investigation of IL-20 in skin biology (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L.

IL-24 appears to function as a proapoptotic cytokine in a variety of tumors (15Su Z.-Z. Madireddi M.T. Lin J.J. Young C.S.H. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

These observations suggest distinct physiological roles for each ligand despite the sharing of receptor complexes. We therefore designed a series of experiments to better elucidate the interactions between these three ligands and their receptor complexes. Here we show that all three receptor subunits are expressed in similar cell types in lung tissue, suggesting that at least in some instances a given cell type may respond to a given ligand through both receptor complexes simultaneously. To more fully study the interactions of each ligand with each receptor complex, we have performed both proliferation and reporter assays in two cell types stably transfected with each complex. The results of these assays indicate that each receptor complex responds to its respective ligands in a quantitatively similar fashion. However, growth inhibition experiments on the ovarian carcinoma cell line NIH:OVCAR-3, which endogenously expresses all three receptor subunits, suggest both that receptor recognition alone cannot adequately explain differences in ligand activity and that alternative signaling pathways may be involved. Another series of experiments to further study the activation of individual STAT proteins showed that in transfected cells STAT3 is activated at low (physiological) ligand concentrations, whereas STAT1 activation is seen at much higher levels. RT-PCR was performed on a human Rapid-Scan gene expression panel (Origene Technologies, Inc.) using primers 5′-ccccagacacggtctacagcat-3′ and 5′-gggtcaggccgaagaactcatat-3′ to amplify a 440-bp fragment of human IL22R. PCR conditions are 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 90 s, then a final extension step of 72 °C for 2 min. (See www.origene.com/ge_rs_dlink.html for a description of Rapid-Scan panel construction and control message amplification.) Hybridizations were carried out as described previously for IL-20 receptor subunits (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar). ForIL22R, two independent probes were designed and corresponded to nt 1910–2783 and nt 208–1081 with respect to sequence AF286095. BLASTn searches using our databases, which include all known class II cytokine receptors, confirmed that the probes were specific. A human alpha actin probe was used as a positive control for the tissue samples, which corresponds to nt 603–1328 of sequence NM_001613. A sense probe was used as a negative control. PCR products containing the working sequence of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter were used as templates for synthesis of digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes (Riboprobe in vitro Transcription System, Promega). Hybridization was carried out at 60 °C with 50% formamide/2× SSC. The signals were amplified with two to three rounds of tyramide signal amplification (TSA in situ indirect kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and visualized with Vector Red substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Four different samples of normal human lung tissue were used with each probe. All tissues were tested with positive control probes and confirmed to be suitable for in situ hybridization analysis. Luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously (19Poulsen L.K. Jacobsen N. Sørensen B.B. Bergenhem N.C.H. Kelly J.D. Foster D.C. Thastrup O. Ezban M. Petersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6228-6232Google Scholar) using BHK570 cells stably transfected with IL-20RA and IL-20RB or with IL-22R and IL-20RB and utilizing the STAT-driven luciferase reporter cassette. The STAT elements included in this construct are STATs 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Cells were switched to serum-free medium overnight prior to treatment with serial dilutions of IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 in the presence or absence of IL-20RA/IL-20RB-soluble receptor. Cells were lysed and luciferase reporter activity was determined in triplicate for each data point using a Berthold MicroLumat Plus luminometer. The BaF3 cells were stably transfected with full-length Class II receptor subunits alone or in combinations and treated with IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24. For end point proliferation assays, cells were cultured at 5000 cells/well with variable cytokine concentrations for 72 h at 37 °C. Alamar Blue (Accumed) was added to the cells, and plates were read 24 h later on a fmax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the Softmax Pro program, 544-nm excitation, and 590-nm emission. For kinetic proliferation assays, cells were cultured at 5000 cells/well with 60 pm human IL-20, IL-19, or IL-24 in 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 37 °C. Each well was pulsed with 250 nCi of [3H]thymidine 6 h prior to harvest. Plates were harvested and counted at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of culture. The human ovarian carcinoma cell line NIH:OVCAR-3 (20Hamilton T.C. Young R.C. McKoy W.M. Grotzinger K.R. Green J.A. Chu E.W. Whang-Peng J. Rogan A.M. Green W.R. Ozols R.F.

For growth inhibition assays, cells were plated in culture media at 5000 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture-treated plates (Corning Costar) and allowed to adhere for 24 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were treated in triplicate with each dose of each cytokine for 48 h. Relative live cell counts were determined using MTT Cell Titer 96 Nonradioactive Proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Percent inhibition was defined as the average of 100 − 100 ×[(A 572 −A 650 for unknown)/(A 572− A 650 for growth media control)]. BHK570 cells stably expressing each receptor complex were plated in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at 2000 cells per well. The next day, cells were refed with serum-free medium and starved for 5–16 h. Cytokines were serially diluted into serum-free medium then added to cells to achieve final cytokine concentrations of 0.15–20 nm. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min (STAT1) or 20 min (STAT3). Immediately following incubation, plates were washed, fixed, and stained using protocols provided with STAT1 and STAT3 HitKit reagent kits (Cellomics, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Plates were analyzed using the ArrayScan II instrument running the nuclear translocation protocol (Cellomics, Inc.). A minimum of 100 cells per well was analyzed. Data were subjected to one-tailed unpaired t test with Welch's correction using Prism (GraphPad) software. Untagged recombinant human IL-20 was produced in baculovirus. C-terminally FLAG-tagged IL-19 and IL-24 were expressed in BHK570 cells. IL-20RA- and IL-20RB-soluble receptors were expressed as homodimeric IgG fusion proteins in BHK570 cells. For construction of heterodimeric IL-20RA/IL-20RB, the extracellular domains of IL-20RA and IL-20RB were fused to human IgG with a Gly-Ser (×4) spacer between. In addition, the IL-20RA carried a C-terminal EE affinity tag (GEYMPME), and the IL-20RB carried a C-terminal His6 tag. The receptor subunits were co-expressed in BHK-570 cells, and the IgG fusions were isolated from the culture media by protein-A chromatography. The heterodimers were purified away from the homodimers by immobilized metal chromatography utilizing an imidazole step gradient elution. Recent studies in our laboratory and others have shown redundant interactions between the IL-10 homologs IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 and their newly identified receptor complexes IL-20RA/IL-20RB and IL-22R/IL-20RB (1Blumberg H.

To better understand the functional relevance of the receptor redundancy found in this IL- 20 subfamily, we performed a variety of experiments. Expression analysis using RT-PCR showed that IL20RA is the most widely expressed of the three receptor subunits. Previous RT-PCR analysis using Origene panels showed that both IL20RA andIL20RB mRNAs are highly expressed in skin and testis, and are also expressed in a variety of other tissues, including the lung and ovary (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar). Because IL-22R is a shared alpha subunit, we evaluated an identical Origene panel for the expression ofIL22R mRNA (Fig. 1). TableI provides a summary of our previous data directly compared with the new data shown in Fig. 1. IL22Ris expressed in a few tissues that lack IL20RB expression, notably pancreas, small intestine, and fetal liver. With the exception of peripheral blood lymphocytes, IL20RB was only expressed in tissues that also showed IL20RA expression; most of these lacked IL22R expression. Co-expression of IL22Rand IL20RB was only observed in tissues that also expressedIL20RA. Of these tissues, skin and lung exhibited robust expression of all three receptors.Table ISummary of RT-PCR expression analysis of IL20RA, IL20RB, and IL22R in human tissuesIL20RAIL20RBIL22RBrain+−−Heart+++/−−Kidney+/−−+/−Spleen−−−Liver+/−−+Colon+/−−+Lung+++Small intestine+/−−+Muscle+/−+−Stomach+−−Testis++++−Placenta++−Salivary gland+−−Thyroid gland+−+Adrenal gland+/−+/−+/−Pancreas+−++Ovary++−Uterus+−−Prostate++−−Skin+++++PBL−+/−−Bone marrow−−−Fetal brain−−−Fetal liver−−+ Open table in a new tab Because IL20RA, IL20RB, and IL22R are all expressed in the lung, we performed in situhybridization on lung sections to evaluate whether the same cell types express all three receptors. The results show that epithelial cells as well as immune infiltrates exhibit positive staining for all three receptor subunits (Fig. 2). Taken together, the RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses show that the cellular/tissue content can be similar for IL20RA,IL20RB, and IL22R. To evaluate functional interactions between the IL-20 ligand subfamily and the two receptor complexes, we utilized cells with stably transfected receptors and those determined to express the receptor subunits endogenously and assayed a variety of endpoints. In the first of these experiments, BHK570 cells were stably transfected with IL-20RA/IL-20RB, IL-22R/IL-20RB, or individual receptor subunits alone and treated with increasing amounts of IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. These cells were also stably transfected with a reporter construct consisting of the firefly luciferase gene driven by promoter/enhancer sequences comprised of tandem STAT elements. In all cases where individual receptor subunits were transfected alone, there was no detectable luciferase production (data not shown). As described earlier (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar), there was a dose-dependent increase in reporter luciferase activity in response to IL-20 treatment of BHK cells stably transfected with IL-20RA/IL-20RB (Fig.3 A). IL-19 and IL-24 were equipotent to IL-20 in this assay, with a half-maximal response between 20 and 40 pm. To confirm the specificity of activation, all three ligands were tested in the luciferase assay in the presence or absence of a heterodimeric IL-20RA/IL-20RB-soluble receptor (SR). A 50-fold excess of the SR resulted in nearly complete inhibition of IL-20 effects. Concurrent soluble receptor treatment resulted in a similar inhibition of IL-19- and IL-24-stimulated luciferase activity. A similar set of experiments was performed using the same parental cell line stably transfected with IL-22R/IL-20RB and treated with increasing amounts of IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 (Fig. 3 B). IL-19 had no effect on this cell line. IL-20 and IL-24 were equipotent in stimulating luciferase output in this cell line, with half-maximal stimulation occurring around 60 pm. IL-20 and IL-24 activities were again blocked with SR treatment. We next wanted to determine which soluble receptors were capable of blocking ligand activity. As described above, IL-20RA/IL-20RB heterodimeric soluble receptor blocked luciferase activity stimulated by IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24 on BHK cells bearing either combination of receptors. In similar luciferase assays, neither IL-20RA nor IL-22R was capable of blocking the activity of any of the three ligands (data not shown). In contrast, IL-20RB-soluble receptor alone did block the activity of IL-19 and IL-24, at >1000-fold excess for IL-19 and >100-fold excess for IL-24 (data not shown). Note that this soluble receptor is much less effective than the heterodimeric IL-20RA/IL-20RB, which fully blocked ligand activity at 50-fold excess (see above). Soluble IL-20RB had no effect on the activity of IL-20 at any concentration (data not shown). An additional binding assay (21Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Jones P.F. Acheson A. Compton D.L. Jain V. Ryan T.E. Bruno J. Czeslaw R. Maisonpierre P.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1161-1169Google Scholar), using soluble receptors to detect ligands transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, further confirmed the specific interaction of IL-20RB with both IL-19 and IL-24 (data not shown). We next evaluated proliferation of receptor-transfected BaF3 cells using Alamar Blue as an end point live cell number readout (Fig. 4). IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24 all stimulated proliferation of BaF3 cells stably transfected with both IL-20RA and IL-20RB (Fig. 4 A). All three ligands showed equipotent activity on this cell line, with a half-maximal response occurring between 60 and 75 pm. BaF3 cells were also stably transfected with IL-22R and IL-20RB alone or in combination and treated with these ligands. Both IL-20 and IL-24 stimulate proliferation through IL-22R/IL-20RB (Fig. 4 B), with a half-maximal response detected at ∼6 pm: 10-fold lower than that observed with BaF3 cells expressing IL-20RA/IL-20RB. Given the differences in ligand potency on BaF3 cells expressing each receptor complex, we next evaluated the kinetics of the growth response in these cells using [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. Fig. 5 A shows that all three ligands stimulated a similar and continuous growth of BaF3 cells expressing IL-20RA/IL-20RB over a 72-h period. IL-20 and IL-24, but not IL-19, also stimulated the growth of BaF3 cells transfected with IL-22R/IL-20RB (Fig. 5 B). The rate of growth stimulated by each ligand was similar for the same receptor complex, however, there were obvious differences in growth kinetics between the two cell lines. Cells transfected with IL-22R/IL-20RB proliferated much more rapidly, surpassing the maximal level of growth seen with the other complex within about 40 h. The decline in growth rate seen at 96 h is due to saturation of the culture. At its maximum, the growth rate of these cells is about double that of the cells expressing IL-20RA/IL-20RB. To perform assays on a cell type endogenously expressing all three receptors, we performed RT-PCR analysis on a variety of cell lines and identified one, NIH:OVCAR-3 (20Hamilton T.C. Young R.C. McKoy W.M. Grotzinger K.R. Green J.A. Chu E.W. Whang-Peng J. Rogan A.M. Green W.R. Ozols R.F. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5379-5389Google Scholar), which expresses IL20RA, IL20RB, andIL22R (data not shown). Because IL-24 is known to inhibit growth of a variety of tumor cell lines (3Jiang H. Su Z.-Z. Lin J.J. Goldstein N.I. Young C.H. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9160-9165Google Scholar, 15Su Z.-Z. Madireddi M.T. Lin J.J. Young C.S.H. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14400-14405Google Scholar), we chose to measure ligand-induced growth inhibition in these cells. IL-19 and IL-24, but not IL-20, treatment resulted in a dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect (Fig. 6), with half-maximal responses at about 30 nm: 500- to 5000-fold greater than those measured for proliferation or reporter activation in the receptor-transfected BaF3 and BHK cell lines. This result was confirmed in three independent assays. Concurrent STAT reporter activation experiments with the NIH:OVCAR-3 cells revealed that treatment with IL-19, IL-20, or IL-24 did not result in activation of the STAT pathway (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when a nuclear translocation assay was performed. To determine whether STAT recruitment changes with increasing ligand doses, we directly analyzed STAT protein nuclear translocation using the BHK cell lines stably expressing each receptor complex. These assays measure activation of individual signaling elements by measuring their localization in the nuclear versus cytoplasmic compartment in resting or stimulated cells (22Ding G.J.F. Fischer P.A. Boltz R.C. Schmidt J.A. Colaianne J.J. Gough A. Rubin R.A. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28897-28905Google Scholar). For our assays, STAT1- and STAT3-specific detection reagents were used. In BHK cells bearing the IL-22R/IL-20RB receptor complex, both IL-20 and IL-24 robustly translocate STAT1 and STAT3 (Fig. 7, A andB). The STAT3 translocation reaches the half-maximal level at 1–5 pm cytokine, whereas the STAT1 translocation is half-maximal at 150–800 pm and has dropped to background levels at ligand concentrations below 30 pm. We previously reported nuclear translocation of STAT3 but not STAT1 in response to IL-20 (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar); similarly, both IL-19 and IL-24 translocate STAT3 in BHK cells bearing IL-20RA/IL-20RB (data not shown). In this set of experiments, we did observe some STAT1 recruitment at high IL-20 doses. Similar results were obtained with IL-19 or IL-24, with half-maximal STAT1 translocation at about 400 pm (data not shown). We show that functional differences exist in the IL-20 subfamily in which IL-20, IL-19, and IL-24 exhibit sharing of receptor complexes. Although STAT reporter activation and preferential activation of STAT3versus STAT1 are similar between complexes, differences become apparent when ligand-induced proliferation is compared between receptor complexes. An ovarian carcinoma cell line endogenously expressing all three receptor subunits also responded differentially to the ligands; IL-19 and IL-24 were growth inhibitory, whereas IL-20 was not. Our expression data show that, in most tissues expressing the common subunit IL20RB, the only other subunit expressed isIL20RA. Thus in the majority of cases the cytokines in this subfamily will be expected to signal through IL-20RA/IL-20RB.IL22R is found in a few tissues lacking IL20RBexpression; these include adult and fetal liver, colon, small intestine, and pancreas. In these tissues its role as part of the IL-22 receptor is expected to predominate, consistent with reports of IL-22 proinflammatory activity on hepatocytes (5Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Google Scholar) as well as recent data showing IL-22 activity on pancreatic acinar cells (23Aggarwal S. Xie M.H. Maruoka M. Foster J. Gurney A.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 1047-1053Google Scholar). Interestingly, we did not find any tissue or cell type in which IL22R was expressed with IL20RB in the absence of IL20RA; rather, tissues co-expressing IL22R with IL20RBalso expressed IL20RA. We detected IL20RA andIL22R messages in lung immune infiltrates, which consist largely of specialized macrophages (24Semenzato G. Bortolin M. Facco M. Tassinari C. Sancetta R. Agostini C. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 423-455Google Scholar, 25Laskin D.L. Weinberger B. Laskin J.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 163-170Google Scholar). These messages are detectable neither in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 1 and Table I) nor in resting or activated peripheral immune subsets (26Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5397-5402Google Scholar). Thus they appear to be up-regulated in immune cells only under certain maturation or stimulation conditions. Taken together, these data suggest that, although the primary receptor complex in most cell types is IL-20RA/IL-20RB, in some cell types expressing all three receptor subunits the net signal transduced by a given ligand would depend upon a more complicated set of interactions between that ligand and the two signaling complexes. We studied the types of signals transduced by each receptor complex separately in transfected BHK and BaF3 cells. Although the EC50 values for STAT reporter activation in BHK cells were very similar for all ligand/receptor combinations, there were substantial differences between receptor complexes in their ability to promote proliferation of BaF3 cells. Both IL-20 and IL-24 exhibit 10-fold lower EC50 values for proliferation of BaF3 cells bearing IL-22R/IL-20RB as compared with cells bearing IL-20RA/IL-20RB (summarized in Fig. 8). Although it could be argued that this result may be due to higher ligand affinity for IL-22R/IL-20RB or to higher expression levels of that receptor complex on the assay cell line, it should be noted that the EC50 values for both proliferation and reporter activation are 25- to 200-fold below the measured affinities of the ligands for receptors, where these values are known (Fig. 8). This suggests that these signaling events require only fractional receptor occupancy, and are thus reasonably insensitive to small differences in affinity or receptor number. A more likely explanation is that the signal transduced by IL-22R/IL-20RB differs from that of IL-20RA/IL-20RB in a way that favors proliferation. To further study the differences in signal transduction, we examined nuclear translocation of individual STAT proteins in transfected BHK cells. IL-20 and IL-24 appear equivalent in function when acting through IL-22R/IL-20RB, with robust activation of STAT3 showing EC50 values of 1–5 pm. The EC50value for STAT1 activation is substantially higher, in the 150–800 pm range. When the STAT translocation assays were done on BHK cells bearing IL-20RA/IL-20RB, all three ligands activated STAT3 equivalently. Activation of STAT1 through this complex was slightly more robust with IL-19 and IL-24 as compared with IL-20, but the EC50 values for both activities were consistent with those observed for cells bearing IL-22R/IL-20RB. Taken together our STAT activation data show that at low (below 100 pm) ligand concentrations, STAT3 activation is favored over STAT1 activation through either receptor complex. STAT3 is involved with signal transduction through a wide variety of receptors, and, not surprisingly, ablation of the STAT3 gene results in embryonic lethality (for review, see Refs. 10Ihle J.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 211-217Google Scholar and 27Akira S. Stem Cells. 1999; 17: 138-146Google Scholar). As a result, the critical actions of STAT3 are studied in tissue-specific knockouts. Because the three receptor subunits we studied are all expressed in skin, we were particularly interested in the recent report of keratinocyte-specific ablation of STAT3 (28Sano S. Itami S. Takeda K. Tarutani M. Yamaguchi Y. Miura H. Yoshikawa K. Akira S. Takeda J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4657-4668Google Scholar). Keratinocytes from these mice failed to migrate in response to epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, hepatocyte growth factor, or IL-6, and this defect resulted in impaired wound healing and abnormal hair cycles. The keratinocytes showed normal proliferative responses, leading the authors to conclude that the proliferative response was due to activation of one or more STAT3-independent pathways, whereas the migratory response was STAT3-dependent. We have shown that IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 activate STAT3 through either receptor complex. We previously reported that IL-20 also activates STAT3 in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT and have shown marked synergy of IL-20 with epidermal growth factor, IL-1β, or tumor necrosis factor α in STAT-luciferase reporter assays (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar). Our IL-20 transgenic phenotype and our observation of high receptor expression in psoriatic skin (1Blumberg H. Conklin D. Xu W. Grossmann A. Brender T. Carollo S. Eagan M. Foster D. Haldeman B.A. Hammond A. Haugen H. Jelinek L. Kelly J.D. Madden K. Maurer M.F. Parrish-Novak J. Prunkard D. Sexson S. Sprecher C. Waggie K. West J. Whitmore T.E. Yao L. Kuechle M.K. Dale B.A. Chandrasekher Y.A. Cell. 2001; 104: 9-19Google Scholar) would appear to favor a role of IL-20 in proliferation of keratinocytes. We did not observe changes in keratinocyte migration in IL-20 transgenic mice, but it is possible that such a defect might have become apparent had the mice survived beyond the neonatal period. Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing IL-19 have no apparent skin phenotype,3 and we are unaware of any changes in skin caused by administration of IL-24 (although IL-24 is up-regulated in wound healing (29Soo C. Shaw W.W. Freymiller E. Longaker M.T. Bertolami C.N. Chiu R. Tieu A. Ting K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 1-10Google Scholar)). One hypothesis is that the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes seen in IL-20 transgenics is due to activation of a STAT3-independent pathway unique to IL-20. Future work with mice lacking each of the individual receptor subunits will prove helpful in determining the relative importance of each ligand in skin structure and remodeling. Growth inhibition assays on NIH:OVCAR-3 cells revealed a functional divergence among the three ligands. IL-19 and IL-24 at doses above 600 pm inhibited the growth of this cell line, whereas IL-20 had no effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cytostatic effects of IL-19. The growth inhibitory effect that we detected on OVCAR cells did not appear to be cytotoxicity, because the cells grew normally following removal of the cytokines. The cytostatic effect does not seem to be a general response to treatment with these ligands, because none of the ligands at any concentration affects the growth rate of BHK cells transfected with either receptor complex (data not shown). Several groups have tried to dissect the putative pathways involved in the growth inhibitory activity of IL-24 using adenoviral delivery of this protein. The early work described this activity of IL-24 as growth-suppressing (3Jiang H. Su Z.-Z. Lin J.J. Goldstein N.I. Young C.H. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9160-9165Google Scholar). Su et al. (15Su Z.-Z. Madireddi M.T. Lin J.J. Young C.S.H. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Goldstein N.I. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14400-14405Google Scholar) showed nucleosomal DNA degradation in human breast cancer cells infected with adenoviral IL-24. These previous studies were done using adenoviral delivery of IL-24, whereas our experiments utilized purified proteins. Future experiments will need to better differentiate which effects of IL-24 are specific only to adenoviral delivery of this protein. Because the growth inhibitory effect does not correlate with the receptor complex specificities of the ligands, it may be that the growth inhibition associated with IL-19 and IL-24 results from utilization of another signaling pathway. This pathway could involve signaling through the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, as has recently been observed in lung cancer cell lines (30Pataer A. Vorburger S.A. Barber G.N. Chada S. Mhashailkar A.M. Zou-Yang H. Stewart A.L. Balachandran S. Roth J.A. Hunt K.K. Swisher S.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2239-2243Google Scholar). Use of an alternative pathway is supported by the failure of any of the ligands to activate the STAT/luciferase reporter or nuclear translocation assay in this cell line. Another possibility is that aberrant receptor complexes form at saturating doses of cytokine. Because IL-19 and IL-24 both bind to IL-20RB alone, a quality that IL-20 lacks, they could induce homodimerization of IL-20RB. They could also induce the formation of heterodimers between IL-20RB and an unknown additional receptor subunit. A third possibility is that IL-20 has a lower affinity for the receptor complexes than do IL-19 and IL-24, such that saturation kinetics are reached at the concentrations tested for the latter two but not for IL-20. An example from the interferon α/β system supports this hypothesis. A low affinity ligand, interferon τ, has antiviral properties similar to those of interferon α but is at least 30-fold less toxic. Thus in this system toxicity is associated with saturation binding and is related to theK d value, whereas maximal antiviral activities are induced with only fractional receptor occupancy (31Subramaniam P.S. Khan S.A. Pontzer C.H. Johnson H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12270-12274Google Scholar). A similar mechanism could be responsible for the disparate cytostatic effects of IL-19 and IL-24 as compared with IL-20 despite their similar activities in every other type of assay. We have demonstrated substantial functional differences between the two receptor complexes in the IL-20 subfamily, reflected in proliferation assays. The growth inhibition induced by IL-19 and IL-24 in the OVCAR cells revealed a novel difference between ligands that is not explained by receptor specificity. Future work will be needed to dissect this ligand/receptor system further to better explain the biological differences seen in this family.

The EphA2 receptor is up-regulated in transformed cells and tumor vasculature where it likely contributes to cancer pathogenesis. To exploit EphA2 as a therapeutic target, we used phage display to identify two related peptides that bind selectively to EphA2 with high affinity (submicromolarK D values). The peptides target the ligand-binding domain of EphA2 and compete with ephrin ligands for binding. Remarkably, one of the peptides has ephrin-like activity in that it stimulates EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling. Furthermore, this peptide can deliver phage particles to endothelial and tumor cells expressing EphA2. In contrast, peptides corresponding to receptor-interacting portions of ephrin ligands bind weakly and promiscuously to many Eph receptors. Bioactive ephrin mimetic peptides could be used to selectively deliver agents to Eph receptor-expressing tissues and modify Eph signaling in therapies for cancer, pathological angiogenesis, and nerve regeneration.

Bioactive ephrin mimetic peptides could be used to selectively deliver agents to Eph receptor-expressing tissues and modify Eph signaling in therapies for cancer, pathological angiogenesis, and nerve regeneration. Originally identified as regulators of neural development, the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are also critical for vascular development and pathological forms of angiogenesis (1Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar, 3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar). For example, the EphA2 receptor and ephrin-A1, a ligand for EphA2, are coordinately expressed in the vasculature of human tumors and mouse xenograft tumors grown from human cancer cells (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar). The EphA2 receptor plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PFU, plaque-forming units; AP, alkaline phosphatase; HUVE, human umbilical vein endothelial; MAP, mitogen-activated protein1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PFU, plaque-forming units; AP, alkaline phosphatase; HUVE, human umbilical vein endothelial; MAP, mitogen-activated protein -induced neovascularization because TNFα up-regulates ephrin-A1, which causes receptor activation in blood vessels (5Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Google Scholar). Similarly, the homeobox transcription factor Hox B3 promotes angiogenesis by up-regulating ephrin-A1 (6Myers C. Charboneau A. Boudreau N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 343-351Google Scholar). Furthermore, EphA2 signaling is required for the formation of endothelial capillary tubes in vitro (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 7Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P. St. John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of blood vessel-like structures by melanoma cells (8Hess A.R. Seftor E.A. Gardner L.M. Carles-Kinch K. Schneider G.B. Seftor R.E. Kinch M.S. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3250-3255Google Scholar). The expression of EphA2 appears to be restricted to “activated” adult blood vessels as this receptor has not been detected in either embryonic or adult quiescent blood vessels (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 9Ruiz J.C. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 87-100Google Scholar,10Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624Google Scholar). Ephrin-A1 has also not been detected in adult blood vessels, although it is present in the embryonic vasculature (11McBride J.L. Ruiz J.C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 201-204Google Scholar).In addition to being present in tumor endothelial cells, EphA2 and ephrin-A1 are up-regulated in the transformed cells of a wide variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colon, skin, and esophageal cancers (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 12Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S.

Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 195-203Google Scholar). Many factors increase EphA2 expression in cancer cells including the H-Ras oncogene, E-cadherin, members of the p53 family of transcriptional regulators, DNA damage, and loss of estrogen receptors and c-Myc (16Andres A.C. Reid H.H. Zurcher G. Blaschke R.J. Albrecht D. Ziemiecki A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1461-1467Google Scholar, 17Dohn M. Jiang J.Y. Chen X.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6503-6515Google Scholar, 18Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Peters M.A. Taparowsky E.J. Kinch M.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 714-720Google Scholar).Because the tumor vasculature is discontinuous and leaky in nature, it is possible to utilize the up-regulation of EphA2 and ephrin-A1 to deliver cancer-eradicating agents to both blood vessels and tumor cells (19Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Dvorak J.T. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 95-109Google Scholar). Indeed, systemically administered biological agents can easily penetrate into tumors from the blood circulation (20Essler M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2252-2257Google Scholar). Selectively targeting EphA2 and ephrin-A1 is a challenging task because these proteins belong to large families of closely related proteins (21Eph Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Google Scholar). One approach that has been successfully used to identify peptides that exhibit selectivity for their targets is to screen random peptide libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage (22Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Google Scholar, 23Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T.

Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a phage display approach to search for peptides that bind selectively to the extracellular domains of EphA2 and ephrin-A1. Remarkably the two peptides identified bind selectively to EphA2, but not other Eph receptors, and antagonize ephrin binding. Intriguingly, at least one of the peptides has bioactive properties in that it stimulates EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling. In addition, this peptide delivers phage particles to EphA2-expressing cells and thus can have therapeutic value in delivering agents to tissues that express EphA2. Thus, Eph receptor-binding peptides with different agonistic and drug targeting activities can have important therapeutic applications.DISCUSSIONWe have used phage display to isolate novel peptides that selectively bind to the EphA2 receptor, a cell-surface protein present in pathologic angiogenic vasculature, including tumor vasculature, and in many types of cancer cells (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Thus, targeting this receptor should allow therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases. The YSA peptide could be used to deliver cytotoxic agents to blood vessels of diseased tissues. Indeed, vascular-targeted peptides coupled to chemotherapeutic drugs, toxins, or proapoptotic peptides can decrease tumor growth, suppress clinical arthritis, or destroy prostate tissue (32Arap W.

Bredesen D.E. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Firestein G.S. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 357-361Google Scholar). The YSA peptide has the added benefit in that it stimulates EphA2 activation, which likely mediates internalization of the receptor and the peptide (37Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B.C. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638Google Scholar, 38Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S.

Therefore, toxic or apoptotic substances could be delivered intracellularly to selectively kill cells (34Ellerby H.M. Arap W. Ellerby L.M. Kain R. Andrusiak R. Rio G.D. Krajewski S. Lombardo C.R.

Furthermore, activation of EphA2 signaling induced by the YSA peptide should reduce proliferation, invasiveness, and metastatic behavior of EphA2-expressing cancer cells (28Miao H. Wei B.R.

This is consistent with the finding that EphA2 activation correlates with decreased malignancy of breast and prostate cancer cells and reverses the transforming effects of EphA2 overexpression (18Zelinski D.P.

Intriguingly, EphA2 activation could sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli when the YSA peptide is used to deliver cytotoxic agents (17Dohn M. Jiang J.Y. Chen X.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6503-6515Google Scholar).Phage-displayed peptides isolated by panning on receptors often bind within ligand-binding sites (40Koivunen E. Gay D.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Google Scholar, 44Yayon A. Aviezer D. Safran M. Gross J.L. Heldman Y. Cabilly S. Givol D. Katchalski-Katzir E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our evidence strongly suggests that the YSA and SWL peptides bind to the interface of EphA2 that mediates the initial high affinity heterodimerization with ephrins (31Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Google Scholar). First, the peptides interact with the ligand-binding globular domain of EphA2 and antagonize ephrin binding. Second, at least one of the peptides causes EphA2 phosphorylation and signaling, similar to ephrins. Third, the YSA and SWL peptide, as ephrin-A5, bind to a site whose affinity is regulated by the ephrin-derived A5 peptide (Fig. 5,B and C). This effect of the A5 peptide, which presumably binds to the low affinity tetramerization interface of EphA2 (31Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Google Scholar), also suggests a previously unrecognized allosteric regulation between the two ephrin-binding sites of an Eph receptor.The YSA and SWL peptides bind selectively only to EphA2. Therefore these peptides have features that confer specificity and are not shared by the ephrins and the ephrin-derived peptides. However, the two related YSA and SWL peptides do show similarity to receptor-binding sequences of A-ephrins, including a conserved ΦxxΦ motif (where Φ is an aromatic amino acid and x is a non-conserved amino acid) present in both the dimerization and tetramerization interfaces. Understanding the structural determinants of peptide-binding promiscuityversus specificity and high affinity may allow the rational design of new peptides that bind with high affinity to specific Eph receptors.Conceivably, phage display could also be used to isolate peptides that specifically bind to each of the fifteen known Eph receptors (cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature). Different Eph receptors have been implicated in various types of cancer and should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Indeed, we have already isolated peptides that bind EphB4 (data not shown), another receptor expressed in blood vessels and up-regulated in tumors (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Eph receptors could also be targets for promoting nerve regeneration, where ephrin mimetic peptides could desensitize regenerating nerves to the repulsive effects of ephrins up-regulated at injury sites (46Hornberger M.R. Dutting D. Ciossek T. Yamada T. Handwerker C. Lang S. Weth F. Huf J. Wessel R. Logan C. Tanaka H. Drescher U. Neuron. 1999; 22: 731-742Google Scholar, 47Miranda J.D. White L.A. Marcillo A.E.

Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1929-1936Google Scholar).Bioactive peptides that selectively target an Eph receptor also represent unique reagents for developmental studies to interfere with the activity of a specific receptor, a feat not possible by using the naturally occurring ligands. In addition, such peptides will be useful to discern the signal transduction mechanisms of different Eph receptors in cells expressing multiple receptors. Small-molecule ephrin mimetics with exclusive specificity have great potential value as tools to characterize Eph receptor function and as therapeutics to change such function in disease. Originally identified as regulators of neural development, the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands are also critical for vascular development and pathological forms of angiogenesis (1Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Google Scholar, 2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar, 3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar). For example, the EphA2 receptor and ephrin-A1, a ligand for EphA2, are coordinately expressed in the vasculature of human tumors and mouse xenograft tumors grown from human cancer cells (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar). The EphA2 receptor plays a critical role in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PFU, plaque-forming units; AP, alkaline phosphatase; HUVE, human umbilical vein endothelial; MAP, mitogen-activated protein1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PFU, plaque-forming units; AP, alkaline phosphatase; HUVE, human umbilical vein endothelial; MAP, mitogen-activated protein -induced neovascularization because TNFα up-regulates ephrin-A1, which causes receptor activation in blood vessels (5Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Google Scholar). Similarly, the homeobox transcription factor Hox B3 promotes angiogenesis by up-regulating ephrin-A1 (6Myers C. Charboneau A. Boudreau N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 343-351Google Scholar). Furthermore, EphA2 signaling is required for the formation of endothelial capillary tubes in vitro (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 7Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P. St. John P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar) and promotes the formation of blood vessel-like structures by melanoma cells (8Hess A.R. Seftor E.A. Gardner L.M. Carles-Kinch K. Schneider G.B. Seftor R.E. Kinch M.S. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3250-3255Google Scholar). The expression of EphA2 appears to be restricted to “activated” adult blood vessels as this receptor has not been detected in either embryonic or adult quiescent blood vessels (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 9Ruiz J.C. Robertson E.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 46: 87-100Google Scholar,10Ganju P. Shigemoto K. Brennan J. Entwistle A. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1613-1624Google Scholar). Ephrin-A1 has also not been detected in adult blood vessels, although it is present in the embryonic vasculature (11McBride J.L. Ruiz J.C. Mech. Dev. 1998; 77: 201-204Google Scholar). In addition to being present in tumor endothelial cells, EphA2 and ephrin-A1 are up-regulated in the transformed cells of a wide variety of tumors including breast, prostate, colon, skin, and esophageal cancers (4Ogawa K. Pasqualini R. Lindberg R.A. Kain R. Freeman A.L. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6043-6052Google Scholar, 12Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Stewart J.C. Irizarry A.R. Kinch M.S.

Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 195-203Google Scholar). Many factors increase EphA2 expression in cancer cells including the H-Ras oncogene, E-cadherin, members of the p53 family of transcriptional regulators, DNA damage, and loss of estrogen receptors and c-Myc (16Andres A.C. Reid H.H. Zurcher G. Blaschke R.J. Albrecht D. Ziemiecki A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1461-1467Google Scholar, 17Dohn M. Jiang J.Y. Chen X.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6503-6515Google Scholar, 18Zelinski D.P. Zantek N.D. Walker-Daniels J. Peters M.A. Taparowsky E.J. Kinch M.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 714-720Google Scholar). Because the tumor vasculature is discontinuous and leaky in nature, it is possible to utilize the up-regulation of EphA2 and ephrin-A1 to deliver cancer-eradicating agents to both blood vessels and tumor cells (19Dvorak H.F. Nagy J.A. Dvorak J.T. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 95-109Google Scholar). Indeed, systemically administered biological agents can easily penetrate into tumors from the blood circulation (20Essler M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2252-2257Google Scholar). Selectively targeting EphA2 and ephrin-A1 is a challenging task because these proteins belong to large families of closely related proteins (21Eph Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Google Scholar). One approach that has been successfully used to identify peptides that exhibit selectivity for their targets is to screen random peptide libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage (22Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Google Scholar, 23Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Ruoslahti E. Pasqualini R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 768-774Google Scholar, 24Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Google Scholar, 25Devlin J.J. Panganiban L.C. Devlin P.E. Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a phage display approach to search for peptides that bind selectively to the extracellular domains of EphA2 and ephrin-A1. Remarkably the two peptides identified bind selectively to EphA2, but not other Eph receptors, and antagonize ephrin binding. Intriguingly, at least one of the peptides has bioactive properties in that it stimulates EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling. In addition, this peptide delivers phage particles to EphA2-expressing cells and thus can have therapeutic value in delivering agents to tissues that express EphA2. Thus, Eph receptor-binding peptides with different agonistic and drug targeting activities can have important therapeutic applications. DISCUSSIONWe have used phage display to isolate novel peptides that selectively bind to the EphA2 receptor, a cell-surface protein present in pathologic angiogenic vasculature, including tumor vasculature, and in many types of cancer cells (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Thus, targeting this receptor should allow therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases. The YSA peptide could be used to deliver cytotoxic agents to blood vessels of diseased tissues. Indeed, vascular-targeted peptides coupled to chemotherapeutic drugs, toxins, or proapoptotic peptides can decrease tumor growth, suppress clinical arthritis, or destroy prostate tissue (32Arap W. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1998; 279: 377-380Google Scholar, 33Olson T.A. Mohanraj D. Roy S. Ramakrishnan S. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 865-870Google Scholar, 34Ellerby H.M. Arap W.

Bredesen D.E. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Firestein G.S. Arthritis Res. 2001; 3: 357-361Google Scholar). The YSA peptide has the added benefit in that it stimulates EphA2 activation, which likely mediates internalization of the receptor and the peptide (37Zantek N.D. Azimi M. Fedor-Chaiken M. Wang B.C. Brackenbury R. Kinch M.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 629-638Google Scholar, 38Carles-Kinch K. Kilpatrick K.E. Stewart J.C. Kinch M.S.

Therefore, toxic or apoptotic substances could be delivered intracellularly to selectively kill cells (34Ellerby H.M. Arap W. Ellerby L.M. Kain R. Andrusiak R. Rio G.D. Krajewski S. Lombardo C.R. Rao R. Ruoslahti E. Bredesen D.E. Pasqualini R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1032-1038Google Scholar).

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6503-6515Google Scholar). Phage-displayed peptides isolated by panning on receptors often bind within ligand-binding sites (40Koivunen E. Gay D.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20205-20210Google Scholar, 41Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Google Scholar, 42Pasqualini R. Koivunen E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11593-11598Google Scholar) and can mimic natural receptor-binding motifs of ligands (42Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Google Scholar, 44Yayon A. Aviezer D. Safran M. Gross J.L. Heldman Y. Cabilly S. Givol D. Katchalski-Katzir E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10643-10647Google Scholar, 45Wright R.M. Gram H. Vattay A. Byme S. Lake P. Dottavio D. Bio-Technology. 1995; 13: 165-169Google Scholar). Our evidence strongly suggests that the YSA and SWL peptides bind to the interface of EphA2 that mediates the initial high affinity heterodimerization with ephrins (31Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Google Scholar). First, the peptides interact with the ligand-binding globular domain of EphA2 and antagonize ephrin binding. Second, at least one of the peptides causes EphA2 phosphorylation and signaling, similar to ephrins. Third, the YSA and SWL peptide, as ephrin-A5, bind to a site whose affinity is regulated by the ephrin-derived A5 peptide (Fig. 5,B and C). This effect of the A5 peptide, which presumably binds to the low affinity tetramerization interface of EphA2 (31Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Google Scholar), also suggests a previously unrecognized allosteric regulation between the two ephrin-binding sites of an Eph receptor. The YSA and SWL peptides bind selectively only to EphA2. Therefore these peptides have features that confer specificity and are not shared by the ephrins and the ephrin-derived peptides. However, the two related YSA and SWL peptides do show similarity to receptor-binding sequences of A-ephrins, including a conserved ΦxxΦ motif (where Φ is an aromatic amino acid and x is a non-conserved amino acid) present in both the dimerization and tetramerization interfaces. Understanding the structural determinants of peptide-binding promiscuityversus specificity and high affinity may allow the rational design of new peptides that bind with high affinity to specific Eph receptors. Conceivably, phage display could also be used to isolate peptides that specifically bind to each of the fifteen known Eph receptors (cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature). Different Eph receptors have been implicated in various types of cancer and should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Indeed, we have already isolated peptides that bind EphB4 (data not shown), another receptor expressed in blood vessels and up-regulated in tumors (2Dodelet V.C. Pasquale E.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Google Scholar). Eph receptors could also be targets for promoting nerve regeneration, where ephrin mimetic peptides could desensitize regenerating nerves to the repulsive effects of ephrins up-regulated at injury sites (46Hornberger M.R.

Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1929-1936Google Scholar). Bioactive peptides that selectively target an Eph receptor also represent unique reagents for developmental studies to interfere with the activity of a specific receptor, a feat not possible by using the naturally occurring ligands. In addition, such peptides will be useful to discern the signal transduction mechanisms of different Eph receptors in cells expressing multiple receptors. Small-molecule ephrin mimetics with exclusive specificity have great potential value as tools to characterize Eph receptor function and as therapeutics to change such function in disease.

https://openalex.org/W2021155980,"The α-synuclein fibrillation process has been associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we have characterized the cytoplasmic α-synuclein aggregates using a fractionation procedure with which different aggregate species can be separated. Overexpression of α-synuclein in cells produce two distinct types of aggregates: large juxtanuclear inclusion bodies and small punctate aggregates scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Biochemical fractionation results in an inclusion-enriched fraction and two small aggregate fractions. Electron microscopy and thioflavin S reactivity of the fractions show that the juxtanuclear inclusion bodies are filled with amyloid-like α-synuclein fibrils, whereas both the small aggregate fractions contain non-fibrillar spherical aggregates with distinct size distributions. These aggregates appear sequentially, with the smallest population appearing the earliest and the fibrillar inclusions the latest. Based on the structural and kinetic properties, we suggest that the small spherical aggregates are the cellular equivalents of the protofibrils. The proteins that co-exist in the Lewy bodies, such as proteasome subunit, ubiquitin, and hsp70 chaperone, are present in the fibrillar inclusions but absent in the protofibrils, suggesting that these proteins may not be directly involved in the early aggregation stage. As predicted in the aggresome model, disruption of microtubules with nocodazole reduced the number of inclusions and increased the size of the protofibrils. Despite the increased size, the protofibrils remained non-fibrillar, suggesting that the deposition of the protofibrils in the juxtanuclear region is important in fibril formation. This study provides evidence that the cellular fibrillation also involves non-fibrillar intermediate species, and the microtubule-dependent inclusion-forming process is required for the protofibril-to-fibril conversion in cells.

This study provides evidence that the cellular fibrillation also involves non-fibrillar intermediate species, and the microtubule-dependent inclusion-forming process is required for the protofibril-to-fibril conversion in cells. A group of human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's Disease; LB, Lewy body; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; EM, electron microscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SB, 1× Laemmli sample buffer; fr, fraction. dementia with Lewy bodies (LBs), and multiple system atrophy, are characterized by cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are mainly composed of α-synuclein fibrils (1Trojanowski J.Q. Goedert M. Iwatsubo T. Lee V.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 832-837Google Scholar, 2Goedert M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 492-501Google Scholar). Although direct role of fibrils and the inclusion bodies in the disease pathogenesis is the subject of intense debate, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the processes of fibrillation and inclusion formation are closely related to the disease mechanism. First, two missense mutations (A53T and A30P) that are responsible for the familial PD has been identified in α-synuclein gene (3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L.

Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Google Scholar), and the mutant proteins have greater propensity for the self-association and aggregation than the wild type protein (5Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Google Scholar, 6Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol.

Indeed, both mutations accelerated the formation of the pre-fibrillar oligomers in vitro, whereas the fibril formation was slowed by one of the mutations (7Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11604-11613Google Scholar, 8Conway K.A. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 571-576Google Scholar). Second, transgenic animal models that were generated by the overexpression of human α-synuclein developed neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies along with neuronal cell loss and behavioral defects (9Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Google Scholar, 10Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L.

S. A. 2002; 99: 8968-8973Google Scholar). Some of these animals produce fibrillar inclusions (9Feany M.B. Bender W.W. Nature. 2000; 404: 394-398Google Scholar, 12Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Google Scholar), but others generate only the granular aggregates (10Masliah E. Rockenstein E. Veinbergs I. Mallory M. Hashimoto M. Takeda A. Sagara Y. Sisk A. Mucke L. Science. 2000; 287: 1265-1269Google Scholar). In a rat Parkinson's model, established by a systemic administration of rotenone, nigrostriatal degeneration and the motor symptoms were also accompanied by α-synuclein-positive inclusion bodies (14Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Google Scholar). Therefore, the cellular mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation is likely to be linked to at least some aspects of the disease process. Although the process of α-synuclein fibril formation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD by genetic and biochemical evidence, the exact mechanism by which the processes of α-synuclein fibrillation and inclusion body formation contribute to neurodegeneration is currently unknown. In dilute solution, α-synuclein does not have stable structure (15Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Google Scholar) except for some residual helical structure in the N terminus of the protein (16Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Google Scholar). Fibrillation of α-synuclein is a nucleation-dependent process (17Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Google Scholar) and is initiated by acquiring a partially folded conformation (18Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Google Scholar), which is subsequently stabilized by self-association (19Uversky V.N. Lee H.-J. Li J. Fink A.L. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43495-43498Google Scholar). Prior to the formation of the fibril, the end product of the process, several non-fibrillar oligomeric aggregates, or protofibrils, were identified (20Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Google Scholar). Earliest and most common protofibrillar species are in a spherical shape with average height of 4.2 nm in case of wild type protein (21Ding T.T. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Google Scholar). The spherical protofibrils are thought to undergo head-to-tail associations to form elongated chain-like (22Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Google Scholar), and ring-like protofibrillar species (21Ding T.T. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Google Scholar). In their search for a potential pathogenic mechanism for α-synuclein protofibrils, Lansbury and colleagues (23Volles M.J. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Shtilerman M.D. Ding T.T. Kessler J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7812-7819Google Scholar, 24Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Google Scholar) demonstrated that only protofibrillar α-synuclein bind tightly and permeabilize synthetic vesicles in a size-selective manner, suggesting membrane disruption via a pore-like mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that the two pathogenic mutations (A53T and A30P) promote the formation of annular pore-like protofibrils (25Lashuel H.A. Hartley D. Petre B.M. Walz T. Lansbury P.T. Nature. 2002; 418: 291Google Scholar) and result in an increased permeabilization activity relative to the wild type protein (24Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Google Scholar). Although some of the basic processes of α-synuclein aggregation, including the protofibrils with different morphologies, have been characterized in vitro, little is known about the fibrillation process or the intermediate protofibrillar species in cells. To understand the mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation in cells, the following questions need to be addressed: (i) What is the end product of α-synuclein aggregation process in cells? (i.e. is it the fibril or other aggregate form?) (ii) What are the intermediates that proceed α-synuclein fibrillation in cells? (iii) Is the fibrillation process linked to the inclusion formation process, and if so, how? Here, using a combination of biochemical fractionation, immunofluorescence labeling, and electron microscopy (EM), we show that cells produce inclusion bodies that are filled with α-synuclein fibrils. Before the appearance of the fibrillar inclusions, small non-fibrillar aggregates are formed, and the basic properties of these aggregates suggest that they are the cellular equivalent of the protofibrils. Our study also provides evidence that the inclusion-forming process, which is characterized by the transport of α-synuclein protofibrils and other cellular components to the pericentriolar region, is required for the conversion of protofibrils to fibrils. Transformed African monkey kidney cell line COS-7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.) in a 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified incubator. To express α-synuclein, COS-7 cells were split on 100-mm tissue culture dishes 1 day prior to infection to obtain ∼90% confluence on the day of infection. For infection, recombinant adenoviral vector (26Lee H.-J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar) was added to each dish at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 75. After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, 9 ml of fresh medium was added and the cells were maintained at 37 °C. The cells were then split the next day to ∼40% confluency and maintained for another 48 h or as indicated. Note that, in our culture condition, the time course of aggregation varies depending on the size of the culture dish used. For example, cells cultured in a 100-mm dish show more rapid aggregation than the cells in smaller dishes. COS-7 cells expressing α-synuclein were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before addition of buffer T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) to each dish. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the supernatant containing Triton-soluble proteins was carefully removed from plates. After gentle washing of dishes with PBS, the Triton-insoluble materials were scraped in buffer N (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, protease inhibitor mixture), resuspended by repeated pipetting, and incubated on ice for 5 min. The extract was then centrifuged at 80 × g for 10 min. The pellet containing big inclusions was resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (SB) for Western blot analysis, in PBS for immunofluorescence staining, or in 0.1m phosphate buffer for EM. The supernatant containing small aggregates was then overlaid onto a discontinuous density gradient of 2.5%, 25%, and 35% iodixanol solutions (3:3:1, v/v) in buffer T and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The fractions were obtained from the top of the gradient, diluted with 2 volumes of PBS, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets from fractions were then resuspended in 1× SB for Western blot analysis, in PBS for immunofluorescence staining, or in 0.1m phosphate buffer for EM. Western blot analysis was performed according to the procedure described in Lee et al. (27Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P.E. Xia W. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 730-734Google Scholar). LB509 monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). The procedure for cell staining has been described elsewhere (26Lee H.-J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then blocked in blocking solution (PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum). Primary antibodies in blocking solution were added at dilutions described below and incubated for 30 min: LB509 monoclonal α-synuclein antibody (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), 7071 polyclonal α-synuclein antibody (1:1000, provided by Peter Lansbury at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), anti-ubiquitin antibody (1:1000, Chemicon), anti-Hsp70/Hsc70 antibody (1:200, StressGen), anti-20S proteasome α-subunit antibody (1:200,Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA). Coverslips were extensively washed for 1–1.5 h with PBS before addition of fluorescent dye (Cy3, Cy2, or Rhodamine Red X)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in blocking solution for 30 min. Stainings with Thioflavin S (Sigma) and Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were performed according to Lee et al. (26Lee H.-J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar). For staining of obtained fractions, the samples in PBS were placed on coverslips and let partially dry. After fixing the coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, the staining was done in the same manner as described above. COS-7 cells expressing α-synuclein and α-synuclein fractions in PBS were prepared for section as described in Bouley et al. (28Bouley D.M. Ghori N. Mercer K.L. Falkow S. Ramakrishnan L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7820-7831Google Scholar). For the immunolabeling, the sections were incubated in 1% gelatin in PBS and then in 0.03m glycine in PBS. After blocking in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the sections were incubated with LB509 antibody (1:250) in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, followed by 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The sections were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For negative staining of fibrils from the inclusion bodies, the pellet from an 80 × g spin was rinsed and then resuspended in PBS and incubated in 1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature. After the incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 80 × g to remove undissolved inclusion bodies, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and then placed on a carbon-coated grid. The grid was incubated with LB509 antibody (1:250), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with a 10-nm gold particle, and after two rinses with distilled water, it was stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The images were obtained using a Philips CM 12 electron microscope. To characterize the cytoplasmic α-synuclein aggregates, we established a mammalian cell culture model using COS-7 cells and recombinant adenoviral vector. In this model, expression of monomer is saturated at an m.o.i. of about 25, and higher expression over the saturation point induces the spontaneous aggregation, which shows an exponential increase with respect to the increasing m.o.i (40Gosavi N. Lee H.-J. Lee J.S. Patel S. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48984-48992Google Scholar). Alternatively, inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory chain, such as rotenone, greatly enhance α-synuclein aggregation even at the expression level slightly above the saturation point (m.o.i. of 35), in which the spontaneous aggregation is minimal (26Lee H.-J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar). In this study, the spontaneous α-synuclein aggregation was induced in COS-7 cells at m.o.i. 75, and the resulting cytoplasmic aggregates were characterized using biochemical fractionation combined with imaging analyses. Similar to what was observed in the rotenone-induced α-synuclein aggregation (26Lee H.-J. Shin S.Y. Choi C. Lee Y.H. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5411-5417Google Scholar), spontaneous aggregation at m.o.i. 75 resulted in two types of aggregates that are distinct in their sizes and cytoplasmic distributions. One type is represented by small punctate aggregates that are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and the other is large juxtanuclear inclusion bodies (Fig. 1). The juxtanuclear inclusion bodies bind to thioflavin S (Fig. 1B), a fluorescent dye specific for the highly ordered cross β-sheet structure, thus an indicative of the amyloid-like fibrillar structures (see below for the ultrastructural analysis). In contrast, the small punctate aggregates are thioflavin S-negative (Fig. 1A), indicating a non-fibrillar conformation. The difference in the dye binding properties suggests that these two types of aggregates have different structural properties. Previous immunohistochemical studies of human LBs showed that they are also stained with ubiquitin (29Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar), proteasomes (30Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Google Scholar), and molecular chaperones, such as hsp70 (11Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). To determine whether the inclusion bodies in our cell system contain these proteins, we co-stained the cells for α-synuclein with ubiquitin, α-subunit of 20 S proteasome, or hsp70. Like human LBs, large juxtanuclear inclusion bodies were positive for all these proteins (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, most of the peripheral punctate aggregates were not stained with ubiquitin, the proteasome subunit, or hsp70 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the cells with small punctate aggregates display brighter staining in the perinuclear region for ubiquitin, hsp70, and 20 S α-subunit proteins than the cells without aggregates (data not shown), where they show some degree of co-localization with α-synuclein punctate aggregates (Fig. 1A). Mitochondria and lysosomes are also elevated and accumulated in the perinuclear region along with the small punctate α-synuclein aggregates (40Gosavi N. Lee H.-J. Lee J.S. Patel S. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48984-48992Google Scholar). The accumulation of these proteins and organelles, which are required for the degradation of macromolecules in the perinuclear region, at what appears to be an early stage of inclusion formation, supports the hypothesis that the inclusion-forming process represents how the cells deliberately sequester and degrade abnormal protein aggregates at the specialized subcellular location. To further characterize different types of α-synuclein aggregates, we have established a procedure by which these aggregates are separated into different fractions (Fig. 2A). Cells that produce α-synuclein aggregates were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in the culture dish, and the Triton-soluble proteins were gently removed. Under this condition, the soluble monomeric α-synuclein was completely removed, and the aggregates remained in the culture dish, probably due to their association with unknown structures. The remaining Triton-insoluble portion was then scraped in basic pH buffer, in which the aggregates were dissociated from the cellular structures, and centrifuged at 80 × g. After the centrifugation at 80 × g for 10 min, the pellet fraction was found to contain exclusively the large inclusion bodies, whereas the supernatant contained predominantly small α-synuclein aggregates (see below). In an attempt to further separate the different α-synuclein aggregates, the supernatant was then subjected to a density gradient centrifugation as described in Fig. 2A. Western blot analysis of the fractions (fr) identified three distinct fractions containing SDS-resistant α-synuclein aggregates (fr 2, fr 4, and 80 ×g pellet) (Fig. 2B). Although fr 7 also contains α-synuclein aggregates in some cases, immunofluorescence and immuno-EM studies suggested that this fraction consists of clumps of heterogeneous α-synuclein aggregates, which appear to be a mixture of the aggregates found in fr 2 and fr 4 (data not shown). Dual fluorescence labeling shows that fr 2 and 4 contain small punctate aggregates that are thioflavin S-negative, whereas the 80 ×g pellet contains large inclusion bodies that are thioflavin S-positive (Fig. 3A), confirming the in situ immunofluorescence results (Fig. 1). Also consistent with the in situ immunofluorescence staining, the small aggregates do not contain ubiquitin, hsp70, or 20 S proteasome α-subunit, whereas the large inclusion bodies in the 80 × g pellet were positive for these proteins (Fig. 3, B–D). The inclusion bodies were found exclusively in the 80 × g pellet. These results confirm that the cells produce different types of α-synuclein aggregates with distinct conformational and compositional properties and that the separation of these aggregates can be achieved using our procedure. To further analyze the ultrastructural features of α-synuclein aggregates, the fractions were examined by immuno-EM. The aggregates in both fr 2 and fr 4 appear to be non-fibrillar spheres (Fig. 4, A and B). To compare the size distributions of aggregates in fr 2 and fr 4, we measured the diameter of each aggregate labeled with α-synuclein antibody (Fig. 4C). Those aggregates that are irregular in shape were measured across the longest and shortest axes, and the median value was calculated. Random measurement of the diameter of these spheres shows the different size distributions in these fractions, and the calculated mean diameters for fr 2 and fr 4 were 24 and 34 nm, respectively. EM analysis confirmed that the large inclusion bodies were enriched in the 80 × g pellet, and they were immunostained with α-synuclein antibody (Fig. 5A). However, in contrast to the small spherical aggregates in fr 2 and fr 4, the inclusions are filled with fibril structures. To further characterize the fibrils of these inclusion bodies, the 80 × g pellet was disrupted in 1% SDS, and the released fibrils were collected by 100,000 × g centrifugation. The fibrils isolated from the inclusions were 8–13 nm in width and were clearly labeled with α-synuclein antibody (Fig. 5B). These fibrils resembled the ones isolated from human LBs (29Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar) or the inclusions of the transgenic mice (12Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Quinn S.M. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 521-533Google Scholar). Thicker structures, which appear to be fibril bundles, were also frequently observed (Fig. 5C). These ultrastructural morphologies, along with the thioflavin S binding property, demonstrate that the α-synuclein aggregation process in our cell model produces the inclusion bodies that are composed of α-synuclein fibrils, thus suggesting that this process of inclusion body formation in these cells may resemble the process of LB formation in human brain. To gain insights into the dynamic relationship between different aggregate species, we investigated the time-dependent formation of the small spherical aggregates and the fibrillar inclusions in the 80 × g supernatant and pellet fractions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6A, the small aggregates in the 80 × g supernatant became apparent as early as 48 h post-infection and increased with time. On the other hand, the fibrillar inclusions in the 80 × g pellet did not appear until 60 h (Fig. 6A). This result suggests that the small spherical aggregates are formed before the formation of fibrillar inclusions. We then investigated the time course for the two subspecies of spherical aggregates. Fractionation of the spherical aggregates at different time points shows that the fr 2 aggregates are the earliest species formed, appearing at 48 h (Fig. 6B, top panel). The fr 4 aggregates were formed slightly later at around 54 h (Fig. 6B, second panel). Both species increased progressively at later time points, but the increase was more dramatic for the fr 4 aggregates (Fig. 6B). The fact that these two fractions show differences in both the time of appearance and the rate of increase suggests that they are distinct aggregate species and that the fr 2 aggregates may be the precursors for the fr 4 aggregates. It has been demonstrated with a number of proteins that the juxtanuclear inclusion formation requires the microtubule-dependent transport of peripheral small aggregates to the pericentriolar region (31Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar, 32Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar). To test whether microtubule-dependent transport is important for the formation of α-synuclein inclusion body, we treated the cells with a microtubule-disrupting agent, nocodazole, and assessed the inclusion formation in two ways. First, the number of inclusion bodies was counted after the immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 7A). Second, the relative amounts of inclusion bodies and small non-fibrillar aggregates were measured after the fractionation (Fig. 7B). Both analyses clearly show the decrease of the inclusion bodies after nocodazole treatment, implicating the importance of microtubule-dependent transport system in the inclusion formation. Furthermore, the fractionation experiment shows that the reduction of inclusion bodies is accompanied by the increase of the small aggregates (Fig. 7B), confirming that nocodazole inhibits the transport of the small aggregates rather than the aggregation per se. Interestingly, when the microtubule is disrupted, bigger foci were frequently found in the periphery of the cell (Fig. 7C), which implies that the peripheral aggregates can grow bigger to a certain extent, if their transport to the pericentriolar region is blocked. This finding raised a question as to whether the large foci that are grown in the periphery of the cell can acquire the characteristics of the juxtanuclear inclusion bodies. To answer this question, we investigated the thioflavin S binding property and the immunoreactivities for the proteins that are found in the inclusion bodies. Unlike the juxtanuclear inclusion bodies, the large peripheral foci are thioflavin S-negative, indicative of the non-fibrillar nature of the aggregates and devoid of ubiquitin, hsp70, and 20 S proteasome α-subunit (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that fibrillation and acquisition of the auxiliary proteins are not spontaneous consequences of the aggregate growth, rather, they are closely linked to the microtubule-dependent inclusion-forming process. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that overexpression of α-synuclein or exposure of cells to mitochondrial inhibitors produces two distinct forms of α-synuclein aggregate; small punctate aggregates that are scattered throughout the cytoplasm and large juxtanuclear inclusion bodies. Here, we have characterized the structural natures of these aggregates and investigated the relationship between them in the context of inclusion forming process. Using biochemical fractionation and EM analysis, we have demonstrated small aggregates are non-fibrillar spheres, and the inclusion bodies are filled with α-synuclein fibrils. Time-dependent analysis shows that small non-fibrillar aggregates precede the formation of fibrillar inclusions. An anti-microtubule agent, nocodazole, causes a reduction in the number of fibrillar inclusions and the accumulation of non-fibrillar aggregates in the cytoplasm, suggesting that these non-fibrillar aggregates are the precursors of the fibrillar aggregates in the inclusion bodies. Protofibrils are described as non-fibrillar aggregates that precede the fibril formation and are often enriched with β-sheet structure (20Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Google Scholar). Although the conformational characteristics of the cytoplasmic aggregates are not yet available, the ultrastructural and kinetic properties suggest that the small non-fibrillar aggregates are the cellular equivalents of the protofibrils. In solution, fibrillation of α-synuclein, which involves a number of metastable intermediate species, including various protofibrils, is a continuous process, because all the monomers and assembly intermediates are freely diffusible and available for the molecular interactions. However, in cells, fibrillar α-synuclein aggregates are found exclusively in the juxtanuclear inclusions, and interfering with the transport of protofibrils to the pericentriolar region inhibits the fibril formation. These findings support the hypothesis that monomer to protofibril conversion and protofibril to fibril conversion are spatially separate processes; the former seems to be a diffusion-limited reaction that occurs throughout the cytoplasm, whereas the latter is restricted only in the pericentriolar region. In cells, the protofibrils seem to be associated with detergent-insoluble structures, 2H.-J. Lee and S.-J. Lee, unpublished data. which limits their chance to interact with one another. When microtubule-mediated transport is disrupted with nocodazole, peripheral protofibrils become larger than normal but do not turn into fibrils. Thus, it is only after the protofibrils are transported and deposited in the pericentriolar region that the interactions between the protofibrils are allowed to undergo the transformation into fibrils. Protofibrillar intermediates (often in a spherical morphology) have been found in virtually all fibrillation characterized, thus becoming a universal mechanism of amyloid-like fibril formation (33Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar, 34Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Google Scholar, 35Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Google Scholar, 36Poirier M.A. Li H. Macosko J. Cai S. Amzel M. Ross C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41032-41037Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the protofibril-to-fibril transition is not clearly understood. In vitro, most α-synuclein protofibrils are either in a spherical shape or in the morphologies (chain-like and annular pore-like structures) that appear to be produced by the association of the spherical protofibrils (20Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Google Scholar, 21Ding T.T. Lee S.-J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Google Scholar). This observation implies that the protofibril spheres can self-associate to form higher-order structures. A similar mechanism has been proposed in the fibrillation of sup35 protein (N-terminal and mid-domain fragment) in which oligomer-oligomer interactions precede the conformational changes to amyloid-like fibrils (34Serio T.R. Cashikar A.G. Kowal A.S. Sawicki G.J. Moslehi J.J. Serpell L. Arnsdorf M.F. Lindquist S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1317-1321Google Scholar). Our observation that the fibril formation occurs only when the protofibrils are concentrated and allowed to interact with one another also supports the possibility that the fibril formation in vivo could be driven by protofibril-protofibril interactions. However, our findings do not exclude the role of monomers in the cellular fibrillation process. Direct incorporation of monomers into the fibrils could also play a role in fibril growthin vivo. In vitro studies show that when the protofibrils are populated in solution, the transition from spherical aggregates to the amyloid-like fibrils is a spontaneous process. However, in cells this process may be assisted by the proteins that are co-accumulated with α-synuclein aggregates in the pericentriolar region, such as molecular chaperones. Microtubule-dependent deposition of peripheral aggregates into the pericentriolar region has been documented with several other proteins, and the resulting inclusion bodies are referred to as aggresomes (37Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Google Scholar, 38Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Google Scholar). Aggresome represents one of the end points of cellular responses to misfolded proteins, with other competing end points being degradation and refolding. Although many proteins share the same mechanism for the deposition in the pericentriolar region, the physical states of the final aggregated forms seem to be determined by the conformational properties of individual proteins. For example, aggregates of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (31Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar) or GFP-250 (32Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Google Scholar) remain granular in shape, whereas α-synuclein aggregates are transformed into fibrils after deposition in the aggresomes. If the recent proposal is correct that protofibrils are the pathogenic species (20Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Google Scholar), accelerating the transformation of disease-associated protofibrils into fibrils would have evolutionary advantage. Developing noninvasive ways to interfere with the transport of protofibrils to the inclusion-forming site or the structural transition to fibrils will allow us to assess the role of these processes in α-synuclein-mediated cell death. Inclusion bodies, either the ones that are produced in our cell system or LBs in human brain, contain protein components other than α-synuclein fibrils, such as proteasome subunits (30Ii K. Ito H. Tanaka K. Hirano A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 125-131Google Scholar), ubiquitin (29Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Google Scholar), and molecular chaperones (11Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Google Scholar). Their presence in inclusion bodies raises the question of whether they co-aggregate with α-synuclein or even promote the aggregation process. Our study shows that α-synuclein protofibrils, both the ones in the cells or isolated from the cells, are not stained for these proteins, but they are co-deposited in the perikaryal region with α-synuclein protofibrils. In a previous study, we have shown that early stage α-synuclein oligomerization in crude cytosol preparation is highly self-selective (19Uversky V.N. Lee H.-J. Li J. Fink A.L. Lee S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43495-43498Google Scholar). In agreement with our findings, Rajan et al. (39Rajan R.S. Illing M.E. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13060-13065Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that aggregation of misfolded proteins is the result of highly specific self-association, rather than nonspecific interactions between unrelated proteins. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proteins that co-exist in the inclusion bodies play a direct role in promoting α-synuclein aggregation. Rather, it seems more likely that the presence of protein degradation machineries and the molecular chaperones is an indication of an attempt by the cell to clear these protein deposits. Fractionation of protofibrillar aggregates resulted in the separation of two subspecies with distinct size distribution. It is not entirely clear at the moment whether they represent two distinct intermediates in a linear process or one of them is an artificial outcome that are formed during the extraction procedure, such as fragmentation of larger aggregates to smaller pieces or large clumps of aggregates due to an incomplete resuspension. If they were the same species, it would be predicted that their kinetic behavior is identical. However, our time-course experiment shows that these two species have clearly distinctive kinetics: the smaller species appears first, followed by the larger one. Thus, it is likely that they are distinct entities and may be related in a linear process. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that α-synuclein fibrillation is tightly associated with the microtubule-dependent inclusion-forming process, which seems to be necessary for the protofibril-to-fibril transition. The ability to separate different species and semi-quantitatively analyze them will allow the detailed characterization of the α-synuclein aggregation process in cells. We thank P.

https://openalex.org/W2022682828,"Ceruloplasmin is a multicopper oxidase essential for normal iron homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanisms of copper incorporation into this protein, holoceruloplasmin biosynthesis was examined by immunoblot analysis and 64Cu metabolic labeling of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant ceruloplasmin. This analysis reveals that the incorporation of copper into newly synthesized apoceruloplasmin in vivo results in a detectable conformational change in the protein. Strikingly, despite the unique functional role of each copper site within ceruloplasmin, metabolic studies indicate that achieving this final conformation-driven state requires the occupation of all six copper-binding sites with no apparent hierarchy for copper incorporation at any given site. Consistent with these findings a missense mutation (G631R), resulting in aceruloplasminemia and predicted to alter the interactions at a single type I copper-binding site, results in the synthesis and secretion only of apoceruloplasmin. Analysis of copper incorporation into apoceruloplasmin in vitro reveals that this process is cooperative and that the failure of copper incorporation into copper-binding site mutants observed in vivo is intrinsic to the mutant proteins. These findings reveal a precise and sensitive mechanism for the formation of holoceruloplasmin under the limiting conditions of copper availability within the cell that may be generally applicable to the biosynthesis of cuproproteins within the secretory pathway.

Copper is an essential trace element that plays a critical role in the biochemistry of all aerobic organisms (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3126Google Scholar). This metal permits the facile transfer of electrons by specific cuproenzymes in critical metabolic pathways. The chemical reactivity of copper also accounts for the toxicity of this metal when cellular homeostasis is impaired, and therefore specific mechanisms have evolved that regulate copper trafficking and compartmentalization within the cell. Under physiological circumstances intracellular copper availability is extraordinarily restricted, and as a result the delivery of copper to specific pathways and target proteins is determined by metallochaperones that protect this metal from intracellular scavenging (2Rae T.D.

Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural analysis of these copper chaperones indicates that copper transfer to specific targets within the cytoplasm is mediated by an intricate series of events involving direct protein-protein interaction (4Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 733-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The majority of known cuproenzymes are synthesized within the secretory pathway, and copper gains access to this compartment via the trans-Golgi resident copper transporting ATPases present in all cells (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3126Google Scholar). Despite the essential role of these cuproenzymes, there is currently little or no understanding of the mechanisms of copper incorporation into these proteins within the secretory pathway. Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing plasma ferroxidase that plays an essential role in mammalian iron homeostasis (5Hellman N.E. Gitlin J.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). This protein is a member of the multicopper oxidase family of enzymes, utilizing the electron chemistry of bound copper ions to couple iron oxidation with the four-electron reduction of dioxygen. Inherited loss of function of ceruloplasmin in humans results in a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by excessive iron accumulation within the basal ganglia (6Yoshida K. Furihata K.

Ceruloplasmin is synthesized in hepatocytes and secreted into the plasma following the incorporation of six atoms of copper in the secretory pathway (8Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1995; 1270: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Copper does not affect the rate of ceruloplasmin synthesis or secretion; however, failure to incorporate this metal during synthesis results in secretion of an unstable apoprotein that is devoid of oxidase activity and rapidly degraded in the plasma (10Holtzman N.A. Gaumnitz B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gitlin J.D. Schroeder J.J. Lee-Ambrose L.M. Cousins R.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In Wilson disease the absence or impaired function of a copper-transporting ATPase disrupts copper movement into the secretory pathway, resulting in the decreased serum ceruloplasmin observed in affected patients (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3126Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin is characterized by the presence of three types of spectroscopically distinct copper sites. Three type I copper sites result in strong absorption at 600 nm, conferring an intense blue color to this protein. A single type II copper is coordinated by four imidazole nitrogens and is in close proximity to two antiferromagnetically coupled type III copper ions that absorb at 330 nm. The type II and type III coppers have been shown to form a trinuclear copper cluster that is the site of oxygen binding during the catalytic cycle (12Calabrese L. Carbonaro M. Musci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6183-6187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resolution of the structure of human ceruloplasmin by x-ray crystallography has confirmed the presence of this trinuclear cluster as well as the identity of each of the amino acid copper ligands (13Zaitseva I.

In the current study this molecular information taken together with a well defined expression system that reflects the physiological mechanisms of ceruloplasmin synthesis and secretion provided the opportunity to directly examine the mechanisms of copper incorporation into this protein within the secretory pathway.

CHO cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 48 h later the cells were incubated for 20 min with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and then chased for the indicated times in serum-free media. This was followed by collection of lysate and media for immunoprecipitation and 7.5% SDS-PAGE (14Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

For copper labeling, CHO cells were incubated for the indicated times with 300 μCi/ml 64Cu and chased with serum-free media containing 100-fold excess copper. Media were collected, concentrated using Centricon-30 filters (Millipore), and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gels under non-reducing conditions as described previously (8Sato M.

Following quantitative analysis of 64Cu by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, cross-linked by ultraviolet radiation, and denatured in 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 2% SDS. Immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-ceruloplasmin antisera as previously described (14Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

In some experiments cells were pretreated for 48 h with 50 μm of the copper chelator tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), followed by extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline prior to the addition of 64Cu. Treatment of cells with this concentration of TEPA reduces the intracellular copper content by 50% without any effect on cell viability (15Narayanan V.S. Fitch C.A. Levenson C.W. J.

Molecular modeling of the G637R mutation was accomplished using the software program InSight (Accelrys) and the published x-ray crystallographic structure of human ceruloplasmin (13Zaitseva I.

This was followed by automated nucleotide sequencing of each of the exons of the ceruloplasmin gene as described (7Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R.T. Gitlin J.D. Proc.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing the entire human ceruloplasmin open reading frame, using Klentaq polymerase (Clontech), 5′ sense and 3′antisense oligonucleotides, and primer pairs corresponding to the mutations noted in Table I (14Hellman N.E.

Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by detection of protein with Coomassie Blue dye. For limited trypsin proteolysis, media were harvested from CHO cells following transfection with a cDNA encoding wild-type human ceruloplasmin and concentrated on a Centricon-30 column. 5-μl aliquots of concentrated media were then incubated in 25 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol containing 2.5–50 ng/μl bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min at 20 °C (17Asante-Appiah E.

This was followed by SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, and detection of ceruloplasmin by immunoblotting. 48 h following transfection CHO cells were pulsed for 1.5 h in 300 μCi/ml 64Cu followed by a 2-h chase period in Ham's F12 media. Media were then concentrated on Centricon-30 columns, chromatographed on Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences), and equilibrated in 50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. 500-μl fractions were collected and analyzed directly for radioactivity in a 3-inch NaI crystal Packard γ counter. Window settings were established empirically, and counting efficiency was determined using aliquots of isotope and correcting for half-life (64Cu t 12=12.8 h). All samples were measured in triplicate. For detection of ceruloplasmin in column fractions, 30 μl of each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting. Media were isolated from CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant ceruloplasmin, concentrated with Centricon-30 columns, and dialyzed twice against 20× volume of universal buffer containing 14.3 mm boric acid, 14.3 mm KPO4, 14.3 mm citric acid, 14.3 mm barbital, and 1 mm sodium ascorbate, pH 7.4 (18Davis-Kaplan S.R.

Samples were then concentrated using Microcon-30 filters, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted for ceruloplasmin. For quantitative copper incorporation studies the amount of copper present in media samples was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Autoradiographs were quantitated using UnScanIt imaging software (Silk Scientific), and data were fitted to the curve using Sigma Plot (SPSS). For experiments with Fet3, wild-type or mutant proteins containing a FLAG epitope were isolated and purified as described previously (19Blackburn N.J. Ralle M. Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Biochemsitry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). 5 μg of these purified proteins were resuspended in either phosphate-buffered saline or 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, and 1 mm sodium ascorbate. This was followed by the addition of 500 μCi/ml64Cu. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C followed by concentration with Centricon-30 filters, SDS-PAGE, and analysis for copper incorporation as indicated above and described previously for Fet3 (20Klomp L.W.

As can be seen in Fig.1 A, immunoblot analysis of ceruloplasmin in the media of HepG2 cells following SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions demonstrates the presence of two bands of 135 and 85 kDa. We have previously shown that these two bands represent apo and holoceruloplasmin that have distinct electrophoretic mobility under these conditions and that the 85-kDa species represents oxidase-active holoceruloplasmin containing all six coppers (8Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this concept, the 85-kDa holoceruloplasmin band is undetectable following prior treatment of cells with the copper chelator TEPA but increases in intensity if these same cells are previously grown in media containing excess CuCl2 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2 and 4). Similar analysis of the media of HepG2 cells following metabolic labeling with 64Cu also detects the 85-kDa holoceruloplasmin band by direct autoradiography (Fig. 1 A, lane 5) as demonstrated previously (8Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the media of CHO cells transfected with a cDNA-encoding human ceruloplasmin reveals findings identical to those observed for HepG2 cells, indicating the validity of this approach for dissecting the mechanisms of copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin (Fig.1 A, lanes 6–8). The electrophoretic analysis suggested the possibility of unique conformational differences between the apo and holo forms of ceruloplasmin. This concept was examined further by subjecting purified human ceruloplasmin to denaturation in increasing concentrations of urea followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and detection with Coomassie Blue staining. As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, this treatment results in the conversion of the 85-kDa holoceruloplasmin to the 135-kDa apoprotein with no intermediate forms detectable. To detect these conformational differences in vivo, media from transfected CHO cells were subjected to limited trypsin proteolysis followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblot detection of ceruloplasmin. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, this treatment results in distinct cleavage patterns for apo- and holoceruloplasmin. Furthermore, apoceruloplasmin was more sensitive to trypsin digestion, with complete cleavage taking place at 10 ng/μl (Fig. 1 C). Taken together with the findings from the urea denaturation these data support the concept of conformational differences between apo- and holoceruloplasmin. To further examine the conformational changes that result following copper incorporation into apoceruloplasmin, missense mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis at each of the six integral copper-binding sites in ceruloplasmin. To abrogate copper incorporation at each of these sites, histidine to glutamine substitutions were made at each type I copper-binding site (H276Q, H637Q, and H1026Q), the type II copper-binding site (H101Q), and each type III copper-binding site (H103Q and H163Q) (Table I). To ensure that the results were not caused by the replacement of histidine residues, a type I copper-binding site mutant in which cysteine was converted to serine (C680S) was also generated. Pulse-chase analysis following transfection of each mutant into CHO cells demonstrated kinetics of synthesis and secretion identical to that of wild-type ceruloplasmin, indicating that none of these copper-binding site mutations result in grossly impaired protein folding or trafficking (Fig. 2). Despite this finding, metabolic labeling with 64Cu revealed the striking observation that each mutation results in a complete abrogation of copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin (Fig. 3 A). The inability of these copper-binding site mutants to form holoceruloplasmin was verified by immunoblot analysis of the media, which revealed the presence of apoceruloplasmin only (Fig.3 B). In contrast to findings with wild-type ceruloplasmin (Fig. 1 A), incubation of cells transfected with mutant ceruloplasmin in media containing excess CuCl2 did not result in any detectable holoceruloplasmin (data not shown). These findings were not the result of the electrophoretic methodology used to detect apo- and holoceruloplasmin, because size exclusion chromatography of the media of transfected cells following64Cu labeling also revealed copper incorporation only in the wild-type protein (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, under these conditions apo- and holoceruloplasmin separate in identical fractions, supporting the concept that the size differences observed in SDS-PAGE reflect conformational differences accentuated with this technique (Fig. 4 B). Failure to detect 64Cu holoceruloplasmin with this method was not caused by a loss of the transfected proteins because immunoblot analysis of chromatographic fractions revealed abundant apoceruloplasmin in the media from cells transfected with the copper-binding site mutants (Fig.4 B).Figure 3Copper incorporation into copper-binding site mutants. A, HepG2 cells or CHO cells transfected with either wild-type (wt) ceruloplasmin or the indicated copper-binding site mutants were incubated in serum-free media containing 200 μCi/ml 64Cu for 1 h followed by chase in media containing 100-fold excess copper for 2 h.

To directly examine the physiological relevance of these findings, a similar analysis was undertaken using a missense mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene from a patient with aceruloplasminemia. The proband in this family had undetectable levels of circulating serum ceruloplasmin and was found to be homozygous for the mutation G631R (data not shown). As observed previously for the copper-binding site mutants, pulse-chase analysis of the G631R mutation revealed that this protein is synthesized and secreted with kinetics identical to that of wild-type ceruloplasmin (Fig. 5 A). Nevertheless, both64Cu metabolic labeling and immunoblot analysis reveal that the G631R mutant is synthesized and secreted only as the apoprotein (Fig. 5, B and C). As noted with the copper-binding mutants, size exclusion chromatography of media following 64Cu metabolic labeling also failed to reveal any copper incorporation into the G631R mutant ceruloplasmin (data not shown). Molecular modeling of the targeted Gly-631 residue reveals that it is in close proximity to and interacts with His-637, one of the critical ligands of a type I copper-binding site (Fig.6). This finding suggests the possibility that the substituted arginine in the G631R mutation may interfere with copper binding at this type I site either through disruption of hydrogen bonding or through more distant conformational effects. As predicted from data in Fig. 3, such an effect would then prevent copper incorporation at all other sites. The predicted outcome of this mutation, consistent with the clinical findings, is the secretion of an apoceruloplasmin that is devoid of ferroxidase activity and rapidly degraded in the plasma.Figure 6Structural model illustrating Gly-631.Structural model of ceruloplasmin showing Gly-631 and the adjacent copper-binding His-637. The α-carbon on Gly-631 is separated from the ε-carbon on His-637 by a distance of 7.10 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although the pulse-chase experiments suggest no difference in the rate of synthesis or secretion between the wild-type and mutant forms of ceruloplasmin, it remains possible that the mutant proteins are trafficked abnormally in the late secretory pathway, preventing targeting to the compartment where copper is incorporated. To directly examine if the mutant proteins are capable of incorporating copper, media from transfected CHO cells were subjected to in vitrocopper exchange with increasing concentrations of CuCl2. This treatment resulted in an increase in holoceruloplasmin in media from cells transfected with wild-type ceruloplasmin, whereas neither the G631R mutation nor the copper-binding site mutants were capable of incorporating copper under these same conditions (Fig.7 A). These in vitrofindings suggest that the conformation of apoceruloplasmin is the critical determinant for copper incorporation and that each copper-binding site plays a key role in this process. The copper concentrations indicated in Fig. 7 A reflect the amount added to the media. To precisely quantitate the copper-dependent conversion to holoceruloplasmin under these conditions, experiments were performed in media where the total amount of copper was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. This quantitative analysis of copper incorporation into apoceruloplasmin in vitro revealed a sigmoidal curve diagnostic of cooperative binding (Fig.7 B). This same cooperative binding curve was observed when these experiments were repeated with purified apoceruloplasmin, suggesting that this finding is not the result of competition with copper-binding factors in the media (data not shown). Spectroscopic studies of the homologous multicopper ferroxidase Fet3 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that mutations at one copper-binding site do not abrogate copper incorporation into the other copper-binding sites of this protein (19Blackburn N.J. Ralle M. Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Biochemsitry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To directly compare these results to our findings with ceruloplasmin, a similar in vitro analysis was performed using wild-type Fet3 or Fet3 containing a missense mutation at the type I (C484S) or type II (H81Q) copper-binding sites. These experiments reveal copper incorporation into all three Fet3 proteins, confirming the previous spectroscopic findings (Fig. 8 A). Identical findings were observed when these proteins were copper-labeled utilizing the same tissue culture media that were employed for the ceruloplasmin studies (data not shown). The ability to detect partially labeled Fet3 (type I or type II mutants) also suggests that the failure to detect copper-labeled ceruloplasmin under these same conditions is not the result of a loss of copper during the electrophoresis. As observed previously in yeast, analysis of copper incorporation into Fet3 under these conditions results in a detectable signal between 75 and 100 kDa caused by the glycosylation of this protein (20Klomp L.W.

Detection of copper incorporation into mutant Fet3 indicates that our inability to observe copper incorporation into mutant ceruloplasmin (Figs.3 A and 5 B) is not the result of the methodological approach utilized and likely reflects unique differences between these two proteins. In support of this concept, whereas recent studies reveal that chloride is a critical allosteric effector for copper loading into Fet3 (18Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin was found to be equivalent using either CuCl2, Cu(CH3COO)2, or CuSO4 as the copper source (Fig. 8 B). These data together with previous biochemical studies (8Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicate that ceruloplasmin is an allosteric protein that enters the late secretory pathway in a copper-competent conformation where copper serves as a homotropic modulator facilitating the transition to a functional holoprotein. This concept is supported by physical and spectroscopic studies of ceruloplasmin indicating that copper removal results in an apoprotein with altered sedimentation velocity and electrophoretic mobility but retained secondary structure, albeit with weaker tertiary interactions than were observed in the holoprotein (21Carrico R.J. Deutsch H.F. Beinert H. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22De Filippis V. Vassiliev V.B. Beltramini M. Fontana A. Salvato B. Gaitkhoki V.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We propose that this folding intermediate may be similar to that described for proteins such as apomyoglobin and staphylococcal nuclease A where secondary structure is preserved but flexibility permits the interval motions required for cofactor insertion (23Sugawara T. Kuwajima K. Sugai S. Biochemsitry. 1991; 30: 2698-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Jennings P.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1993; 262: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In the case of ceruloplasmin, this copper-competent state would allow for folding and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and serve to protect the protein from unfolding in the acidic milieu of the late secretory pathway while still permitting the critical small scale fluctuations required to accommodate copper incorporation. Biochemical analysis of the G631R patient mutation underscores the essential nature of this copper-competent state in the formation of an active, functional ferroxidase (Fig. 5). In transfected cells this mutation did not affect the critical stages of protein folding required for exit of ceruloplasmin from the endoplasmic reticulum or secretion from the cell. However, this mutation clearly altered the intrinsic protein structure in such a way as to abrogate copper incorporation as revealed by in vitro copper incorporation studies (Fig. 7). Although greater than 90% of serum ceruloplasmin is in the form of the holoprotein, the marked differences in the serum half-lives of apo- and holoceruloplasmin predicts an equivalent rate of hepatic synthesis under steady state conditions (10Holtzman N.A. Gaumnitz B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is precisely what is observed in CHO cells transfected with wild-type ceruloplasmin (Fig. 1 A), confirming the validity of this approach for analysis of the G631R mutation. One of the most critical features of the data in this current study is the observation that copper incorporation into ceruloplasmin requires competency of all six ligand-binding sites with no apparent hierarchy for incorporation at any one site. Obviously, at some point during this process intermediates must form, and it remains possible that these represent copper binding to low affinity sites such that only the final step of copper incorporation into a high affinity site is required to bring the protein into the trypsin-resistant, stable holo conformation. Under such circumstances the binding at these low affinity sites may still occur in an ordered or hierarchical fashion. While we are currently evaluating the possibility of such a model with fluorescence spectroscopic studies of copper binding to recombinant purified apoprotein, the existence of such low affinity intermediates seems unlikely given the inability to detect these forms even when excess copper is added to the cell cultures and electrophoresis conditions (data not shown) or in the in vitro copper loading experiments (Fig. 7). In contrast to our findings with ceruloplasmin, partial copper intermediates have been observed for the multicopper oxidases Fet3 and bilirubin oxidase (19Blackburn N.J. Ralle M. Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Biochemsitry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Shimizu A. Kwon J.-H. Sasaki T. Satoh T. Sakuarai N. Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Samejima T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3034-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the case of Fet3 these partial copper intermediates were readily detected with the methods used in this current study (Fig. 8). Ceruloplasmin is unique among these three multicopper oxidases in containing three type I copper centers, and it is possible that this may result in structural or biochemical differences that account for the all-or-none process of copper incorporation. Consistent with this possibility it has been proposed that the type I copper in domain II of ceruloplasmin may serve in a structural role and not be involved in electron transfer as the high reduction potential at this site prevents oxidation at physiologic pH (27Machonkin T.E. Zhang H.H. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As the data in this current study clearly indicate an essential role for this type I copper site in holoprotein formation (Fig. 3,H276Q), it does raise the intriguing possibility that this copper, as Cu+, may serve a structural role in protein folding. Regardless of such a possibility, further work will be needed to elucidate the structural mechanisms of the copper incorporation process observed in this current study. Although the precise role of copper in protein folding is not well understood, further study of these mechanisms in ceruloplasmin may have a more broad relevance given recent observations that copper binding to the cellular prion protein induces thermodynamic changes favoring pathologic β-sheet formation (28Stocker J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Ceruloplasmin is a single subunit protein with multiple binding sites for copper (Table I). This suggested to us the hypothesis that the allosteric effects of copper binding observed in Fig. 1 might result in an increase in the affinity for subsequent copper binding. This concept is supported by the binding studies in Fig. 7 B that clearly illustrate the cooperative nature of this process. The allosteric effects giving rise to such cooperativity are presumably mediated by conformational changes transmitted within the protein upon copper binding. As cooperativity permits a more sensitive response to ligand concentrations, taken together these data reveal a precise and sensitive mechanism to permit the rapid synthesis of holoceruloplasmin under the normal physiological circumstances of restricted copper availability in the cell. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the considerable evidence indicating that copper is incorporated into ceruloplasmin at or beyond the trans-Golgi network (5Hellman N.E. Gitlin J.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 439-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances the partially folded copper-competent apoceruloplasmin would then be sequestered with copper in an acidic vesicular environment where the cooperative mechanisms of protein folding permits holoceruloplasmin synthesis. Although such a model is distinct from that utilized to ensure copper delivery in the cytoplasm, it seems plausible given the enormous diversity of cell-specific expression as well as structure and function of the cuproenzymes synthesized in the secretory pathway (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3126Google Scholar). While further studies will be needed to directly test this hypothesis, support is found in recent experiments examining copper incorporation into tyrosinase. Those experiments demonstrate specific mutations that abrogate copper incorporation but do not affect trafficking of the apoprotein to the melanosome (25Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N.

We previously identified p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA ATPase with two conserved ATPase domains (D1 and D2), as an interacting partner of the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) protein with expanded polyglutamines that causes Machado-Joseph disease. To reveal its pathophysiological roles in neuronal cells, we focused on its ATPase activity. We constructed and characterized PC12 cells expressing wild-type p97/VCP and p97(K524A), a D2 domain mutant. The expression level, localization, and complex formation of both proteins were indistinguishable, but the ATPase activity of p97(K524A) was much lower than that of the wild type. p97(K524A) induced cytoplasmic vacuoles that stained with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker, and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the nuclear and membrane but not cytoplasmic fractions was observed, together with the elevation of ER stress markers. These results show that p97/VCP is essential for degrading membrane-associated ubiquitinated proteins and that profound deficits in its ATPase activity severely affect ER quality control, leading to abnormal ER expansion and cell death.

Various neurodegenerative disorders, including polyglutamine diseases, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have distinct clinical symptoms, but they share several intracellular features such as accumulation of abnormal proteins or intracellular deposits of ubiquitinated proteins, formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and neural cell death (1Kakizuka A. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 396-402Google Scholar). These observations suggest a potential link between neuronal degeneration and dysfunction of the protein degradation pathway via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (2Waelter S. Boeddrich A. Lurz R.

Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y. Popiel A.H. Sinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Kimura Y. Sobue G. Uchiyama Y. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 977-984Google Scholar). By immunohistochemical analyses, p97/VCP was found to co-localize with poly-Q inclusions in cell culture and transgenic rat models overexpressing expanded poly-Qs of MJD protein origin (10Hirabayashi M.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 977-984Google Scholar). p97/VCP immunostaining was also observed throughout aggresomes induced by proteasome inhibitor treatments in cultured neuronal cells, where many large vacuoles were concomitantly observed (10Hirabayashi M. Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y. Popiel A.H. Sinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Kimura Y. Sobue G. Uchiyama Y. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 977-984Google Scholar). Using our Drosophila poly-Q disease model (11Higashiyama H. Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Inoue Y.H. Fujikake N. Matsukage A. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 264-273Google Scholar), we performed a genetic screen to search for enhancers and suppressors of the eye degeneration phenotypes caused by the poly-Q expression and identified ter94, the Drosophila p97/VCP, as a modulator of poly-Q-induced eye degenerations (11Higashiyama H. Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Inoue Y.H. Fujikake N. Matsukage A. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 264-273Google Scholar). These observations collectively indicate that p97/VCP is a key molecule in the pathway of neuronal cell death induced by expanded poly-Q and probably other misfolded proteins as well. p97/VCP is one of the most abundant intracellular proteins, and it has been shown to be involved in postmitotic processes of membrane fusions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and nuclear envelopes (12Latterich M. Fröhlich K.-U. Schekman R. Cell. 1995; 82: 885-893Google Scholar, 13Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar, 14Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R.

Bio. 2001; 3: 1086-1091Google Scholar). In these processes, p97/VCP differentially utilizes its partners such as p47 and the Ufd1/Npl4 complex. Recently, p97/VCP has also been shown to bind directly to polyubiquitinated proteins in vitro (16Dai R.M. Li C.-C.H. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 740-744Google Scholar) and to be involved in the ER-associated protein degradation system (ERAD) via interaction with Ufd1 and Npl4 in yeast and permeabilized astrocytoma cells (17Meyer H.H.

In this study, we demonstrate that the D2 ATPase domain represents the major ATPase activity in p97/VCP and is essential for p97/VCP function, especially to maintain ER integrity in mammalian neuronal cells. These phenotypes imply that p97/VCP plays a bifunctional role: p97/VCP can contribute to the cellular defense system via regulation of the ER quality control in physiological conditions, but in certain situations in which its ATPase activity is profoundly inhibited, p97/VCP is predicted to cause cell death via failure in ER quality control, which may occur by the excessive accumulation of misfolded proteins. PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum. TV and TmV cells were established following a standard procedure as described previously (21Yasuda S. Inoue K. Hirabayashi M. Higashiyama H. Yamamoto Y. Fuyuhiro H. Komure O. Tanaka F. Sobue G. Tsuchiya K. Hamada K. Sasaki H. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Kakizuka A.

HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE PLUS or LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-p97/VCP antibody was described previously (10Hirabayashi M. Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y. Popiel A.H. Sinohara A. Iwamatsu A.

Mouse p97/VCP cDNA was subcloned into pCMX vector (9Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Google Scholar, 21Yasuda S. Inoue K. Hirabayashi M.

Mouse p97/VCP and p97(K524A) cDNAs were subcloned into the pEYFP vector (Clontech). cDNAs encoding His-YFP-p97s were subcloned into a baculovirus expression vector. Recombinant His-YFP-p97s were expressed in insect sf-9 cells after transfection with CELLFECTIN Reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (400 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 20 mm benzamidine, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Nakarai Tesque)), and the lysates were loaded onto nickel-chelated HiTrap chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), and 50 mm imidazole. The recombinant proteins were eluted with a 50–500 mm imidazole gradient, concentrated by Centriprep (Millipore), and kept in storage buffer (150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol) after passing through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The entire coding regions of p47, Ufd1, and Npl4 cDNAs were amplified from a human brain lysate via reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into pBluescriptII KS (+) (Stratagene), and their sequences were confirmed. These cDNAs and MJDQ79 cDNA (21Yasuda S. Inoue K. Hirabayashi M. Higashiyama H. Yamamoto Y. Fuyuhiro H. Komure O. Tanaka F. Sobue G. Tsuchiya K. Hamada K. Sasaki H. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Kakizuka A.

Recombinant GST-fused proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 25 mm glutathione, and the buffers were exchanged into PBS with dialyses. HeLa, TV, and TmV cells were harvested at the indicated time periods, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (completeTM). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatants were loaded on a glycerol gradient (10–40%) and centrifuged in a SW41 (Beckman) rotor for 12 h at 36,000 rpm. For pull-down experiments, cell lysates (100 μg) were mixed with 2 μg of GST-fusion proteins and rotated overnight, and then glutathione beads were added with rotation for another 4 h. Beads were washed with Triton buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (24Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Blocking and primary antibody incubations were performed in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% low fat milk. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated in the same buffer without low fat milk. Proteins were visualized and quantified using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and a luminescence image analyzer (LAS-1000 PLUS, Fuji Film) (24Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M.

Cell pellets were suspended in homogenizing buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a protease inhibitor mixture, passed through 22-gauge needle, and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton) for 12 strokes. Nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions were separated by sequential centrifugation at 700 × g for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. For immunoprecipitation, samples were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. Insoluble portions were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with an anti-GFP antibody and rotated at 4 °C overnight after addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with Triton buffer. Proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (24Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl.

HEK293 cells were transfected with a GFP-CFTR(ΔF508)-expression vector, harvested, washed with PBS, fixed by 70% EtOH on ice for 20 min, and washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and GFP intensities and cell numbers were measured by FACS scanning (BD Biosciences). The ATPase activities of p97/VCP were assayed by an enzyme coupling method, as described (27Tokuda H. Yamanaka M. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Briefly, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the linear phase of the decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm of NADH at 37 °C in an assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 3 mm phospho-enolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, and 2 mm ATP) supplemented with enzymes (1.5 units of pyruvate kinase and 1.0 unit of lactate dehydrogenase). To elucidate the pathophysiological roles of p97/VCP, we constructed stable neuronal PC12 cells expressing wild-type and mutant p97/VCP with C-terminal-tagged GFP under the control of the tet-off promoter and compared the phenotypes of these cells after tetracycline removal. PC12 cells are a well characterized cell line with the ability to differentiate into postmitotic neuron-like cells by the simple addition of nerve growth factor. Before this experiment, we made several mutants in which the conserved lysines (251 and 524) or glutamates (305 and 578) were substituted with alanine or glutamine residues, respectively, resulting in the following mutants: p97(K251A), p97(K524A), p97(E305Q), and p97(E578Q). These amino acids are essential residues in the Walker A or B motif of the ATP binding domain. We selected the p97(K524A) mutant for this study because it induced cytoplasmic vacuoles and cell death most effectively in differentiated PC12 cells, when expressed transiently; the p97(E578Q) mutant had a similar but weaker phenotype than p97(K524A), and the others had much more subtle phenotypes. Among the several sublines, we selected cells with the highest expression levels of wild-type p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP after tetracycline removal, and these cells were named TV and TmV cells, respectively (Fig. 1). We next compared the protein levels between p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP in TV and TmV cells, respectively. The expression levels of both proteins appeared equivalent and were comparable with the endogenous p97/VCP protein 24 and 48 h after the removal of tetracycline from the medium (Fig. 1, A (right panels) and B). Localization of both proteins was observed throughout the cells (Fig. 1 A, left panels), a pattern indistinguishable from that of endogenous p97/VCP. Consistent with this, the subcellular fractionation analysis also showed that both p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP expression were comparable with and behave indistinguishably from the endogenous p97/VCP protein (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of tetracycline, both cells grew well and responded equally to nerve growth factor with formation of neurite-like structures (data not shown). However, we found clear differences in the morphology between TV and TmV cells after removal of tetracycline from the medium. TV cells maintained a healthy appearance and were indistinguishable from the parental PC12 cells with numerous neurite outgrowth, whereas TmV cells appeared sick and lost the ability to extend neuritis and formed many cytoplasmic vacuoles instead (Fig. 1 A, middle panels, and see below), followed by cell death. This cell death was not inhibited by a calpain inhibitor or several caspase inhibitors,e.g. Z-VAD-FMK (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone) and Ac-DEVD-CHO (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde) (data not shown). Homo-oligomeric ring structure is the most characteristic feature of AAA ATPase, which has been shown to be required for representing the maximum ATPase activity. To examine whether p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP can form their hexameric structure in PC12 cells, lysates of TV and TmV cells were first fractionated by the density gradient method, and then each fraction was analyzed by Western blot using an anti-p97/VCP antibody (Fig.2 A, middle andlower panels). The majority of both proteins co-migrated with the endogenous p97/VCP proteins (fractions 11–20). In addition, the levels of p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP peaked in the same fraction, fraction 12, which was one fraction heavier than that of endogenous p97/VCP from control HeLa cell lysate, a difference due to the additional GFP portions. Furthermore, an anti-GFP antibody co-precipitated almost equal amounts of endogenous p97/VCP with p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP from TV and TmV cells, respectively (see Fig.6 C). These results clearly indicated that both p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP are incorporated into the hexameric complex together with the endogenous p97/VCP and probably occupy approximately half, namely three subunits of the complex on the average in both TV and TmV cells.Figure 6Accumulation of polyubiquitinated (poly-Ub) proteins in nuclear and membrane but not cytosolic fractions in cells expressing p97(K524A). A, TV and TmV cells were harvested at the indicated time points before and after removal of tetracycline, and subcellular fractionation was performed by the method shown under “Experimental Procedures.” Ten μg of proteins from each fraction was loaded on each lane and then analyzed by Western blot using an anti-ubiquitin (anti-Ub) or an anti-p97 antibody. As shown in B, amounts of polyubiquitinated proteins were quantified with a luminescence image analyzer, and the ratios of polyubiquitinated protein levels were calculated where those before removal of tetracycline (day 0) were chosen as the reference values in the total and fractionated lysates. Values obtained from TV and TmV cells are shown in gray columns and hatched columns, respectively.C, Immunoprecipitants (IP) using an anti-GFP antibody from cytosolic (C) or membrane (M) fractions were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-ubiquitin or an anti-p97 antibody. HC and LC indicate positions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains of the anti-GFP antibody, respectively. In control experiments, an anti-FLAG antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and was not able to precipitate ubiquitinated-proteins (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also expressed His-YFP-tagged p97/VCP and p97(K524A) proteins in the baculovirus system and then affinity-purified these proteins using a nickel column (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2). Small amounts of endogenous p97/VCP were co-purified with both recombinant proteins (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 2, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and lanes 3 and 4, immunoblot). The recombinant p97/VCP complex showed more than 23-fold stronger ATPase activity when compared with the recombinant p97(K524A) complex (Fig.3 B). These results clearly show that alanine substitution of lysine 524 abolished most of the ATPase activity of p97/VCP and thus indicate that the second ATPase domain represents the major ATPase activity in p97/VCP. Regardless of the change in the ATPase activity, the GST pull-down experiments showed that the p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP hexameric complexes co-precipitated with GST-fused p47, Ufd1, Npl4, and MJD (Fig.2 B). Both p97-GFP and p97(K524A)-GFP complexes were also immunoprecipitated with endogenous p47, Ufd1, and Npl4 using anti-p47, anti-Ufd1, and anti-Npl4 antibodies, respectively (data not shown). These results indicate that p97/VCP ATPase activity is dispensable for its interaction with known partners, e.g. p47, Ufd1, Npl4, and MJD. As mentioned above, 24 h after expression of p97(K524A), many large vacuole-like membrane compartments appeared in the cytoplasmic spaces of TmV cells followed by cell death. To investigate the origin of these strange organelles, we examined which organelle markers,e.g. mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, endosome, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers, could stain them. Among those tested, only CFP-ER, an ER-residing marker protein that has the ER localization signal of calreticulin and the KDEL motif, gave clear co-localization with the vacuoles (Fig.4, A–C). This result was consistent with our previous electron microscopy results that revealed ribosome-like structures scattered on the p97(K524A)-induced vacuole membranes (10Hirabayashi M. Inoue K. Tanaka K. Nakadate K. Ohsawa Y. Kamei Y. Popiel A.H. Sinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Kimura Y. Sobue G. Uchiyama Y. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 977-984Google Scholar). Treatment with PSI, a proteasome inhibitor, also induced similar CFP-ER-positive vacuoles and cell death even in parental PC12 cells (Fig. 4, C andD). Given that these vacuoles were of ER origin, it would be reasonable to speculate that ER stress might be induced in TmV cells. We thus examined the expression of GRP78 mRNA, an ER stress marker. Significant up-regulation of GRP78 mRNA was observed in TmV but not in TV cells 24 h after removal of tetracycline (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and6). Similar levels of GRP78 mRNA were also induced after tunicamycin treatment, a known ER stress inducer that functions through inhibiting protein N-glycosylation (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2). CHOP protein (28Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Google Scholar), another ER stress marker, was also clearly induced in TmV but not in TV cells 1–2 days after removal of tetracycline (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the loss or severe decrease of p97/VCP ATPase activity results in ER stress and abnormal ER expansion. As mentioned above, cytoplasmic vacuoles of ER origin were also induced by the addition of proteasome inhibitors in the culture medium of PC12 cells (Fig. 4, right panel). It has been shown that approximately one-third of newly synthesized proteins in the cells are not appropriately folded, and these misfolded proteins were degraded mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We thus next examined a potential link between protein degradation and the p97/VCP ATPase activity and found that expression of p97(K524A)-GFP enhanced the accumulation of ubiquitinated and likely misfolded proteins in TmV cells (Fig. 6,A (lanes 4–6, 10–12, and 16–18) andB). However, the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is prominent in the nuclear (lanes 11 and 12) and membrane fractions (lanes 17 and 18) but not in the cytoplasmic fraction (lanes 23 and 24), indicating that loss or decrease of the p97/VCP ATPase activity did not inhibit cytoplasmic protein degradation where proteasomes are functional. Then, how is p97/VCP involved in the protein degradation in places other than the cytoplasm? We performed immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-GFP antibody (Fig.6 C). Membrane and cytosolic fractions of TV and TmV cells were resolved by 1% TritonX-100 and clarified by centrifugations. The resultant soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 6 C) or a non-related anti-FLAG antibody as a control (data not shown), and precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by an anti-ubiquitin antibody via Western blot analysis. The results showed that p97(K524A)-GFP co-precipitated more polyubiquitinated proteins from the membrane but not the cytoplasmic fractions than p97-GFP. The precipitates from the membrane fraction contained endogenous Ufd1, Npl4, and p47 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the ER quality control system senses misfolded proteins and refolds them with chaperones or degrades them by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD), in which misfolded proteins are translocated into the cytoplasm through the Sec61 translocon and then degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm. Consistent with recent reports (18Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Google Scholar, 29Bays N.W. Wilhovsky S.K. Goradia A. Hodgkiss-Harlow K. Hampton R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4114-4128Google Scholar, 30Rabinovich E. Kerem A. Fröhlich K.-U. Diamant N. Bar-Nun S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 626-634Google Scholar), these results support the idea that p97/VCP functions in the ERAD system, especially in pulling out misfolded membrane proteins into the cytoplasm. We next examined whether the degradation of misfolded membrane proteins was inhibited in cells expressing p97(K524A) by using CFTR(ΔF508) as a model substrate, which is a well known substrate of ERAD (23Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Google Scholar). By microscopy and FACS analyses, we could observe more GFP-CFTR(ΔF508) aggregates in cells expressing p97(K524A) than in cells expressing wild-type p97/VCP or p97(K251A) (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, it was evident that more GFP-CFTR(ΔF508) as ubiquitinated high molecular weight forms"

The requirement of these cysteine residues was investigated by the effect of mutations and deletions. Mutants with substitutions of the N-terminal cysteines or deletion of the first Cys-(X)2-Cys motif formed acylphosphate intermediates. From the copper dependence of phosphoenzyme formation, the mutants appear to have 2–3 fold higher affinity for Cu(I) than wild type CopA. In contrast, substitutions in Cys479 or Cys481 resulted in loss of copper resistance, transport and phosphoenzyme formation.

From the copper dependence of phosphoenzyme formation, the mutants appear to have 2–3 fold higher affinity for Cu(I) than wild type CopA. In contrast, substitutions in Cys479 or Cys481 resulted in loss of copper resistance, transport and phosphoenzyme formation. These results imply that the cysteine residues of the Cys-Pro-Cys motif (but not the N-terminal cysteine residues) are required for CopA function. The 834-residue CopA copper pump from Escherichia coli(1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar) is a member of the superfamily of cation-transporting P-type ATPases (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Google Scholar). CopA belongs to a subfamily that transports the cations of soft Lewis acids (or, for simplicity, just soft metal cations) (3Gatti D. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34009-34012Google Scholar). Members of one branch of the subfamily transports monovalent cations such as Cu(I) and Ag(I) (4Camakaris J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 225-232Google Scholar, 5Gupta A. Matsui K. Lo J.F. Silver S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 183-188Google Scholar, 6Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Google Scholar). A second branch transports divalent cations such as Zn(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), and Co(II) (7Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Google Scholar, 8Rensing C. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14326-14331Google Scholar). Copper translocating P-type ATPases are found in virtually every organism, from E. coli to humans and include homologues that are related to the human Menkes (9Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genetics. 1993; 3: 7-13Google Scholar) and Wilson (10Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat. Genetics. 1993; 5: 327-337Google Scholar) diseases. In E. coli CopA participates in copper homeostasis and is required for copper efflux and resistance (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar). Distinctive features of the soft metal ion translocating P-type ATPases are one to six N-terminal Cys-(X)2-Cys sequences that bind soft metal cations in vitro (11Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Google Scholar, 12Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1890-1896Google Scholar), and a Cys-Pro-Cys motif in the sixth transmembrane segment (TM) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane segment; DTT, dithiothreitol; BCDS, bathocuproindisulfonate; DDM, dodecyl maltoside, MNK, Menkes disease-related protein; WND, Wilson disease-related protein that may be part of the translocation pathway. Thus far intracellular trafficking in eukaryotes is the only physiological role identified for the Cys-(X)2-Cys sequences (14Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Google Scholar, 15Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Google Scholar, 16Voskoboinik I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Google Scholar), but this is unlikely to apply to E. coli, which has no intracellular membranes. E. coli CopA contains two N-terminal Cys-(X)2-Cys sequences, Gly-Leu-Ser-Cys14-Gly-His-Cys17 and Gly-Met-Ser-Cys110-Ala-Ser-Cys113. We have previously shown that none of the four cysteine residues in the two sequences is required for either copper resistance or transport (18Fan B. Grass G. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 414-418Google Scholar). However, a deletion of codons 8–150 (ΔNCopA) lost both copper resistance and transport, suggesting that an N terminus is required even though the cysteines are not. All P-type ATPases have a conserved aspartate residue that is phosphorylated by ATP during the catalytic cycle. In CopA the corresponding residue is Asp523. In this report we investigated the ability of CopA to form a phosphorylated intermediate with [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P label on CopA was sensitive to treatment with alkali or hydroxylamine, consistent with acylphosphate formation. Phosphoenzyme formation required a monovalent soft metal cation, either Cu(I) or Ag(I). Divalent Cu(II) or Zn(II) could not substitute. This clearly demonstrates that this copper-translocating P-type ATPase distinguishes between Cu(I) and Cu(II). Paradoxically, mutations of the four cysteine residues in the two N-terminal Cys-(X)2-Cys sequences increased the apparent affinity for copper, as did deletion of the first Cys-(X)2-Cys sequence. Mutations in the two cysteine residues in the Cys-Pro-Cys motif in TM6 resulted in loss of copper resistance, transport, and phosphoenzyme formation, indicating that these cysteines play a more critical role in CopA function than the N-terminal cysteines. CopA was solubilized with dodecylmaltoside and purified by metal chelate chromatography. The activity of purified CopA was stimulated by copper or silver ions and inhibited by addition of a Cu(I) chelator. Cells of E. coli were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York.1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactosidase (80 μg/ml) and l(+)-arabinose (0.0002%) were added as required. To assay inhibition of growth by metal salts, cells were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani medium, diluted 1:100 in the same medium with CuSO4, and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with shaking. Growth was monitored from the absorbance at 600 nm. Each strain achieved approximately the same final density in the absence of copper. Standard molecular and genetic techniques were used for strain and plasmid construction (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning, a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York.1989Google Scholar). The construct of copA deletion strain DC194 and Cys-(X)2-Cys motif mutants were described previously (18Fan B. Grass G. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 414-418Google Scholar). To introduce mutations in the coding sequence for the cysteines in the Cys-Pro-Cys motif, a sequence corresponding to base pairs 892–1854 of the copA gene was cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using forward primer 5′-CTCGGCCATATGCTGGAAGCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTAATCGCCGCGGTTTCAATG-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuickChange method (Stratagene). The inserts were excised by double digestion with NdeI and SacII and ligated into plasmid pGEXCopA2 in which copA is inserted into the pGEX-6p-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). ThecopA gene was excised from that plasmid by digestion withNcoI and SacII and ligated into pCopA2 (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar). A copA gene with deletion of codons 7–54 (corresponding to amino acid residues 3–18 and including the first Cys-(X)2-Cys sequence) was generated by PCR amplification of copA of using forward primer 5′-GTTCCATGGCAAAACGCGTGAAAGAAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGGCCGCCGGCGAAAACCATCACTGC-3′, with subsequent cloning into plasmid pGEM-T Easy. The insertion was excised byNcoI/NaeI double digestion and ligation into pCopA2, generating the plasmid pCopA2ΔN1. Plasmid pCopA2ΔN2, which has a deletion ofcopA codons 7–342 bp (corresponding to amino acid residues 3–114 and includes both Cys-(X)2-Cys sequences) was generated by PCR using forward primer 5′- GTTCCAATGGCAACCCGCGTACAAAATGCG-3′ and the same reverse primer as with pCopA2ΔN1. The PCR product was excised byNcoI/NaeI double digestion and ligation into plasmid pCopA2 generating plasmid pCopA2ΔN2. All mutations were verified by sequencing the entire insert. In pCopA2 copA is in-frame with the sequence for the Myc epitope and six histidine codons, which are at the 3′-end ofcopA (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant pCopA2plasmid were introduced into strain DC194. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of LB, diluted 100-fold into prewarmed medium and allowed to grow to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm. Cells were induced with 0.0002% arabinose for 2.5 h at 30 °C. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles were suspended in a buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 0.2 m KCl, and 0.05 mm EDTA and stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma Chemical Co.). Samples were prepared by incubation in SDS sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature and separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed with antibody to the His6 tag (Clontech) using an enhanced chemiluminescence assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed on x-ray film at room temperature, as described previously (20Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Google Scholar). To correct for differences in expression of the mutant proteins, the amount of CopA in everted membrane vesicles was normalized to that of the wild type by quantitative Western blot analysis. Each set of membranes was analyzed at four different concentrations, and a standard curve was constructed from the values obtained by densitometry. 64Cu was obtained from the Division of Radiological Science, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University Medical School, which is supported by NCI Research Resource Grant NIH 1 R24 CA86307. Transport assays were performed at room temperature as described previously (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, the reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 40 mm histidine (pH 6.8), 0.2 m KCl, 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mg of membrane protein, 10 μm64CuCl2(0.5–10 μCi/ml), and 5 mm Na2ATP. The reaction was initiated by addition of 5 mmMgCl2. At intervals, 0.1-ml samples were withdrawn and filtered through nitrocellulose filters (0.22-μm pore size, Whatman). The filters were presoaked in a buffer consisting of 40 mmhistidine, pH 6.8, 0.2 m KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, and 20 mmCuCl2. Following filtration, the filters were washed with 5 ml of the same buffer, dried, and the radioactivity quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The values obtained with the assay mixture without membrane vesicles were subtracted from all time points. Everted membrane vesicles (20 μl of 1 mg/ml protein) were diluted into 140 μl of an assay buffer consisting of 40 mm histidine (pH 6.8), 0.2 mKCl, 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 mmMgCl2. For assays containing AgNO3, 0.2m KNO3, and 5 mmMg(NO3)2 were used in place of KCl and MgCl2. Reductant (1.5 μl of 0.1 m DTT, GSH, or cysteine) and 1.5 μl of metal ion solutions or water were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. To measure sensitivity to vanadate, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 50 μm. After incubation on ice (or at room temperature for purified CopA) for the indicated times, 40 μl of ice-cold 50% tricholoracetic acid was added to terminate the reaction. For pulse-chase analysis, 1 mm cold ATP was added 30 s after the start of the reaction, followed by incubation on ice for another 15 to 30 s. Following addition of tricholoracetic acid, the membrane vesicles were kept on ice for an additional 10 min and then harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet protein was washed once with 0.5 ml of distilled water and once with 0.5 ml of a solution of 50 mmH3PO4/NaOH, pH 2.4. To examine alkali lability, the pelleted material was suspended in 0.2 ml of 0.5 m KOH and kept on ice for 5 min. Sensitivity to hydroxylamine was examined by suspending the pelleted material in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.6, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of 0.25m NH2OH, with an additional 10 min incubation at room temperature. The treated samples were again precipitated with tricholoracetic acid and dissolved in 30 μl of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer diluted with an equal volume of 50 mmH3PO4/NaOH, pH 2.4, containing 5% SDS. Samples of 10 μl were loaded on an acidic 8% polyacrylamide gel (21Fairbanks G. Avruch J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1972; 1: 66-75Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried using a DryEase mini-gel drying system (Novex). Radioactivity was analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Membrane vesicles (5 mg/ml) were solubilized in buffer D, consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm CuCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, containing 2% dodecyl maltoside (DDM). The mixture was gently shaken at 4 °C for 1 h, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Probond Ni2+ affinity column (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with buffer D containing 0.1% DDM. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of the same buffer, followed by 5 bed volumes of the same buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.1 m imidazole. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected into tubes containing concentrated DTT and EDTA such that the final concentrations became 1 and 0.1 mm, respectively. The samples were analyzed for CopA by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. CopA-containing fractions were concentrated 10-fold using Centricon concentrators (Millipore), and the imidazole was removed by gel filtration on a 5-cm column filled with 3 ml of Sephadex G-25 column pre-equilibrated with buffer D containing 0.1% DDM. All buffers were degassed under vacuum or bubbled with Argon before use. All steps were performed at 4 °C. ATPase activity was estimated by a coupled spectrometric assay (22Vogel G. Steinhart R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 208-216Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.4 ml) contained 40 mm histidine, pH 6.8, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 0.4 mg of total E. coli lipids (AVANTI polar-lipids), 0.25 mm NADH, 1.25 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 7 units of pyruvate kinase, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 5 mm ATP. Where indicated 1 mmNaN3, 0.25 mm BCS, 10 μmCuCl2 or 10 μm Cu(I) (acetonitrile copper(I) hexafluorophosphate, Sigma) were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to initiating the assay with 5 mm MgCl2. A signature property of the P-type ATPases is that the conserved aspartate residue in the DKTG motif accepts the γ-phosphate from ATP during the catalytic cycle, forming a covalent acylphosphate intermediate (23Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Google Scholar). To investigate phosphoenzyme formation in CopA, everted membrane vesicles were prepared from cells of strain DC194 (ΔcopA) expressing wild type copA on a plasmid. CopA was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP in a time-dependent manner, with maximum labeling within 30 s (Fig. 1 A). Vesicles from thecopA deletion strain DC194 did not exhibit a radioactive band at the corresponding position (Fig. 1, lane 1). The intermediate was sensitive to basic pH and hydroxylamine (Fig.1 B), which are considered to be reliable criteria for the presence of an acylphosphate bond. The label could be chased by 1 mm unlabeled ATP within 15 s, indicating the transient nature of the intermediate. In the presence of 50 μmsodium orthovanadate, which mimics the transition state when bound in the active site of P-type ATPases, the reaction was entirely inhibited. On the other hand, phosphoenzyme formation was not inhibited by azide, an inhibitor of many ATPases. Since CopA is a copper ion pump, acylphosphate formation would be expected to be stimulated by copper ion. In the absence of copper ion, no radioactive band was observed (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). To date there has been no clear determination of the redox state of the substrate of copper ion pumps, that is, whether these ATPases transport Cu(II), Cu(I) or both. Our previous work showed that a reductant, DTT, was required for the transport of 64Cu with membrane vesicles (1Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Google Scholar, 18Fan B. Grass G. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 414-418Google Scholar). To investigate whether reductant is also required for phosphoenzyme formation, several reductants were added to the assay. In agreement with the results of the transport assays, a significant radioactive band was observed only in the presence of Cu(II) and reductant: DTT, GSH, or cysteine (Fig. 1 C). DTT and GSH were more effective than cysteine. For those reasons DTT was usually added as reductant in subsequent assays. The requirement for reductant could be to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) or to reduce the cysteines in CopA or both. For that reason the effect of mono- and divalent soft metal ions on acylphosphate formation was examined (Fig. 1 C). No phosphoenzyme formation was observed in the presence of the divalent cations Zn(II) or Co(II), whether or not DTT was present. In contrast, either Ag(I) or Cu(I) (added in the form of acetonitrile copper(I) hexafluorophosphate) stimulated phosphoenzyme formation even in the absence of DTT, showing that DTT is not necessary to maintain the enzyme in a reduced state. Moreover, bathocuproindisulfonate (BCDS), which chelates Cu(I) and not Cu(II), prevented labeling. These results demonstrate that CopA is a monovalent (but not a divalent) soft metal ion P-type ATPase. One characteristic that differentiates soft metal P-type ATPases from their hard metal homologues is the presence of one or more Cys-(X)2-Cys metal binding domains in the cytosolic N-terminal region. We have previously shown that none of the four cysteine residues in the Gly-Leu-Ser-Cys14-Gly-His-Cys17 and Gly-Met-Ser-Cys110-Ala-Ser-Cys113 sequences of CopA is required for either copper resistance or transport, although deletion of codons 8–150 (ΔNCopA) lost both copper resistance and transport (18Fan B. Grass G. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 414-418Google Scholar). To extend this observation, two N-terminally truncated CopAs were constructed: pCopA2ΔN1, which is truncated immediately after the first Cys-(X)2-Cys motif, and pCopA2ΔN2, which has both Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs deleted. Cells expressing ΔN1 CopA retained partial resistance to CuSO4 in vivo, while cells expressing ΔN2 CopA were as sensitive as the CopA deletion strain (Fig. 2), even though the truncated proteins were made in amounts comparable to that of the wild type (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that at least a portion of the cytosolic N terminus of the protein is necessary, although whether that is for activity or proper folding cannot be deduced from these results.Figure 3Acylphosphate intermediate formation in CopA mutants. Phosphorylation of CopA was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Each lane contained 20 μg of membrane protein from cells of DC194 without a plasmid (lane 1) or bearing plasmids expressing wild type CopA (lane 2), C14A/C17A (lane 3), C110A/C113A (lane 4), C14A/C17A/C110A/C113A (lane 5), ΔN1 (lane 6), ΔN2 (lane 7), C479A (lane 8), C481A (lane 9), or C481H (lane 10). A, immunoblotting with antibody against the His6 tag. B, labeling of CopA with [γ-32P]ATP, with radioactivity in each lane imaged with a phosphorimager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CopA mutants with alanine substitutions in the first (C14A/C17A) or second (C110A/113A) Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs or with all four cysteines substituted (C14A/C17A/C110A/C113A) formed an acylphosphate intermediate equivalent to wild type CopA (Figs.1 B and 3 B). Indeed, deletion of the N terminus through the first Cys-(X)2-Cys motif did not appear to affect the ability of the ΔN1 CopA to form a phosphorylated intermediate, just as a strain expressing this mutant copAconferred copper resistance in vivo. Consistent with the loss of resistance in cells bearing pCopA2ΔN2, the ΔN2 enzyme did not form a phosphorylated intermediate. A distinctive feature of soft metal ATPases is a highly conserved Cys-Pro-Cys motif in TM6, the putative translocation domain (24Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Google Scholar). The Cys-Pro-Cys motif in CopA includes Cys479 and Cys481. The two cysteines were individually mutated to C479A and C481A. Since the Enterococcus hirae CopB has a Cys-Pro-His sequence (6Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Google Scholar), a C481H mutant was also constructed. All three mutant proteins were expressed in amounts comparable to wild type CopA (Fig. 3 A). The effect of the mutations on copper resistance in vivo (Fig. 4 A) and ATP-driven64Cu transport in vitro were examined. None of the mutant genes conferred resistance to copper, and everted membrane vesicles from cells expressing those genes were unable to accumulate64Cu (Fig. 4). No phosphoenzyme intermediates were detected in the C479A, C481A, or C481H proteins (Fig. 3 B). Formation of the acylphosphate intermediate with increasing copper concentration was investigated (Fig. 5). Wild type CopA, the C14A/C17A/C110A/C113A quadruple mutant, and the ΔN1 mutant each responded to increasing concentrations of copper (Fig. 5 A). The bands from three separate 32P-labeled gels were quantified by densitometry. The values were averaged and, for clarity, were normalized to the value at 50 μm (Fig.5 B). The apparent K m for copper of wild type CopA was 1.5 ± 0.5 μm, which is similar to theK m of 3.9 μm for the copper dependence of ATPase activity of the Achaeoglobius fulgidus CopA (25Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Arguello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Google Scholar). The apparent K m of the quadruple mutant was 0.45 ± 0.1 μm, and the ΔN1 exhibited an apparentK m of 0.84 ± 0.2 μm. Thus, removal of the first N-terminal Cys-(X)2-Cys motif or modification of all four N-terminal cysteines seemed to produce an apparent increase in affinity for Cu(II). Membrane vesicles were prepared from arabinose-induced cells bearing plasmid pCopA2, which carries a copA gene in-frame with the sequence for the Myc epitope and six histidine codons under control of the arabinose promoter. The vesicles were solubilized with 2% dodecylmaltoside, and CopA was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography (Fig.6 A). The presence of a small amount of copper during solubilization and purification was found to result in more active and stable CopA. A minor band was observed upon immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B). Since the slightly smaller protein reacted with antibody to the histidine tag, there was probably some degradation at the N terminus of CopA. Although the purified protein exhibited ATPase activity, hydrolysis was inhibited 80–90% by sodium azide. Since phosphoenzyme formation is not inhibited by sodium azide (Fig. 1 B), it is likely that the azide-sensitive ATPase activity is due to minor contamination by a highly active ATPase. The azide-insensitive ATPase activity of 130 nmol/mg/min was inhibited to 65 nmol/mg/min by BCS, a Cu(I) chelator, that may reflect residual copper remaining from purification. Neither Cu(II) nor Zn(II) stimulated ATPase activity. Compared with the rate in the presence of BCS, there was an ∼4-fold activation by Cu(I) (280 nmol/mg/min) or Cu(II) plus DTT (295 nmol/mg/min). In other experiments, Ag(I)-stimulated activity was 4- to 5-fold higher than the rate with BCS. The Ag(I)-stimulated activity exhibited a relatively broad pH profile, with approximately equal activity at pH 7 and 8, and about one-third lower at pH 6. These results indicate that the azide-insensitive ATPase activity is catalyzed by CopA in a reaction that requires either Cu(I) or Ag(I). Cu(I)-stimulated ATPase exhibited an apparent K m for ATP of 0.5 mm (Fig.6 C). The Cu(I)-stimulated V max of 0.19 μmol/mg/min is similar to the V max for the Ag(I)-stimulated ATPase reported for the CopA homologue fromA. fulgidus (25Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Arguello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Google Scholar). The distinctive feature of P-type ATPases that gave the superfamily its name is the formation of an acylphosphate on a conserved aspartate residues during the catalytic cycle (23Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Google Scholar). Phosphoenzyme formation has been shown for several copper-translocating P-type ATPase homologues of CopA (25Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D.

In this report we demonstrate Cu(I)-dependent phosphorylation of CopA. Phosphorylation was sensitive to alkali and hydroxylamine, consistent with acylphosphate formation on the conserved Asp523. Whereas it is presumed that copper pumps are specific for Cu(I) and not Cu(II), this has not been proven. Since an N-terminal peptide containing the Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs of the Wilson disease protein has been shown to bind Cu(II) and other divalent cations (29DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Sarkar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33279-33282Google Scholar), it is possible that these proteins could pump both Cu(I) and Cu(II). Phosphorylation of WND and E. hirae CopA were not copper-dependent. This could have been due to copper contamination in the buffers, since copper chelators were found to inhibit. Phosphorylation of MNK and theA. fulgidus CopA showed copper dependence, but it was not clear whether the activity was stimulated by Cu(I), Cu(II), or both. In both cases DTT was present in the phosphorylation assays, which would reduce some or all of the Cu(II) to Cu(I), but DTT might also have been necessary to reduce cysteine thiolates in the proteins. The data reported here clearly show that Cu(I) and not Cu(II) stimulates phosphorylation of CopA, and that DTT is not required. While phosphoenzyme formation was stimulated by Cu(II) in the presence of DTT, Cu(I) and Ag(I) were equally effective in the absence of DTT. Thus the requirement for DTT appears to be in reduction of copper rather than for maintenance of protein cysteine thiolates. There was no phosphorylation in the presence of Cu(II) or other divalent cations, so CopA is not a divalent cation pump. The soft metal P-type ATPase are distinguished from their hard metal homologues by the presence of N-terminal metal binding motifs, usually Cys-(X)2-Cys, and a second cysteine motif, usually Cys-Pro-Cys, in TM6. The physiological role of these motifs and the function of the individual cysteine residues in the biochemical mechanism of the ATPases are open questions. In eukaryotes the N-terminal motifs may interact with metal chaperones or may be involved in copper-regulated trafficking of copper pumps from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. Most prokaryotes lack intracellular membranes or compartments, and the function of the Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs in their copper pumps is less clear. In E. coli there are no intracellular membranes, and no metallochaperones have been identified. In this report we investigated the ability of N-terminal cysteine mutants and deletions to form a phosphorylated intermediate. A quadruple mutant lacking all four cysteine residues of the two N-terminal Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP. CopA with a deletion of the first Cys(X)2Cys motif similarly was phosphorylated. In both there was a 2–3-fold decrease in the concentration of copper required for maximal phosphoenzyme formation. Does this apparently counterintuitive result imply that binding of copper to the N-terminal motifs decrease the affinity of the pump for copper, perhaps for a regulatory function? An alternative explanation is that in vitro the Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs reduce access of copper to the translocation pathway or reduce the local concentration of copper in that region. The mutations did not produce altered copper resistance, so it is questionable whether the in vitro results reflect an increased efficiency of the pump in vivo. While none of the four N-terminal cysteines are required for CopA activity under the conditions studied, their contributions to CopA function may be apparent only under different physiological conditions. Similar conclusions have been made about the Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs in other copper P-type ATPases. For example, in MNK mutation or deletion of the first four of the six Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs had no apparent effect on copper-induced trafficking, their only identified function (15Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Google Scholar). Although none of the cysteine residues of the two Cys-(X)2-Cys motifs of CopA are obligatory, deletion of the N terminus to just before the first putative transmembrane region resulted in loss of function, but it is possible that the remainder of the protein does not fold properly. In three CopA homologues the Cys-Pro-Cys motif that is distinctive in soft metal ion-translocating ATPases has been shown to be located in TM6 (30Melchers K. Schuhmacher A. Buhmann A. Weitzenegger T. Belin D. Grau S. Ehrmann M. Res. Microbiol. 1999; 150: 507-520Google Scholar, 31Melchers K. Weitzenegger T. Buhmann A. Steinhilber W. Sachs G. Schafer K.P. J. Biol.

Biomembr. 2002; 34: 147-156Google Scholar), so it is reasonable to assume that it is in TM6 of CopA as well. The Cys-Pro-Cys motif has been proposed to be part of the translocation domain (24Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Google Scholar). To examine the requirement of the cysteine residues, Cys479 and Cys481 were changed to alanine residues. Cells expressing either mutant became sensitive to copper. Both mutant proteins were found in the membrane in normal amounts, but neither was phosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP. Since the CopB homologue from E. hirae has a Cys-Pro-His motif in the corresponding TM6 (6Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Google Scholar), we constructed a C481H mutant. Cells expressing the mutant CopA were also sensitive to copper, and the protein with a Cys-Pro-His motif did not form an acylphosphate intermediate. A reasonable interpretation of these results is that the Cys-Pro-Cys motif of CopA is essential for Cu(I) binding, and that mutants with Cys-Pro-His, Cys-Pro-Ala, or Ala-Pro-Cys no longer bind metal. This is consistent with the known catalytic cycle for hard metal ion-translocating P-type ATPases, where binding of metal is required for acylphosphate formation at the conserved aspartate residue (33Inesi G. Kirtley M.R. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 271-283Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that the Cys-Pro-Cys residues of CopA are required for binding of Cu(I) in the ion translocation pathway and hence for Cu(I) transport."

Ammonium sulfate fractionation was employed as a preliminary step when large volumes were processed. The purification was about 4000-fold. Homogeneity was shown by free boundary, agar and paper electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, and diffusion. Immunoelectrophoretic behavior against antisera to human serum and serum fractions indicated purity. Other immunoelectrophoretic analyses showed lack of reaction with antisera produced against sera from several species other than human. The molecular weight of the protein was calculated as 51,700 from sedimentation and diffusion data. Chemical composition was ascertained by amino acid and carbohydrate analyses, nitrogen determination, and biuret. The physicochemical properties described include sedimentation coefficient (s020,w = 3.79 S), diffusion coefficient (D20,w = 6.15 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1), electrophoretic mobility (u = 4.9 x 10-5 cm2 volt-1 sec-1), extinction coefficient (E1%1 cm = 6.45), partial specific volume (V = 0.708 ml g-1), and frictional ratio (f/f0 = 1.42). One binding site for cortisol was found by equilibrium dialysis at 4° and at 37°; the association constants at these temperatures were 5.2 x 108 m-1 and 2.4 x 107 m-1, respectively. Complete removal of sialic acid did not significantly affect the cortisol-binding affinity. Pure corticosteroid-binding globulin was inactivated by gel filtration at 45° or by dialysis against glass-redistilled water."
https://openalex.org/W2014160574,"The nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of the NF-ATc family of transcription factors, essential to many developmental, differentiation, and adaptation processes, are determined by the opposing activities of the phosphatase calcineurin, which promotes nuclear accumulation of NF-ATc, and several kinases, which promote cytoplasmic accumulation. Many reports suggest that protein kinase A (PKA) negatively modulates calcineurin-mediated NF-ATc activation. Here we show that overexpression of PKA causes phosphorylation and cytoplasmic accumulation of NF-ATc1 in direct opposition to calcineurin by phosphorylating Ser-245, Ser-269, and Ser-294 in the conserved serine-proline repeat domain, and that mutation of these serines blocks the effect of PKA. Activation of endogenous PKA is similarly able to promote phosphorylation of these sites on NF-ATc1 in two lymphoid cell lines. We further show that a complete block of NF-ATc1 nuclear localization by PKA requires a second kinase activity that can be supplied by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and that mutation of either the PKA phosphorylation sites or the upstream GSK-3 sites prevents the effect of PKA. Thus, we propose that PKA functions cooperatively as a priming kinase for further phosphorylation by GSK-3 to oppose calcineurin-mediated nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of NF-ATc1 and that, through this mechanism, PKA may be an important modulator of many NF-ATc-dependent processes.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Google Scholar), and each has several RNA splice variant isoforms. The NF-ATc family members exhibit several properties, such as distinct cell-type and differentiation expression patterns, different DNA binding affinities, the varied requirement for heterologous DNA binding partners, and complex regulation of their subcellular accumulation, which may enable them to be involved in such a diverse array of cellular processes (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar, 25Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Google Scholar). An hypothesis of the regulation of NF-ATc subcellular accumulation is that it undergoes continuous rapid cycling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, where a dynamic equilibrium between its import and export rates determines its steady-state nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation (4Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Google Scholar, 26Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Google Scholar, 27Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Google Scholar). These rates are regulated through the relative activity levels of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (28Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 237-295Google Scholar, 29Premack B.A. Gardner P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1119-C1140Google Scholar) and various opposing NF-ATc kinases. Dephosphorylation of NF-ATc by calcineurin increases NF-ATc nuclear accumulation and NF-AT-mediated gene transcription, whereas phosphorylation by the opposing NF-ATc kinases increases NF-ATc cytoplasmic accumulation and the cessation of transcriptional activity (1Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Google Scholar, 3Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Google Scholar). This kinase/phosphatase interplay determines the phosphorylation state of the ∼20 conserved serines found in the amino-terminal domain termed the NF-AT homology region (NHR) (30Luo C. Burgeon E. Carew J.A. McCaffrey P.G. Badalian T.M. Lane W.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3955-3966Google Scholar). The NHR is necessary and sufficient to confer calcium-responsive localization to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion partner and carries several distinct amino acid motifs: the serine-rich region (SRR), three serine-proline (SP) repeats with the sequence spXXSPXXSPXXSPrXsXX(D/E)(D/E), an amino-terminal nuclear localization sequence (N-NLS), and a nuclear export sequence (NES) (31Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Google Scholar, 32Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Google Scholar). For the NF-ATc1 protein, dephosphorylation of critical serine residues in the SRR or the first SP repeat (SP1) is thought to induce a conformational change that unmasks its two functionally redundant NLSs, resulting in subsequent nuclear accumulation (31Beals C.R. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 824-834Google Scholar). Others have found that phosphorylation is required for nuclear export, suggesting that phosphorylation, although masking the NLS, also unmasks an NES (4Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Google Scholar, 33Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Google Scholar). Regulation of NF-ATc subcellular localization through this multisite phosphorylation mechanism adds an opportunity for complex signal integration (16Neilson J. Stankunas K. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 346-350Google Scholar, 25Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Google Scholar). One report describes the requirement for a threshold concentration of nuclear NF-AT to activate NF-AT-dependent gene transcription (34Fiering S. Northrop J.P. Nolan G.P. Mattila P.S. Crabtree G.R. Herzenberg L.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1823-1834Google Scholar), suggesting that a stimulus which serves to counteract the drive for NF-ATc nuclear import, even if only to a moderate degree, may have dramatic consequences on NF-AT-mediated gene transcription. Many NF-ATc kinases have been reported to phosphorylate from one to many of the serines in the NHR, and several of these kinases, once overexpressed, can oppose calcineurin-mediated nuclear accumulation of specific NF-ATc family members (35Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Google Scholar, 36Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J.

Cell. 1998; 93: 851-861Google Scholar). Thus, the large number of possible phosphorylation sites creates the potential for graded modulation of NF-ATc activity through the activation of these various kinase signaling pathways (33Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that the cAMP/PKA pathway can modulate the activity of NF-ATc. The membrane-permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) inhibits the calcium-mediated transcriptional activity of the distal interleukin-2 (IL-2) NF-AT DNA element (6Negulescu P.A. Shastri N. Cahalan M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2873-2877Google Scholar). Overexpression of either constitutively active calcineurin or of NF-ATc can overcome IL-2 promoter sensitivity to this cAMP/PKA opposition (8Paliogianni F. Kincaid R.L. Boumpas D.T. J. Exp.

Furthermore, NF-AT DNA binding activity, dependent on the T cell source (9Tsuruta L. Lee H.J. Masuda E.S. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J.

We have previously reported that PKA is able to phosphorylate NF-ATc1in vitro, providing the necessary priming phosphates for further rephosphorylation by the NF-ATc kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (35Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Google Scholar). GSK-3 is able to oppose ionomycin-induced NF-ATc1 nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity, as well as to increase the rate of NF-ATc1 nuclear export. In addition, GSK-3 is thought to be a strong candidate as a physiological NF-ATc kinase (16Neilson J. Stankunas K. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 346-350Google Scholar). However, the in vivo relevance and mechanistic details of the in vitro ability of PKA to prime for GSK-3 phosphorylation of NF-ATc1 have not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that PKA phosphorylates NF-ATc1 in vivo and has the ability to oppose both calcineurin-mediated NF-ATc1 dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation. It does this by acting as a priming kinase for subsequent rephosphorylation of the SP2 and SP3 repeat motifs of NF-ATc1 by GSK-3, and by synergizing with limiting amounts of GSK-3 to oppose activated calcineurin. Thus, activation of PKA may enable GSK-3 to more effectively oppose the calcineurin-mediated activation of NF-ATc1 during simultaneous stimulation of both the calcium and cAMP pathways.

HEK 293T cells were plated at 50% confluence in 35-mm tissue culture dishes the night before transfection. 2 μg of indicated plasmid DNAs were mixed with 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) then mixed with 8.5 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM medium, incubated 15–45 min at room temperature, mixed with 800 μl of serum-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), placed on cells pre-washed once with serum-free DMEM, incubated at 37 °C for 5 h, and transferred to cell culture medium for 24–48 h. 107 TAg Jurkat cells were resuspended in cytomix (49van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Google Scholar) (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, pH adjusted with KOH, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.6, 5 mm glutathione), and DNA was added to a final volume of 295 μl. Cells were electroporated at 250 volts, 960 microfarads, room temperature, then transferred to 10 ml of cell culture medium for 48 h. TAg Jurkat T cells were electroporated as described above with 10 μg of indicated reporter plasmid, 2 μg of pGL3 (transfection control), ± 20 μg of PKAc and/or pSRα as indicated to 37 μg of total DNA, incubated 48 h, and then stimulated overnight with 50 ng/ml PMA and 2 μm ionomycin or Me2SO vehicle. Cells were lysed in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) and gene reporter assays were performed as described in the Galacto-Light PlusTM kit (Tropix) and the Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega) protocols and read with a Monolight 2001 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Protein assays were performed as described in the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Reagent protocol. The transcriptional activation values were calculated as “β-galactosidase/luciferase” = (β-galactosidase/μg of protein)/(luciferase/μg of protein). The PMA + ionomycin value was considered to be 100% stimulation; therefore, using CA-Cricket®Graph IIITM (Computer Associates International, Inc.), each value was calculated relative to this giving “relative β-galactosidase activity” = (β-galactosidase/luciferase) × 100/(value of PMA + ionomycin). HEK 293T cells were fixed in either 3.75% formaldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with −20 °C methanol for 2 min, rehydrated with PBS, blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h, incubated 2 h to overnight with 5 μg/ml anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibody and then 1:250 rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 45 min in a humidified chamber at 37 °C and viewed with water-immersion 40× objective on Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope and photographed with Elite Chrome 400 ASA 35-mm film for color slides (Eastman Kodak Co.). HEK 293T cells expressing GFP constructs were stimulated as indicated, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed, and photographed. TAB cells were cytospun (700 rpm, 7 min) onto poly-l-lysine glass slides (Sigma) after indicated stimulation, briefly air-dried, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, then permeabilized in −20 °C 100% methanol for 2 min, and rehydrated in PBS. Cells were blocked in 2% fetal calf serum, 1% BSA, PBS for 1–2 h at room temperature, probed with 1:1000 7A6 antibody for 2 h, then 1:500 biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse for 1 h, then 1:500 FITC-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h. The red nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:1000 in PBS and incubated on cells for 5 min and washed. The Slow-Fade-Light kit (Molecular Probes) was used to prevent fading, and then cells were covered with glass coverslip and sealed. Cells were viewed on a AmershamBiosciences MultiProbe 2010 confocal laser scanning microscope with 60× oil-immersion objective located in the Cell Sciences Imaging Facility (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Data were collected with the Amersham Biosciences ImageSpace (version 3.2) software. Cells were pre-incubated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min, then stimulated at 37 °C with either 1 μg/ml CsA, 1 mmBt2cAMP + 1 mm IBMX, or Me2SO vehicle (−) for 30 min before addition of 1 μg/ml ionomycin or Me2SO (−) for 30 min as indicated. 150 μl of either 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate) were added to HEK 293T cells, incubated for 30 min on ice, sonicated 15 s, centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. 10–20 μl of supernatant were run on 7.5 or 6% separating, 4% stacking SDS-PAGE Bio-Rad mini-gels at 150 V for 1 h, then transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked overnight in 5% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20, 1× Tris-buffered saline, incubated with primary antibody as indicated 1.5 h at room temperature, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody as indicated 45 min at room temperature, washed, developed with the Amersham ECL kit, and exposed to film. Purified wt NF-ATc1-GST protein was used to isolate the peptides phosphorylated by PKA. GST fusion proteins were purified by lysing bacteria in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 174 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice three times for 1 min each and centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to supernatant, rotated at room temperature 45–60 min, washed with lysis buffer, then washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. In vitro PKA phosphorylation was performed with 4 μg of wt NF-ATc1-GST/beads, one reaction with [32P]ATP and one with cold ATP, with 50 mmPIPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μmcold ATP (plus 1 μCi of [32P]ATP for hot reaction only), 10 μl of immunoprecipitate, 0.2 μg of PKAc (Sigma), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF, rinsed with water, and exposed to film.32P-Labeled wt NF-ATc1-GST and corresponding cold-labeled bands were cut out. Phosphotryptic peptide mapping protocol was followed as described below, except that 1000 cpm of32P-labeled sample was combined with all of the cold-labeled sample before the last wash in pH 1.9 buffer to ensure that sufficient peptide was available for both sequencing and radio-isotope detection. After mapping, 32P-labeled peptides were located on the cellulose plate, scraped off with a razor blade, and collected in a microcentrifuge tube, then washed with water. Eluted peptides were lyophilized. The sample was then resuspended in 50 μl of water for Edman degradation peptide sequencing at the PAN Facility at Stanford University. Either GST fusion proteins (see above) or NF-ATc1 proteins immunoprecipitated from HEK 293T cells were used in phosphotryptic peptide mapping. Cell lysis was performed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer as described above. NF-ATc1 was immunoprecipitated with 7A6 anti-NF-ATc1 antibody and Protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight, then washed three times in lysis buffer. NF-ATc1 had been either in vivoorthophosphate-labeled (see below) or in vitrophosphorylated with PKA as GST fusion proteins above. Phosphotryptic peptide mapping was performed as described (50Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). Thin-layer electrophoresis dimension was run in pH 1.9 buffer for 30 min at 1000 volts, and the thin-layer chromatography dimension was run in phosphochromatography buffer (37.5% n-butanol, 30.4% pyridine, 7.5% glacial acetic acid) overnight. Cells were starved for 1 h in phosphate- and serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 for TAB cells, and DMEM for 293T cells), then incubated for 3 h in 500 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free medium with 10% fetal calf serum (dialyzed against HEPES to remove excess ATP). Cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors (CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets, EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) plus phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 500 ng/ml cyclosporin A, 100 μm β-glycerol-phosphate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 μm sodium molybdate) plus kinase inhibitors (20 μm peptide PKA inhibitor, 2 μm staurosporine, 10 mm lithium chloride) and immunoprecipitated with 7A6 (anti-NF-ATc1) and Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For mapping, samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF for further analysis as described above. For quantitation of phosphorylation and comparison with protein levels, samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were wrapped in Saran and exposed to a phosphorimager screen for 12–24 h, developed on a STORM 840 Phospho Screen phosphorimager and analyzed with ImageQuantMac version 1.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was assayed by Western blot with 7A6 (anti-NF-ATc1) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated"
https://openalex.org/W2051064724,"Dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH):quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the reductive metabolism of quinones. To examine the in vivo role of NQO2, NQO2-null (NQO2−/−) mice were generated using targeted gene disruption. Mice lacking NQO2 gene expression showed no detectable developmental abnormalities and were indistinguishable from wild-type (NQO2+/+) mice. However, NQO2-null mice exhibited myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow and increased neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets in the peripheral blood. Decreased apoptosis of bone marrow cells and circulating granulocytes contributed to myeloid hyperplasia and hyperactivity of bone marrow in NQO2-null mice. The hematological changes in NQO2−/− mice were specifically associated with loss of the NQO2 gene because histological analysis of various tissues including spleen, thymus, blood cultures, and urine analysis demonstrated no sign of infection. NQO2-null mice also demonstrated decreased toxicity when exposed to menadione or menadione with NRH. These results establish a role for NQO2 in protection against myelogenous hyperplasia and in metabolic activation of menadione, leading to hepatic toxicity. The NQO2-null mice are a model for NQO2 deficiency in humans and can be used to determine the role of this enzyme in sensitivities to toxicity and carcinogenesis.

The dicoumarol-sensitive NQO1 is a cytosolic protein of 274 amino acid residues (M r 30,880). NQO1 gene expression is induced in response to xenobiotics, antioxidants, oxidants, heavy metals, UV light, and ionizing radiation (1O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol.

Interestingly, NQO1 is part of an electrophilic and/or oxidative stress-induced cellular defense mechanism that includes the induction of more than two dozen defensive genes (1O'Brien P.J. Chem.

The coordinated induction of these genes, including NQO1, presumably provides the necessary protection for cells against free radical damage, oxidative stress, and neoplasia caused by exposure to quinones and other chemicals (1O'Brien P.J.

The human NQO1 gene has been localized to chromosome 16q22 (6Jaiswal A.K. Bell D.W. Radjendirane V. Testa J.R. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent studies have characterized a C → T mutation in the NQO1 gene which resulted in a P187S change and the loss of NQO1 activity (7Ross D. Beall H. Traver R.D. Siegel D. Phillips R.M. Gibson N.W.

This mutation has been found in human colon carcinoma (BE) cells, human lung cancer cells (H596), and in fibroblasts taken from a cancer-prone family. More recently, studies have suggested an increased susceptibility of individuals carrying mutant alleles of NQO1 to the toxic effects of benzene and its metabolites as well as myeloid leukemia (9Rothman N.

However, the role of NQO1 in bioactivation of drugs is controversial (17Workman P. Oncology Res. 1994; 6: 461-475PubMed Google Scholar). A cytosolic activity distinct from NQO1, yet related to NQO1, was reported to activate mitomycin C (18Joseph P. Xu Y. Jaiswal A.K. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). NQO1−/− mice were produced using targeted gene disruption (19Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee Y.H. Kimura S. Klein-Sazanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mice lacking a functional NQO1 gene (NQO1−/−) were born normal and exhibited no reproductive abnormalities, but they did exhibit altered intracellular redox status/metabolism caused by accumulation of the cofactors NADH and NADPH (20Gaikwad A. Long D.J. II Stringer J.L. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22559-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because of this, NQO1−/− mice accumulated less abdominal adipose tissue with increasing age compared with wild-type mice (20Gaikwad A. Long D.J. II Stringer J.L. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22559-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Disruption of the NQO1 gene in mice also led to myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow (21Long D.J. II Gaikwad A. Multani A. Pathak S. Montgomery C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3030-3036PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, loss of NQO1 gene expression in mice led to increased sensitivity to menadione toxicity, as well as benzo(a)pyrene and dimethylbenzanthracene-induced skin tumors (19Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee Y.H. Kimura S. Klein-Sazanto A.J.P. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22Long D.J.

Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The benzo(a)pyrene-inhibitable cytosolic NQO2 is a 231amino acid protein (M r 25,956) (24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The human NQO2 protein is 43 amino acids shorter in its carboxyl terminus than the human, rat, or mouse NQO1. The human NQO2 cDNA and protein are 54 and 49% similar to the human liver cytosolic NQO1 cDNA and protein, respectively (24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that NQO2 is different from NQO1 in its cofactor requirements (25Wu K.B. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NQO2 uses dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) rather than NAD(P)H as an electron donor. Another difference between NQO1 and NQO2 is that NQO2 is resistant to typical inhibitors of NQO1, such as dicoumarol, cibacron blue, and phenindone (25Wu K.B. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Flavones, including quercetin, are inhibitors of NQO2 (25Wu K.B. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Benzo(a)pyrene is another known inhibitor of NQO2 (26Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Even though overlapping substrate specificities have been observed for NQO1 and NQO2, significant differences exist in relative affinities (Km) for the various substrates (25Wu K.B. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of NQO2 revealed that NQO2 contains a specific metal binding site that is not present in NQO1 (27Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The human NQO2 gene has been localized precisely to chromosome 6p25 (6Jaiswal A.K. Bell D.W. Radjendirane V. Testa J.R. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human NQO2 gene locus is highly polymorphic (6Jaiswal A.K. Bell D.W. Radjendirane V. Testa J.R. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The in vivo role of NQO2 in the detoxication of quinones remains unknown. In the present report, we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to disrupt the NQO2 gene and generate knockout (NQO2−/−) mice. NQO2−/− mice showed no detectable developmental abnormalities and were indistinguishable from wild-type (NQO+/+) or heterozygous (NQO2+/−) mice. However, NQO2−/− mice exhibited myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow. The myeloid hyperplasia caused a significant increase in granulocytes in the peripheral blood of NQO2−/− mice. Further analysis showed that decreased apoptosis of myeloid cells in bone marrow and granulocytes in the peripheral blood contributed to increased bone marrow myeloid cell hyperplasia and hyperactivity in NQO2−/− mice. Interestingly, these studies also revealed that unlike NQO1, the loss of NQO2 leads to decreased sensitivity to menadione toxicity. This indicates that NQO2 plays a role in the metabolic activation of menadione. The cloning and nucleotide sequence of mouse cDNA and gene encoding NQO2 have been reported previously (28Long D.J. II Jaiswal A.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The structure of the mouse NQO2 gene was found to be similar to that reported for the human NQO1 gene. Like the human NQO2 gene, the mouse NQO2 gene contains seven exons interrupted by six introns (28; Fig. 1). The splice junctions and nucleotide sequences in the various exons are conserved between human and mouse NQO2 genes (28Long D.J. II Jaiswal A.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Exon 1 in both human and mouse is noncoding (28Long D.J. II Jaiswal A.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was constructed using the pPNT vector having the positive selection neomycin (G418) resistance (29Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.J. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). To disrupt the NQO2 gene, a targeting plasmid containing a deletion of exon 3 of the NQO2 gene was constructed. The 2.1-kb BamHI fragment containing a portion of intron 2 and exon 3 and a small portion of intron 3 of the NQO2 gene was replaced by the 2.0-kb BamHI fragment from the pPNT vector containing the bacterial phosphoribosyltransferase II gene conferring G418 resistance (Fig. 1). The targeting vector contained 1.8 kb of homologous 3′-sequence and 4.0 kb of homologous 5′-sequence flanking the neocassette. To construct the targeting vector, a 1.8-kbBamHI-EcoRI fragment of the mouse NQO2 gene containing a portion of the third intron was first subcloned at theBamHI-EcoRI sites of the pPNT vector. The recombinant plasmid, designated as pPNT-3′-NQO1, was grown and digested with XhoI and dephosphorylated. A 4.0-kbEcoRI-EcoRI fragment of mouse NQO2 gene containing the 5′-flanking region, exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and a portion of intron 2 was isolated, EcoRI-XhoI adapters added, digested with XhoI, and subcloned at theXhoI site of pPNT-3′-NQO1 plasmid to generate targeting construct pPNT-mouse NQO2 gene. Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) mouse ES cells were used for homologous recombination and deletion of exon 3 from the NQO2 gene. The ES cells were thawed and diluted with ES cell medium (HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium, 15% fetal bovine serum, 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin, 1,000 units of leukemia inhibitory factor/ml), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in ES cell medium. The ES cells were plated onto a 60-mm Petri dish previously seeded with mitotically inactive, γ-irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. After 2 days, fresh medium was added to the ES cells, incubated for 4 h, trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA buffered with HEPES, resuspended at 2.5 × 105/60-mm diameter plates with electroporation buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 20 mm HEPES buffer, 0.11 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2), and used for electroporation. Supercoiled targeting pPNT-mouse NQO2 gene plasmid DNA was prepared and linearized with NotI. The DNA was cleaned, precipitated, and resuspended at a concentration of 2 μg/μl sterile distilled water. 50 μg of linearized plasmid was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of electroporation buffer and electroporated in ES cells with a Bio-Rad gene pulser. The electroporation was carried out at 250 V, 250 microfarad capacitance. The electroporated ES cells were plated onto 60-mm Petri dishes containing mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts with ES cell medium. One day after electroporation, cells were selected with the drug G418 (300 μg/ml). After a 1-week selection, the ES cell clones were picked up under a dissecting microscope, transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate containing 25 μl of 0.025% diluted HEPES-buffered trypsin-EDTA, and dissociated by pipetting up and down six times. Dissociated clones were transferred to wells of a 24-well plate containing mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The clones were expanded and trypsinized. One plate was used to make DNA for analysis, and one plate was frozen in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 20% fetal bovine serum in ES medium at −80 °C. The ES cells with homologous recombination were detected by genomic Southern analysis using a 1.0-kb PCR product from 5′-flanking region as probe (the position of the probe is shown in Fig. 1). Positive ES cell clones with homologous recombination and deletion of exon 3 were detected in a ratio of 9:170 ES cell clones. The ES cells from the positive clones were injected into blastocysts, and chimeric animals were then bred to produce F1 mice. Thawing and preparation of the ES cells for microinjection were done according to the Genome Systems protocol. Briefly, a vial of mouse embryonic fibroblasts was thawed, expanded, and plated on six-well plates in preparation for the thawing of the ES cell clones. The cells in the 24-well plates were thawed in a water bath and moved to the six-well plates. Two days later, the cells were trypsinized and replated. The clones were either expanded to 25-cm2 flasks or used directly from the six-well plates for microinjection (depending on the growth rate). The morning of the microinjection, the medium was changed 4 h prior to delivery to the Baylor College of Medicine Microinjection Core Facility. 2.5–3 h after media replacement, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm. The cells were resuspended in 500 μl of STO medium and placed on ice. The core facility injected at least 50 embryos with each of the nine ES cell clones. Southern blots were used to identify germ line transmission, and the heterozygous animals were interbred to produce homozygous knockout mice that do not express the NQO2 gene. NQO2−/−, NQO2+/−, and wild-type mice were housed in the Baylor College of Medicine Center for Comparative Medicine. The animals were kept in polycarbonate cages, maintained with a 12-h light/dark cycle, a temperature of 24 ± 2 °C, a relative humidity of 55 ± 10%, and a negative atmospheric pressure. The mice were fed standard rodent chow and acidified tap water ad libitum. Animals received humane care throughout the experiment according to the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines for animal welfare. The probe to test the ES cells for homologous recombination with the targeting construct is shown in Fig. 1. The PCR kit was purchased from Invitrogen, and forward/reverse primers were used for PCR analysis of the 1.0-kb probe of the 4.3-kb EcoRI fragment in the promoter region of the mouse NQO2 gene. The nucleotide sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GTGAACACAGAAAGCAGGC-3′; that of the reverse primer was 5′-CAATCCAATTTAGACTTTT-3′. The denaturation step was done at 94 °C, reannealing at 40 °C, and extension at 72 °C. 30 cycles were done, followed by a 7-min extension. DNA was isolated from ES cells and mouse tails by the procedure described by Laird et al. (30Laird P.W. Zijderveld A. Linders K. Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Berns A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). DNAs were digested overnight with NcoI, electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized with a 1.0-kb PCR fragment from the 5′-flanking region of the mouse NQO2 gene by standard procedures (24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Southern blots were washed, exposed to x-ray films, and subjected to autoradiography. In a related experiment, the DNAs from NQO2+/+, NQO2+/−, and NQO2−/− mice were digested withBamHI, run on agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized with the 2.0-kb neocassette probes. The blots were washed and autoradiographed. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues including liver, kidney, testis, and lung by the procedures described (31Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rotter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar, 32Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). 80 μg of the RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, blotted, and hybridized with 165 bp of exon 3 probe from mouse NQO2 cDNA (31Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rotter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar, 32Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). NQO2 gene-PCR primers (forward, 5′-GTAAGAAAGTGCTCATCGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATCATTTCTTGTGGCCCTTG-3′) were used to amplify 155 bp of exon 3 to genotype the wild-type, NQO2+/−, and NQO2−/− mice. Similarly, neo-PCR primers (forward, 5′-GTACTCGGATGGAAGCCGGTCT-3′; reverse, 5′-AATATCACGGGTAGCCAACGCT-3′) were used to amplify 250 bp of neocassette. 0.5 μg of genomic DNA from the wild-type, NQO2+/−, and NQO2−/− mice and the above sets of primers was used in a PCR (1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 100 pmol of primers) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min followed by 62 °C for 1 min, and 62 °C for 5 min using an Invitrogen PCR kit. PCR-amplified products were separated on 2% agarose-ethidium bromide gel and photographed. The DNA was transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized to32P-labeled NQO2 exon 3 and neocassette probes by procedures described previously (24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed and autoradiographed. The various tissues (liver, kidney, testis, and lung) from wild-type, NQO2+/−, and NQO2−/− mice were homogenized in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic fractions. The various cytosolic fractions were analyzed for the presence or the absence of NQO2 protein by Western blot analysis as described previously using antibodies against purified rat liver NQO1 protein (33Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rat NQO1 antibody is known to cross-react with mouse and human NQO1 and NQO2 proteins (24Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with ECL (AmershamBiosciences) reagents by the procedure suggested by the manufacturer. Benzo(a)pyrene-sensitive NQO2 activity was measured in all cytosolic fractions by a method reported earlier (25Wu K.B. Knox R. Sun X.Z. Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Zhang D. Deng P.S.K. Chen S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 28Long D.J. II Jaiswal A.K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly described, the wild-type and NQO2−/− mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver, kidney, testis, and lung were surgically removed and washed briefly in cold PBS. The organs were homogenized in 250 mm sucrose and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) was used to determine the protein concentration of the supernatant (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The supernatant was used for NQO2 enzyme analysis. NRH was synthesized by adding 1,000 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to 500 μl of 10 mmnicotinamide mononucleotide (Sigma) in PBS. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. 10 μl of the NRH was added to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 μmdichlorophenolindophenol, and cytosolic extract in a 1-ml standard cuvette. The decrease in absorbance was followed at 600 nm for 1 min with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Cytosolic extract concentrations were used which produced a 0.08–0.15 Achange/min. The specific activity of NQO2 was calculated from the change in A/μg of protein. NQO2−/− and wild-type mice were euthanized, and the various tissues were surgically removed. The tissues were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fischer Scientific) for"

Here we report the effect of Avemar on Jurkat leukemia cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and the activity of key glycolytic/pentose cycle enzymes that control carbon flow for nucleic acid synthesis. The cytotoxic IC50 concentration of Avemar for Jurkat tumor cells is 0.2 mg/ml, and increasing doses of the crude powder inhibit Jurkat cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations higher than 0.2 mg/ml, Avemar inhibits cell growth by more than 50% (72 h of incubation), which is preceded by the appearance of a sub-G1 peak on flow histograms at 48 h. Laser scanning cytometry of propidium iodide- and annexin V-stained cells indicated that the growth-inhibiting effect of Avemar was consistent with a strong induction of apoptosis. Inhibition by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone of apoptosis but increased proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) indicate caspases mediate the cellular effects of Avemar. Activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase were inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion, which correlated with decreased13C incorporation and pentose cycle substrate flow into RNA ribose. This decrease in pentose cycle enzyme activities and carbon flow toward nucleic acid precursor synthesis provide the mechanistic understanding of the cell growth-controlling and apoptosis-inducing effects of fermented wheat germ. Avemar exhibits about a 50-fold higher IC50 (10.02 mg/ml) for peripheral blood lymphocytes to induce a biological response, which provides the broad therapeutic window for this supplemental cancer treatment modality with no toxic effects.

The preventive and therapeutic potential of two natural wheat products, wheat bran and fermented wheat germ (Avemar), in experimental carcinogenesis has recently been described (1Reddy B.S. Hirose Y. Cohen L.A. Simi B. Cooma I. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4792-4797PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zalatnai A. Lapis K. Szende B. Raso E. Telekes A. Resetar A. Hidvegi M. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although no chemical constituents are yet isolated and tested experimentally, it is likely that benzoquinones and wheat germ agglutinin in wheat germ and fiber and lipids and phytic acid in wheat bran play a significant role in exerting anti-carcinogenic effects.

Lapis K. Szende B. Tömösközi-Farkas R. Balogh A. Boren J. Marin S. Cascante M. Hidvegi M. Pancreas. 2001; 23 (201): 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These metabolic changes indicate that fermented wheat germ exerts its anti-proliferative action through altering metabolic enzyme activities, which primarily control glucose carbon flow toward nucleic acid synthesis.In vivo, Avemar has a marked inhibitory effect on metastasis formation in tumor-bearing animals (4Hidvégi M. Ráso E. Tömösközi-Farkas R. Paku S. Lapis K. Szende B. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2353-2358PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect is attributed to its immune-restorative properties (5Hidvegi M. Raso E. Tomoskozi-Farkas R. Lapis K. Szende B. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 41: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which result in a decreased survival time of skin grafts and reduced cell proliferation while enhancing apoptosis. Avemar remarkably inhibits tumor metastasis formation after chemotherapy and surgery in clinically advanced colorectal cancers. Patients receiving standard surgical and chemopreventive therapies for their advanced colorectal cancers developed significantly less new metastases during the 9-month follow-up period when treated with additional 9 g/day Avemar daily (6Jakab F.

It is well known that apoptosis is a well controlled process by a programmed set of cellular events partially mediated by caspases. A large number of substrates for caspases have been reported, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a 116-kDa nuclear DNA repair enzyme that is cleaved during apoptosis by caspases-3 and -7 (9Haridas V. Higuchi M. Jayatilake G.S. Bailey D. Mujoo K. Blake M.E. Arntzen C.J. Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Powerful and selective reversible and irreversible peptide-based inhibitors are also available to better characterize and understand the mechanism(s) of how caspases regulate apoptosis. The tripeptide benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.fmk) is a broadly used general caspase inhibitor that blocks apoptosis in many cell types, including human leukemic Jurkat T cells (10Inayat-Hussain S.H.

Our results confirm strong tumor growth inhibitory properties of Avemar and additionally reveal its cell cycle-regulating characteristics. Avemar decreases G6PDH and transketolase activities that are key enzymes involved in glucose conversion into the five-carbon nucleotide precursor ribose pool. Stable isotope studies indicate that Avemar is a powerful inhibitor of de novonucleic acid synthesis. This likely is the underlying mechanism of the anti-proliferative tumor growth-controlling and apoptosis-inducing potential of fermented wheat germ in leukemia tumor cells. On the contrary, Avemar has no toxic biological effects on PBLs in the doses that affect tumor cells in an adverse manner.RESULTSFor the present report, Jurkat lymphoid T- cell leukemia cells were treated with increasing amounts of Avemar for either 48 or 72 h in order to estimate the growth regulating effects of this natural anti-cancer nutritional supplement through cell cycle modulation, apoptosis induction, metabolic enzyme activity changes as well as substrate flow measurements. Avemar doses of 10 mg/ml (stock) and its serial dilutions were selected for the study because the effective oral dose of Avemar that inhibits tumor metastasis formation is 9.0 g/day, which is equivalent to an estimated plasma concentration of 0.5 and 1 mg/ml in an average (70 kg) weight patient (6Jakab F. Mayer Á. Hoffmann A. Hidvégi M. Hepatogastroenterology. 2000; 47: 393-395PubMed Google Scholar).Cytotoxic Effects of Avemar on Jurkat cellsAvemar induced a dose-dependent decrease in vital formazan dye accumulating cells after 72 h of treatment, ranging from 0 to 10 mg/ml (Fig.1 A). The mean IC50of Avemar was 0.23 ± 0.03 mg/ml. The cytotoxicity of Avemar on Jurkat cells was studied using a time course experiment. A significant increase in cell death by formazan exclusion was detected as early as 24 h with 1 mg/ml Avemar treatment (Fig. 1 B). The mean IC50 of vincristine as a positive control was 0.18 ± 0.02 nm. Avemar exhibited about 50-fold higher IC50 (10.02 mg/ml) for PBLs to induce biological responses.Cell CycleIn control cultures the cell cycle pattern remained constant over time; the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase: 40, 39, and 42%; S phase: 35, 39, and 34%; and G2/M phase: 25, 23, and 23% after 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 2). A complete alteration of the cell cycle patterns became evident as shown in Fig. 2 by the gray arrows after 48 and 72 h with 0.5 mg/ml or higher Avemar concentrations. At concentrations of 0.7 and 1 mg/ml Avemar, even after 24 h, a broad peak appeared in the sub-G1 region with a significant decrease in the S cycle phase. The sub-G1 region is indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 2, black arrows). Although lower concentrations of Avemar (0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml) induced only minor changes in the cell cycle distribution of Jurkat cells, they were still effective in controlling cell growth as there was a significant decrease in formazan-accumulating Jurkat cells as shown in Fig. 1 A.Figure 2Jurkat leukemia cell cycle changes in response to Avemar treatment. Jurkat cell cultures were treated with increasing doses of Avemar as indicated on the right column, and cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometry after PI staining expressed as percent of G0/G1, S, and G2-M cycle phases. The DNA histograms show that Avemar induced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the S cycle phase whereas there was a significant expansion of the G0/G1 cycle phase consistent with an increase in the number of apoptotic Jurkat cell figures. The typical FACS analysis showed the distinct signals and cell frequencies associated with the arrested cell cycle status as described under “Results” (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Induction of ApoptosisAvemar triggered prominent apoptosis at 0.5 mg/ml dose after 72 h of culturing as demonstrated by FACS analysis. Increasing doses of Avemar induced more prominent apoptosis, which also appeared earlier (Fig.3 A). In order to discriminate between late apoptotic and necrotic cells, we investigated PI and annexin V-FITC positive cells using LSC analyses. We observed that all cells with PI+/FITC+ characteristics presented pycnotic nuclei, which is a definite sign of apoptotic cell formation after treatment with 1 mg/ml Avemar (72 h). The portion of normal cell figures with LSC was only 5.5%, whereas early apoptotic cells showed 64.5% and late apoptotic cells 29.3% frequency (Fig.4). All Avemar-treated Jurkat cells inside the PI−/FITC+ region presented the typical green appearance of early apoptosis caused by the labeling of annexin V by FITC.Figure 3Jurkat leukemia cell apoptosis in response to Avemar treatment.

It can be depicted that Avemar induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in apoptosis in Jurkat cells in culture. Time dependence is clear at the 0.5 and 1 mg/ml dose treatments.

Jurkat cell cultures were treated with 1 mg/ml Avemar (72 h), and the formation of apoptotic and necrotic Jurkat cell figures was determined using PI and Annexin V-FITC staining. The majority (64.5%, right bottom quadrant) of Jurkat cells exhibited early apoptosis as indicated by the limited nuclear fragmentation. Late apoptosis/necrosis was present in about 30% (right upper quadrant) of Jurkat cells with advanced nuclear fragmentation and limited staining, while the frequency of normal cells dropped to 5.5% as seen in the left bottom quadrant of the LSC screen (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Involvement of Caspases in the Apoptotic Effect of AVEMARDecreased apoptosis-related phosphatidylserine externalization by specific caspase inhibitors is a routinely used method to reveal the presence of caspase cascades in the cell death process. In order to assess the involvement of caspases in the apoptotic effect of Avemar, we studied whether the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk could prevent Avemar-induced phosphatidylserine externalization. Jurkat cells incubated for 72 h with 1 mg/ml of Avemar in the presence or absence of 100 μm Z-VAD.fmk showed severely decreased phosphatidylserine externalization in both early (annexin V-FTIC+/PI−) and late (annexin V-FTIC+/PI+) apoptotic cells (Fig.3 B).We also investigated whether incubation of Jurkat cells with different doses of Avemar induced proteolytic cleavage of PARP, which is considered to be a hallmark of activation of caspase-3 like proteases during apoptosis (24Castaño E.

Incubation of Jurkat cells for 48 h with 0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mg/ml of Avemar induced prominent cleavage of PARP at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml or higher (Fig.3 C).Transketolase and G6PDH Enzyme ActivitiesG6PDH and transketolase are two key enzymes that regulate carbon flow in the pentose cycle because of their high substrate flux coefficients and thus regulate ribose synthesis and NADPH production for proliferating cells (24Castaño E. Dalmau M. Barragán M. Pueyo G. Bartrons R. Gil J. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Patel T. Gores G.J. Kaufmann S.H.

Avemar inhibited G6PDH activity at concentrations of 0.7 mg/ml and higher after 48 h of treatment, and G6PDH was completely inhibited after 72 h (Fig.5 A). Transketolase was significantly inhibited with 0.7 and 1 mg/ml Avemar after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Jurkat leukemia cell G6PDH (A) and transketolase (B) enzyme activities in response to 48 and 72 h of Avemar treatment.

Overall carbon flux in the pentose cycle relative to glycolysis showed a dose-dependent non-significant increase in Jurkat cells after 2 days of Avemar treatment after 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml treatments. At the dose of 1 mg/ml Avemar treatment the pentose cycle showed a rapid 22% decrease relative to glycolysis, as indicated by decreasedm1/m2 13C ratios in lactate (TableI).Table ILactate production of Jurkat cells in response to increasing doses of Avemar treatment after 48 h of cultureLactatem0m1m2m1/m2PCControl0.8090.0060.18490.03221.06%Avemar0.1 mg/ml0.82110.00620.17230.03591.18%0.5 mg/ml0.8560.00550.13860.03971.31%1 mg/ml0.93080.00170.06750.02520.83%Lactate isotopomers derive from [1,2-13C2]glucose based on glycolysis (m2) or direct glucose oxidation (m1).

Open table in a new tab 13C Label Accumulation in RNA RiboseIn order to estimate nucleic acid precursor synthesis measurements of the molar enrichment of RNA ribose with 13C from glucose was carried out because ribosomal and messenger RNAs are continuously synthesized in tumor cells regardless of their proliferative response, cell cycle alterations and apoptosis formation in response to anti-carcinogenic treatments. 13C incorporation from glucose into RNA ribose was significantly and dose-dependently decreased after increasing doses of Avemar treatment (Table II). Increasing doses of Avemar (0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/ml) decreased glucose carbon incorporation into nucleic acid synthesis by 6, 20.4, and 40.2%, respectively, after 48 h of incubation, which correlated well with the decrease in G6PDH and transketolase activities (Figs. 5 and 6).Table IIEffect of Avemar on RNA ribose synthesisRibosem0m1m2m3m4ΣmnControl0.55360.15290.22090.02890.04570.8675Avemar0.1 mg/ml0.57650.14240.21390.02540.04150.81410.5 mg/ml0.62750.13320.18440.02310.03150.69871 mg/ml0.93080.03240.11250.00970.00940.3482Ribose isotopomers obtained from the experiment with glucose label are shown as m0, m1, m2, m3, and m4, which represent unlabeled, 1, 2, 3, and 413C substitutions assembled by specific synthesis pathways for nucleic acid ribose synthesis.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONBecause of their beneficial nutritional values, wheat germ and wheat bran are frequently used in human food supplements, breakfast cereals, nutri-bars, and various fiber drink mixtures; therefore, they are part of the regular Western diet. Avemar is the first fermented and concentrated wheat germ extract produced by an optimized process to yield 0.4 mg/g (on dry matter basis) 2,6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone and given as a nutritional supplement for cancer patients. The suspicion that wheat germ contains powerful cancer-fighting chemicals is not new; in his later life, the Nobel laureate biochemist Albert Szent-Györgyi studied various extracts of the wheat plant extensively for their anti-carcinogenic effects.This study investigates the complex responses to Avemar treatment, a potent natural fermented wheat germ extract with anticarcinogenic properties, of Jurkat T-progeny leukemia cells in culture. Using flow and laser scanning cytometry techniques, direct enzyme activity measurements, carbon substrate flow measurements with a13C-labeled glucose tracer has enabled us to study a broad range of cellular response mechanisms, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and their dose-response to this cancer growth-modifying agent. Activity changes of four important metabolic enzymes involved in direct glucose oxidation (G6PDH), non-oxidative glucose utilization (transketolase) toward nucleic acid synthesis, glycolysis (LDH), and glucose activation (HK) are herein also reported. Our studies revealed profound differences and a dose-dependent response of Jurkat leukemia cells that directly affected metabolic enzyme activities, metabolic pathway substrate flow, apoptosis formation, and cell proliferation in response to Avemar. It has previously observed that G6PDH inhibition leads to an increase in apoptosis formation in tumor cells of various origins (26Suttle S. Stamato T. Perez M.L. Biaglow J. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,27Tian W.N. Braunstein L.D. Apse K. Pang J. Rose M. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1121-C1131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Avemar treatment according to our results is about 50× less effective in peripheral blood lymphocytes in inducing biological effects, which provides a comfortable therapeutic window for Avemar to apply in patients as a supplemental treatment modality with minimal or no toxic side effects.It has been proved that the flip-flop of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer plasma membrane leaflet of the cell is a fundamental characteristic that differentiates apoptosis from necrosis (28Van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaeekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). This early phenomenon during the apoptotic process is followed by caspase activation, which can specifically be inhibited and the fact that this inhibitor effectively inhibited Avemar-induced phosphatidylserine externalization demonstrated the involvement of caspases in mediating the biological apoptosis-inducing effects of Avemar. Furthermore, we detected a cleavage of PARP during Avemar-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, which more specifically points to the involvement of caspase-3 in the cascade that mediates wheat germ-induced apoptosis. Based on these molecular findings our data also indicate that the mechanism of how Avemar mitigates metastasis also involves decreasing cell motility.It has recently been demonstrated that Avemar induces profound metabolic changes in cultured MIA pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells using the [1,2-13C2]glucose isotope as the single tracer and biological gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. It was concluded that Avemar controls tumor propagation primarily through the regulation of glucose carbon redistribution between cell proliferation- and cell differentiation-related macromolecules in MIA cells (3Boros L.G. Lapis K. Szende B. Tömösközi-Farkas R. Balogh A. Boren J. Marin S. Cascante M. Hidvegi M. Pancreas. 2001; 23 (201): 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study we again applied stable isotope-based dynamic metabolic profiling as a model for measuring metabolic pathway control characteristics (29Cascante M. Boros L.G. Comin-Anduix B. de Atauri P. Centelles J.J. Lee P.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) by demonstrating a dose-dependent decrease in substrate carbon flow toward nucleic acid precursor ribose synthesis and metabolic enzyme activities (G6PDH, transketolase, HK, and LDH) in Jurkat leukemia cells treated with comparable doses of Avemar. Indeed, Jurkat cells also responded with decreased carbon flow through the pentose cycle toward nucleic acid synthesis and in this study the significant, dose-dependent decrease of G6PDH and transketolase are also demonstrated. It is likely that decreased oxidative ribose synthesis in response to Avemar treatment in Jurkat cells is not able to supply the tumor cells' metabolic needs for reducing equivalents, which would intensively be used for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides during DNA replication because Avemar inhibits key enzymes that are critically important both in nucleic acid ribose synthesis and fatty acid production. The reversion of transformed cell-specific metabolic changes that consist of increased glucose utilization for nucleic acid synthesis and proliferation (21Boros L.G. Cascante M. Paul Lee W.N. Drug Discovery Today. 2002; 7: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Cascante M. Boros L.G. Comin-Anduix B. de Atauri P. Centelles J.J. Lee P.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) has been shown to be an effective approach for developing new cancer therapies where natural products such as Avemar may play a key role as nutritional supplements with no know toxic effects.The specific cancer fighting constituents of Avemar are not yet known. It is likely that multiple naturally produced compounds contained in the crude powder of fermented wheat germ induce the complex metabolic- and apoptosis-inducing effects inhibiting multiple tyrosine phosphorylase signaling cascades and the down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) involved in immune protection, migration, tumor metastasis formation, and growth, as shown in other in vitro models of leukemia (30Fajka-Boja R.

Comparison of the anti-cancer metabolic effects of Avemar to that of the new effective anti-leukemia drug Gleevec reveals similarities in the metabolic enzyme and carbon substrate flow modifying effects toward nucleic acid synthesis. Gleevec inhibits glucose phosphorylation and oxidation in the oxidative branch of the pentose cycle, which is specific to inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL in myeloid tumor cells (31Boren J. Cascante M. Marin S. Comin-Anduix B. Centelles J.J. Lim S. Bassilian S. Ahmed S. Lee W.N. Boros L.G. J. Biol.

Avemar has additional multiple effects on metabolic enzymes, and it simultaneously inhibits oxidative and nonoxidative ribose synthesis as well as the activation of glucose and glycolysis. Individual components of fermented wheat germ may be important anticancer natural drugs both as nutritional supplements and as therapeutic agents after they have been isolated and identified.In conclusion, Avemar is a natural fermented wheat germ extract with no known toxicities, and it is a strong regulator of leukemia tumor ce"

This tightly regulated, complex pathway is a key regulator of many important signaling pathways and has an important role in many cellular processes including apoptosis, and recent studies have identified many apoptosis regulatory proteins as targets for ubiquitination (7Palaga T.

In addition to being targets for degradation, some apoptosis regulatory proteins have a more active role and act as components of the ubiquitin cascade via the ubiquitin ligase activity ascribed to the RING finger domains that is part of their primary structure. Targeting proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway involves the covalent linkage of ubiquitin either to the amino terminus or specific lysine residues in the target protein through the action of three enzymes. In this process ubiquitin is first activated by an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and then ligated to the target protein by an E3 ubiquitin ligase (4Ciechanover A.

Although some of the regulatory features that directly control the catalytic activities of DAPK have been described, including the activation by calcium/calmodulin (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Google Scholar), an understanding of how the cellular activities of DAPK are regulated in vivo is poorly understood. The presence of protein-protein interaction domains within the primary structure of DAPK, including its ankyrin repeat motifs and death domain, suggests that additional interactions between DAPK and other cellular proteins will also be important for regulation of DAPK activities. In this study, we describe a new DAPK-interacting protein called DIP-1 (DAPK-interactingprotein-1), which has a direct role in regulating the cellular levels of DAPK. DIP-1 regulates the cellular levels of DAPK through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is shown to promote ubiquitination of DAPK in vitro and in vivo. The results of these studies describe a new mechanism by which the activities of the apoptosis regulator DAPK can be modulated. A mouse 11-day embryo cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using a pAS2–1 plasmid containing either the kinase domain (residues 1–280), ankyrin repeats (residues 372–627), death domain/carboxyl-terminal “tail” (residues 1216–1442), or the region between the ankyrin repeats and death domain (residues 628–1215) for expression as “bait” to clone proteins that interact with DAPK in a yeast-two-hybrid screen. The cDNA library (pGAD10) and pAS2–1 DAPK were simultaneously transformed into Y190 yeast using the manufacturer's protocols (Clontech). Selection was performed, β-galactosidase-positive colonies were identified, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the yeast. The cDNA insert of one of the positive clones encoding the carboxyl-terminal region of DIP-1 (bp 2155–4351) was amplified and sequenced (Seqwright; Houston, TX). A full-length cDNA having a predicted open reading frame between bp 680 and 3700 was identified by screening a λ gt11 mouse bladder library. Domains within the open reading frame were identified using SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool; smart.embl-heidelberg.de) (20Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Google Scholar, 21Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA was subcloned into p3XFlagCMV10 (Sigma) or pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) vectors such that the 110-kDa DIP-1 protein was fused in-frame to the 3XFLAG epitope (FL-DIP-1) or GFP (GFP-DIP-1) at its amino terminus. Similar constructs were made to express residues 815–998 encompassing the three RING fingers (FL-RING1–3 or GFP-RING1–3). Each construct was verified by Western blotting of COS cell lysates after transient expression using either anti-DIP-1 affinity-purified antibody or an appropriate antibody to detect the fusion protein. An affinity purified, rabbit polyclonal sera against DIP-1 (residues 493–1006) was generated using standard methodology (Sigma-Genosys). Two monoclonal anti-human DAPK (clone 17 from Sigma and clone 55 from BD Biosciences) were used at dilutions of 1:250 and 1:10,000, respectively, and gave similar results. The anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:1,000, anti-T7 antibody (Novagen) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000, and anti-GST antibody (Sigma) used at a dilution of 1:2,000. Antibodies against poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, ubiquitin, and cytochrome c were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). RNA was prepared from mouse tissues and cell lines using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion). For Northern blotting, 20 μg of total RNA per lane was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to a32P-labeled antisense DIP-1 riboprobe (cRNA) corresponding to bp 3123–3674. The blot was washed and exposed to X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen for 1 week. Western blotting was performed as described previously (22Gallagher P.J. Jin Y. Killough G. Blue E.K. Lindner V. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 1078-1087Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts were prepared from cells or tissues by homogenization in a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 6 μg/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 6 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 mm PefablocSC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg/ml (4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF). Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates were fractionated by electrophoresis through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoreactive proteins on Western blots were visualized using the Supersignal West Dura or West Pico detection systems (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions after incubation with appropriate anti-DIP-1 or FLAG antibodies. All transient transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacture's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Stable HeLa cell lines expressing doxycycline-inducible DIP-1 or RING1–3 were established by selection with Zeocin of HeLa-tet cells transfected with FLAG-tagged DIP-1 or RING1–3 cloned into pCDNA4TO vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (DAPK paper). For all experiments, HeLa-tet parental cells and HeLa cells expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 were treated with doxycycline (2 μg/ml) for 24 h for stable expression of the transgene. Because all experimental results obtained with HeLa-DIP-1 and HeLa-RING1–3 in the basal, uninduced state were indistinguishable from the HeLa parental cell line (either in the presence or absence of tet), they are not included in the figures. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using standard protocols where cellular lysates were clarified by centrifugation and pre-cleared using protein A-Sepharose beads. The indicated proteins were immunoprecipitated by the addition of protein A beads pre-complexed with appropriate antisera. The immune complexes bound to protein A beads were washed in wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3 and then resuspended in protein gel sample buffer. Apoptotic cell death was determined by DNA fragmentation analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). For these experiments, the indicated HeLa cell lines were transiently transfected with vectors encoding GFP-actin, GFP-DIP-1, or GFP-RING1–3. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were enzymatically detached, fixed in 5% acetic acid, 95% ethanol at −20 °C for 2 h, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) (23Esser C. Gottlinger C. Kremer J. Hundeiker C. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 382-386Google Scholar). For transient analysis, cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding DIP-1, RING1–3, or empty vector (pCDNA4TO; control) together with vector encoding GFP-actin (Clontech) at a ratio of 5:1. Expression of the exogenous transgenes was confirmed by Western blotting. A BD Biosciences FACStar plus was used to identify GFP-positive cells and simultaneously analyze their DNA content. A minimum of 50,000 cells was counted for each analysis. Where indicated, cell death was determined by enumerating the numbers of viable, trypan blue-excluding cells as described previously (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). The % cell death was calculated using the formula 1 − (the number of viable cells)/(number of viable cells in control) × 100. Measurements of caspase activity were performed as described previously (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cell lines expressing DIP-1, RING1–3, or parental cells were lysed with CHAPS lysis buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After centrifugation, equal amounts of total cellular proteins were incubated at 37 °C, and the assay was initiated by the addition of either 200 μmAc-IETD-p-nitroanilide (caspase-8), 200 μmAc-DEVD-p-nitroanilide (caspase-3), or 200 μmAc-LEHD-p-nitroanilide (caspase-9). Change in absorbance at 405 nm over time was monitored by spectrophotometry and caspase activities (pmol/min/mg of total protein) were calculated after subtraction of background using pure p-nitroaniline for calibration of the standard A 405 curve. For every cell sample, the background was determined by adding the caspase specific inhibitors, Ac-IETD-CHO (caspase-8), Ac-DEVD-CHO (caspase-3), or Ac-LEHD-CHO (caspase-9) as the negative control. Constructs for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial expression of GST-tagged DIP-1 fusion proteins were obtained by PCR amplification and subcloning of DIP-1 sequences corresponding to residues 493–1006 (GST-DIP-1 493–1006) or the three RING fingers (residues 815–998, GST-DIP-1-RING1–3) into pGEX-4T-2 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). Verification of the sequences was achieved by DNA automated sequencing. For GST fusion proteins, bacterial cells were lysed by sonication at 4 °C in PBS binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After centrifugation, GST fusion proteins were purified from the cell lysate using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) assay (Amersham Biosciences) was used to quantify the relative amounts of the isolated GST fusion proteins. Ubiquitination assays were modified from those previously described (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Google Scholar). Briefly, the reactions contain bacterial-expressed ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1, 250 nm), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2; Ubc5a; 2 μm), His-ubiquitin (0.6 mm), and ATP (2 mm). Identical results were obtained using commercially available ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1; Calbiochem) or GST-tagged ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a (E2; Calbiochem) and amino-terminal His-tagged ubiquitin (Sigma). Where indicated, DIP-1 or RING1–3 (1 μg), DAPK immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lines or DAPK fragments purified from bacteria (1–5 μg) were added to the reactions. After incubation at room temperature, the reactions were analyzed by Western blotting to detect the ubiquitinated proteins. Vectors for expression of E1 (250 nm) and E2 (Ubc4 or Ubc5a; 2 μm) were kindly provided by Dr. Tony Hunter (Salk Research Institute) and have been described before (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Google Scholar). Vectors for expression of hemagglutinin or His-tagged ubiquitin were provided by Dirk Bohmann (University of Rochester) and have been described before (25Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Google Scholar). For some assays, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1A) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc5a) (Calbiochem) and His-ubiquitin (Sigma) were used. To confirm our prediction that DAPK associates in vivo with other cellular proteins, DAPK was immunoprecipitated under non-denaturing conditions from COS cells cultured in the presence of35S-labeled methionine and cysteine. Several proteins were found to co-immunoprecipitate with DAPK whose molecular masses range in size from ∼40 to 240 kDa. This result suggested that DAPK might exist in cells as a large multi-protein complex (Fig.1 A). To identify these proteins, the entire cDNA encoding DAPK was divided into regions that encompassed the kinase domain, ankyrin repeats, death domain/“tail,” or the region between the ankyrin repeats and death domain, and each of these four regions was subcloned into pAS-2-1 to be expressed as bait in a yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen. One of the positive clones, encoding a 110-kDa protein now called DAPKinteracting protein-1 (DIP-1), identified by interaction with the ankyrin repeats in DAPK, has been cloned, expressed, and characterized. The sequence of the predicted open reading frame from a 3.8-kilobase cDNA clone encoding DIP-1 that was obtained by screening a mouse bladder library is shown in Fig.1 B. The sequence of DIP-1 includes several motifs that were identified using SMART (simple modular architecture research tool) (Fig. 1 C) (26Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Google Scholar, 27Ponting C.P. Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 229-232Google Scholar). These motifs include a zinc finger (ZnF; residues 79–124), 9 ankyrin repeats (ANK; residues 430–729), three RING fingers (RING1, 819–853; RING2, 866–900; RING3, 963–995), and an α-helical coiled-coil located between RING2 and RING3 (COIL; residues 934–962). Data base searches for similar protein motifs suggested that the RING fingers present in DIP-1 had the highest similarity to those present in several apoptosis regulators including IAP-1, IAP-2, XIAP, and LIVIN (Fig. 1 D). To detect expression of DIP-1, an antibody (anti-DIP-1) was produced in rabbits and affinity-purified. Anti-DIP-1 antibody detects a protein with a mass of ∼110 kDa that co-migrates with the expressed recombinant DIP-1 protein in all of the embryonic and adult tissues and cell lines examined (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with this finding, Northern blot analysis of mRNA prepared from these same tissues and cells reveals the presence of a 4-kilobase mRNA that hybridizes to a cRNA probe corresponding to bp 3370–3920 of the DIP-1 cDNA. To confirm that DAPK and DIP-1 are associated in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Fig.3 shows that DIP-1 could be detected by Western blotting of DAPK immunoprecipitates. In the reverse immunoprecipitation, DAPK was detectable by Western blotting of DIP-1 immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells. To investigate the functional role of DIP-1 in cells undergoing TNF-induced apoptosis, tetracycline-inducible HeLa cell lines expressing full-length DIP-1 or the carboxyl-terminal region of DIP-1 that encompasses all three RING fingers (residues 815–998; RING1–3) were generated and characterized as described previously (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). Overexpression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 enhanced the sensitivity of HeLa cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (Fig.4 A). In these experiments the dose-response curve of the cell lines expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 is left-shifted, consistent with the enhanced sensitivity of these cell lines to TNF, and the TNF dose at which 50% apoptosis occurs decreased from 15 ng/ml to less than 1 ng/ml. Paralleling the enhanced sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis, the levels of apoptotic cell death increased from 44% for the parental cells to 77 and 82% for the cells overexpressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the caspase-dependent cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase is accelerated in HeLa cell lines expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 (Fig. 4 C) and becomes detectable within 3 h compared with 5 h in the TNF-treated parental HeLa cells. Transient expression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 in HeLa cell lines expressing DAPK-α, DAPK-β, or the parental HeLa cells revealed that either protein could effectively antagonize the anti-apoptotic activities of DAPK (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). For these experiments plasmids encoding GFP fusion proteins (GFP-DIP-1, GFP-RING1–3, or GFP-actin) were transfected into the parental HeLa cell line or HeLa cell lines with tetracycline-inducible expression of DAPK-α or DAPK-β (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the results of fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of propidium iodide-stained DNA in GFP-positive cells after treatment with TNF (10 ng/ml) and cyclohexamide (10 μg/ml) for 4 h. This analysis revealed that transient expression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 significantly increased the appearance of parental HeLa cells having fragmented, sub-G1 (gated population in Fig. 5) DNA from 35 to 55%. Significantly, overexpression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 in HeLa cells overexpressing the more potent anti-apoptotic form of DAPK, DAPK-β (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar), increased the population of cells that had apoptotic, fragmented DNA from 14 to 30%, a level similar to that found in the parental HeLa cells overexpressing only GFP-actin (35%). This suggests that overexpressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 can abolish the anti-apoptotic effect of DAPK. Consistent with our previous findings that expression of DAPK-α, the murine equivalent of human DAPK, neither promotes or reduces apoptosis, transient expression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 in HeLa-DAPK-α cells promotes apoptosis to levels similar to those found in the parental HeLa cells. Because expression of DAPK-β strongly reduces TNF-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria in HeLa cells (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar), we examined the levels of cytochrome cin post-mitochondrial, cytosolic fractions of HeLa cell lines expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3 and found that TNF treatment of these cell lines resulted in enhanced release of cytochrome c (Fig.5 B). Additional support for a pro-apoptotic function of DIP-1 comes from the direct determination of caspase activity in cell lysates of HeLa cell lines expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3. Using caspase-specific colorimetric peptides, the activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were determined. A statistically significant increase in both caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities was found. The levels of caspase-3 activity increased 1.5- and 1.6-fold, and the levels of caspase-9 activity increased 1.5- and 2.1-fold after 4 h of TNF treatment in cells expressing DIP-1 or RING1–3, respectively, over parental cells, whereas overexpression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 had no effect on TNF-induced caspase-8 activation. Previous studies show that the RING fingers present in proteins such as IAP-1, IAP-2, and XIAP can function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Google Scholar, 28Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Google Scholar, 29Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Google Scholar, 30Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Google Scholar). The finding that the carboxyl terminus of DIP-1 contains three similar RING finger motifs led us to examine the possibility that the RING fingers in DIP-1 function as E3 ligases. For these in vitro ubiquitination assays (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Google Scholar), purified ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc5a), His-ubiquitin, and ATP were added to affinity-purified GST or GST-RING1–3 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation, the reactions were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting to detect ubiquitinated proteins using anti-His antibody. Fig. 6 shows that the higher molecular mass RING1–3 protein is detectable only after incubation in the presence of His-ubiquitin but does not occur in reactions containing GST fusion protein alone, suggesting that RING1–3 can act as an E3 ligase in vitro and undergo autoubiquitination. To determine whether DIP-1 or RING1–3 is foundin vivo as the ubiquitinated protein, HeLa cells expressing stable levels of these proteins were transfected with a plasmid encoding His-ubiquitin. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h before lysis. Talon affinity purification was used to fractionate His-ubiquitin-tagged proteins. Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody was used to detect the FLAG-tagged RING1–3 (FL-RING1–3) or DIP-1 (FL-DIP-1). The detection of higher mass species of RING1–3 or DIP-1 only in the presence of His-tagged ubiquitin suggests that both DIP-1 and RING1–3 are ubiquitinated in cells. The finding that the RING fingers at the carboxyl terminus of DIP-1 can function as an E-3 ligase in vitro and antagonize the anti-apoptotic effects of DAPK-β in TNF-induced apoptosis lead us to consider whether DAPK is a target for ubiquitination by its binding protein, DIP-1. We first determined if DAPK could be ubiquitinated by DIP-1 in an in vitro ubiquitination assay. For these experiments, DAPK was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells using anti-OMNI-tag antibody to immunoprecipitate recombinant DAPK. A control immunoprecipitation using protein A-Sepharose complexed with non-immune IgG was performed in parallel. The washed immune complexes were added to an in vitro ubiquitination reaction in the presence or absence of recombinant DIP-1-(492–1006) purified from bacteria as indicated in Fig. 7 A. After incubation for 90 min, the immune complexes were washed to remove unconjugated ubiquitin and then analyzed by Western blotting. Inspection of these Western blots revealed that the majority of the immunoreactive DAPK appears to migrate in a position that potentially corresponds to mono-ubiquitinated DAPK (mass increase of ∼8–10 kDa). However, a higher molecular mass “smear” of immunoreactive DAPK is also detectable representing polyubiquitinated DAPK (Fig.7 B, Ub n-DAPK). The blots were probed with anti-DAPK (not shown) and anti-OMNI tag antibodies to detect DAPK with similar results. In addition, similar results were obtained either with DAPK-α or DAPK-β. A second experimental approach used DIP-1-depleted HeLa cell lysates as a source of ubiquitin-activating E1 and ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes. To these DIP-1-depleted lysates, exogenous ubiquitin, ATP, and, where indicated, a purified fragment of DIP-1, residues 492–1006, were added (Fig. 7 B). After incubation the ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-ubiquitin antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting to detect endogenous DAPK. These results show that polyubiquitinated DAPK is detectable only when DIP-1-(492–1006) is added to the DIP-1-depleted lysate. To show that DAPK is an in vivo substrate for ubiquitination by DIP-1, HeLa cells were co-transfected with vectors for expression of hemagglutinin-ubiquitin and either FL-DIP-1 or FL-RING1–3. At 24 h, ubiquitinated proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-ubiquitin antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-DAPK antibody to detect the endogenous DAPK. The results of this experiment show that increasing the expression of DIP-1 or RING1–3 results in a parallel increase in the relative level of polyubiquitinated DAPK (Fig. 7 C). Evidence showing that the cellular levels of DAPK are regulated by ubiquitin proteasome degradation was obtained by examining the expression levels of the endogenous DAPK in HeLa, HeLa-DIP-1, or HeLa-RING1–3 cell lines transiently expressing exogenous ubiquitin. The Western blot shown in Fig. 7 D revealed either a modest or large decrease, respectively, in DAPK in HeLa cell lines expressing either DIP-1 or RING1–3. The greater decrease in expression of DAPK in HeLa-RING1–3 cells transfected with ubiquitin is likely to be due to the higher level of overexpression of RING1–3 compared with DIP-1, which is shown in the second panel in Fig. 7 D. Control experiments using the HeLa-DIP or HeLa-RING1–3 cell lines in the uninduced configuration did not reveal any significant differences in the relative expression levels of DAPK. Consistent with our previous suggestion that DAPK is an anti-apoptotic factor, we also observed in HeLa-RING1–3 cells transfected with ubiquitin that the decreased expression of endogenous DAPK correlated with enhanced poly-ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage (Fig. 7 D, third panel) and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis including condensed chromatin and membrane blebbing (data not shown). The high conservation of the complex primary structure of DAPK and the presence of several protein-protein interaction motifs including several ankyrin repeat motifs and a death domain suggested that in addition to substrate binding and activation by calcium/calmodulin, this Ser/Thr kinase might be associated with other cellular proteins. A yeast two-hybrid interaction screen has identified a new protein called DIP-1, which binds to the ankyrin repeat region of DAPK, and co-immunoprecipitation studies have confirmed that DIP-1 and DAPK are associated in cells. Although understanding the structural components and the regulation of DAPK and DIP-1 interactions will be critical to understanding their collaborative function in apoptosis regulation, the similarity between the RING fingers in DIP-1 and those present in IAP-1 and IAP-2 led us to focus on examining the functional properties of the carboxyl-terminal region containing these motifs in DIP-1. The primary sequence of DIP-1 has several interesting structural motifs including a B-box-type zinc finger, a series of nine ankyrin repeats, and a carboxyl-terminal region that contains three putative RING finger domains with an α-helical coiled-coil structure that separates RING2 from RING3. Classical RING finger domains are defined by a specific pattern of cysteine and histidine residues that are involved in the binding of zinc, which is important for the folding of the domain and its activities. Many RING domain proteins also have B-box zinc fingers and coiled-coil motifs arranged in a conserved order, and these motifs may function as additional sites of protein interactions (31Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Google Scholar, 32Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that collectively these motifs function as a molecular scaffold to mediate the organization of large protein signaling complexes, and the identification of DIP-1 as a component of proteins that are associated in a complex with DAPK supports this proposal. One specific function that has been ascribed to the RING finger domain is its ability to act as an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (11Wojcik C. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2002; 6: 25-48Google Scholar, 24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Google Scholar, 29Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Google Scholar, 33Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 84-87Google Scholar, 34Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Google Scholar, 35MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have determined that DIP-1 can autoubiquitinate in vitro in the presence of ubiquitin-activating E1 and ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes, suggesting that DIP-1 is a member of the “single subunit” class of RING domain E3 ligase (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Google Scholar). Although we do not know if the autoubiquitination is inter- or intramolecular, the demonstration that DIP-1 is found as a polyubiquitinated protein in vivosuggests this may serve as mechanism to down-regulate DIP-1 expression. The determination that DAPK is also found in vivo as a polyubiquitinated protein also suggests that cellular levels of DAPK are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; the association of DIP-1 with DAPK provided the basis for proposing that DAPK is a target for DIP-1-mediated ubiquitination, and four experimental approaches were utilized to confirm this proposal. First, an in vitroubiquitination assay using purified RING1–3 as an E3 ligase in the presence of purified E1 and E2 showed that DAPK can be polyubiquitinated by DIP-1. An add-back experiment using purified DIP-1-(492–1006) to supplement DIP-1-immunodepleted cell lysates restored the appearance of polyubiquitinated DAPK. Western blotting to examine the in vivo ubiquitination levels of DAPK in cell lines that overexpress either DIP-1 or RING1–3 showed enhanced ubiquitination of DAPK in these cells compared with the parental HeLa cells. Finally, the endogenous levels of DAPK are diminished significantly in HeLa cell lines overexpressing DIP-1 or RING1–3, suggesting that the endogenous levels of DAPK may be regulated by DIP. Together these findings support the proposal that the apoptosis regulatory protein kinase DAPK is a target for ubiquitination and proteasome degradation by the E3 ligase activity of one of its binding proteins, DIP-1. Although additional work will be needed to determine whether DIP-1 has other ubiquitination targets, the ability of DIP-1 to deplete cellular levels of DAPK by targeting it for proteasomal degradation suggests a mechanism by which DIP-1 could antagonize the anti-apoptotic effects of DAPK to promote TNF-induced apoptosis. Paralleling our previous findings with DAPK (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar), we also find that DIP-1 enhances caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities while having little effect on TNF-induced caspase-8 activity. These results suggest that both DAPK and DIP-1 act downstream of caspase-8 and before the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria. Because previous studies suggest that human DAPK-α promotes apoptosis or autophagy in variety of cell types (13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar, 14Cohen O. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 6-15Google Scholar, 36Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Google Scholar), it is still unclear as to why our results consistently show that expression of mouse DAPK-α has no effect and DAPK-β is a strong anti-apoptotic factor for TNF-induced apoptosis in several cell lines. In summary, these studies have identified a novel RING finger protein, which has been named DIP-1 (DAPK interactingprotein). DIP-1 has intrinsic E3 ligase activity and can self-ubiquitinate in vitro. In vivo, DIP-1 can be detected as a polyubiquitinated protein, suggesting that the intracellular levels of DIP-1 are regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The determination that DAPK is an in vitro as well as in vivo target for ubiquitination by DIP-1 provides a mechanism by which DAPK activities may be regulated through proteasomal degradation. Finally, we show that expression of DIP-1 can antagonize the anti-apoptotic activity of DAPK to promote a caspase-dependent apoptosis. This result is consistent with our previous determination that DAPK is an important anti-apoptotic survival factor in cells (17Jin Y. Blue E.K. Dixon S. Hou L. Wysolmerski R.B. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39667-39678Google Scholar). We thank Paul Herring for helpful comments during the preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1989168385,"Recent studies have revealed that the calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin mediates the effects of intracellular calcium in many different cell types. In this study we investigated the role of calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. We found that the specific calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506 overcame the antiadipogenic effect of calcium ionophore on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This finding suggests that calcineurin is responsible for mediating the previously documented Ca2+-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis. We further demonstrate that the expression of a constitutively active calcineurin mutant potently inhibits the ability of 3T3-L1 cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation by preventing expression of the proadipogenic transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα). This calcineurin-mediated block in adipocyte differentiation is rescued by ectopic expression of PPARγ1. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin activity with either FK506 or a specific calcineurin inhibitory peptide enhances differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in response to suboptimal adipogenic stimuli, suggesting that endogenous calcineurin activity normally sets a signaling threshold that antagonizes efficient adipocyte differentiation. Collectively, these data indicate that calcineurin acts as a Ca2+-dependent molecular switch that negatively regulates commitment to adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression of critical proadipogenic transcription factors.

Collectively, these data indicate that calcineurin acts as a Ca2+-dependent molecular switch that negatively regulates commitment to adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression of critical proadipogenic transcription factors. Adipocytes are highly specialized cells that play a key role in energy homeostasis by regulating the storage and release of energy in response to changing nutritional needs (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). In addition to their role in energy balance, adipocytes also perform important endocrine functions by secreting a variety of factors that regulate such processes as food intake, insulin responsiveness, reproduction, vascular remodeling, and the immune response (2Fruhbeck G. Gomez-Ambrosi J. Muruzabal F.J. Burrell M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2001; 280: E827-E847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although adipocytes clearly play an important physiological role, the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue can result in obesity, which is known to be a significant risk factor for a number of other disease states including insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes, hypertensions, cardiovascular disease and cancer (3Visscher T.L. Seidell J.C. Annu. Rev. Public Health. 2001; 22: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Obesity can arise from either an increase in individual adipocyte cell size or from an increase in total adipocyte cell number as a result of increased de novoadipocyte differentiation (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of adipocyte growth and differentiation are of considerable scientific interest and have been the subject of much investigation (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Considerable progress in our understanding of adipocyte biology has come from the study of the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (6Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), which under the appropriate in vitro culture conditions can be efficiently induced to undergo terminal differentiation into morphologically distinct, triglyceride-laden, mature adipocytes. Adipocyte differentiation is induced in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by treatment of confluent, growth-arrested cells with the adipogenic hormones methylisobutylxanthine (Mix), 1The abbreviations used are: Mix, methylisobutylxanthine; Dex, dexamethasone; MDI, methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone and insulin; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; CsA, cyclosporin A; CNmut, constitutively activated calcineurin mutant; MSCV, murine stem cell virus; IRES, internal ribosomal entry sequence; pEGFP, permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein; Ab, antibody; LTR, long terminal repeat dexamethasone (Dex), and insulin, collectively known as MDI. A large body of accumulated data has revealed that this process of adipocyte differentiation proceeds via a highly orchestrated and coordinated cascade of transcription factors, including members of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

MDI-treated, growth-arrested 3T3-L1 preadipocytes synchronously enter the cell cycle and initially express the early transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (7Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ then elicit the expression of the proadipogenic transcription factor PPARγ (7Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn induces the expression of C/EBPα (9Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Together, PPARγ and C/EBPα then are believed to play a dual role in adipogenesis by first inducing withdrawal from the cell cycle and then directing the expression of adipocyte-specific genes that ultimately result in the acquisition of the mature adipocyte cell fate (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar, 11Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D.

Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This process of adipocyte differentiation is influenced by a variety of different extrinsic factors and intracellular signaling pathways (4Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar,14MacDougald O.A. Mandrup S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to the current study are the effects of intracellular calcium on adipocyte differentiation. A number of reports have demonstrated that increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) during the early phase of human and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation act to potently inhibit adipogenesis (15Ntambi J.M. Takova T. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar, 16Miller C.W. Casimir D.A. Ntambi J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5641-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17Shi H. Halvorsen Y.D. Ellis P.N. Wilkison W.O. Zemel M.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the effects of calcium on this process may be complex, because increases in [Ca2+]i in human preadipocytes during the later stages of differentiation and in Ob1774 cells appear to enhance the expression of certain markers of mature adipocytes (17Shi H. Halvorsen Y.D. Ellis P.N. Wilkison W.O. Zemel M.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Gaillard D. Negrel R. Lagarde M. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Vassaux G. Gaillard D. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11092-11097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the molecular mechanism that underlies the inhibitory effect of early increases in [Ca2+]i on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, is known to be a critical downstream effector of the calcium signal in a wide variety of different cell types (20Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We present evidence to demonstrate that calcineurin mediates the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin activity in 3T3-L1 cells enhances the efficiency of adipogenesis in response to suboptimal adipogenic stimuli. On the basis of our results, we propose that commitment to the terminal phase of adipocyte differentiation is likely to be regulated by the level of calcineurin activity in preadipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC) were cultured in a growth medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). To induce adipocyte differentiation, cells were grown until 2 days postconfluence (day 0) and then treated for 2 days with growth medium plus MDI (0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μmdexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin, all from Sigma). The cells were re-fed with growth medium that contained 10 μg/ml insulin at day 2 and every 2 days thereafter with growth medium alone. After 10 days, cells were fixed with formalin and stained with the lipophilic dye Oil Red O (Sigma). Stained cells were either photographed or counterstained with Giemsa and visualized by bright field microscopy. Where indicated, cells were treated additionally with 2 μm ionomycin, 5 ng/ml FK506, 1 μg/ml CsA (all from Calbiochem), or vehicle control (ethanol). The retroviral expression vector pMSCV-CNmut was generated by insertion of aXhoI-EcoRI fragment that contained the previously described CNmut (21Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) into pMSCV-GFP downstream of the viral long terminal repeat and upstream of the IRES-GFP cassette. The pMSCV-H2K retroviral expression vector was created by replacing GFP in the pMSCV-GFP retroviral expression vector with a PCR-amplified truncated murine major histocompatibility class I H-2KkcDNA from pMACS Kk.II (Miltenyi Biotec). pMSCV-PPARγ1 was created by introducing the full-length, cDNA-encoding murine PPARγ1 (a gift from J. Reddy, Northwestern University) into pMSCV-H2K. pMSCV-VIVIT-GFP was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide that encoded a previously described (22Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) calcineurin-inhibitory peptide (MAGPHPVIVITGPHEE) into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech)and then introducing the resulting VIVIT-GFP fusion sequence into pMSCV-H2K. Retroviral expression vectors were cotransfected with pVSV-G (Clontech) into the GP293 pantropic packaging cell line (Clontech) by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The medium was replaced after 24 h, and viral supernatants were harvested at 2 days post-transfection and stored at −80 °C. For infections, 5 × 1043T3-L1 cells were plated per well of a 6-well plate. The next day, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of viral supernatant that contained 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and plates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 1.5 h at room temperature. After removal of the viral supernatant, cells were expanded in growth medium for subsequent analysis. For double infections, previously infected cells were replated after 3 days and infected with the second virus as described previously. On day 3 after infection, cells were analyzed for GFP fluorescence or were stained additionally with a phycoerythrin-coupled anti-mouse H-2Kk Ab (36-7-5; BD Biosciences). 10,000 events were analyzed using a FACSCaliber flow cytometer and CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Protein extracts prepared from cells harvested at the indicated times postdifferentiation were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the relevant Ab. All Abs (PPARγ (H-100), C/EBPα (14AA), C/EBPβ (H-7), and C/EBPδ (C-22)) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from cells by using Trizol (Invitrogen) on the indicated day after differentiation was induced. RNA samples (10 μg) were separated by using 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-N membrane (AmershamBiosciences). Immobilized RNA was hybridized with a32P-radiolabeled murine aP2 probe cDNA probe (ATCC) and visualized by exposure to Kodak X-AR film. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe as a control. To investigate the role of calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, we first examined whether the specific calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and CsA were able to attenuate the previously reported inhibitory effect of calcium ionophore on the differentiation of the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (15Ntambi J.M. Takova T. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, 2-day postconfluent plates of 3T3-L1 cells that were treated with MDI efficiently differentiated into morphologically distinct, fat-laden adipocytes with accumulated cytoplasmic triglycerides that stained red with Oil Red O. Notably, the presence of either FK506 or CsA did not affect the ability of MDI to induce 3T3-L1 cells to undergo adipocyte differentiation. This fact indicates that calcineurin is not required for MDI-induced adipocyte differentiation, as was originally proposed by Ho et al.(23Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous report (15Ntambi J.M. Takova T. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin potently blocked their differentiation. Significantly, we found that this inhibitory effect of calcium ionophore was abrogated in the presence of either FK506 or CsA (Fig. 1). These data therefore indicate that calcineurin activity is required to mediate the inhibitory effects of calcium ionophore on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes and suggest that calcineurin is likely to negatively regulate adipocyte differentiation. To further investigate the effects of calcineurin on adipogenesis, we used an efficient retroviral gene delivery system to introduce a previously characterized (21Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) calcium-independent, constitutively active calcineurin mutant (CNmut) into 3T3-L1 cells. The cDNA that encoded CNmut was introduced into the MSCV-GFP retroviral vector under the control of the MSCV promoter and upstream of an IRES-GFP expression cassette, thereby allowing the expression of both CNmut and GFP from a single bicistronic mRNA (Fig.2 A). Using these vectors, we were routinely able to generate a high-titer retrovirus capable of stably infecting >95% of 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 C, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes infected with the control MSCV-GFP retrovirus and treated with MDI efficiently differentiated into mature Oil Red O-staining adipocytes. In contrast, we found that cells infected with the MSCV-CNmut retrovirus and stimulated with MDI failed to undergo the characteristic morphological changes associated with adipocyte differentiation and did not stain red with Oil Red O. As expected, we were able to rescue adipogenesis in these CNmut-expressing cells by treatment with FK506 (data not shown). To confirm the inhibitory effect of CNmut on adipocyte differentiation, we next examined the time course of expression of the late adipocyte-specific marker gene, aP2. As shown in Fig. 2 D, expression of aP2 mRNA was readily detectable in control MSCV-GFP-infected cells after treatment with MDI, whereas this transcript was not detectable in MDI-induced CNmut-expressing cells. Taken together, these results indicate that sustained calcineurin activity in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibits adipocyte differentiation. The transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα are known to be both necessary and sufficient for adipocyte differentiation (10Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar, 11Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 24Lin F.T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,25Rosen E.D. Sarraf P. Troy A.E. Bradwin G. Moore K. Milstone D.S. Spiegelman B.M. Mortensen R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanism that underlies the inhibitory effect of calcineurin on adipocyte differentiation, we next examined the effects of CNmut on the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Thus, cell extracts prepared from 3T3-L1 cells infected with either MSCV-GFP or MSCV-CNmut that had been induced to undergo adipocyte differentiation by treatment with MDI were analyzed for expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα was readily detectable in cells infected with MSCV-GFP. In contrast, we did not observe any appreciable expression of either PPARγ or C/EBPα in CNmut-expressing cells (Fig.3 A). Thus, calcineurin activity appears to inhibit adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression of the proadipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. The expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα is thought to be regulated during adipocyte differentiation by the transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (7Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether calcineurin activity blocks the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα by interfering with the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. As shown in Fig. 3 B, exposure of MSCV-GFP-infected control cells to differentiation-inducing conditions resulted in the expression of both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. We found that ectopic expression of CNmut did not attenuate the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (unlike PPARγ and C/EBPα), because both were induced in CNmut-expressing cells with similar kinetics to control cells (Fig.3 B). Moreover, it appeared that calcineurin did not affect the relative abundance of the smaller inhibitory liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP) isoform of C/EBPβ that arises from alternative translational initiation and is believed to represent a naturally occurring dominant-negative regulator of C/EBP family members (26Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that sustained calcineurin activity does not prevent the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα by affecting the expression of the early transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. We wanted to determine next whether the inhibitory effect of CNmut on adipocyte differentiation was specifically caused by prevention of the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, or whether sustained calcineurin activity might merely nonspecifically perturb 3T3-L1 cellular physiology by creating a cellular environment incompatible with cellular differentiation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether ectopic expression of PPARγ was able to bypass the block in adipogenesis and rescue adipocyte differentiation in CNmut-expressing cells. Thus, 3T3-L1 cells were infected sequentially first with MSCV-CNmut and then with either MSCV-PPARγ1 or MSCV-H2K as a control. The MSCV-PPARγ1 retroviral vector directs the expression of both PPARγ1 and the murine major histocompatibility class I molecule, H2Kk from a single bicistronic mRNA (Fig.4 A). As a result, successful infection with this virus can be monitored readily by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with a fluorescence-conjugated anti-H2Kk mAb. Using this sequential infection protocol, we were able to doubly infect >95% of cells with MSCV-CNmut and either MSCV-H2K or MSCV-PPARγ1 (Fig.4 B). As expected, cells infected with both MSCV-CNmut and MSCV-H2K failed to undergo adipocyte differentiation under standard differentiation conditions (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, cells that co-expressed both CNmut and PPARγ1 were found to efficiently undergo the characteristic morphological changes associated with adipocyte differentiation and stained positive for Oil Red O (Fig.4 C). Fluorescent microscopic analysis of these cells revealed that they still expressed the CNmut-IRES-GFP transgene, ruling out the trivial possibility that PPARγ1 rescued adipogenesis by inhibiting expression of CNmut (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that expression of PPARγ1 overcomes the inhibitory effects of ionomycin on adipogenesis (Fig. 4 D). The efficient rescue of adipocyte differentiation in both CNmut-expressing and ionomycin-treated cells by ectopic expression of PPARγ1 suggests that calcineurin principally inhibits adipogenesis by preventing the expression of the proadipogenic transcription factor PPARγ. Having demonstrated that the sustained activation of calcineurin either by treatment with calcium ionophore or ectopic expression of CNmut potently inhibits adipogenesis, we wanted to investigate the potential role of calcineurin during the normal process of in vitro adipocyte differentiation. For these experiments, we took advantage of our observation that treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with suboptimal adipogenic stimuli (Mix and Dex without insulin) resulted in only modest adipocyte differentiation that occurred primarily in isolated patches of cells. As seen in Fig.5 A, stimulation of 3T3-L1 cells with decreasing concentrations of Mix and Dex resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in adipocyte differentiation. However, when 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated under these suboptimal conditions in the presence of either FK506 or CsA, we observed enhanced differentiation with a significant increase in both the number and the size of these adipogenic cell clusters (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). To further implicate endogenous calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, we took advantage of a previously characterized specific peptide inhibitor of calcineurin, VIVIT-GFP, which has been shown to specifically inhibit the ability of calcineurin to activate NFAT proteins (22Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). As predicted, expression of VIVIT-GFP in 3T3-L1 cells was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of ionomycin on adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5 B). Consistent with the effect of FK506 (Fig. 5 A), we found that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin activity with VIVIT-GFP dramatically enhanced adipocyte differentiation in response to suboptimal adipogenic stimuli (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous calcineurin activity acts to antagonize the normal process of adipogenesis and is likely to set a signaling threshold required for efficient adipocyte differentiation. In the current study, we provide multiple lines of evidence to indicate that the Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin acts to negatively regulate adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that the activation of the calcineurin signaling pathway inhibits adipogenesis by preventing the expression of the proadipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα. Conversely, we found that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin activity markedly enhances adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells in response to suboptimal adipogenic stimuli. Together our findings suggest that the level of activation of the endogenous calcineurin signaling pathway in preadipocyte cells is likely to play an important role in setting the signaling threshold required for commitment to the terminal phase of adipocyte differentiation. Given that calcineurin activity is exquisitely sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i (27Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), the role of calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation is likely to be especially important in the response to environmental cues such as prostaglandin F2α that modify the level of intracellular Ca2+. Prostaglandin F2α has been shown previously to inhibit adipogenesis by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism (16Miller C.W. Casimir D.A. Ntambi J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5641-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). On the basis of our findings, we propose that calcineurin is an intrinsic negative regulatory component of the adipogenic signaling pathway that acts as a Ca2+-dependent molecular switch to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in response to exogenous agents that elevate [Ca2+]i. It is important to note that our primary conclusion that calcineurin acts to negatively regulate adipocyte differentiation conflicts with a previous study by Ho et al. (23Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). On the basis of their identification of an NFAT binding site in a proximal promoter element of the adipocyte-specific aP2 gene and their observation that CsA inhibits MDI-induced 3T3-L1 differentiation, these authors proposed a positive role for the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway in the regulation of adipogenesis. However, a previous study by Yeh et al. (28Yeh W.C. Bierer B.E. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11086-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) found that neither CsA nor FK506 inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In fact, they found that a molar excess of FK506 was able to overcome the antiadipogenic effects of the structurally related drug rapamycin. Because both FK506 and rapamycin are known to mediate their biological activities by binding to a common intracellular receptor, FK506-binding protein (29Bierer B.E. Somers P.K. Wandless T.J. Burakoff S.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 250: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the ability of FK506 to overcome the antiadipogenic effects of rapamycin indicates that functional FK506-FK506 binding protein complexes are unable to block adipogenesis. This observation and our current data argue strongly against a positive role for calcineurin in adipocyte differentiation, as originally suggested by Ho et al. (23Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Instead, our data provide multiple independent lines of evidence that demonstrate a novel inhibitory function for calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. At present, the reason behind the discrepancy between our data and those of Ho et al. is not clear but may be related to either the method of drug delivery or specific cell culture conditions. Our finding that sustained calcineurin activity inhibits adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, but not C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, suggests a number of potential mechanisms by which calcineurin may inhibit adipogenesis. First, calcineurin may interfere directly with the activity of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. Although C/EBPβ is thought to be regulated during 3T3-L1 differentiation by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism (30Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), no evidence currently exists to suggest that C/EBPβ is a direct substrate of calcineurin. In addition, it appears that calcineurin does not affect the expression of known inhibitors of C/EBPβ activity such as LIP (Fig. 3 B), an inhibitory C/EBPβ isoform that arises by alternative translational initiation (26Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), or the expression of CHOP-10 (data not shown), which is believed to represent an endogenous dominant-negative inhibitor of the C/EBP family (31Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Second, calcineurin may inhibit adipocyte differentiation by affecting a parallel pathway to C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ that is also required for the efficient expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. In this regard, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway has been shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation (32Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 33Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This effect is controversial, however, because other studies have suggested a positive role for this pathway in adipogenesis (34Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 35Bost F. Caron L. Marchetti I. Dani C. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Binetruy B. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, the cAMP- response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) and p38 kinase signaling pathways have both been shown to be required for PPARγ expression and efficient adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells (36Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lin A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35630-35638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 37Reusch J.E. Colton L.A. Klemm D.J.

Commun. 2001; 281: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calcineurin has been shown to affect the activity of each of these signaling pathways in a number of distinct cell types (39Zou Y. Yao A. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Hiroi Y. Shimoyama M. Uozumi H. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 40Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15913-15919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), making each pathway a potential target for the antiadipogenic activity of calcineurin. Third, calcineurin may inhibit adipocyte differentiation by activating a pathway that directly represses expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. Indeed, undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes are known to express a number of proteins that have been shown to potently inhibit adipogenesis by preventing the expression of PPARγ. The expression of these proteins, which include PREF-1 (42Smas C.M. Chen L. Zhao L. Latasa M.J. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12632-12641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Wnt-10b (43Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), and the transcription factors GATA-2 and GATA-3 (44Tong Q. Dalgin G. Xu H. Ting C.N. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), must be down-regulated to ensure successful adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, calcineurin has recently been implicated in up-regulating the expression of GATA-2 in muscle cell precursors, where it is believed to play a role in the promotion of muscle cell differentiation and hypertrophy (45Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Finally, because calcineurin is best known for its ability to activate the NFAT family of transcription factors (20Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 46Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 47Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 48Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), and NFAT proteins are expressed in 3T3-L1 cells (23Ho I.C. Kim J.H. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it is possible that calcineurin mediates its effects through NFAT. Because the calcineurin- inhibitory peptide VIVIT-GFP has previously been reported to specifically block the ability of calcineurin to activate NFAT proteins (22Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the enhancing effect of VIVIT-GFP on adipogenesis (Fig. 5, B and C) suggests that NFAT proteins may play a role in the negative regulation of adipocyte differentiation. This notion is further supported by our observation that ectopic expression of a constitutively active NFATc1 mutant also inhibits the MDI-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by preventing the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, although this may be secondary to a transforming effect of NFATc1 in these cells. 2J. W. Neal and N. A. Clipstone, manuscript in preparation. Experiments are currently under way to further delineate the role of calcineurin in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. Collectively, our findings identify calcineurin as a Ca2+-dependent negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation and provide evidence that the level of endogenous calcineurin activity in preadipocytes plays an important role in determining the efficiency of adipogenesis. Because it is now clear that an increase in adipogenesis can contribute to increased adipose tissue mass and the development of obesity (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), our data suggest a potential in vivo role for calcineurin in the regulation of obesity and its associated diseases. Indeed, our observation that inhibition of endogenous calcineurin activity leads to enhanced adipogenesis may explain the increased obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type-2 diabetes that have been reported in patients treated with the immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 (49Mathieu R.L.

On the basis of our results, further investigation of the in vivo role of calcineurin in the regulation of obesity is clearly warranted.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts from startle-potentiated rats showed a selective increase in the amygdala of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity. Supershift experiments further indicated that p65 and p50 subunits but not c-Rel were involved in DNA binding. The protein levels of IκB-α were reduced by treatments that reliably induced LTP in this area of the brain. This was accompanied by a decrease of NF-κB in the cytoplasm concomitant with an increase in the nucleus. Quantitative analysis of IκB kinase activity demonstrated that fear training led to an increase in kinase activity, and this effect was inhibited by thalidomide. Paralleled behavioral tests revealed that thalidomide inhibited fear-potentiated startle. Intra-amygdala administration of κB decoy DNA prior to training impaired fear-potentiated startle as well as LTP induction. Similarly, NF-κB inhibitors blocked IκB-α degradation and startle response. These results provide the first evidence of a requirement of NF-κB activation in the amygdala for consolidation of fear memory.

These results provide the first evidence of a requirement of NF-κB activation in the amygdala for consolidation of fear memory. It is generally believed that consolidation of long term memory in mammalian brain and long term facilitation in Aplysiarequire new protein synthesis (1Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 2Castellucci V.F. Blumenfeld H. Goelet P. Kandel E.R. J.

Neurosci. 1999; 113: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized proteins are thought to deposit at the synapses that have been tagged by prior activity to encode enduring changes in synaptic strength (4Frey U. Morris R.G.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 5Frey U. Morris R.G.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, despite the importance of new protein synthesis for memory consolidation, little is known about signaling pathways leading to protein translation in neurons. NF-κB, originally identified as a regulator of immunoglobulin κ light chain gene expression, is a DNA-binding factor that functions as a dimer. Five mammalian members of the family have been identified; p50/NF-κB1, p65/RelA, c-Rel, RelB, and p52/NF-κB2 (6Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). NF-κB was localized mainly to the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to an inhibitory protein termed IκB (7Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by extracellular inducers, IκB was rapidly phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex on the serine residues 32 and 36. This phosphorylation led to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB by the proteasome followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar, 9Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Once translocated to the nucleus, NF-κB bound cognate DNA sequences and activated transcription of specific target genes, the majority of which encoded proteins important in immunity and inflammation (12Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 13May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

Apart from its role in hematopoiesis, accumulated evidence indicates that NF-κB is involved in neuroprotection or neurodegeneration, depending on the particular system under investigation and the NF-κB subunits that became activated (16O'Neill L.A.J. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 17Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B.

Neuroscience. 2001; 108: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study implicated that NF-κB played an important role in the synaptic plasticity, because pretreatment of hippocampal slices with κB decoy DNA prevented induction of long term depression (LTD) 1The abbreviations used for: LTD, long term depression; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IKK, IκB kinase; LTP, long term potentiation; D-APV, D-2-amino-phosphonovalerate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TS, tetanic stimulation; LA, lateral; BLA, basolateral; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 1The abbreviations used for: LTD, long term depression; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; IKK, IκB kinase; LTP, long term potentiation; D-APV, D-2-amino-phosphonovalerate; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TPCK, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TS, tetanic stimulation; LA, lateral; BLA, basolateral; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. and significantly reduced the magnitude of LTP (19Albensi B.C. Mattson M.P. Synapse. 2000; 35: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that acquisition of fear was associated with an activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and its downstream target Akt in the rat amygdala (20Lin C.H. Yeh H.W. Lin C.H. Lu K.T. Leu T.H. Chang W.C. Gean P.W. Neuron. 2001; 31: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase and Akt were also activated in response to LTP-inducing tetanic stimulation (TS). In parallel, PI 3-kinase inhibitors interfered with TS-induced LTP as well as long term fear memory formation. Akt has been shown to induce the activation of NF-κB family of transcriptional factors (21Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 22Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether NF-κB plays any role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Here we show that NF-κB is activated in the amygdala following fear-potentiated startle, and disruption of this signaling pathway impairs fear memory. Rats (4–5 weeks old) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and subsequently were mounted on a stereotaxic apparatus. Two cannula made of 22-gauge stainless steel tubing (C313G; Plastic Products) were implanted bilaterally into the lateral (LA) or basolateral (BLA) amygdala (anteroposterior, −2.8 mm; mediolateral, ±4.5 mm; dorsoventral, −7.0 mm) (23Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). A 28-gauge dummy cannula was inserted into each cannula to prevent clogging. Three jewelry screws were implanted over the skull, serving as anchors and the whole assembly was affixed on the skull with dental cement. The rats were monitored and handled daily and were given 7 days to recover. NF-κB inhibitors were administered bilaterally in a volume of 0.5–0.8 μl at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. κB decoy and scrambled DNA were prepared and administered based on the method of Blondeau et al. (24Blondeau N. Widmann C. Lazdunski M. Heurteaux C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4668-4677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, double-stranded κB decoy DNA was prepared by annealing complementary single strands with the sequences of 5′-GAGGGGACTTTCCCT-3′. Control DNA with a scrambled sequence was prepared by annealing oligonucleotides of the following sequence: 5′-GATGCGTCTGTCGCA-3′. Stocks of double-stranded DNA were prepared at a concentration of 2 mm in saline. κB decoy and scrambled DNA (60 μg) were infused into the amygdala at a rate of 0.5 μl/min (two injections at 24 and 2 h before conditioning). Fear conditioning was measured using the potentiated startle paradigm in a startle apparatus (San Diego Instrument, San Diego, CA) as described previously (20Lin C.H. Yeh H.W. Lin C.H. Lu K.T. Leu T.H. Chang W.C. Gean P.W. Neuron. 2001; 31: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25Cassella J.V. Davis M. Physiol. Behav. 1986; 36: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, the animal was constrained in a Plexiglas cylindrical tube (length, 20 cm; diameter, 10 cm) with an accelerometer sensor attached on the base. The whole set-up was enclosed in a ventilated, sound-attenuating cabinet (length, 38 cm; width, 38 cm; and height, 55 cm). The acoustic startle stimulus was a 50-ms white noise at an intensity of 95 dB. The visual conditioned stimulus was a 3.7-s light produced by an 8-watt fluorescent bulb attached to the back of stabilimeter. The unconditioned stimulus, which serves as the aversive component necessary for fear conditioning, was a 0.6-milliamp foot shock with a duration of 0.5 s. Startle amplitude was defined as the maximum accelerometer voltage that occurred during a 200-ms period after the onset of the startle stimulus. Seven days after surgery, each rat was exposed to habituation sessions over two consecutive days. In these sessions, rats were placed in the startle box and 3 min later presented with 10 startle stimuli at 2-min intertrial intervals. On the basis of their mean startle amplitudes in the second of these two sessions, rats were matched into groups with similar response levels. On the training day, rats were placed in the startle chamber and received 10 light-foot shock pairings. Unpaired controls received the same number of light and foot shock presentation but in a pseudorandom fashion in which the unconditioned stimulus could occur at anytime except at 3.2 s following the conditioned stimulus. Male Sprague-Dawley 4–6-week-old rats were decapitated, and their brains were rapidly removed and placed in cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution. Subsequently, the brain was hemisected, and transverse slices of 450-μm thickness were made. ACSF solution had the following composition: 117 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, and 11 mm glucose. The ACSF was bubbled continuously with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and had a pH of 7.4. Extracellular field potentials were made by electrical stimulation of the external capsule, which contained fibers from the auditory cortex to the lateral amygdala, with a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (SNE-100; Kopf Instruments, Bern, Germany). Electrical stimuli (150 μs in duration) were delivered at a frequency of 0.05 Hz. Base-line field potentials were adjusted to ∼30–40% of the maximal responses. LTP was elicited by four trains of tetanus (100 Hz, 1 s at 3-min intervals) at the same stimulation intensity used for base line. For κB decoy DNA experiments, amygdala slices from each rat were divided into two groups. Slices in the treatment group were incubated with 50 μm κB decoy DNA for at least 3 h before recordings were made. Control slices were incubated for a similar length of time with scrambled DNA or normal ACSF in different beakers. The lateral and basolateral subregions of the amygdala were sonicated briefly in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin). In the LTP experiments, slices were given four trains of TS or were treated with forskolin for 15 min, the protocols that reliably evoked LTP in this area of the brain. Subsequently, slices were removed from the recording chamber at various time points as indicated after the last TS or the washout of forskolin. Following sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was obtained after pelleting the crude membrane fraction by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein concentration in the soluble fraction was then measured using a Bradford assay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equivalent amounts of protein for each sample were resolved in 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted electrophoretically to Immobilon membranes, and blocked overnight in TBS buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin. For detection of NF-κB and IκB-α, blots were incubated with polyclonal antibodies for p50, p65, or IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. Western blots were developed in the linear range used for densitometry. The density of the immunoblots was determined by an image analysis system (Vilber Lourmat). After the rats were killed, the brains were rapidly removed, and the LA and BLA were dissected out using a Dounce grinder with a loose pestle in ice-chilled buffer (15 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm NaCl, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and pellet was resuspended in buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm NaF, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After a brief vortexing, they were incubated on ice for 10 min and lysed with a tight pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40–60 μl of extraction buffer consisting of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.8 m NaCl, 15% glycerol, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and were incubated on ice for 2–4 h. The nuclear suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved. EMSA was performed on the amygdala neurons isolated from unpaired control or conditioned animals at specific times after training. For binding reactions, 10 μg of protein was incubated in binding buffer (0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 15 min at room temperature. The double-stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP. Probe specificity has been thoroughly documented previously (26Roshak A.K. Jackson J.R. McGough K. Chabot-Fletcher M. Mochan E. Marshall L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31496-31501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min. In the supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies against the p65, p50, and/or c-Rel proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min before the binding reaction. The specificity of binding was demonstrated by the addition of cold competitor or cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) probe (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′). The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris, 22.2 mm borate, and 0.5 mm EDTA). The dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography after an overnight exposure. IKK activity was quantitated using an immune complex kinase assay as described previously (27Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Cells were prepared from unpaired conditioned or conditioned rats given thalidomide (10 μg dissolved in 1.0 μl of saline, 0.5 μl per side) 30 min before training. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the β subunit of IKK. Kinase activity was determined in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes (pH 7.7), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 1–3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm PNPP, 300 μmNa3VO4, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μm PMSF, aprotinin at 10 μg/ml, leupeptin at 1 μg/ml, pepstatin at 1 μg/ml, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30–60 min in the presence of the indicated substrate. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and visualized by autoradiography. IκB-α-(1–317) substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli with glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. We determined whether conditioning was associated with activation of NF-κB by using EMSA in which nuclear extracts from the amygdala of paired or unpaired rats were incubated with radiolabeled NF-κB consensus DNA sequence. Fig.1 A shows that fear training significantly increased the association of NF-κB with consensus oligonucleotide. By contrast, NF-κB DNA binding activity was not altered in unpaired controls. Regulation of NF-κB may be a general phenomenon across the entire brain. To determine whether it was specific for the amygdala, additional experiments were performed to measure NF-κB DNA binding activity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. As illustrated in Fig.1 B, training of visual conditioned fear did not lead to an increase in NF-κB binding activity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These results indicate that regulation of NF-κB activity occurs in the region of the brain involved in the formation of fear memory. Previous studies have shown that biochemical changes that occur in areas LA and BLA during fear conditioning in vivo are similar to those occur during LTP in vitro (28Schafe G.E. Atkins C.M. Swank M.W. Bauer E.P. Sweatt J.D. LeDoux J.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8177-8187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Huang Y.-Y. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6317-6325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Josselyn S.A. Shi C. Carlezon Jr., W.A. Neve R.L. Nestler E.J. Davis M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether forskolin or TS, the protocols that reliably evoked LTP in this area of the brain, produced a similar effect as fear training. Slices were treated with forskolin (50 μm) for 15 min, and nuclear extracts prepared from the LA and BLA were assessed for NF-κB activation using EMSA. Fig.2 A shows that NF-κB binding activity was eliminated in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled κB DNA. In contrast, unlabeled CREB probe had no effect demonstrating the specificity of binding. To identify which NF-κB family members that were binding, we performed supershift experiments. Fig. 2 A revealed that both p65 and p50 antibodies retarded the migration of proteins interacting with the NF-κB oligonucleotide. Similar experiments were performed following TS. As shown in Fig.2 B, supershift assay indicated that the major NF-κB complex induced by TS was p65/p50 heterodimer. Interestingly, CREB antibody also slightly retarded the migration, suggesting the possible interaction between NF-κB and CREB (see below). The induction of the active state of NF-κB involves phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB-α (7Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). We performed Western blot analysis to test what effects TS or forskolin treatment have on the regulation of IκB-α. Fig.3 A shows that IκB-α protein level was degraded by 25.7 ± 1.8% (n = 6, p < 0.01) at 10 min after TS. The degradation was followed by an almost complete resynthesis of IκB-α at 30 min after TS (98.8 ± 1.2, n = 6). Similar degradation of IκB-α (43.4 ± 2.3%, n = 6, p< 0.001) was observed at 10 min following the cessation of forskolin treatment (Fig. 3 B). We next examined the link between PI 3-kinase and NF-κB activation. We found that forskolin-induced degradation of IκB-α was attenuated by PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3 C), suggesting the involvement of PI 3-kinase in NF-κB activation.N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) is a protease inhibitor that was commonly used as NF-κB inhibitor (31Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay L. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 32Wu M. Lee H. Billas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.3 C, the degradation of IκB-α was blocked by TLCK. We further examined the effect of TLCK on the NF-κB DNA binding activity. Pretreatment of TLCK before training blocked conditioning-induced binding of NF-κB (Fig. 3 D). However, the direct addition of TLCK to the nuclear extracts from the conditioned rats did not affect the binding of NF-κB to the DNA. These data indicate that suppression of NF-κB binding by TLCK is not due to interference between the transcription factor and the DNA but rather that TLCK acts specifically to inhibit conditioning-induced NF-κB activity. IKK is the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of IκB-α; therefore, we examined the regulation of IKK activity in behaviorally trained rats. By using agarose-conjugated antibody against the β subunit of IKK complex, IKK was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts of rats that had been conditioned. Immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity by incubating with IκB-α (amino acids 1–317) fusion protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. Fig.4 shows that fear training led to an increase in kinase activity by 10 min that continued through the 30-min time point. It has been shown that anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide were based on its ability to block NF-κB activation through suppression of IKK activity (33Keifer J.A. Guttridge D.C. Ashburner B.P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22382-22387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We tested whether thalidomide produces a similar effect on the central neurons by administration of this drug (10 μg dissolved in 1.0 μl of saline, 0.5 μl per side) 30 min before training. Quantitative analysis of conditioning-induced IKK activity demonstrated that thalidomide inhibited the increase at 10 (p < 0.05) and 30 min (p < 0.01) time points as compared with that without thalidomide treatment. Paralleled behavioral tests performed 24 h after training revealed that thalidomide inhibited fear-potentiated startle. Startle potentiations were 191.7 ± 25.4% in the vehicle group and 93.1 ± 9.5% in the thalidomide-treated group (t (10) = 3.85, p < 0.01). Amygdala slices were given four trains of TS or were incubated with 50 μmforskolin for 15 min, and extracts of treated cells were separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting assay. Fig. 5 A shows that NF-κB p50 protein was reduced to 48.0 ± 3.9 (n = 6,p < 0.01) of its initial value in the cytoplasmic fraction within 60 min after TS. In contrast, in the nuclear fraction, NF-κB p50 protein accumulated to 183.2 ± 16.3% (n = 6, p < 0.01) of its initial value. Similarly, NF-κB p50 protein was reduced to 35.5 ± 5.9 (n = 6, p < 0.001) of its initial value in the cytoplasmic fraction within 60 min after cessation of forskolin treatment (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, in the nuclear fraction, NF-κB p50 protein accumulated to 163.2 ± 9.5% (n = 6, p < 0.001) of its initial value. To investigate whether the activation of NF-κB was not only correlated but also obligatory for conditioned fear, we microinjected TLCK (0.4, 20, or 50 mm, 0.5 μl per side) bilaterally into the LA or BLA 30 min before training. Fear retention was tested 24 h after training. Fig.6 A shows that TLCK dose-dependently impaired fear memory. The analysis of variance for startle scores revealed a significant effect for dose (F (4,25) = 8.10; p < 0.001).Post hoc comparisons (Newman-Keuls) revealed the significant differences among vehicle control and the high doses (20 and 50 mm) of TLCK (p < 0.01), whereas no difference was detected among control and low doses (0.4 mm; p > 0.05). Similarly, intra-amygdala infusion of another NF-κB inhibitor,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK; 100 mm, 0.5 μl per side) blocked the acquisition of fear memory (n = 6, p < 0.01versus vehicle control). The infusion cannula tip locations are shown in Fig. 6 B. Only rats with cannula tips at or within the boundaries of LA and BLA were included in the data analysis. We administered double-stranded κB decoy DNA or control double-stranded DNA with a scrambled sequence bilaterally into the amygdala based on the method of Yu et al. (34Yu Z. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After conditioning, the rats were sacrificed, and nuclear extracts from the amygdala were incubated with radiolabeled NF-κB consensus DNA sequence. As shown in Fig.7 A, the conditioning-induced increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity was not seen in rats that were given κB decoy DNA. Furthermore, quantification of startle potentiation 24 h after conditioning revealed a marked depression of the degree of potentiation (48.3 ± 14.8% of potentiation,n = 6) as compared with those receiving scrambled DNA (205.1 ± 29.6%, n = 6, p < 0.001) or sham-operated rats (251.3 ± 12.1%,n = 6, p < 0.001) (Fig.7 B). To exclude the possible toxic effect of κB decoy DNA on the amygdala neurons, rats that received κB decoy DNA were rested for at least 3 days and subsequently were retrained without drug treatment. Fig. 7 B shows that rats that had impaired memory caused by κB decoy DNA treatment now exhibited a normal startle reflex (211.4 ± 55.1%, n = 6, p< 0.01). This result suggests that the effect of κB decoy DNA was reversible and appeared not to cause permanent damage to the amygdala function. It has been shown that many hippocampal pyramidal neurons exhibited intense fluorescence when slices were incubated for 3 h in the presence of 50 μm κB decoy DNA, indicating penetration of the κB decoy DNA into these cells (19Albensi B.C. Mattson M.P. Synapse. 2000; 35: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Amygdala slices were incubated with 50 μm κB decoy DNA for at least 3 h before recordings were made. Control slices were incubated for a similar length of time with scrambled DNA in a different beaker. Fig.7 C shows that delivery of four sets of TS at an interstimulus interval of 3 min produced a long lasting, robust enhancement of synaptic responses in control and scrambled DNA-treated slices. The slopes of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) were 213 ± 18, 201 ± 15, 189 ± 16, and 178 ± 17% (n = 6), at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the stimulation. By contrast, the same amount and pattern of stimulation elicited a gradually decaying long-term potentiation (LTP) in κB decoy DNA-treated slices. The fEPSP slopes at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after the stimulation were 134 ± 23, 108 ± 26, 86 ± 14, and 88 ± 14% (n = 6) of control, respectively. The difference between control and κB decoy DNA-treated slices was statistically significant at 1 (p < 0.05), 2 (p < 0.05), 3 (p < 0.01), and 4 h (p< 0.005). We also performed control experiments to examine whether the basal synaptic transmission was changed by measuring the input-output relationship before and after incubation with κB decoy DNA. We found that the input-output relationship was not affected by κB decoy DNA (not shown). Sin"

Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel AOS-encoding cDNA (LeAOS3) from Lycopersicon esculentum whose predicted amino acid sequence classifies it as a member of the CYP74C subfamily of enzymes that was hitherto not known to include AOSs. Recombinant LeAOS3 expressed in Escherichia coli showed spectral characteristics of a P-450.

Kinetic assays demonstrated that LeAOS3 was ≈10-fold more active against 9-hydroperoxides than the corresponding 13-isomers.LeAOS3 transcripts accumulated in roots, but were undetectable in aerial parts of mature plants. In contrast to wild-type plants, LeAOS3 expression was undetectable in roots of a tomato mutant that is defective in jasmonic acid signaling. These findings suggest that LeAOS3 plays a role in the metabolism of 9-lipoxygenase-derived hydroperoxides in roots, and that this branch of oxylipin biosynthesis is regulated by the jasmonate signaling cascade.

Oxylipins comprise a group of biologically active compounds that are produced by oxidative metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Members of the eicosanoid family of lipid mediators have been studied extensively with respect to their biosynthesis from arachidonic acid and their function in diverse physiological processes in animal cells (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). In plants, which lack arachidonic acid, oxygenated derivatives of C18 fatty acids participate in the regulation of many defense-related and developmental processes. The biosynthesis of most phytooxylipins is initiated by lipoxygenase (LOX), 1The abbreviations used for: LOX, lipoxygenase; AOS, allene oxide synthase; HPL, fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase; AOC, allene oxide cyclase; DES, divinyl ether synthase; OPR, 12-OPDA reductase; JA, jasmonic acid; MeJA, methyl JA; EST, expressed sequence tag; RT-PCR, reverse-transcriptase-PCR; TAIL-PCR, thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; 9-HPOD, 9-hydroperoxy linoleic acid; 9-HPOT, 9-hydroperoxy linolenic acid; 13-HPOD, 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid; 13-HPOT, 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid; 9, 10-EOT, 9,10-epoxyoctadecatrienoic acid; 9, 10-EOD, 9,10-epoxyoctadecadienoic acid; 12, 13-EOT, 12,13-epoxyoctadecatrienoic acid; 10-OPDA, 10-oxo-11,15-phytodienoic acid; 10-OPEA, 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid; 12-OPDA, 12-oxo-10,15-phytodienoic acid; TMS, trimethylsilyl. which adds molecular oxygen to either the C-9 or C-13 position of linolenic or linoleic acid (2Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The resulting hydroperoxides are further metabolized by several enzymes including three closely related members of the CYP74 family of cytochromes P-450: allene oxide synthase (AOS), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), and divinyl ether synthase (DES). Indeed, much of the structural and functional diversity in oxylipin metabolism in plants can be accounted for by the activity of CYP74s that metabolize 9- and 13-hydroperoxides to a wide range of products (3Howe G.A. Schilmiller A.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast to typical P-450 monooxygenases, CYP74 P-450s do not require O2 and a NADPH-dependent P-450 reductase for activity. Rather, they use a hydroperoxide group both as the oxygen donor and as a source of reducing equivalents (4Song W.-C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 252: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 5Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This unique catalytic feature is shared by thromboxane synthase and prostacyclin synthase, two P-450 enzymes involved in the synthesis of eicosanoids (6Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A greater understanding of the biochemical and physiological function of this atypical class of P-450 enzymes promises to provide new insight into the evolution of fatty acid-based signaling pathways in diverse biological systems. Interest in plant oxylipins has focused mainly on the AOS branch of the 13-LOX pathway that gives rise to the jasmonate family of compounds (collectively referred to as JAs) including JA, methyl-JA (MeJA), and their metabolic precursor 12-oxo-10,15-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) (Fig. 1). AOS catalyzes the transformation of 13-hydroperoxy linolenic acid (13-HPOT) to a short-lived allene oxide intermediate, 12,13-epoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (12,13-EOT) (7Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 76-84Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the biosynthetic route to JA, allene oxide cyclase (AOC) converts 12,13-EOT to 12-OPDA (9Hamberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reduction of 12-OPDA by OPDA reductase (OPR) and three cycles of β-oxidation yields JA (10Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 11Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Feng P. Zimmerman D.C. Lipids. 1979; 14: 710-713Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). During in vitroreactions carried out in the absence of AOC, 12,13-EOT spontaneously hydrolyzes to α- and γ-ketols, and can also undergo non-enzymatic cyclization to produce racemic 12-OPDA (4Song W.-C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 252: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 8Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of α- and γ-ketols, and the extent to which they are produced in vivo, is unclear. Genes encoding AOSs that metabolize 13-HPOT have been cloned from several plant species. Based on comparisons of predicted amino acid sequence, these proteins are classified within the CYP74A subfamily of P-450s (2Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 3Howe G.A. Schilmiller A.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Several AOSs have been shown to have a strong (≈36:1) preference for the 13-hydroperoxide relative to the corresponding 9-isomer (e.g. Refs. 12 and 13). One exception to this is barley AOS, which despite its classification as a CYP74A and proposed role in JA biosynthesis can metabolize both 9- and 13-isomers in vitro(14Maucher M. Hause B. Feussner I. Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Plant J. 2000; 21: 199-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plants also utilize a second type of AOS for the metabolism of 9-hydroperoxides in non-photosynthetic tissues (Fig. 1). An AOS activity responsible for production of α- and γ-ketol fatty acids from 9-hydroperoxy linoleic acid (9-HPOD) was first demonstrated in extracts from corn seed (15Gardner H.W. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 311-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gardner H.W. Kleiman R. Christianson D.D. Weisleder D. Lipids. 1975; 10: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that these compounds are formed by non-enzymatic hydrolysis of an unstable allene oxide (9,10-epoxyoctadecanoic acid; 9,10-EOD) that is generated by the action of AOS on 9-hydroperoxides (17Hamberg M. Hughes M.A. Samuelsson B. Wong P.Y.-K. Sun F.F. Advances in Prostaglandin, Thromboxane, and Leukotriene Research. 19. Raven Press, New York1988: 64-69Google Scholar, 18Hamberg M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More recently, the production of ketols by the sequential action of 9-LOX and AOS was demonstrated in cell-free extracts from tomato root (19Caldelari D. Farmer E.E. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 599-604Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), tulip bulb (20Grechkin A.N. Mukhtarova L.S. Hamberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and potato stolon (18Hamberg M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The latter study (18Hamberg M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also showed that metabolism of linoleic and linolenic acids via the 9-LOX/AOS pathway gives rise to 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid (10-OPEA) and 10-oxo-11,15-phytodienoic acid (10-OPDA), respectively, novel cyclopentenones that are structural isomers of 12-OPDA (Fig.1). The presence of 9-AOS in plants raises the question of the physiological function of this branch of oxylipin metabolism and its relationship to AOSs that act in the 13-LOX pathway for JA biosynthesis. Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a cDNA encoding a novel member of the CYP74 P-450 gene family in tomato. We demonstrate that the recombinant protein (designated LeAOS3) is an AOS by virtue of its ability to convert hydroperoxy fatty acids to ketol and cyclopentenone oxylipins. The phylogenetic classification of LeAOS3 within the CYP74 family, the substrate preference of the enzyme and the tissue-specific expression of LeAOS3 transcript lead us to propose a role for this P-450 in the production of 9-hydroperoxide-derived oxylipins. We also demonstrate that expression of LeAOS3 mRNA in roots is abolished in a mutant of tomato that is insensitive to JAs. The relevance of these findings to the possible physiological function of LeAOS3 is discussed. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Castlemart) plants were grown in Jiffy peat pots (Hummert International) in a growth chamber maintained under 17 h of light (200 μE2/s) at 28 °C and 7 h of dark at 18 °C. Seeds ofLycopersicon pennellii (LA716) and the introgression lines used for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping were obtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (Davis, CA). Plants homozygous for jai1–1 were obtained from a population of F2 plants that was segregating the mutation, as previously described (21Li L. Li C. Howe G.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1414-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Basic molecular biological techniques were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The expressed sequence tag (EST) clone cLEI16I12 (GenBankTMAW651347; EST329801) was obtained from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. The cDNA insert, which was sequenced in its entirety on both strands, was 1773 base pairs (bp) in length, and included 16-bp upstream of the initiator AUG codon and 281 bp in the 3′-untranslated region (excluding poly(A) residues). Thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) was used to obtain additional sequence information at the 5′-end of the gene as previously described (23Itoh A. Howe A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3620-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 20 ng of tomato genomic DNA was used as a template for an initial PCR reaction using a gene-specific primer (GSP1: 5′-TGG-AGT-TGT-AGA-ACG-CGT-TGT-ATA-GCT-TC-3′) and a shorter arbitrary degenerate primer (AD1: 5′-(A/C/G/T)TCGA(C/G)T(A/T)T(C/G)G(A/T)GTT-3′). The resulting PCR product was used as a template for a second PCR reaction using the same AD1 primer and a second nested gene-specific primer (GSP2: 5′-CTG-ATG-ATC-GCG-TTT-TAC-AAG-GAT-GAT-AG-3′). The PCR products obtained from this reaction were excised from the gel and used as template for a final PCR reaction with the AD1 primer and a third nested gene-specific primer (GSP3: 5′-CCT-AGT-GAA-ATC-AAT-GGA-GCT-AGT-TGA-AG-3′). TAIL-PCR products of ∼850 bp were obtained from two independent reactions. DNA sequencing of these products was performed using a gene-specific primer (5′-GAT-GTA-GTA-AAG-ATG-GGA-TG-3′), and revealed an in-frame stop codon (UAA) 42 nucleotides upstream of the initiator AUG. Reverse transcription PCR was used to exclude the possibility that the in-frame stop codon was located in an intron that was amplified by TAIL-PCR. Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT) primers and Enhanced Avian reverse transcriptase (Sigma Chemical Co.). PCR was performed using a primer (5′-GTG-ATT-ATT-CTA-ATC-TCT-AGC-ACT-ATC-TA-3′) located upstream of the in-frame stop codon and the GSP3 primer. Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR product confirmed the position of the stop codon relative to the initiator AUG codon. Data base searches were performed using the BLAST program (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) available at the United States National Center for Biotechnology. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal method in the Megalign program (DNAStar, Madison, WI). An unrooted neighbor-joining phylogeny was constructed in PAUP4.0* version 4.0b10 (25Swofford D.L. PAUP*. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (*and Other Methods). Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar), and 100 bootstrap replicates were run to test the reliability of the tree topology. A PCR-based approach was used to construct a vector for expression of LeAOS3 containing the C-terminal His6 tag. Forward and reverse primers that amplify the cDNA (EST clone cLEI16I2) were designed to contain NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-GGA-ATT-CCA-TAT-GGC-TAA-TAC-CAA-AGA-3′ and that of reverse primer, 5′-CCG-CTC-GAG-TGA-TGT-TGC-TTT-AG-3′. PCR amplification yielded a 1.45-kb product that was subsequently cut with NdeI andXhoI and subcloned into the same sites of the expression vector pET23-b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting construct, which added eight amino acids (LEHHHHHH) to the C terminus of LeAOS3, was transformed into E. coli host strain BL21(DE3). His-tagged recombinant LeAOS3 was expressed in BL21(DE3) host cells as follows. An overnight culture (2 ml) of bacteria was inoculated into 200 ml of Terrific Broth (TB) medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in a shaker at 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5. Cultures were cooled to 25 °C, and isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Induced cultures were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C with gentle shaking (120 rpm). Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until further use. Purification of recombinant LeAOS3 was performed as described previously (23Itoh A. Howe A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3620-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Following centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min) of the cleared E. coli lysate, the recombinant protein was solubilized from the particulate fraction using 1.5% Triton X-100R. Solubilized protein was further purified using TALON metal affinity column (cobalt-based IMAC, Clontech) and subsequent elution with imidazole. Imidazole was removed from the protein sample using a 2.5-ml spin column prepared with Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5% glycerol, and 0.02% Triton X-100R. Protein measurements were performed using a BCA assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. The relative purity of recombinant LeAOS3 was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide) and staining of gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Affinity-purified LeAOS3 (30 μg of protein) was incubated with 250 μg of fatty acid hydroperoxide substrate (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) in 1 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5% (v/v) glycerol. Reactions proceeded for 5 min at 25 °C and then were stopped by acidification to pH 4.0 with 1 m citrate. Products were extracted twice with chloroform, dried under N2 gas, and resuspended in 0.25 ml of methanol. Compounds were methylated by treatment with ethereal diazomethane at 25 °C for 10 s and dried under N2 gas. Samples subjected to silylation were treated with 30 μl of the following mixture: pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/trimethylchlorosilane at a ratio of 2:1:2 (v/v/v) at 25 °C for 20 min (26Gemzell-Danielsson K. Hamberg M. Hum. Reprod. 1994; 9: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following removal of excess reagent under vacuum, the remaining residue was dissolved in hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously described (13Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The temperature program was initiated at 50 °C, ramped to 320 °C at 10 °C min−1, and maintained at 320 °C for 2 min. Stereochemical analysis of products was not attempted. However, it was noted that incubation of LeAOS3 with hydroperoxides yielded two cyclopentenone products, presumably diastereomers, which were separable by GC and gave identical mass spectra. The peak area of these two compounds was added together to compute the total cyclopentenone composition. The mass spectrum of 12-OPDA produced from LeAOS3-catalyzed metabolism of 13-HPOT was identical to that of an authentic 12-OPDA standard (Cayman Chemical). The hydroperoxide-metabolizing activity of recombinant LeAOS3 was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 234 nm resulting from disruption of the conjugated diene bond of the substrate (27Zimmerman D.C. Vick B.A. Plant Physiol. 1970; 46: 445-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic assays were performed at 30 °C in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 30 ng or 60 ng of purified LeAOS3 and varying concentrations of hydroperoxide substrate. Activity slopes obtained during the first 0.5 min of the reaction were used for calculation of kinetic parameters. Absorbance spectra were obtained using purified recombinant protein in 1 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Carbon monoxide treatments were performed by bubbling CO gas through the sample for 1 min. The protein was reduced by the addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite. RNA and DNA blot analyses were performed as previously described (13Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Itoh A. Howe A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3620-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from soil-grown plants or from seeds (4 days after imbibition) that were germinated on water-saturated filter paper. Hybridization signals on RNA blots were normalized to the signal obtained using a cDNA probe for translation initiation factoreIF4A mRNA, obtained from Clemson University (EST clone cLED1D24). Chromosome mapping of LeAOS3 was performed as previously described (23Itoh A. Howe A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3620-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), using a set of introgression lines that harbor defined segments of L. pennellii DNA in an otherwiseL. esculentum genetic background (28Eshed Y. Zamir D. Euphytica. 1994; 79: 175-179Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A RFLP that distinguishes LeAOS3 in L. pennellii from its homolog in L. esculentum was generated by digestion of genomic DNAs with DraI. LeAOS3 was mapped to the IL10-1 interval on chromosome 10 (Tomato Genetics Stock Center accession number LA3515). Hybridization of genomic DNA blots to an RFLP marker (TG103) known to map to this interval confirmed the identity of LA3515. A search of the tomato EST data base (www.tigr.org/tdb/lgi/) was conducted to identify potential new members of the CYP74 gene family in tomato. A tentative consensus sequence (29Quackenbush J. Liang F. Holt I. Pertea G. Upton J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), constructed from multiple overlapping EST clones, was identified that was similar to but clearly distinct from previously characterized CYP74 sequences in tomato and other plant species. DNA sequence analysis of one EST clone (cLEI16I12) revealed a 1772-bp cDNA insert that contained an open reading frame predicted to encode a 491-amino acid protein, having a calculated molecular weight of 55,513. In keeping with the previous nomenclature of tomato CYP74s (3Howe G.A. Schilmiller A.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and the biochemical characteristics of the protein (see below), we henceforth refer to the cDNA as LeAOS3 (L. esculentum AOS3). The deduced amino acid sequence of LeAOS3 showed several features that distinguish CYP74s from P-450 monooxygenases (Fig. 2). For example, the I-helix region of P-450 monooxygenases contains an invariant threonine residue that serves an important role in the binding and activation of oxygen (30Chappel C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 311-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 31Paquette S.M. Bak S. Feyereisen R. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All reported CYP74s, including LeAOS3, contain a small hydrophobic residue (I/A/V) at this position. The CYP74 consensus sequence for residues surrounding the cysteinyl heme ligand near the C terminus is NKQC(A/P)(G/A)K(D/N)XV. With the exception of a V → I substitution in the last position, this sequence is conserved in LeAOS3. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of LeAOS3 using the ChloroP program (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) suggested that the protein does not contain a predicted N-terminal targeting sequence that directs many, but not all (32Froehlich J.E. Itoh A. Howe G.A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 125: 306-317Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Maucher M. Hause B. Feussner I. Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Plant J. 2000; 21: 199-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CYP74 P-450s to the chloroplast. Phylogenetic analysis was used to gain insight into the functional relationship between LeAOS3 and extant members of the CYP74 family, which is comprised of four subfamilies (CYP74A through CYP74D). An unrooted neighbor-joining phylogeny indicated that CYP74 members fall into distinct groups that reflect, to a large extent, the known enzymatic identity and substrate specificity of individual members (Fig. 3). This phylogeny was in perfect agreement with that obtained using a maximum parsimony algorithm (not shown). The CYP74A subfamily, which forms a monophyletic cluster with monocots positioned basally to the dicots, consists mainly of AOSs that have specificity for 13-hydroperoxides (i.e. 13-AOSs). The CYP74B subfamily also forms a well defined group comprised of HPLs that have specificity for 13-hydroperoxides (i.e. 13-HPLs). CYP74C P450s from cucumber (CsHPL) and melon (CmHPL) are HPLs that have a preference, but not absolute specificity, for 9-hydroperoxides (33Matsui K. Ujita C. Fujimoto S. Wilkinson J. Hiatt B. Knauf V. Kajiwara T. Feussner I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,34Tijet N. Schneider C. Muller B.L. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Members of the CYP74D subfamily are DESs that have high specificity for 9-hydroperoxides (23Itoh A. Howe A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3620-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Stumpe M. Kandzia R. Göbel C. Rosahl S. Feussner I. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LeAOS3 was most similar to the mixed specificity HPLs (CYP74Cs) from melon (58% identity) and cucumber (57% identity). In accordance with cytochrome P-450 nomenclature, LeAOS3 was classified as a CYP74C and was assigned the name CYP74C3. 2D. Nelson, personal communication. The full-lengthLeAOS3 cDNA was subcloned into an expression vector (pET23-b) that adds a His6 tag to the C terminus of the protein. Following introduction of this construct into E. coli, recombinant LeAOS3 was expressed and purified using metal affinity chromatography. The majority of LeAOS3 was found in inclusion bodies in the 3,000 × g pellet after centrifugation of sonicated cells. Approximately 80% of enzyme activity found in the 3,000 × g supernatant was subsequently recovered in the 100,000 × g pellet, indicating that the active protein is associated with bacterial membranes. Solubilization of membranes with Triton X-100R followed by cobalt-affinity chromatography allowed purification of LeAOS3 to >95% homogeneity (Fig.4). The apparent molecular weight of His6-tagged LeAOS3, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was in good agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 56,578. The typical yield of affinity-purified LeAOS3 was 0.5 mg/liter of E. coli culture. A spectrophotometric assay (27Zimmerman D.C. Vick B.A. Plant Physiol. 1970; 46: 445-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine whether purified LeAOS3 could metabolize fatty acid hydroperoxides (Fig.5 A). The results showed that LeAOS3 was highly active against 9-HPOD. The enzyme also metabolized 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid (13-HPOD), albeit at a rate ∼12-fold lower than that observed for 9-HPOD. A similar preference for 9-hydroperoxy linolenic acid (9-HPOT) compared with 13-HPOT was also observed (not shown; see below). These results indicate that LeAOS3 is active against both 13- and 9-hydroperoxy fatty acids, but with a marked preference for the latter substrates. The UV spectra of the reaction product generated from 9-HPOD (Fig.5 B) and other hydroperoxides (data not shown) were featureless, indicating that the substrate (λmax = 234 nm) was largely consumed during the reaction, and that divinyl ethers (λmax = 250–253 nm) were not among the major products. LeAOS3 also showed no detectable HPL activity using an NADH-coupled assay (36Vick B.A. Lipids. 1991; 26: 315-320Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that readily detected products formed by the action of recombinant tomato HPL on 13-HPOT (data not shown and Ref. 13Howe G.A. Lee G.I. Itoh A. Li L. DeRocher A.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These results suggested that LeAOS3 possess neither DES nor HPL activity. To determine the enzymatic identity of LeAOS3, products generated from various substrates were converted to the corresponding methyl ester/TMS derivatives and subjected to GC-MS analysis (Fig.6 and TableI). The major product (77.2%) obtained from reaction with 9-HPOD gave a mass spectrum that was identical to the reported spectrum (20Grechkin A.N. Mukhtarova L.S. Hamberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for the α-ketol, 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12-octadecenoic acid (Fig. 6 A). The second most abundant (8.7%) product gave a mass spectrum identical to that reported (18Hamberg M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) for the cyclopentenone 10-OPEA (Fig. 6 B). A third product (Fig. 6 C), present in minor amounts (1.9%), was identified as the γ-ketol (10-oxo-13-hydroxy-11-octadecenoic acid) by comparison to published spectra of this compound (e.g. Ref. 20Grechkin A.N. Mukhtarova L.S. Hamberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because each of these products is known to arise from spontaneous hydrolysis of 9,10-EOD that is generated by the action of AOS on 9-HPOD (18Hamberg M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Grechkin A.N. Mukhtarova L.S. Hamberg M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we conclude that LeAOS3 is an AOS. Analysis of products derived from other hydro"

The complex contains at least one of three p160 coactivators (SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, or pCIP/RAC3/ACTR/AIB1/TRAM1), a histone acetyltransferase such as CBP or p300, and the histone methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1). Methylation of histone H3 and possibly other proteins in the transcription initiation complex by CARM1 occurs along with acetylation of histones and other proteins by CBP and p300 to help remodel chromatin structure and recruit RNA polymerase II. Here we show that other domains of CARM1 are required for the coactivator function of CARM1 in addition to the methyltransferase activity. The methyltransferase GRIP1, binding, and homo-oligomerization activities all reside in the central region of CARM1, which is highly conserved among the entire protein arginine methyltransferase family. In addition to this conserved domain, the unique N- and C-terminal regions of CARM1 were also required for enhancement of transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors. While the N-terminal region has no known activity at present, the C-terminal part of CARM1 contains an autonomous activation domain, suggesting that it interacts with other proteins that help to mediate CARM1 coactivator function.

The p160 coactivators bind directly and in a ligand-dependent manner to the C-terminal AF2 activation domains of NRs through three LXXLL motifs (where L is a leucine and X, any amino acid) located in the central part of the p160 polypeptide chain. The C-terminal region of the p160 coactivators can also interact with the N-terminal AF1 activation domains of some NRs (9Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A.

CBP and p300 contribute to chromatin remodeling by acetylating histones, and also acetylate other components of the transcription initiation complex (16Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M.

CBP and p300 can also bind directly to basal transcription factors and may thereby help to assemble the transcription initiation complex (12Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A.

Thus multiple domains of CBP and p300 apparently contribute to chromatin remodeling and recruitment/activation of RNA polymerase II. The activation domain AD2, located at the C terminus of p160 factors, binds CARM1, which belongs to a family of previously identified arginine-specific protein methyltransferases (PRMTs) (23Chen D.

CARM1 enhances nuclear receptor function in a p160-dependent manner in transient transfection assays. CARM1, p300/CBP, and a p160 coactivator can also form a ternary complex which functions synergistically to enhance NR function and requires the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 to do so (24Chen D.

Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity is supported by a catalytic core domain, which is highly conserved among PRMT family members and contains the AdoMet and arginine binding sites and a barrel-like domain (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved core region, each methyltransferase has a unique N-terminal region of variable size. However, CARM1 is the only member of the family to harbor unique domains at its N and C termini. The contribution of these additional domains to the function of the PRMTs is unknown, although some studies suggest that they may be involved in the specificity of protein substrate binding (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 30McBride A.E. Weiss V.H. Kim H.K. Hogle J.M. Silver P.A. J. Biol.

Previous studies indicate that while the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 is required for coactivator function, other unspecified domains also contribute (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the coactivator function of CARM1 depends on p160 coactivators (23Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 24Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol.

To better understand which activities and domains of CARM1 contribute to its coactivator function, we defined the locations of the methyltransferase, p160 binding, and homo-oligomerization domains, as well as an autonomous activation domain, with respect to the conserved central domain (amino acids 150–480) and the unique N- and C-terminal regions of CARM1. By testing deletion mutants of CARM1 lacking various domains, we identified multiple regions of CARM1, which are required for its coactivator function along with the methyltransferase and GRIP1 binding activities. Proteins with N-terminal hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope tags were expressed in transient mammalian cell transfections and in vitro from vector pSG5.HA which has SV40 and T7 promoters (23Chen D. Ma H.

CARM1 deletion mutants were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified CARM1 cDNA fragments flanked by a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′BglII site into EcoRI and BglII sites of pSG5.HA and into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pM (to make Gal4 DBD fusions) or pVP16 (Clontech) (to make VP16 fusions). pM.GRIP1 (encoding Gal4DBD-GRIP1) was described previously (9Ma H.

Bacterial expression vectors for glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to GRIP1 AD2 (consisting of the GRIP1 C-terminal amino acids 1121–1462) and CARM1 were described previously (9Ma H. Hong H.

To measure binding of35S-labeled proteins synthesized in vitro to GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads, GST pull-down assays were performed as previously described (36Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions: binding was conducted overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of the in vitro synthesis reaction in a 150-μl total volume of NETN buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfections of CV-1 cells (37Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) were performed in 12-well dishes as described previously (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with 1 μg of total DNA per well. Where indicated, medium was supplemented with 20 nm estradiol (E2) during the last 30 h of growth. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities are shown as the mean and range of variation of two transfected cell cultures. COS7 cells (37Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One million cells were seeded into 10-cm diameter cell dishes and transfected with Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with 5 μg of pSG5.HA plasmid encoding CARM1 wild type or CARM1 mutants. After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 40 h before harvest. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were frozen at −80 °C, thawed on ice, and clarified by centrifugation before incubation overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibody (clone 3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against the HA tag. Preblocked protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were recovered by rapid centrifugation, washed three times with NETN containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in HMT Buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA). In vitrohistone methylation assays were performed as follows: 3 μg of histone H3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated with immunoprecipitated methyltransferases and 7 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (specific activity 14.7 Ci/mmol) in 30 μl of HMT buffer for 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS loading buffer and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Ten percent of the immunoprecipitated methyltransferases from the transfected cells (see above) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (38Ding X.F. Anderson C.M. Ma H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 against the HA epitope at 100 ng/ml as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 160 ng/ml (1:2,500 dilution) as the secondary antibody. To determine which parts of CARM1 are required for its coactivator function, N- and C-terminal truncations were made near the boundaries between the conserved central domain of CARM1 and its unique N-terminal (amino acids 1–150) and C-terminal (amino acids 480–608) regions (Fig. 1 A). The coactivator activity of CARM1 and its mutants were tested with ER by transient transfection in CV-1 cells under two different conditions: with relatively high levels of transfected ER expression vector, where CARM1 cooperates with a p160 coactivator (23Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar); and at very low levels of transfected ER expression vector, where CARM1 functions synergistically with a p160 coactivator and p300, such that all three of these coactivators must be co-expressed with ER to achieve efficient activation of an estrogen-dependent reporter gene (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In both cases, the activity observed was shown previously to be completely dependent on the exposure of the cells to estradiol to activate ER. At the higher level of ER vector (5 ng), GRIP1 expression enhanced reporter gene activation by ligand-bound ER, and co-expression of full-length CARM1 resulted in a further enhancement approximately in proportion to the amount of CARM1 expression vector used (Fig.1 B). However, mutants lacking the N-terminal part of CARM1 (mutant 121–608) or the C-terminal part (mutants 3–460, 3–500, 3–580) had no effect on the reporter gene expression mediated by ER and GRIP1, suggesting that both ends of CARM1 contribute to its coactivator activity. With a low concentration of ER expression vector (0.1 ng), p300 had no effect on the transcriptional activity observed with ER and GRIP1, and CARM1 (in the absence of p300) caused an enhancement of only 2-fold (Fig. 1 C). However as previously described (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), expression of both CARM1 and p300 with GRIP1 resulted in a dramatic increase of ER-dependent reporter gene activity. Deletions of the unique N- or C-terminal part of CARM1 severely impaired the synergistic effect. Thus the unique N- and C-terminal regions of CARM1 are required for coactivator activity with ER under both tested conditions. The expression level of each mutant was similar to that of full-length CARM1, with the exception of CARM1 (121–608) (Fig. 1 A). The lack of coactivator activity of the CARM1-(121–608) fragment could be partly due to its lower expression. We also recognized that the deletions may disrupt the protein structure and thereby impair the function of domains that are still present in the mutant protein. To test this possibility, we examined whether other known functions of CARM1 remained intact in the various mutants. This line of experimentation also allowed us to assign specific functions of CARM1 to specific domains of the protein and thereby to explore the mechanisms by which the unique N- and C-terminal regions and the conserved central region of CARM1 contribute to the coactivator activity. The lack of coactivator activity of the CARM1 mutants could be due to their inability to bind GRIP1. Binding between GRIP1 and CARM1 is required for CARM1 coactivator function (24Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the GRIP1 binding domain of CARM1 has not been mapped. Full-length CARM1 and its deletion mutants were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with either GST or GST-GRIP1 AD2 fusion protein (consisting of the GRIP1 C-terminal amino acids 1122–1462), which were preloaded on glutathione-Sepharose beads. None of the CARM1 proteins bound to GST, but full-length CARM1 and several CARM1 fragments bound GST-GRIP1 AD2 (Fig.2 A). Deletion of the N terminus (amino acids 1–120) or the C terminus (amino acids 501–608 or 581–608) of CARM1 did not impair binding to GRIP1 AD2, showing that these domains are not required for the in vitro interaction. The CARM1 mutant lacking amino acids 461–608 was still retained by GST-GRIP1 AD2 but to a lesser extent. However, the CARM1 C-terminal region alone was not able to bind GRIP1 AD2. A mammalian two-hybrid assay confirmed these results (Fig. 2 B). These results localized the GRIP1 binding domain of CARM1 within the central conserved domain (amino acids 121–460) and demonstrated that the unique N- and C-terminal regions of CARM1 are neither necessary nor sufficient for the interaction with GRIP1. Full-length CARM1 and its deletion mutants were expressed in COS7 cells by transient transfection, isolated by immunoprecipitation, and incubated with histone H3 in the presence of [methyl-3H]AdoMet; methylated histone H3 was detected by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig.3). The mutant lacking the N-terminal part of CARM1 (amino acids 1–120) or the C-terminal region (amino acids 501–608) still methylated histone H3 efficiently, showing that these unique domains were not required for the enzymatic activity of CARM1, at least in vitro. The lower activity of CARM1-(121–608) was due to its lower expression level (Fig.1 A). However, the mutant lacking amino acids 461–608, which includes a small portion of the central conserved domain, was inactive. The unique C-terminal region (amino acids 461–608) by itself did not exhibit any enzymatic activity. Thus, the methyltransferase activity resides within amino acids 121–500. To localize the homo-oligomerization domain, we tested the ability of the CARM1 deletion mutants to interact with wild type CARM1. All mutants lacking N- and C-terminal amino acids were retained by the bead-bound GST-CARM1 fusion protein, although CARM1-(3–460) bound very weakly compared with wild type CARM1 (Fig.4 A); thus the unique ends of CARM1 are not required for its homo-oligomerization in vitro. Furthermore, by itself the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 461–608) did not bind to GST-CARM1. Mammalian two-hybrid assays produced very similar results in vivo (Fig. 4 B). We, therefore, located the CARM1 homo-oligomerization domain in the conserved central part of the protein along with the methyltransferase and GRIP1 binding activities. Since the unique N- and C-terminal regions of CARM1 were important for its coactivator function but played no role in its methyltransferase, GRIP1-binding, or homo-oligomerization activities, we tested whether these unique regions might contain an autonomous activation function. CARM1 mutants fused to the Gal4 DBD were tested for their ability to activate expression of a reporter gene controlled by Gal4 response elements (Fig.5). Fusion of full-length CARM1 to the Gal4 DBD enhanced the reporter gene expression, indicating the presence of an autonomous transactivation domain somewhere in the CARM1 protein. A mutant deficient in methyltransferase activity (C1 VLD) (23Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) fused to Gal4 DBD also increased the transcription driven by Gal4 response elements. This suggests that the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 is not necessary for the observed transcriptional activation activity. A mutant constituted only by the N-terminal part of CARM1 (amino acids 3–126) had little or no ability to increase the reporter gene expression. The mutant 121–608 was almost as effective as full-length CARM1, thus showing that the N-terminal part was not involved in the activity. Mutants lacking the C-terminal part of CARM1 (mutants 3–500; 3–580) were also active but to a lesser extent than full-length CARM1. Moreover, deletion of residues 461–608 totally abolished the autonomous transactivation activity of CARM1. Finally, the CARM1 fragments 461–608 and 501–608 exhibited activity ten times that of wild type CARM1, indicating that CARM1 contains a strong autonomous activation domain in its unique C-terminal region (Fig. 5, right panel). The C-terminal activation domain of CARM1 may contribute to coactivator function through protein-protein interactions with some important component of the transcription machinery. If so, overexpression of the isolated C-terminal domain might inhibit the coactivator function of full-length CARM1 by competing with CARM1 for the interaction with this transcription machinery component. CARM1-C (amino acids 461–608) strongly inhibited the coactivator effect of CARM1 on the hormone-dependent, ER-mediated activation of reporter gene expression (Fig. 6 A,upper panel). CARM1-C had little or no effect on the basal ER activity observed in the absence of hormone. The specificity of the inhibitory effect was also demonstrated by the fact that CARM1-C had no effect on the expression of a RSV promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter gene, which was tested in a parallel experiment (lower panel). CARM1-C also inhibited the autonomous transactivation activity of full-length CARM1 fused to Gal4 DBD (Fig. 6 B,left panel). In contrast full-length CARM1, used as a positive control, enhanced the activity of the Gal4-CARM1 fusion protein, presumably through homo-oligomerization. In a mammalian two-hybrid assay, the interaction of Gal4-CARM1 with VP16-CARM1 was only slightly inhibited by CARM1-C (Fig. 6 B, right panel), consistent with our previous finding that CARM1-C cannot bind to full-length CARM1 (Fig. 4). Thus, the negative effect of CARM1-C on the autonomous activation activity of CARM1 is not caused by a disruption of the homo-oligomer but could rather be because of a competition of CARM1-C with CARM1 for the interaction with another transcription factor that binds CARM1-C. CARM1 belongs to the PRMT family of arginine-specific protein methyltransferases, which share a conserved core region of about 330 amino acids that contains the methyltransferase activity. X-ray crystallography of mammalian PRMT3 and yeast Rmt1/Hmt1 demonstrated that the conserved region forms two separate structural domains that combine to form the active enzyme (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 39Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) (Fig.7). The N-terminal part, which is the most highly conserved in primary amino acid sequence among family members, is composed of mixed α-helices and β-strands. The C-terminal part of the core forms an elongated 9-stranded β-barrel structure. Homodimerization is apparently required to form an active enzyme. The dimer interface is formed by reciprocal contact between the α/β region of one monomer and a tri-helical arm extending from the surface of the β-barrel structure of the other monomer. The AdoMet binding pocket is formed by the α/β region. The arginine residue of the protein substrate binds in an acidic pocket containing two glutamate residues, which interact directly with the two terminal amino groups of the arginine side chain. The portions of the protein substrate surrounding the target arginine residue are predicted to fit in a groove between the α/β region and the β-barrel structure (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 39Weiss V.H. McBride A.E. Soriano M.A. Filman D.J. Silver P.A. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1165-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). As expected from the three-dimensional structure and the high degree of conservation among PRMT members, our studies located the methyltransferase and homo-oligomerization activities of CARM1 approximately within the conserved region (amino acids 150–480 of CARM1) (Figs. 3, 4, and 7). A C-terminal deletion to amino acid 460, which removed the last β-strand of the β-barrel structure, eliminated the methyltransferase activity and thus demonstrated that the entire conserved barrel structure is required for methyltransferase activity. The C-terminal β-strand may contribute to structural integrity of the entire domain or could help to form the protein substrate-binding groove. The same deletion mutant retained partial-to-full homo-oligomerization and GRIP1 binding activity (Figs.2 and 4), indicating that structural integrity was not completely disrupted. Our finding that the central conserved region of CARM1 also contained the GRIP1 binding activity (Figs. 2 and 7) is consistent with previous findings that multiple members of the PRMT family can bind to the C-terminal region of GRIP1 (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The GRIP1 binding activity of CARM1 is undoubtedly required for the coactivator function of CARM1, since we previously showed that the presence of GRIP1 and its C-terminal CARM1-binding region are required for the coactivator function of CARM1 (23Chen D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). While CARM1 shares homology with the PRMT family throughout the methyltransferase domain, CARM1 has a unique set of protein substrates, including histone H3 and p300/CBP (23Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 40Xu W. Chen H. Du K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In addition, CARM1 is the only PRMT member tested to date which can cooperate synergistically with p300, CBP, or p/CAF to enhance transcriptional activation by NRs (25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the coactivator function of CARM1 depends on its methyltransferase activity (23Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 25Lee Y.H. Koh S.S. Zhang X. Cheng X. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3621-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that steroid hormones stimulate recruitment of CARM1 and methylation of histone H3 in a CARM1-specific manner at promoters of stably integrated, steroid hormone-responsive genes (27Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, the unique transcriptional coactivator function of CARM1 is at least partly due to its unique methyltransferase substrate specificity. Deletion of the unique N- or C-terminal part of CARM1 totally abolished its coactivator function (Fig. 1), but had no effect on its ability to bind GRIP1 (Fig. 2), methylate histone H3 (Fig. 3), or form homo-oligomers (Fig. 4). Thus the unique N- and C-terminal regions must contribute to the coactivator function of CARM1 through a novel mechanism not involving any of these three activities. To date little is known about the functions of the unique N termini of PRMT family members; these unique N termini vary greatly in length as well as sequence (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the relatively short N terminus of mammalian PRMT1 and yeast Rmt1/Hmt1 may contribute to methyltransferase substrate specificity by interacting with regions of the substrate protein distinct from the sequence immediately surrounding the target arginine residue (29Zhang X. Zhou L. Cheng X. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 30McBride A.E. Weiss V.H. Kim H.K. Hogle J.M. Silver P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of the relatively long unique N terminus of PRMT3 altered its substrate specificity in vitro (33Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32974-32982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, mutants of CARM1 lacking the unique N- or C-terminal regions appeared to be unaffected in their ability to methylate histone H3 (Fig. 3) and several other protein substrates that we tested. 2C. Teyssier and M. R. Stallcup, unpublished results. We also found that the N terminus of CARM1 did not contribute to the autonomous transcriptional activation activity of CARM1 (Fig. 5). Thus the mechanism by which the N-terminal region of CARM1 contributes to coactivator function remains unclear. While the unique C-terminal part of CARM1 was not required for GRIP1 binding, methyltransferase, or homo-oligomerization activities, it contains a strong autonomous activation domain (Fig. 5), which presumably explains why this domain is necessary for the coactivator function of CARM1. CARM1 mutants lacking this domain were almost devoid of a transcriptional activation activity when fused to Gal4 DBD, indicating that the C terminus is responsible for most or all of the autonomous transactivation activity observed in full-length CARM1. The ineffective autonomous transcriptional activation activity associated with the mutants lacking the C-terminal region indicates that the methyltransferase activity per se is not sufficient for transcriptional activation (Fig. 5). PRMT1, which lacks a unique C-terminal domain and has a very short unique N-terminal domain, also exhibits no autonomous activation activity when fused to Gal4 DBD (36Koh S.S. Chen D. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, although CARM1 methylates histone H3 and PRMT1 methylates histone H4, the simple recruitment of a histone methyltransferase activity to the promoter of a transient reporter gene is not sufficient to activate transcription. This is also consistent with our findings that the unique terminal domains of CARM1 are required in addition to the methyltransferase activity for the coactivator function of CARM1. As a model for CARM1 function, we propose that CARM1 is recruited to the promoter through its interaction with the C-terminal domain of a p160 coactivator. The autonomous activation activity of the CARM1 C-terminal domain collaborates with the methyltransferase activity of the central domain and possibly an unknown activity in the unique N-terminal domain, to mediate the coactivator function of CARM1. The methyltransferase activity is responsible for the methylation of histone H3, which presumably contributes to chromatin remodeling. In addition, CARM1 may methylate other protein components of the transcription machinery. We propose that the autonomous activation activity of the C-terminal domain is due to its ability to interact with other proteins in the transcription machinery. For example, CARM1-C could interact with a component of the basal transcription machinery and thereby help to recruit RNA polymerase II; or CARM1-C could interact with another, currently unknown, coactivator and thereby recruit or maintain the additional coactivator in the complex with GRIP1, CARM1, and p300. The ability of the co-expressed C-terminal fragment of CARM1 to inhibit the coactivator function of full-length CARM1 (Fig. 6) supports our proposal that this region binds an important factor that contributes to the transcriptional activation process. Thus, once bound to the promoter, CARM1 contributes to the transcriptional activation process through multiple downstream signaling mechanisms, i.e. through methylation of histones and possibly other proteins and through protein-protein interactions mediated by the unique C-terminal and possibly N-terminal domains. The use of multiple downstream signaling mechanisms by a single coactivator is not unique to CARM1. The coactivators p300, CBP, and p/CAF have multiple protein-protein interaction domains which also contribute to their coactivator function in collaboration with their histone acetyltransferase activities (12Chen H.

https://openalex.org/W1596574891,"Abstract Activated forms of l-homoserine have been shown to be more readily utilized as substrates than homoserine for the homocysteine synthetases (enzymes which catalyze the formation of homocysteine from homoserine and sulfide in the presence of pyridoxal phosphate) of Neurospora crassa, yeast, and Escherichia coli KB. This substrate preference is shown by the increased specific activities of the enzyme reactions. Specificity for the type of acylated derivative of homoserine is apparent. Enzymes from the fungi preferentially utilize O-acetyl-l-homoserine, and the enzyme from the bacterium requires O-succinyl-l-homoserine. Methionineless mutants of Neurospora contain homocysteine synthetases with specific activities nearly equivalent to those of the wild type when the substrate is O-acetylhomoserine. End product feedback inhibition by l-methionine on the homocysteine synthetases, when the substrates used were acyl derivatives of homoserine, is described for the enzymes from Neurospora and yeast, but was not demonstrated with the enzyme from E. coli. O-Acetyl-l-serine is a required substrate for cysteine synthesis by an enzyme from E. coli KB. Some preference for O-acetylserine was exhibited by the enzyme from yeast; however, cysteine synthetase from Neurospora showed no marked preference for this compound over serine."

An early model represented the events leading to stimulation of MAP kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; RT, reverse transcriptase; DSFM, Drosophila serum-free medium; RNAi, RNA interference as the sequential activation of a linear series of steps from ligand through receptor and signaling intermediates to MAPK (1Ullrich A.

This paradigm arose in part from studies of the pheromone mating pathway and other MAPK pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the view was further substantiated by early work on regulation of ERK2 by growth factors. The paradigm was revised as it was recognized that diverse receptors may use different proximal signaling mechanisms to funnel into the three-protein kinase cascade, which became known as a MAPK module (3Neiman A.M. Stevenson B.J. Xu H.-P. Sprague G.F.J. Herskowitz I. Wigler M. Marcus S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 4Anderson N.G. Kilgour E. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this three-tiered module, MAPKs are controlled by a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) which activates a MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K, also called MKK or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)) which activates the MAPK. The MAP3K was viewed as the point of convergence of these different receptor mechanisms (3Neiman A.M. Stevenson B.J. Xu H.-P. Sprague G.F.J. Herskowitz I. Wigler M. Marcus S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The limited number of MAP2K family members, their remarkable substrate selectivity among MAPKs, and the kinetic properties conferred on MAPK regulation via the MAP2Ks strongly support the idea that MAPKs and their cognate MAP2Ks form modules (6Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ferrell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 460-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, the MAP3Ks have, thus far, resisted placement in single cascades. First, the number of putative MAP3Ks exceeds the number of MAP2Ks or MAPKs (8Plowman G.D. Sudarsanam S. Bingham J. Whyte D. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13603-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Second, many of these MAP3Ks, when overexpressed, share the capacity to activate more than one MAPK and in some cases other pathways. Consistent with this finding, in vitro MAP3Ks display overlapping specificity in that they phosphorylate and activate MAP2Ks from different modules (9Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These observations require a further re-evaluation of the model. Two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, might account for the diversity of the MAP3Ks. One possibility is that individual MAP3Ks may be coupled exclusively to activation by a specific type of ligand, i.e. a different MAP3K for each type of ligand. This would imply that a specific three-kinase module (containing the same MAP2K and MAPK) would be dedicated to mediate the functions of each ligand type. In this case, the apparently relaxed specificity of the MAP3Ks might be attributable to an artifact of overexpression. A second possibility is that specific ligands may employ multiple MAP3Ks, which may control multiple MAPKs and other signaling events, to generate the necessary set of responses. If this is so, then signals converge not on the MAP3Ks but on the MAP2Ks of a two-kinase module (14Zanke B.W. Rubie E.A. Winnett E. Chan J. Randall S. Parsons M. Boudreau K. McInnis M. Yan M. Templeton D.J. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29876-29881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the apparently relaxed specificity of the MAP3Ks is an intrinsic property of the signal transduction mechanism of the ligand. To test these ideas, we examined the control of the MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in Drosophila S2 cells. We searched the Fly Data Base to find MAP3Ks and other proteins implicated upstream in regulating JNK in mammalian cells and the fly and asked if any of these molecules are involved in JNK activation in S2 cells using RNA interference (RNAi) (15Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). We found that the pro-inflammatory molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS) uses a single MAP3K, whereas the osmotic stresses sorbitol and NaCl use multiple MAP3Ks to activateDrosophila JNK. These and other findings support both models above; LPS targets a discrete MAP3K module, whereas signals from osmotic stresses target multiple MAP3Ks to converge on a conserved MAP2K-MAPK module. Thus, distinct stimuli regulate JNK through disparate signal transduction mechanisms. Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells were cultured in 1× Drosophila serum-free medium (DSFM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) and 0.1% gentamycin (Sigma) in 100-mm2 dishes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated from 106 S2 cells using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperscriptTM First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). To choose candidates for RNAi, the BDGP-FlyBase (a data base of the Drosophila genome) was searched to identify fly homologs of the indicated proteins (Table I); full-length sequences of candidates were aligned with mammalian proteins to determine sequence similarities. The primers for RT-PCR are shown in Table I and include a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase-binding site (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA). The indicated primers were used both in amplifying DNA template for transcription of dsRNA and in RT-PCR for detecting the expression of genes. The following PCR program was used: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min) and an additional 10 min at 72 °C.

After 3 days of incubation with dsRNAs, cells were lysed in 0.2 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa2V3O4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 10 min. Clarified lysates were collected by microcentrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. 30 μg of lysate protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies that recognize JNK from multiple species (O977 (17Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from 300 μg of lysate protein with antibody O977 and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (1 m NaCl, 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), and one time with 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0.

InDrosophila the JNK pathway has been found to be essential not only in cell shape changes required for dorsal closure during embryonic development but also in cell polarity and immunity in the adult (19Stronach B.E. Perrimon N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6172-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutants have been generated with defects in dorsal closure, identifying molecules necessary for this process. Several of these molecules are likely to lie upstream in the JNK pathway; these include the following: MKK7 (hep), the MAP3Ks, TAK1 and MLK2 (slipper); misshapen (Msn), a MAP4K ortholog of the Nck-interacting kinase NIK; and the small G proteins, Drac1, Dcdc42, and DRho1 (20Noselli S.

To study pathways regulating JNK (Basket, Bsk) activity in cultured S2 cells, we first determined the effects of different stimuli on JNK activity in these cells. JNK activity was assessed by immune complex kinase assay and by immunoblotting lysates with antibodies that recognize the active, doubly phosphorylated form of JNK. Both assays demonstrated that LPS (50 μg/ml for 10 min) and sorbitol (0.4 m for 30 min) elicited strong activation of JNK in S2 cells (Fig.1). Several agents that cause marked increases in JNK activity in mammalian cells, including UV light and anisomycin, had no effect on JNK in S2 cells. Trace JNK activation was noted only by immune complex kinase assay of extracts from cells treated with insulin and phorbol ester. Taxol and nocodazole, which have little effect on JNK activity in most mammalian cells, also had little effect on JNK in fly cells. Neither the ERK2 ortholog ERKA nor p38 were activated by sorbitol or LPS in these cells (not shown and see Fig. 2 B).Figure 2MKK4 and MKK7 are required for JNK activation by LPS and sorbitol. S2 cells were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of dsRNA specific to JNK, MKK7, MKK4, or MKK7 plus MKK4 for 3 days. A, total RNA was isolated. Expression of MKK4 and MKK7 was detected by RT-PCR with specific primers. cDNA from control cells and cells treated with dsRNA suppressing MKK7 (m7+), MKK4 (m4+), or both as indicated.B, prior to harvest, cells previously exposed to oligonucleotides directed against the indicated molecules were either untreated or stimulated with 50 μg/ml LPS for 10 min.

To examine the explicit contribution of these kinases to JNK activation, we inhibited their expression using RNAi (Table I). JNK was also knocked down as a control. Reducing the expression of either MKK4 or MKK7 (Fig. 2 A) only partially inhibited JNK activation in response to LPS or sorbitol (Fig. 2, B and C). If both MKK7 and MKK4 were suppressed in the same cells, JNK activation was inhibited below the limit of detection. These results indicate that MKK7 and MKK4 must both be present to elicit maximal activation of JNK in response to these stimuli (Fig. 2, B andC). Multiple mammalian MAP3Ks have been linked to JNK activation, based on in vitro reconstitution with MKKs 4 and 7 or by overexpression in transfected cells. Analysis of the fly data base revealed six fly MAP3Ks, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1) (30Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E.

Expression of two of these, PKN and DLK, was not detected in S2 cells (data not shown). RNAi-mediated silencing of the other four MAP3Ks was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig.3 A). Stimulation of JNK activity by LPS was unaffected by silencing of MLK2, ASK1, or MEKK1. On the other hand, no JNK activity was detected in lysates of cells in which expression of TAK1 was suppressed (Fig. 3 B), indicating that TAK1, but none of the other MAP3Ks tested, is required for activation of JNK by LPS. The elimination of these MAP3Ks had no effect on the activity of the p38 MAPK (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to signaling by LPS, no single MAP3K was essential for JNK activation by sorbitol (Fig. 3 C). This suggested either that none of the four MAP3Ks tested were involved in the sorbitol signal to JNK or that multiple MAP3Ks work in this pathway. To evaluate the possibility that multiple MAP3Ks were involved in JNK activation, S2 cells were treated with the four dsRNAs in the indicated combinations (Fig.4 A). Suppressing the expression of all four of the MAP3Ks simultaneously blocked JNK activation by sorbitol (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of cells with two or three of the four dsRNAs reduced but did not completely block stimulation of JNK by sorbitol (Fig. 4 B and not shown). In experiments mentioned below, as many as six different dsRNAs were added to the cells at one time with no loss of phospho-JNK signal. Therefore, the loss of signal apparent in Fig. 4 B is not due to a nonspecific effect on JNK. Activation of the JNK pathway has been reported to involve the small GTPases Ras, Rac, Cdc42, Ral, and Rho in a cell-type and stimulus-dependent manner (39Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T.

To test whether small GTPases are involved in JNK activation in S2 cells, seven small G proteins from the fly, counterparts of mammalian Ras, Ral, and Rho family members, were silenced by RNAi. Inhibiting the expression of the small G proteins, individually or in combinations, had no influence on JNK activation by LPS (data not shown); this finding is consistent with studies in mammalian cells that suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines act through receptor-adaptor-MAP3K complexes to activate JNK (46Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In contrast, maximal stimulation of JNK activity by sorbitol required Ras (Fig. 5 A). Inhibition of JNK was proportional to the amount of dsRNA directed at Ras incubated with the cells (not shown). No consistent effects of the other small G proteins were detected, either separately or in combination (data not shown). We probed the mechanism of JNK activation by the osmotic stress NaCl to determine whether there are common elements in signal transduction by osmotic perturbation. As was the case for sorbitol, no single MAP3K was essential to prevent JNK activation by NaCl (0.4m, 10 min), but suppression of all four greatly reduced JNK activation by NaCl (Fig. 5 B), indicating that NaCl, like sorbitol, uses multiple MAP3Ks to activate JNK. Suppression of Ras, however, had little or no effect on JNK activation by NaCl, indicating that NaCl, unlike sorbitol, does not activate JNK primarily through Ras (Fig. 5 A). JNKs are also known as stress-activated protein kinases because of their sensitivity to environmental stresses (e.g.hyperosmolarity and radiation), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1), and biosynthetic inhibitors (e.g. anisomycin) (6Lewis T.S.

A variety of agents stimulate the JNK pathway, yet the intracellular signal transduction pathways that lead to JNK activation in response to any particular stimulus have not been determined. In mammalian cells, MKK4 and MKK7 are the two MAP2K family members that directly phosphorylate JNK based on extensive biochemical studies and gene disruption; they may have discrete biological functions or act simultaneously in JNK activation (49Lin A.

Although we assume these MAP3Ks act in the JNK pathway as MAP2K kinases, they may also have other functions that contribute to pathway control (e.g. see Ref. 58Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, by using RNAi, we have been able to define the explicit contributions of MAP3Ks and MAP2Ks to activation of the JNK cascade by three different agents in a cell culture system (Fig.6). At the MAP2K level, both MKK7 and MKK4 are required for maximal JNK activation by either LPS or sorbitol, consistent with their having non-redundant contributions to JNK activation. In vitro experiments have suggested that MKK4 selectively catalyzes the phosphorylation of the tyrosine of JNK, whereas MKK7 catalyzes phosphorylation of the threonine of JNK (52Lawler S. Fleming Y. Goedert M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1387-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); both residues must be phosphorylated to maximally activate it (39Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the presence of either of the MAP2Ks is sufficient to mediate phosphorylation of both JNK residues, although the amount of JNK activated is reduced by the absence of either. In contrast to the MAP2K level, at the MAP3K level, stimuli use different MAP3Ks to mediate JNK activation. Remarkably, only TAK1 is required for LPS-stimulated JNK activity. Preliminary experiments in HeLa cells also suggest a significant role for TAK1 in regulating the JNK pathway. 2W. Chen and M. H. Cobb, unpublished data. The requirement for a single MAP3K fits the model in which individual signals are linked to single MAP3Ks. Interestingly, TAK1 was originally identified as an activator of p38 MAPK and has recently been shown to be a major IκB kinase kinase, implicating it in control of NF-κB (30Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 59Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Our studies reveal that it has a prominent role in the JNK pathway, bolstering the idea that activation of TAK1 will impact multiple intracellular signaling systems. On the other hand, four MAP3Ks contribute to JNK activation by sorbitol or NaCl. Although sorbitol and NaCl are widely studied as perturbations because of their significance as pathophysiologic agents, for example in diabetes (60Wallner E.I. Wada J. Tramonti G. Lin S. Srivastava S.K. Kanwar Y.S. Renal Fail. 2001; 23: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), few studies explore how they influence signaling pathways (61Sajan M.P. Bandyopadhyay G. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Quon M.J. Reed B.C. Dikic I. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study we determined that both agents activated multiple MAP3Ks through different upstream mechanisms as discussed further below. Despite the fact that sorbitol has major effects on cells via osmotic stress, some sorbitol-stimulated signal transduction events may be mediated through effects on membrane receptors. 3E. Gallagher, C. Wells, M. Karandikar, P. C. Sternweis, and M. H. Cobb, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the effects of sorbitol may be representative of the actions of other more conventional ligands. If this is so, the findings here also support the second model in which single ligands may employ multiple MAP3Ks. The required contribution of multiple MAP3Ks may be important to couple a more diverse group of signaling pathways to the regulatory events induced by sorbitol or may allow quantitatively different contributions from a largely overlapping set of pathways. In mammalian cells, small GTPase proteins are important upstream components in the JNK signaling cascades (62Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5228) Google Scholar, 63Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 64Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found no evidence linking any small G proteins to activation of JNK by LPS. In contrast, the small G protein Ras made a demonstrable contribution to JNK activation by sorbitol. This linkage recapitulates the linkage between Ras and c-Jun in oncogenesis and the original identification of JNK as a Ras-sensitive regulator of c-Jun (65Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the dependence on small G proteins such as Ras may be a general feature of agents that activate multiple MAP3Ks. To test this idea, we compared the requirements for signaling by sorbitol and NaCl to determine whether Ras is a common intermediate. JNK activation by both agents was mediated by multiple MAP3Ks; however, whereas the upstream signal from sorbitol is conveyed to the kinase cascade by Ras, NaCl activates JNK in a manner largely or entirely independent of Ras. Thus, these two osmotic stresses employ distinct mechanisms of action, and the ability to communicate to multiple MAP3Ks does not necessarily depend on the same small G proteins. Many kinases acting at the MAP3K level have been identified, adding to the complexity of unraveling signaling mechanisms. There is no apparent similarity among these proteins outside of their kinase catalytic domains, which display only minimal identity. The relative contribution of each MAP3K to the activation of individual MAPKs, with the possible exception of Raf in the ERK1/2 module, is unclear. A specific MAP3K enzyme may regulate either a single or multiple MAP2Ks; this may depend upon the enzymatic specificity of the MAP3K, the cellular and subcellular distribution of the signaling components, and the formation of protein complexes. Some signals may utilize multiple MAP3Ks acting in concert. Consequently, significant differences in both the magnitude and kinetics of MAPK activation may occur in response to a given agent under different circumstances. The implication of our findings for JNK activation is that different MAP3Ks regulate JNK in response to different stimuli. In the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway, Raf isoforms appear to be the predominant MAP3Ks used by ligands to activate ERK1/2. In contrast, our findings suggest that MAP3Ks that are only modestly related may be required for JNK activation by different stimuli and that these enzymes may participate singly or in combination in stimulus-specific signal transduction pathways.

ClpB from Thermus thermophilus is a member of the AAA protein superfamily that is important for a variety of biological activities (1Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Google Scholar). Despite their different cellular functions AAA proteins (ATPases associated with a variety of cellularactivities) employ a general mechanism. They mediate the assembly and disassembly of large protein complexes that are involved in processes like DNA replication, vesicle transport, or organelle biogenesis. The AAA protein superfamily comprises the Clp/Hsp100 proteins with its members ClpA, ClpX, and ClpY on the one hand and ClpB on the other. ClpA, ClpX, and ClpY (HslU) interact with cellular peptidases to form ATP-dependent proteases. The role of these Clp proteins is the unfolding of substrates and the delivery of unfolded polypeptides to the protease subunit. In contrast ClpB from Escherichia coli and T. thermophilus and theSaccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Hsp104 do not appear to bind to cellular proteases. Instead they interact with the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system to assist the disaggregation of protein aggregates (2Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Google Scholar, 3Mogk A. Tomoyasu T.

Clp proteins are further classified according to the number of nucleotide binding domains (NBD), 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; DTE, dithioerythritol; MANT, 2′(3′)-O-N′-methylanthraniloyl; N-domain, N-terminal domain; C-domain, C-terminal domain; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide binding domain; DTE, dithioerythritol; MANT, 2′(3′)-O-N′-methylanthraniloyl; N-domain, N-terminal domain; C-domain, C-terminal domain; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid which are 220–250 amino acids in length and show a high level of sequence homology. Class two proteins contain only one NBD whereas the class one members ClpA and ClpB contain two NBDs. In ClpB and Hsp104 ATP hydrolysis at both NBDs was shown to be necessary for the chaperone activity of the Clp proteins (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol.

Structural information on the class two protein HslU (ClpY) and the hexamerization domain (D2) of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein give insight into the domain architecture of AAA proteins (9Bochtler M.

These crystal structures show ring-shaped oligomers composed of six monomers. The AAA modules of both proteins show a similar overall structure, consisting of the core NBD and a C-terminal, mostly helical, domain. The core NBD contains the Rossman fold including the phosphate binding loop of ATP- and GTP-binding proteins, which consists of five central β-sheets flanked by α-helices. In the case of HslU an additional helical domain is inserted in the NBD that is not present in other Clp proteins. In ClpBEco the C-terminal domain of the second AAA cassette was shown to be important for oligomerization, ATPase activity, and chaperone function (12Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Google Scholar). Isolated C-domains of ClpA, ClpX, and ClpY, which associate with peptidases, were found to interact with different substrate proteins in vivo. Therefore the C-terminal domains were proposed to be sensor and substrate discrimination domains although the C-terminal domains show only little sequence homology between different Clp proteins (13Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Google Scholar). The class one Clp proteins have, in addition, an N-terminal domain that precedes the first NBD. The ClpA and ClpB mRNAs of E. coli contain internal translation initiation sites and are expressed in vivo as two gene products: the full-length proteins and shortened versions lacking the N-terminal domain (14Squires C.L. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Google Scholar, 15Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Kim K.I. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29468-29473Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains are supposed to consist of two ∼75-amino acids-long repeats that can fold independently (16Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Google Scholar, 17Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Google Scholar). For ClpAEco it was shown that the N-terminal domain is associated only weakly with the rest of the molecule, and a mutant lacking the N-terminal domain showed a reduced unfolding activity depending on the substrate protein tested (16Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Google Scholar, 18Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Google Scholar). Recently an interaction of the N terminus with the proposed ClpA modulator protein ClpS was reported (19Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Google Scholar). Similar results were reported for the N-domain of ClpBEco, which did not interact strongly with the shortened ClpB variant (17Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Google Scholar). The N-terminally shortened ClpB from E. coli was shown to be inactive as a chaperone but retained its oligomerization capacity and ATPase activity in vitro (12Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Google Scholar). The shortened protein version, however, can restore bacterial thermo-tolerance in vivo (20Clarke A.K. Eriksson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7092-7096Google Scholar). In this study we focused on the function of the N-terminal domain of ClpB from T. thermophilus and its interactions with substrate proteins. Assigning the individual functions to the different ClpB domains can help to reveal the currently unknown mechanism of protein disaggregation by the ClpB/DnaK system. The DNA fragment encoding ClpBΔN (amino acids 140–854) was generated by PCR using the pRS-ClpB plasmid as a template (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). The forward primer was GACTGCTAAGCATATGGTGCAGACGGAACACGCGGAAAGC, and the reverse primer was (T7 terminator) CTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGTGGC. The PCR product was subcloned between the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites of NdeI/EcoRI digested pET27b(+) vector (Novagen). The integrity of the sequence generated by PCR amplification was verified by DNA sequencing. ClpB and ClpBΔN were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The purification was performed according to the protocol for the wild type (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE from T. thermophilus were purified as described previously (21Klostermeier D. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 511-525Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the method of Ehresmann et al. (22Ehresmann B. Imbault P. Weil J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 454-463Google Scholar). If not noted otherwise all protein concentrations refer to monomers. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco-J710 spectropolarimeter in 0.02-cm cuvettes at a scan rate of 20 nm/min, 0.2-nm resolution, 1-nm bandwidth, a time constant of 1 s, and a sensitivity of 20 millidegrees. Nucleotide affinities were determined using an SLM 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). The fluorescent values were plotted against the ClpB concentration, and the data were analyzed with the quadratic equation using Grafit, Version 3.01 (23Reinstein J. Vetter I.R. Schlichting I. Rösch P. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7440-7450Google Scholar). The equilibrium displacements of fluorescent nucleotides by unlabeled nucleotides were fitted to a cubic equation (24Thrall S.H. Reinstein J. Wöhrl B.M. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4609-4618Google Scholar). Binding of ClpB to FITC-casein Type I (Sigma) was monitored using an SLM Aminco Series 2 spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was 490 nm, and the emission wavelength was 520 nm. Increasing amounts of protein were added to 0.1 mg/ml FITC-casein in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTE, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA. By varying the excitation wavelength the possibility of light scattering as the reason for the fluorescence increase was excluded. Recombinant firefly luciferase (Promega) was incubated (10 μm) for 30 min at room temperature in denaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTE, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm ATP, 7 m urea). For refolding, the denatured luciferase was diluted 125-fold into renaturation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTE, 0.05 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 240 μm CoA, 0.1 mm luciferin, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase) containing 0.5 μm ClpB or ClpBΔN and DnaK (3.2 μm), DnaJ (0.8 μm), GrpE (0.4 μm). The luminescence during refolding was measured continuously at 25 °C over 500 min in microtiter plates with a Fluoroscan Ascent FL spectrometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Because of product inhibition the luciferase activity declines in the continuous assay after prolonged incubation (25Groemping Y. Klostermeier D. Herrmann C. Veit T. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1173-1183Google Scholar). α-Glucosidase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Sigma) was used as described previously (4Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Google Scholar) with the following modifications: α-glucosidase (0.1 μm) was denatured 10 min at 75 °C in the reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTE). Chaperones were added (ClpB or ClpBΔN 1.0 μm and DnaK 1.6 μm, DnaJ 0.4 μm, GrpE 0.2 μm) prior to refolding at 55 °C. α-Glucosidase activity was determined at the indicated time points at 40 °C in the assay solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside) using the iEMS Reader MF microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). LDH (0.2 μm) from B. stearothermophilus(Sigma) was denatured 30 min at 80 °C in the reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm DTE) (4Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Google Scholar). Chaperones were added (ClpB or ClpBΔN 1.0 μm and DnaK 1.6 μm, DnaJ 0.4 μm, GrpE 0.2 μm) prior to refolding at 55 °C. LDH activity was determined at the indicated time points at 40 °C in the assay solution (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 mm sodium pyruvate) using the iEMS Reader MF microtiter plate reader (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Steady state ATP hydrolysis was measured with a coupled colorimetric assay (26Bergmeyer H.U. Adam H. Methoden der Enzymathischen Analyse. Weinheim, Germany1962: 573-577Google Scholar) using the iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) microtiter plate reader (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). ClpB or ClpBΔN (10 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with different concentrations of Mg·ATP in NADH buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTE, 0.4 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm NADH, 20 μg/ml LDH, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase). For casein stimulation κ-casein (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The observed rate constants were determined from the decrease ofA 340 during the first 6 min of incubation. The data were analyzed with Grafit, Version 3.01 using the Hill equation, shown below, describing cooperative binding (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). k=kcat*[S]nHK′+[S]nHEquation 1 Steady state ATP hydrolysis was measured in a coupled colorimetric assay (26Bergmeyer H.U. Adam H.

Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). ClpB or ClpBΔN (10 μm) was incubated at 25 °C in NADH buffer with 1 mm ATP. Increasing amounts of FITC-casein (Type I; Sigma) or poly-l-lysine (molecular mass 15–30 kDa; Sigma) were added. Gel filtration experiments were performed using a Sephadex S200 HR 10/30 column (AmershamBiosciences) with a performance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA) (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). ClpB or ClpBΔN (50 μl, 5 mg/ml) was injected with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (running buffer: 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTE, 10% glycerol, 1–500 mm KCl). The data from the calibration curve (data not shown) can be fitted to an exponential equation, molecular mass = Ae−kRt, where A = 57836.1, andk = 0.10227. The expected retention times (Rt) for the ClpB (molecular mass, 96253 Da) and ClpBΔN (molecular mass, 80904 Da) oligomers were calculated from their molecular mass (kDa) by Equation 2. Rt=lnA−ln molecular masskEquation 2 The monomer of ClpB (ClpBΔN) was defined by a molecular mass from 90 to 150 kDa (70–130 kDa), the limits for the dimer were set to 150–240 kDa (130–200 kDa), the limits for the trimer were set to 240–340 kDa (200–290 kDa), and the limits for the higher oligomers were set up to hexamer (H) 340–580 kDa (290–530 kDa). ClpB from T. thermophilus shows a high sequence homology to the E. coli protein (4Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Google Scholar). It contains a conserved valine residue (Val-141) encoded by a GUG codon identical to the Val-149 of ClpBEco, where it is used as an internal translation start (14Squires C.L. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Google Scholar, 27Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Google Scholar). However, upon expression in E. coli cells, no truncated form of the thermophile enzyme was found in significant amounts. To study the properties of the truncated ClpB from T. thermophilus we constructed and purified a protein variant lacking the first 139 amino acids, which correspond to the N-terminal domain of ClpBEco (Fig.1 A). The effect of the N-terminal deletion on the folding of the protein was examined by CD measurements (Fig. 1 B). The CD spectrum of ClpBΔN is very similar to the spectrum of full-length ClpB. It shows the two negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm, which are characteristic for α-helical proteins. This indicates that the deletion of the N-terminal domain did not influence the folding of the protein significantly and that both proteins are mainly α-helical. The oligomerization behavior of ClpB and ClpBΔN was determined by gel filtration experiments at 25 °C (Fig.2). Compared with the full-length protein, ClpBΔN shows a similar oligomerization behavior at the protein concentration used. ATP and low ionic strength induce the formation of higher oligomers up to hexamers whereas the binding of ADP and higher ionic strength favor smaller oligomers. Quantification of the influence of the bound nucleotide and the ionic strength of the buffer allows a direct comparison between the two proteins. The results are summarized in TableI. In the presence of ATP and low ionic strength both proteins form higher oligomers (1 mmATP, 1 mm KCl: ClpB, 77.6% hexamer; ClpBΔN, 68.7% hexamer). In the presence of ADP and high salt concentrations the monomer is the preferred oligomeric species (1 mm ADP, 500 mm KCl: ClpB, 88.9% monomer; ClpBΔN, 90.3% monomer). However, ClpBΔN forms more oligomers in the presence of ADP and low to modest ionic strength again compared with ClpB (e.g. 1 mm ADP, 200 mm KCl: ClpB, 62.1% monomer; ClpBΔN, 34.7% monomer). These findings demonstrate that the N terminus is not essential for the oligomerization of ClpB in the protein concentration range tested.Table IOligomeric states of ClpB and ClpBΔNATPSaltMonomerDimerTrimerTetrahexamermm13.2 (1.2)7.2 (9.9)12.0 (20.2)77.6 (68.7)20015.3 (10.7)39.7 (42.3)39.0 (43.9)6.0 (3.1)50018.7 (24.4)68.9 (68.2)12.3 (5.2)0.1 (2.2)ADPSaltMonomerDimerTrimerTetrahexamermm110.4 (7.1)24.0 (18.5)37.6 (32.4)28.0 (42.2)20062.1 (34.7)34.2 (57.5)2.3 (5.1)1.4 (2.7)50088.9 (90.3)10.5 (6.6)0.5 (1.4)0.1 (1.7)Analysis of the oligomerization state of ClpB and ClpBΔN depending on nucleotide and ionic strength.

To study the influence of the N terminus on nucleotide binding we compared the binding affinities of unmodified nucleotides and the fluorescent nucleotide analogues MANT-ADP and MANT-ATP for ClpB and ClpBΔN at 25 °C (28Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar). The affinities of the MANT nucleotides were determined by equilibrium titration experiments, and the affinities for the unmodified nucleotides were determined by displacement reactions (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar).

The affinities of the MANT nucleotides were determined by direct titration experiments, and affinities for the unmodified nucleotides were determined by displacement reactions (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Affinities of ADP and ATP for ClpB are taken from Ref. 7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar.

Obviously, the deletion of the N terminus did not influence the nucleotide binding properties significantly. The proteins have almost identical dissociation constants for MANT-ADP (ClpB, 0.2 μm; ClpBΔN, 0.4 μm), and the binding affinity for MANT-ATP is identical (5.4 μm). The unmodified nucleotides ADP and ATP are bound one order of magnitude weaker than the modified nucleotides. The dissociation constants for ADP are again similar (ClpB, 1.5 μm; ClpBΔN, 4.5 μm), and ATP is bound with affinities of 21 μm for the full-length protein and 26 μmfor ClpBΔN. As the ATPase activity under the conditions used is very low, the K d values determined for ATP represent a good approximation and can be compared (7Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of the N-domain on the ATPase activity, steady state experiments were performed at 25 °C. By plotting the observed rate constants k versus the ATP concentration, sigmoidal curves were observed for ClpB and ClpBΔN in the ATP range from 0.1 to 2 mm (Fig.3). Full-length ClpB shows positive cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis and ATPase stimulation in the presence of κ-casein. ClpBΔN shows a higher basal ATPase activity (k cat, 5.5 min−1), which is stimulated weakly by κ-casein. The data were analyzed with the Hill equation describing cooperative behavior of the proteins (TableIII). The k cat of ClpB (3.9 min−1) is increased by 60% when adding κ-casein whereas the k cat of ClpBΔN is only stimulated by ∼10%. The k cat in the presence of κ-casein is in a similar range (6.2 min−1) for the two proteins, which might be the maximal ATPase of the hexamer at the given temperature. The allosteric behavior is not changed by the N-terminal deletion, which is reflected by the very similar Hill coefficients (n H) for the two proteins regarding the unstimulated ATP hydrolysis (ClpB, n H = 2.4; ClpBΔN, n H = 2.5) and in the presence of casein (n H = 3.4 for both proteins). This shows that the N-domain is not involved in forming intermolecular contacts important for the allosteric behavior.Table IIIKinetic analysis of the steady state ATPase activity using the Hill equationk catK′Hill coefficientmin−1μmnHClpB3.9 (6.2)0.32 (0.06)2.4 (3.4)ClpBΔN5.5 (6.2)0.17 (0.05)2.5 (3.4)Steady state experiments with ClpB and ClpBΔN were performed at 25 °C. In the ATP range used (0.1 to 2 mm ATP) a sigmoidal curve is observed for both proteins when plotting the observed rate constant, k versus the ATP concentration. Values obtained without casein are printed bold, and values obtained in the presence of casein are given in parentheses. The data were analyzed using the Hill equation describing cooperative binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Steady state experiments with ClpB and ClpBΔN were performed at 25 °C. In the ATP range used (0.1 to 2 mm ATP) a sigmoidal curve is observed for both proteins when plotting the observed rate constant, k versus the ATP concentration. Values obtained without casein are printed bold, and values obtained in the presence of casein are given in parentheses. The data were analyzed using the Hill equation describing cooperative binding (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the next experiments we addressed the question whether the decreased stimulation of ClpBΔN by κ-casein is because of a loss of casein binding or because of reduced coupling of casein binding and ATP hydrolysis. We used fluorescein-labeled casein as an interaction partner of ClpB. First we tested whether this modified casein is able to stimulate the ATPase of ClpB and ClpBΔN similar to κ-casein. ClpB and ClpBΔN were incubated at 25 °C under steady state conditions with increasing concentrations of FITC-casein in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig.4 A). The ATPase activity of ClpB is stimulated 2.5-fold, and the ATPase of ClpBΔN is only stimulated by 25%. This stimulation is very similar to the stimulation observed by κ-casein (see Fig. 3). Therefore the ATPase activities of ClpB and ClpBΔN respond to FITC-casein as they respond to κ-casein. The binding of ClpB and ClpBΔN to FITC-casein was monitored by the fluorescence change upon chaperone addition (Fig. 4 B). Upon addition of ClpB the fluorescence increase (∼50%) is more pronounced than after addition of ClpBΔN and reaches a saturated level. The fluorescence increase upon addition of ClpBΔN (∼10%) is proportional to the amount of added protein and does not reach saturation. An exact determination of a K d value was not possible because of the heterogeneous nature of casein and the non-saturated binding of ClpBΔN. It is, however, obvious that ClpBΔN binds FITC-casein with a lower affinity compared with ClpB and that the reduced ATPase stimulation of ClpBΔN by casein is correlating with a reduced binding. To monitor unspecific protein binding, BSA was used as a control. To examine whether reduced binding affinity and ATPase stimulation of FITC-casein and κ-casein are general features of the truncated ClpB form we used poly-l-lysine, which was shown to stimulate the ATPase of ClpBEco and Hsp104 (17Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Google Scholar, 29Cashikar A.G. Schirmer E.C. Hattendorf D.A. Glover J.R. Ramakrishnan M.S. Ware D.M. Lindquist S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 751-760Google Scholar). ClpB and ClpBΔN were incubated at 25 °C under steady state conditions with increasing concentrations of poly-l-lysine in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 5). ClpB and ClpBΔN respond to poly-l-lysine very similarly. In both proteins the ATPase activities are stimulated by a factor of 2.5 in the presence of poly-l-lysine. This indicates that the ATPase activity of ClpBΔN can still be stimulated and that both proteins bind poly-l-lysine. To examine whether the reduced binding affinity for casein is combined with a loss of function we tested the refolding capacity of ClpBΔN in cooperation with the DnaK chaperone system. α-Glucosidase, LDH, and luciferase were used as model substrate proteins for the chaperone network. To favor aggregation of the substrates the chaperones were added after the denaturation step. The denatured and aggregated substrate proteins were refolded in the presence of ClpB and the DnaK system, ClpBΔN and the DnaK system, the DnaK system alone, or without chaperones. α-Glucosidase from B. stearothermophilus can be refolded efficiently by the ClpB-DnaK chaperone system at 55 °C after denaturation for 10 min at 75 °C (Fig.6). The refolding started directly after shifting to 55 °C without a pronounced lag phase. Using full-length ClpB 40% of the original α-glucosidase activity was restored. ClpBΔN shows ∼70% of the wild type activity in this assay. The effect of ClpB is large as shown by the poor refolding efficiency of the DnaK system alone, which is less than 10% of the activity in the presence of ClpB. In the absence of chaperones α-glucosidase did not refold spontaneously to a detectable amount. LDH from B. stearothermophilus, the second substrate protein used, is more stable than α-glucosidase (Fig.7). After denaturation for 30 min at 80 °C without chaperones less than 5% of the native activity was detected. Both ClpB variants show a similar refolding activity of ∼60% of the native LDH after refolding at 55 °C. The effect of ClpB is less pronounced; the DnaK system alone can refold denatured LDH to ∼30% of the native activity. After incubation at the refolding temperature without chaperones no increase in LDH activity was detected. Firefly luciferase is a well established substrate of the ClpB-DnaK system (2Glover J.R.

For refolding the denatured luciferase was diluted into refolding buffer containing chaperones. In the presence of the DnaK system alone luciferase activity was restored after a lag phase of ∼50 min. In the presence of ClpB or ClpBΔN and the DnaK system the renaturation of luciferase started immediately and led to a significantly higher refolding yield. Observation of the luciferase activity showed that no luminescence appeared without chaperones. The activity of luciferase declines after prolonged incubation in a continuous assay because of product inhibition (25Groemping Y. Klostermeier D. Herrmann C. Veit T. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1173-1183Google Scholar). The functions of the different domains of Clp proteins have been addressed by a number of studies. Especially the role of the N terminus was examined because of an internal translation initiation site and the two isoforms of ClpB and ClpA present in E. coli (16Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Google Scholar, 17Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Google Scholar). Similar to results obtained for ClpBEco and ClpAEco the folding of ClpBΔN from T. thermophilus is not impaired by the N-terminal deletion. Furthermore we could show that the deletion of the first 140 amino acids did not affect the nucleotide binding properties of the protein, which can be explained by weak interactions of the N-terminal domain with other domains of the molecule, especially with the two NBDs. Weak interactions between the N-domain and the shortened ClpB were also identified in the E. coli protein (17Tek V. Zolkiewski M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1192-1198Google Scholar). In addition the N-terminally shortened protein showed a similar oligomerization behavior depending on ion strength and the bound nucleotide. In the presence of ATP and low ionic strength the proteins assemble into higher oligomers, which are stable at 25 °C. An increase of temperature might stabilize these oligomers (30Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5804-5809Google Scholar). Therefore the N-domain does not appear to contribute intermolecular contacts necessary for the oligomerization. This implies a position of the N terminus at the outside of the hexameric ring structure. Such a position of the N-domain was also postulated for ClpA from E. coli (18Singh S.K. Rozycki J. Ortega J. Ishikawa T. Lo J. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29420-29429Google Scholar). The similar allosteric behavior in steady state ATPase activity of ClpB and ClpBΔN also supports that the N terminus is not involved in oligomerization; both proteins used in this study had very similar Hill coefficients. This confirms that the N-domain is not involved in intermolecular contacts that transmit allosteric signals. The higher basal ATPase activity of ClpBΔN points at a regulating function of the N-domain. In addition the slightly increased formation of oligomers by ClpBΔN as determined from gel filtration might contribute to the higher ATPase activity. ClpB shows a stronger stimulation of the ATPase activity by κ-casein compared with ClpBΔN, which is in agreement with results obtained from ClpBΔNEco (12Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Google Scholar, 31Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate here that this reduced stimulation of the ATPase activity is because of a reduced binding affinity for casein by ClpBΔN and does not represent a coupling defect of ClpBΔN. The deletion of the N terminus does not generally result in a decreased stimulation of the ATPase activity as poly-l-lysine stimulates ClpB and ClpBΔN equally well. Interestingly, the reduced stimulation of the ATPase activity is restricted to casein, a frequently used model substrate (4Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Google Scholar, 12Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Google Scholar,27Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Google Scholar). Considering chaperone activity, the effect of the N-terminal truncation remained obscure. The truncated form was able to restore thermo-tolerance in cyanobacteria in vivo (20Clarke A.K. Eriksson M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 7092-7096Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal shortened variant of ClpBEco was reported to be inactive in vitro in a luciferase refolding assay (12Barnett M.E. Zolkiewska A. Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37565-37571Google Scholar). We cannot confirm the in vitro result with ClpBΔN fromT. thermophilus. We observe unaltered refolding capacity for luciferase and LDH and a slightly reduced refolding yield for α-glucosidase. The slightly reduced refolding activity for one substrate protein is in accordance with studies with ClpAEco (16Lo J.H. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 551-559Google Scholar), which show that the truncated form can still interact with ClpP and degrade substrate proteins albeit at lower rate compared with the full-length ClpA. Therefore we conclude that the N-terminal domain from ClpB is in general not essential for disaggregation and refolding reactions mediated by the DnaK/ClpB system. It influences the basal ATPase activity and might have an auxiliary function during the interaction with denatured proteins or might only be necessary for a subset of substrate proteins. κ-Casein might belong to this class of substrates that possibly represent a minority. The effects of casein that were used frequently as model substrate for ClpB are therefore not representative for other substrate proteins. This is in agreement with different effects of point mutations in the N-domain of ClpBEco concerning the ATPase stimulation, which were reported recently (32Liu Z. Tek V. Akoev V. Zolkiewski M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 111-120Google Scholar). Some mutants were no longer stimulated by κ-casein, but all variants tested responded to poly-l-lysine and were still able to bind inactivated luciferase. Because the N terminus of ClpAEco was shown recently to interact with the substrate modulator ClpS (19Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Google Scholar), casein could potentially interact with the binding site of a modulator at the N terminus of ClpB e.g. by an unspecific interaction. The effects of the frequently used model substrate casein on ClpB ATPase activity may therefore not be representative for other substrate proteins. In particular as casein is not a well defined single protein species and does not allow for consistent monitoring of refolding. This might represent an increasingly severe problem for the study of ClpB/DnaK disaggregation activity. The substrates (protein aggregates) are in general not well defined, which hampers the direct comparison of mutational effects of ClpB/Hsp104 proteins from different organisms unless sets of substrate proteins are investigated, possibly even including procedures to define the nature of protein aggregates as pioneered recently by Goloubinoff and co-workers (33Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Google Scholar). In conclusion, whether the differences between the role of the N terminus from ClpB from T. thermophilus and E. coli are because of the different experimental procedures or represent true differences of the individual enzymes remains to be shown. The studies presented here with a larger set of substrate proteins including nucleotide binding and hydrolysis studies indicate that the N terminus of ClpB is not essential for in vitrochaperone activity.

Perturbations of the lignin biosynthetic pathway have the potential to enhance the utilization of plant cell walls in various natural and industrial processes. In forages fed to ruminant animals, for example, lignins inhibit the rumen degradability of potentially digestible polysaccharides (1Jung H.G. Ralph J. Akin D.E. Ljungdahl L.G. Wilson J.R.

In chemical pulping for the production of fine paper, the aim is to selectively remove the lignin from the cellulose fibers. Recently it has become evident that there is potential beyond down-regulating lignification to produce low lignin plants; inducing structural and compositional changes in the polymer may also be beneficial for many processes (2Sederoff R.R.

Molecular marker compounds that allow the degree of change to be elucidated are vital particularly when various levels of down-regulation need to be assessed.CAD 1The abbreviations used are: CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect 1The abbreviations used are: CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase) is the last enzyme on the pathway to the monolignols, primarily coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols 4 (Fig.1), from which polymeric lignin is derived.

Such an incorporation is logical; the hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde 1 precursors to the hydroxycinnamyl alcohol monolignols 4 are anticipated to build up when the flux to the monolignols is reduced and can be used for polymerization in much the same way as the monolignols themselves (9Higuchi T.

What was not obvious a priori is that these aldehydes, products of incomplete monolignol synthesis, would necessarily be exported to the wall, but that appears to be the case.In softwoods, in which their (guaiacyl) lignins are overwhelmingly derived from coniferyl alcohol 4g, coniferyl aldehyde 1g is not well incorporated (18Kim H. Ralph J. Yahiaoui N. Pean M. Boudet A.-M. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2197-2200Google Scholar,19Ralph J. Lapierre C. Marita J. Kim H. Lu F. Hatfield R.D. Ralph S.A. Chapple C. Franke R. Hemm M.R.

Phytochem. 2001; 57: 993-1003Google Scholar).2 This is largely due to simple chemical cross-coupling propensities; coniferyl aldehyde 1g does not 8–O–4-cross-couple efficiently with guaiacyl units2g in the evolving polymer in plants (18Kim H. Ralph J. Yahiaoui N. Pean M. Boudet A.-M. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2197-2200Google Scholar). The prime incorporation mechanism then is by dimerization, or by cross-coupling with a coniferyl alcohol monomer (Fig. 1 b) (13Ralph J. MacKay J.J. Hatfield R.D. O'Malley D.M. Whetten R.W. Sederoff R.R. Science. 1997; 277: 235-239Google Scholar, 19Ralph J. Lapierre C. Marita J. Kim H. Lu F. Hatfield R.D. Ralph S.A. Chapple C. Franke R. Hemm M.R. Van Doorsselaere J. Sederoff R.R.

Agric. Food Chem. 2000; 48: 2326-2331Google Scholar). Coniferyl alcohol 4goverwhelmingly prefers coupling at its β-position in cross-coupling reactions (23Syrjanen K. Brunow G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2000; 1: 183-187Google Scholar); coniferyl aldehyde 1g does not favor coupling with guaiacyl moieties 2g at its analogous 8-position except in pure dimerization reactions.2 The products of the cross-coupling of coniferyl alcohol and coniferyl aldehyde are therefore β–5- or β–O–4-products 5 and 6 (Fig. 1 b). The resulting products retain unsaturated cinnamyl aldehyde units in the polymer as end units. Coniferyl aldehyde 1gmight also 5–5-couple with guaiacyl lignin units2g (not shown). Coniferyl aldehyde monomers are only poorly incorporated into softwood lignins and degradation products only poorly released by any of the diagnostic degradative methods based on ether cleavage reactions, such as thioacidolysis (24Lapierre C. Jung H.G. Buxton D.R. Hatfield R.D. Ralph J. Forage Cell Wall Structure and Digestibility. 1. American Society of Agronomy-Crop Science Society of America-Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI1993: 133-166Google Scholar) or derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, the “DFRC” method (25Lu F. Ralph J. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1997; 45: 4655-4660Google Scholar).The intimate incorporation of hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes into angiosperm lignins is, in contrast, rather facile due to the different chemical cross-coupling propensities of the radicals involved (14Ralph J. Hatfield R.D. Piquemal J. Yahiaoui N. Pean M. Lapierre C. Boudet A.-M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S .A. 1998; 95: 12803-12808Google Scholar, 18Kim H. Ralph J. Yahiaoui N. Pean M. Boudet A.-M. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2197-2200Google Scholar).2 Sinapyl aldehyde 1s, the precursor of sinapyl alcohol 4s in angiosperms, readily 8–O–4-couples with both syringyl and guaiacyl lignin units2. Coniferyl aldehyde 1g also 8–O–4-cross-couples with syringyl units 2s(but again, not guaiacyl units 2g). As a result, endwise incorporation of both coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes1 into angiosperm lignins is more substantial and, more importantly, occurs in very much the same way as the incorporation of the monolignols 4 themselves. A new hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde monomer (radical) cross-couples with the growing lignin oligomer/polymer 2 (radical), at a phenolic guaiacyl or syringyl end unit. Subsequently, a new monomer (radical),e.g. a normal monolignol 4, may cross-couple with the new phenolic end unit (radical) resulting from the prior coupling reaction, and the hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde unit becomes etherified and intimately incorporated into the lignin. The only difference is that in “normal” lignification, the monomers are comprised largely of the normal monolignols 4, coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols, whereas in CAD-deficient plants, the monomers additionally include the hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes 1, coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes.Hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes either involved in 8–O–4-linkages or incorporated as 4–O–β-end groups will release monomers following ether cleaving reactions in thioacidolysis, which therefore serve as marker compounds for hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde incorporation. However, there are invariably hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde end-groups in normal lignins (26Lundquist K. Paterson A. Ramsey L. Acta Chem. Scand. Ser. B Org. Chem. Biochem. 1983; B37: 734-736Google Scholar), in structures 6, so their products are not diagnostic for CAD deficiency, and they do not qualify as molecular maker compounds for CAD deficiency.Two new isomeric syringyl monomers have been detected following thioacidolysis of a range of CAD-deficient materials during extensive studies at the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique in Paris-Grignon, France (27Lapierre C.

The characteristic peaks, labeled7s and 8s in Fig.2, were suspected as products derived from the incorporation of sinapyl aldehyde into the transgenics' lignins. Here we detail the identification of thioacidolysis CAD marker compounds and provide evidence that 8–O–4-coupled hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde units 3 in lignin are their source. We also demonstrate how a common aldehyde staining method may fail to reveal the substantial incorporation of aldehydes into angiosperm lignins, thus emphasizing the importance of more diagnostic analytical methods.Figure 2GC-MS traces showing the two (silylated) thioacidolysis CAD markers in transgenic poplar (total-ion chromatogram and selected-ion (m/z 384) chromatogram, and the analogous selected-ion chromatogram from thioacidolysis of an 8–O–4-model compound 3sg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneralAll chemicals were purchased from Aldrich unless otherwise noted. The Raney nickel preparation was Aldrich's 50-μm pore size, 80–100 m2/g surface area, 50% slurry in water. The products of thioacidolysis from lignins and hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde 8–O–4-model compounds 3 were examined by GC-MS. GC (Thermoquest Trace GC 2000) conditions were as follows: DB1 column (25 m × 0.2 mm, 33-μm film thickness, J & W Scientific) was used; initial column temperature, 200 °C, held for 1 min, first ramped at rate of 4 °C/min to 248 °C, second ramped at rate of 30 °C/min to 300 °C for 25 min; inlet temperature was 250 °C. MS (Thermoquest GCQ/Polaris MS) conditions were as follows: ion source temperature, 220 °C, transfer line temperature, 300 °C. UV spectra were recorded on DU-50 Series Spectrophotometers (Beckman) at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm.NMR SpectroscopyNMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker DRX-360 instrument fitted with a 5-mm 1H/broadband gradient probe with inverse geometry (proton coils closest to the sample). Compounds (5–60 mg) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of acetone-d 6 (unless otherwise noted); the central acetone solvent peak was used as internal reference (δC 29.80, δH 2.04). We used the standard Bruker implementations of the traditional suite of one-dimensional and two-dimensional (gradient-selected, 1H-detected, e.g. COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, or HSQC, HMQC-TOCSY, HMBC) NMR experiments for structural elucidation and assignment authentication.

Experimental data given here list the data base compound number (e.g. 3047). NOESY spectra were acquired with a 1.5-s mixing time (τm); TOCSY spectra used a 100-ms mixing time; HMBC spectra used 100-ms long range coupling delays.Plant Materials and Lignin IsolationPreparation of CAD-down-regulated transgenic poplars and isolation of the lignin were described previously (29Lapierre C.

Benzyl bromide (11.27 g, 65.48 mmol) was added, followed by anhydrous K2CO3 (15.2 g, 109.9 mmol). The mixture was refluxed overnight in an oil bath. After checking for reaction completion by TLC (CHCl3-EtOAc, 10:1), the inorganic salts were filtered off. The filtrate was diluted with water (300 ml), 1n NaOH (5 ml) was added to partition any non-benzylated phenols, and the solution extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 ml), which was washed with saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator.

All glassware and syringes were oven-dried at 50 °C for several days. Lithium diisopropylamide (11.33 ml, 17 mmol) was stirred in a dried round-bottom flask at −70 °C and kept 10 min. Ethyl 2-methoxyphenoxy acetate (2.39 g, 11 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) and added dropwise over 20 min to the lithium diisopropylamide solution. The mixture was stirred for 30 min. Syringaldehyde benzyl ether (3.11 g, 11 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) and added dropwise to the reaction mixture, which gradually became pale yellow. The stirring was continued for 30 min at −70 °C and the flask allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of 1 h. The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of saturated aqueous NH4Cl. The solution was extracted with EtOAc, washed with saturated aqueous NaCl, and dried over MgSO4. The concentrated yellow oil was purified by flash chromatography (CHCl3-EtOAc, 10:1). The β-hydroxy ester9sg was obtained as a mixture oferythro- and threo-isomers; 4.1 g, 9 mmol, 81%) and was confirmed by NMR. The isomers were separated by preparative TLC (cyclohexane:EtOAc:HOAc 100:50:1) and each isomer crystallized from EtOH/H2O. For NMR data, see Supplementary Material.3-(4-Benzyloxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)acrylic Acid Ethyl Ester 11sgTrimethylsilyl bromide (1.28 ml, 9.7 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of β-hydroxy ester 9sg(erythro:threomixture; 2.34 g, 4.85 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (30 ml). After the mixture had been stirred for 2 h, diazabicycloundecene (1.45 ml, 9.7 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight. The solution was diluted in EtOAc, washed with saturated aqueous NaCl, and dried over MgSO4. The concentrated red oil was purified by flash column (CHCl3-EtOAc, 10:1) to give a red solid11sg (1.26 g, 2.71 mmol, 56%).4-[3-Hydroxy-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-propenyl]-2,6-dimethoxy-phenol12sgCompound 11sg(320 mg, 0.69 mmol) in toluene (30 ml), under nitrogen, was cooled in an ice water bath. Diisobutylaluminum hydride (Aldrich, 1.62 ml of 1.5m solution, 2.42 mmol, 3.5 eq.) in toluene was slowly added via syringe over 10 min. The stirring was continued for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then carefully quenched with ethanol (5 ml). Water (50 ml) was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 200 ml). The extracted layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to give crude red oil. The mixture was separated on TLC (CHCl3-EtOAc, 1:1) to give pure12sg as a yellow oily product (144 mg, 0.43 mmol, 63%). For NMR data, see Supplementary Material.3-[4-Hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)]-propenal3sgCompound12sg (144 mg, 0.43 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (20 ml). 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-benzoquinone (DDQ; 50 mg, 0.22 mmol) was added and stirred overnight. The resulting yellow solution products were dried on an evaporator and separated from DDQ and the trace of starting material by TLC (CHCl3-EtOAc, 1:1). Compound 3sg (84 mg, 0.25 mmol, 59%) was obtained as pale yellow solid after drying. For NMR data, see Supplementary Material.Thioacidolysis of Models 3Thioacidolysis was performed on two representative model compounds 3sg and 3gs; the major products, two isomeric indenes, 7 and 8(Fig. 3), were isolated and their structures deduced from MS and NMR. Raney nickel desulfurization of the thioacidolysis products afforded the indane 13.2,3-Bis-ethylsulfanyl-4,6-dimethoxy-3H-inden-5-ol7sand 2,3-bis-ethylsulfanyl-4,6-dimethoxy-1H-inden-5-ol8sCompound 3sg (30 mg, 0.091 mmol) was dried overnight, dissolved in 6 ml of dioxane, and transferred into a 9-ml screw-top vial. Ethanethiol (0.9 ml) and BF3 etherate (0.225 ml) were added. The total volume was adjusted to 9 ml with dioxane. The vial was capped tightly with a Teflon-lined screwcap and put into an oil bath at 100 °C. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 h. The reaction tube was cooled in ice water. The vial was washed out with CH2Cl2 and water several times and all contents transferred to a separatory funnel. The pH of the aqueous phase was adjusted to 3–4 by addition of 0.4 m NaHCO3, extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 30 ml), and dried over MgSO4. The solution was concentrated on a rotary evaporator that was connected to bleach (sodium hypochlorite) trap. The final products (28 mg, 0.091 mmol) were separated by TLC (CHCl3-EtOAc, 10:1). The two major products,7s and 8s, were identified by NMR and GC-MS.Compound 7s: δH 1.00 (3H, t,J = 7.5, 9-S-CH2-CH3), 1.33 (3H, t, J = 7.4 Hz, 8-S-CH2-CH 3), 2.22(1H, dq,J = 12.1, 7.5 Hz, 9a-S-CH 2-CH3), 2.04 (1H, dq,J = 12.1, 7.5 Hz, 9b-S-CH 2-CH3), 2.94 (2H, q,J = 7.4 Hz, 8-S-CH 2-CH3), 3.82 (3H, s, 5-OMe), 3.96 (3H, s, 3-OMe), 4.39 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz, 9), 6.38 (1H, d, J = 1.2 Hz, 7), 6.63 (1H, s, 6); δC 14.4 (9-S-CH2 CH3), 14.5 (8-S-CH2 CH3), 22.2 (9-S-CH2CH3), 26.8 (8-S-CH2CH3), 52.6 (9Higuchi T.

https://openalex.org/W1967852756,"Mutations in the novel membrane protein Pfcrt were recently found to be essential for chloroquine resistance (CQR) in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for most lethal human malaria (Fidock, D. A., Nomura, T., Talley, A. K., Cooper, R. A., Dzekunov, S. M., Ferdig, M. T., Ursos, L. M., Sidhu, A. B., Naude, B., Deitsch, K. W., Su, X. Z., Wootton, J. C., Roepe, P. D., and Wellems, T. E. (2000) Mol. Cell6, 861–871). Pfcrt is localized to the digestive vacuolar membrane of the intraerythrocytic parasite and may function as a transporter. Study of this putative transport function would be greatly assisted by overexpression in yeast followed by characterization of membrane vesicles. Unfortunately, the very high AT content of malarial genes precludes efficient heterologous expression. Thus, we back-translated Pfcrt to design idealized genes with preferred yeast codons, no long poly(A) sequences, and minimal stem-loop structure. We synthesized a designed gene with a two-step PCR method, fused this to N- and C-terminal sequences to aid membrane insertion and purification, and now report efficient expression of wild type and mutant Pfcrt proteins in the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeand Pichia pastoris yeast. To our knowledge, this is the first successful expression of a full-length malarial parasite integral membrane protein in yeast. Purified membranes and inside-out plasma membrane vesicle preparations were used to analyze wild typeversus CQR-conferring mutant Pfcrt function, which may include effects on H+ transport (Dzekunov, S., Ursos, L. M. B., and Roepe, P. D. (2000) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 110, 107–124), and to perfect a rapid purification of biotinylated Pfcrt.

These data expand on the role of Pfcrt in conferring CQR and define a productive route for analysis of importantP. falciparum transport proteins and membrane associated vaccine candidates. Malaria causes ∼2.5 million deaths annually, mostly children. Four malarial species infect humans, the most deadly beingPlasmodium falciparum. For decades, malaria has been treated effectively with the 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine (CQ) 1The abbreviations used are: CQ, chloroquine; CQR, chloroquine resistant (resistance); DV, digestive vacuole; DHFR-TS, dihydrofolate thymidylate synthase; bad, biotin acceptor domain; DM, dodecyl maltoside; tcbd, transcarboxylase biotin acceptor domain; ISOV, inside-out plasma membrane vesicles; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NaPi, sodium phosphate buffer; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; AO, acridine orange; VPL, verapamil; PMA1, plasma membrane ATPase 1; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; Ab, antibody; however, CQ-resistant (CQR) strains of P. falciparum have spread with considerable success and continue to evolve. Mutations in two genes (pfmdr and cg2) were previously suggested to mediate CQR, but more recently CQR was found to be caused by mutations in the Pfcrt gene (1Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B. Deitsch K.W. Su X.Z. Wootton J.C. Roepe P.D. Wellems T.E. Mol.

Saliba K.J. Caruana S.R. Kirk K. Cowman A.F. Nature. 2000; 403: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Pfcrt protein is localized to the membrane of the parasite digestive vacuole (DV). The DV is the site of hemoglobin digestion, which is a principle source of food for the parasite during rapid intraerythrocytic development. Mutant Pfcrt may confer drug resistance by directly or indirectly lowering DV pH (3Dzekunov S. Ursos L.M.B. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which quite effectively titrates soluble drug target (heme released from hemoglobin) out of solution without compromising detoxification of heme to hemozoin (4Ursos L.M.B. Dzekunov S. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Ursos L.M.B. Roepe P.D. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 465-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There are actually multiple mutant Pfcrt alleles that appear to cause drug resistance and that arose in a geographically distinct pattern (1Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B. Deitsch K.W. Su X.Z. Wootton J.C. Roepe P.D. Wellems T.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Further elucidating the molecular mechanism of CQR is essential. Pfcrt plays a critical role in CQR, probably via some yet to be determined transport function. The protein resides in a subcellular membrane within an intracellular parasite, so to experimentally study Pfcrt transport function requires that transported substrates cross three membranes in a coordinated fashion. This is extremely difficult to manipulate experimentally. Since the technology required for fabricating membrane vesicles of various types (e.g.secretory, inside out plasma, right side out plasma, vacuolar) and for purifying and reconstituting polytopic integral membrane proteins is well developed for yeast, heterologous expression of Pfcrt in yeast would obviously greatly assist further analysis of Pfcrt transport function. Unfortunately, a literature survey for successful heterologous expression of P. falciparum genes is not encouraging. There is but one successful report of low level heterologous expression of a native P. falciparum cDNA (dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) protein (6Sirawaraporn W. Sirawaraporn R. Cowman A.F. Yuthavong Y. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10779-10785Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)). A notorious feature of the P. falciparum genome is its very high A,T content (7Gardner M.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Bowman S. Lawson D.

McLean J. Moule S. Mungall K. Murphy L. Barrell B.G. et al.Nature. 1999; 400: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), thus, P. falciparum genes reveal a markedly biased codon usage. Coding regions are ∼70% A+T, and are flanked by A+T-rich regions as high as 86% (9Saul A. Battistutta D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Weber J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Musto H. Rodriguez-Maseda H.

The high A+T content makes heterologous expression in both prokaryotic (bacterial) and eukaryotic (yeast, insect) systems extremely difficult if not impossible because: (a) these species have their own preferred codon usage that is not dominated by A+T (13Bennetzen J.L.

Thus, expression of a synthetic DHFR-TS gene with optimized codon usage was found to increase the level of expressed protein (21Prapunwattana P. Sirawaraporn W. Yuthavong Y. Santi D.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This result recently enticed others to construct genes with optimized yeast codon usage for pfsub1 (a subtilisin-like protease),pfmsp-1 (a merozoite stage-specific surface protein complex), and the antigen Pfs48/45 (22Withers-Martinez C.

These three studies have yielded some additional success; however, heterologous expression ofP. falciparum genes remains extremely difficult, and no successful overexpression of a polytopic integral membrane protein has yet been reported. Polytopic integral membrane proteins are typically encoded by large genes that are more difficult to assemble synthetically. Also, aside from codon usage and poly(A) termination issues, the encoded proteins contain folding, membrane translocation, and membrane insertion sequences that can be species- and membrane-specific. These are not well defined for malarial membrane proteins. S. cerevisiae yeast have been used as an important tool in the heterologous expression of proteins (25Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Yeast. 1992; 8: 423-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Several membrane proteins have been heterologously expressed, among them, human mdr1 (26Kuchler K. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have examined these issues and have constructed a syntheticPfcrt gene that harbors appropriate base pair content and other necessary features. We have modified the N and C termini regions based on previous work wherein we were able to functionally express the human multidrug resistance protein (humdr1, P-glycoprotein) in S. cerevisiae (27Fritz F. Howard E.M. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4214-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), have subcloned the resulting constructs into appropriate yeast expression vectors, and have achieved high level inducible expression of Pfcrt and Pfcrt-biotin acceptor domain fusion (Pfcrt-bad) proteins in the plasma membrane of P. pastoris. More modest constitutive expression in S. cerevisiae was also achieved. Using the successfully expressed wild type gene as template, we have also created a CQR-associated mutant Pfcrtallele and have overexpressed the mutant Pfcrt-bad protein. Analysis of membrane vesicles from these yeast supports the earlier suggestion (1Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B. Deitsch K.W.

Rabbit anti-Pfcrt IgG was a kind gift from Dr. T. Wellems (NIAID/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). HRP-conjugated monkey anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated streptavidin and ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Prestained SDS-PAGE molecular markers were from Bio-Rad. Immobilized monomeric avidin resin was from Pierce. Yeast and bacteria growth media reagents were from Difco. Oligonucleotides were custom made by MWG-Biotech (High Point, NC). Dodecyl maltoside (DM) was fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). Plasmids and sequencing primers relevant for subcloning and gene expression in P. pastoris yeast were purchased from Invitrogen (version L Picchia expression kit). All other reagents were reagent grade or better and were purchased from Sigma. The Escherichia coli strain NM522 (hsd Δ 5 Δ (lac-pro)F− lacI lacZ ΔM15 pro supE) was used for all bacterial work. S. cerevisiae strain 9.3 (Mat a leu2 ura3 trp1 ade2 trk1Δ trk2Δ ena1::His3::ena4) was kindly provided by Dr. Alonso Rodriguez-Navarro, Universidad Politechnica, Madrid, Spain.P. pastoris strains KM71 and GS115 (arg4 his4 aox1::ARG4 and his4) were from Invitrogen. 9.3 yeast harboring pYHZHB3crt, pYHZHB3crt-bad, pYHZDd2crt-bad, or pYKM77 were selected for growth in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil supplemented with 100 mm KCl. P. pastoris strains KM71 and GS115 harboring pPIC35HB3crt, pPIC35HB3crt-bad, pPIC35Dd2crt-bad, or pPIC35 were selected for growth in minimal glycerol medium lacking histidine. The Pfcrt-hb3 gene sequence (wild typePfcrt) was obtained from GenBankTM(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and we used the CODOP program (generously provided by Dr. Elisabeth P Carpenter, Division of Protein Structure, National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK (22Withers-Martinez C. Carpenter E.P. Hackett F. Ely B. Sajid M. Grainger M. Blackman M.J. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 1113-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) to back-translate the encoded protein sequence. We allowed CODOP to back-translate Pfcrt into a theoretically optimized Pfcrtgene using a S. cerevisiae yeast codon usage table (www.kazusa.or.jp/codon). The process was repeated many times with different random seeding values. All the poly(A) and premature codon patterns in a selected sequence were then screened and destroyed by a second layer of codon engineering. We suspect disrupting poly(A) is more important than 100% optimization of codon usage (see “Results,” Table I caption). A Kozak consensus (GCCGCCACCAUGG) was included and adjusted at −3 (to A) and +4 (to G). Finally, this theoretically optimized Pfcrt gene was divided up into a collection of 40 base fragments encoding both DNA strands and the melting temperature (T m) for the 20-bp overlap regions in each primer set (see “Results”) were calculated. All primer set T m were then adjusted to reside in the range 56–64 °C by yet a third round of codon adjustment. Vector NTI software was also used to check all primers for repeats, palindromes, hairpins, and dimers. In the final theoretical optimizedPfcrt gene AT% is reduced from 72 to 55% (see “Results”).Table IComparison of malarial versus yeast codon preferences and codon usage for native versus yeast optimized PfcrtAmino acidCodonP. falciparumusageS. cerevisiae usageNumber used in nativePfcrtNumber used post-optimizationAfter CODOPFinal geneArgCGA2.43.0200CGC0.52.6000CGG0.21.7000CGU3.46.5355AGA16.721.31189AGG4.09.3143LeuCUA5.313.4166CUC1.75.4100CUG1.410.401013CUU8.612.21031UUA49.326.329125UUG10.227.151521SerUCA18.018.8754UCC5.414.2669UCG2.88.6000UCU15.223.6675AGC3.89.7358AGU21.714.2763ThrACA22.717.79106ACC5.612.65410ACG3.88.0000ACU12.820.2775ProCCA13.318.2445CCC2.66.8021CCG1.05.3000CCU9.213.6311AlaGCA12.816.2776GCC3.412.6435GCG1.26.1000GCU12.521.1787GlyGGA16.610.91033GGC1.79.72106GGG2.96.0000GGU16.923.9111014ValGUA17.911.81363GUC2.611.64310GUG4.910.7144GUU17.7227128LysAAA90.542.123150AAG19.430.841227AsnAAC18.824.971632AAU106.13625160GlnCAA24.827.51086CAG3.312.2024HisCAC3.97.8334CAU19.613.7221GluGAA63.745.9172013GAG10.019.1307AspGAC8.620.44611GAU5537.81083TyrUAC5.714.751018UAU46.218.81380CysUGC2.54.7269UGU15.58.01285PheUUC7.318.2131938UUU34.52625190IleAUA44.417.81390AUC6.017.141441AUU33.730.229235MetAUG21.120.9121212TrpUGG5.310.3222TerUAA1.11.0111UAG0.20.5000UGA0.20.6000Total425425425Use per 1000 codons is listed for P. falciparum and S. cerevisiae (www.kazusa.or.jp/codon) (third and fourth columns).

Thus, for example, even though the yeast preferred codon for lysine is AAA, all lysine residues were coded with AAG to avoid poly(A) sequences (compare last two columns) in the final optimized gene. A total of 66 40-mers were made that encoded both strands of the theoretically optimized Pfcrt gene. We then followed procedures suggested in Refs. 22Withers-Martinez C. Carpenter E.P. Hackett F.

Equal volumes of all 66 40-mers (1.5 μm each) were combined, and the resultant mixture was diluted 10-fold in 100 μl of a PCR mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/μl nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase). The initial PCR program was one denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (30 s), 52 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (2 min) and then a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. 10 μl of this “assembly solution” was then diluted 10-fold in 100 μl of similar PCR mixture, but with a 1 μm concentration each of the 5′- and 3′-flanking primers (1 and 34 in the sequence of 66, respectively). The amplifying PCR program used was one denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles at 94 °C (45 s), 68 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (5 min) and then a final incubation cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. A fragment from the Propionibacterium shermaniitranscarboxylase biotin acceptor domain (tcbd) is a convenient biotin tag for monitoring protein expression and facilitating purification (37Glerum D.M. Muroff I. Jin C. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19088-19094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Isolated plasmid YEp352/BIO6 containing this fragment (kindly provided by Dr. A. Tzagoloff, Columbia University) was PCR-amplified with two designed primers that created convenient overlap and restriction sites (tcbd 5′ primer (5′): GACAGTAT CATCACTC AAGCGGCCGCAG GCTTCGAG CTCGGTAC CCGGGGAT CCGGT (3′);tcbd 3′ primer (5′): GGCCAGTG CCAAGCTTGC ATGCTTGC AGGT (3′)). A NotI restriction site was engineered, a PstI site was destroyed, and aHindIII site was retained (underlined). Purified syntheticPfcrt and purified tcbd fragment were combined and PCR-amplified to form one larger PCR product containing an in-frame fusion of Pfcrt and tcbd. Several different mutant Pfcrt alleles have been associated with chloroquine resistance (CQR) (1Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B.

This allele differs from the CQS-associated allele (what we will call the “HB3” allele) at 8 codons (74–76, 220, 271, 326, 356, 371). Thus, we designed a collection of 12 oligonucleotides (sequences available from the authors as supplemental information) that overlapped in six locations to create 8 codon mutations (encoding M74I, N75E, K76T, A220S, Q271E, N326S, I356T, and R371I amino acid substitutions, see Ref. 1Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B. Deitsch K.W. Su X.Z. Wootton J.C. Roepe P.D. Wellems T.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides also directed silent codon point mutations that created restriction sites flanking each codon mutation (or group of mutations). The created restriction sites (which facilitated subcloning and which will facilitate future work studying other resistance-associated Pfcrt alleles) wereNruI (flanking codon 74–76), EcoRV (flanking codon 220), AfIII (flanking codon 271),ClaI (flanking codon 326), ApaI (flanking codon 356), and SacII (flanking codon 371). A sequence of PCR reactions was required to synthesize the full-length optimized Dd2crt-bad gene using the optimizedHB3crt-bad gene (wild type Pfcrt-tcbdfusion gene described above) as initial template. First, six PCR fragments (A–F) were amplified from HB3crt-bad using the six complimentary sets of 12 oligonucleotides that created the codon and restriction site mutations described above. These were purified, combined in pairs of two, and PCR-amplified to yield three larger fragments I, II, III (e.g. fragment I encoding codons 1–225 was created using fragments A and B as template), etc. By using this sequential strategy, the entire Dd2crt-bad gene was constructed via tiered PCR, subcloned into pYKM77 as described below, and colony-amplified and purified. Plasmid pYKM77 (kindly provided by Drs. K. Kuchler and J. Thorner) was isolated and restricted with PstI and HindIII. The syntheticHB3crt gene, the synthetic HB3crt-bad fusion gene, and the synthetic Dd2crt-bad gene were each trimmed with PstI and HindIII and ligated to the 5.4-kbp vector. Recombinant plasmids were isolated from bacterial transformants and analyzed by restriction. Candidate pHZHB3crtbad (encoding the wild type fusion protein under control of a modified Ste6 promoter), pHZDd2crtbad (encoding mutant crt fusion protein), and pHZHB3crt (encoding wild type Pfcrt) plasmids were sequenced in both directions using oligonucleotides from the gene assembly steps, the BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing program, and ABI prism 373 software. None of the dozen or so sequences that were fully sequenced in each case properly encoded the proteins of interest. Typically, two to three unwanted point mutations were found in the fully assembled recombinant clones. However, by combining restriction fragments from these constructs (using sites fortuitously placed during the initial gene design) our final synthetic genes encoding full-length proteins of the correct sequence were ligated together. These genes were then also subcloned into the vector pPIC3.5 to create pPIC35hb3crt, pPIC35hb3crtbad, and pPIC35dd2crtbad for expression inP. pastoris. The pPIC vector harbors an inducible promoter activated by MeOH, as described under “Results.” Yeast were transformed by the lithium acetate method with 2 μg of target plasmid and 10 μg of carrier plasmid to enhance transformation efficiency. Transformants were plated on selective synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (S. cerevisiae) or MGM (P. pastoris) agar plates. Yeast cells were grown to midlog phase, and crude cellular membranes were isolated via a glass bead lysis protocol (27Fritz F. Howard E.M. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4214-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Plasma membranes were purified via the acid precipitation method of Goffeau and Dufour (38Goffeau A. Dufour J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and clear plasma membrane pellets were resuspended in glycerol-containing solution and stored at −80 C. Crude membranes were resuspended to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in solubilization buffer (0.75% DM, 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.50), 250 mm sucrose, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm MgATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 6.5 mm dithiothreitol) and mixed gently for 1 h at 4 °C. The unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g/1 h/4 °C). DM extracts were loaded on immobilized monomeric avidin resin that had been pre-equilibrated in column wash buffer (0.1% DM, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmMgCl2, 6.5 mm dithiothreitol). The column was washed with 6 bed volumes of column wash buffer. Biotinylated wild type Pfcrt-bad protein was eluted with 2 bed volumes of elution buffer (2 mm d-biotin in column wash buffer). Inside-out plasma membrane vesicles (ISOV) were isolated following the procedure described by Menendez et al. (39Menendez A. Larsson C. Ugalde U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modifications (27Fritz F. Howard E.M. Hoffman M.M. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4214-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In particular, ISOV were fabricated with 100 mm KCl inside the vesicles so that H+pumping could be analyzed with symmetrical high Cl− on either side of the plasma membrane. When elevating [salt], [sucrose] was adjusted to conserve osmolality. Our method is adapted from Ohsumi and Anraku (40Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Conversely, the human asparagine synthetase (AS) promoter contains two cis-acting elements termed nutrient-sensing response elements (NSRE-1 and NSRE-2) that are required to activate the gene by either amino acid deprivation or the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The results reported here document the comparison between CHOP and AStranscriptional control elements used by the amino acid pathway. We first establish that the AS NSRE-1 sequence shares nucleotide sequence and functional similarities with theCHOP AARE. However, we demonstrate that theCHOP AARE can function independently, whereasAS NSRE-1 is functionally weak by itself and instead requires the presence of NSRE-2. Furthermore, AS NSRE-2 can confer endoplasmic reticulum stress responsiveness to theCHOP AARE. Using activating transcription factor-2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we also show that lack of this transcription factor does not abolish the amino acid inducibility of AS transcription, but this transcription factor is necessary to obtain the full AS response to amino acid starvation. Collectively, these results document that there are significant differences in the molecular mechanisms involved in the transcriptional activation of CHOP and AS by amino acid limitation.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the control of gene expression in response to amino acid deprivation have been extensively studied in yeast (1Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Google Scholar). In addition to specific control of genes involved in the synthesis of individual amino acids, yeast employs a general control process whereby a subset of genes are coordinately regulated by starvation of the cell for any single amino acid. In mammalian cells, specific examples of enzymes, transporters, and mRNAs that are regulated by amino acid availability have been reported (3Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Google Scholar, 4Laine R.O. Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 219-248Google Scholar).

AS is expressed in most mammalian cells and is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine. The level of AS mRNA increases in response not only to asparagine starvation, but also to deprivation of any individual essential amino acid (5Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Google Scholar, 6Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Google Scholar, 7Jousse C. Bruhat A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1555-1560Google Scholar). Guerrini et al. (8Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Google Scholar) used promoter deletion and mutation to analyze the proximal promoter of the human AS gene. They identified the palindromic sequence 5′-CATGATG-3′ at nucleotides −70 to −64 as necessary for theAS promoter regulation by amino acid availability. Recently, Barbosa-Tessmann et al. (9Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar) identified, in the AS5′-flanking region, a “minimum control unit” (nt −111 to −34) that yields basal as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR)- and amino acid-regulated transcription. Using mutation analysis, gel shift assays, and in vivofootprinting experiments, Barbosa-Tessmann et al.demonstrated that two cis-elements termed nutrient-sensing response elements (NSRE-1, 5′-TGATGAAAC-3′, nt −68 to −60; and NSRE-2, 5′-GTTACA-3′, nt −48 to −43) in the AS promoter sequence are essential for transcriptional activation by amino acid limitation or the ERSR. NSRE-1/NSRE-2 in either direction can transfer amino acid responsiveness to a reporter driven by a minimum promoter (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 9Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar). Moreover, gel shift experiments and overexpression of dominant-negative mutants suggest that activation of the AS gene by either amino acid limitation or the ERSR could involve ATF-4 and C/EBPβ binding to the NSRE-1 site (10Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Google Scholar,11Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Google Scholar). Dormant under normal growth conditions, the CHOP gene, also known as GADD153, is induced to high levels during the cellular stress caused by a wide variety of stresses, agents, and nutrient deprivation (12Luethy J.D. Holbrook N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5-10Google Scholar, 13Sylvester S.L. Rhys C.M.J. Luethy-Martindale J. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20119-20125Google Scholar, 14Schmitt-Ney M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40839-40845Google Scholar). The induction of CHOP is generally linked to activation of the ERSR, itself presumably mediated by the accumulation of malfolded proteins (15Wang X.-Z. Lawson B. Brewer J.W. Zinszner H. Sanjay A. Mi L.-J. Boorstein R. Kreibich G. Hendershot L.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4273-4280Google Scholar). CHOP encodes a nuclear protein related to the C/EBP family of transcription factors (16Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Google Scholar). Members of the C/EBP family have been implicated in the regulation of processes relevant to energy metabolism, cellular proliferation, differentiation, and expression of cell type-specific genes (17McKnight S. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Google Scholar, 18Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Google Scholar). By forming heterodimers with members of the C/EBP family, the CHOP protein can influence gene expression both as a dominant-negative regulator of C/EBP binding to one class of DNA targets and by directing CHOP·C/EBP heterodimers to other sequences (19Batchvarova N. Wang X.-Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Google Scholar, 20Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Google Scholar, 21Ubeda M. Wang X.-Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Google Scholar, 22Sok J. Wang X.-Z. Batchvarova N. Kuroda M. Harding H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 495-504Google Scholar). Although many of the pathway steps linking amino acids to gene regulation remain unknown, it has been demonstrated that amino acid limitation regulates CHOP expression through a specific pathway independent of the ER stress signaling cascade (23Jousse C. Bruhat A. Hardind H.P. Ferrara M. Ron D. Fafournoux P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 211-216Google Scholar). The regulation of CHOP expression by amino acid concentration has both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.-Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Google Scholar). Recently, an amino acid response element (AARE) was localized between nucleotides −313 and −295 in the CHOPpromoter. This 19-bp DNA control element, which is essential for amino acid activation of the CHOP promoter, can regulate a basal promoter in response to starvation of several individual amino acids (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). Through block substitution mutagenesis, the sequence 5′-ATTGCATCA-3′ was identified as the minimum core sequence essential for the CHOP AARE activity. The CHOP AARE is related to C/EBP- and ATF/cAMP response element-binding protein-binding sites and was described to bind in vitro to ATF-2 under starved and non-starved conditions. Using ATF-2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and an ATF-2 dominant-negative mutant, the expression of ATF-2 was shown to be essential for the transcriptional activation of CHOP by leucine starvation (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). In parallel, it has recently been hypothesized that the transcription factor ATF-4 could also be involved in the amino acid regulation of CHOP expression (26Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Google Scholar). The objective of the work presented here was to determine whether transcriptional activation of CHOP and AS in response to amino acid limitation occurs by a common mechanism. Using mutation analysis, we first established the minimum core consensus sequence in the 9-bp CHOP AARE that is required to confer amino acid responsiveness as 5′-(R/C)TT(R/T)CRTCA-3′. We show that a promoter containing multiple copies of AS NSRE-1 is regulated in response to leucine starvation and therefore can, in this circumstance, function alone as an AARE. However, although theCHOP AARE and AS NSRE-1 share structural and functional similarities, we demonstrate that lack of ATF-2 reduces (but does not abolish) the transcriptional activation of AS by leucine starvation, whereas the activation of CHOP is completely prevented. Furthermore, if the AS NSRE-2 sequence is placed 10 nt downstream of the AARE core in the CHOPpromoter, regulation by both amino acid limitation and the ERSR pathway is observed. HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When indicated, DMEM/F-12 lacking leucine was used. In all experiments involving amino acid starvation, 10% dialyzed calf serum was used. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in ATF-2 were produced from decapitated, eviscerated, day 14.5 ATF-20/0embryos (27Maekawa T. Bernier F. Sato M. Nomura S. Singh M. Inoue Y. Tokunaga T. Imai H. Yokoyama M. Reimold A.M. Glimcher L. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17813-17819Google Scholar, 28Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Google Scholar) using a 3T3 protocol until cells passed through crisis, typically by passage 18 (28). Cells were plated in 12-well dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (24Bruhat A. Jousse C. Wang X.-Z. Ron D. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17588-17593Google Scholar). Two micrograms of luciferase plasmid were transfected into the cells along with 0.1 μg of pCMV-βGal, a plasmid carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene fused to the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/promoter region, as an internal control. Cells were then exposed to the precipitate for 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with DMEM/F-12 containing 10% calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were amino acid-starved for 16 h. After starvation, cells were harvested in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Promega) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 2 min. Twenty microliters of the supernatant were assayed for luciferase activity (Prodemat, Anduze, France). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (29Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity is given as the ratio of relative luciferase units to relative β-galactosidase units. All values are the means calculated from the results of at least three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells as described previously (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). When double-stranded oligonucleotides were required, equal numbers of moles of complementary strands were heated to 90 °C for 1 min and annealed by slow cooling to room temperature. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). To test the effect of anti-ATF-2 antibody, 1 μl of anti-ATF-2 serum (sc-6233X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the incubation mixture at room temperature 1 h prior to addition of the labeled probe. Each mobility shift experiment was repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of the results. TATATK-LUC, containing the minimum herpes simplex virus promoter for thymidine kinase (TK; nt −40 to +50), was generated as previously described (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). Plasmids 1×-, 2×-, and 5×CHOPAARE-TATATK-LUC were constructed by inserting SstI-XhoI double-stranded oligonucleotides containing one, two, and five iterations of theCHOP AARE sequence, respectively, into the TATATK-LUC plasmid (see Fig. 3). In the same way, one, two, and five copies of the AS NSRE-1 sequence (bottom strand, nt −57 to −75) (10Siu F. Chen C. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48100-48107Google Scholar) were inserted into the TATATK-LUC plasmid, producing 1×-, 2×-, and 5×ASNSRE-1-TATATK-LUC, respectively. Mutation series in the CHOP AARE sequence and deletion and mutation series in the AS promoter were made by insertingSstI-XhoI double-stranded mutated sequences into the TATATK-LUC plasmid. pCHOP-LUC (nt −649 to +91) was generated as previously described (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). Plasmid p3.4AS-LUC, containing a 3.4-kb fragment of the humanAS promoter region, was generated by PCR from cloned genomic DNA (8Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and primers and antisense primers containing appropriate restriction sites at their 5′-ends. Amplified fragments were then cloned into the pGL3-basic reporter construct (Promega) using the XhoI andHindIII restriction sites. All luciferase plasmid constructs were sequenced before utilization using the ABI PRISM Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit and the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was prepared as previously described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed according to the procedure of Sambrook et al. (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.46Google Scholar). The membranes were UV-cross-linked, and then prehybridization was carried out for 2 h at 55 °C in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA. The human CHOP cDNA (BH1) and the human AScDNA were generously provided by Dr. N. J. Holbrook (32Park J.S. Luethy J.D. Wang M.G. Fargnoli J. Fornace Jr., A.J. McBride O.W. Holbrook N.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 259-267Google Scholar) and Dr. C. Basilico (5Gong S.S. Guerrini L. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6059-6066Google Scholar), respectively. CHOP and ASprobes were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 65 °C. The membranes were washed for 15 min at 65 °C successively with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Labeled bands were detected by autoradiography. Autoradiogram signals were visualized using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). To control for either variation in the amount of RNA in different samples or loading errors, all blots were rehybridized with a DNA probe corresponding to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. RelativeCHOP or AS mRNA levels were determined as the ratio of CHOP or AS mRNA to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy mini-kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and treated with DNase I (Amplification grade, Invitrogen) prior to cDNA synthesis. RNA integrity was electrophoretically verified by ethidium bromide staining. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with 100 units of Superscript II Plus RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 100 μm random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers forCHOP (forward primer, 5′-cctagcttggctgacagagg-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-ctgctccttctccttcatgc-3′) and AS (forward primer, 5′-tacaaccacaaggcgctaca-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-aagggcctgactccataggt-3′) were used and yielded PCR products 200 bp in size. To control for RNA quality and cDNA synthesis, β-actin mRNA was also amplified with forward (5′-tacagcttcaccaccacagc-3′) and reverse (5′-aaggaaggctggaaaagagc-3′) primers. Quantification involved the use of standard curves that had been prepared with plasmids containing specific sequences of each gene. We cloned the PCR products of CHOP, AS, and β-actin into the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the construction of standard curves for CHOP, AS, and β-actin, pGEM-T-easy plasmids were prepared as a 10-fold serial dilution in water, from 4 ng to 0.4 pg. PCR was carried out using a LightCyclerTM system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which allows amplification and detection (by fluorescence) in the same tube, with a kinetic approach. For LightCycler PCRs, a master mixture of the following reaction components was prepared to the indicated final concentrations: 10.4 μl of water, 1.6 μl of MgCl2 (3 mm), 1 μl of forward primer (0.5 μm), 1 μl of reverse primer (0.5 μm), and 2 μl of LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The LightCycler master mixture (16 μl) was filled in the LightCycler glass capillaries, and 4 μl of cDNA (2 ng of reverse-transcribed total RNA) were added as PCR template. Capillaries were closed, centrifuged, and placed into the LightCycler rotor. The following LightCycler experimental run protocol was used: denaturation program (95 °C for 10 min), amplification and quantification program repeated 45 times (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 8 s with a single fluorescence measurement), melting curve program (69–95 °C with a heating rate of 0.1 °C/s and a continuous fluorescence measurement), and finally a cooling step to 40 °C. A negative control without cDNA template was run with every assay to assess the overall specificity. LightCycler quantification software (Version 3.5) was used to compare amplification in experimental samples during the log linear phase to the standard curve from the dilution series of control plasmids. Relative results are reported in nanograms of CHOPor AS/100 ng of β-actin. Each experiment was repeated three times to confirm the reproducibility of the results. We have previously shown that the minimum core sequence in the CHOP AARE able to render a heterologous promoter amino acid responsive is 5′-ATTGCATCA-3′ (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). To delineate more precisely the nucleotides essential for the transcriptional activity of theCHOP AARE, we constructed a series of point mutants by substituting each of the 9-bp core sequence nucleotides (nucleotides N1–N9) with three different nucleotides (Fig. 1). A single copy of the 19-bpCHOP AARE sequence with the corresponding mutation was placed upstream of the minimum herpes simplex virus promoter forTK. The mutant constructs were then transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the response to leucine was determined by luciferase activity measurements under starved and non-starved conditions. Among all the mutants, mt3 and mt4 of N1(A) in the 9-bp core sequence and substitutions of N4(G) such as mt12 and mt14 and of N6(A) such as mt19 showed responsiveness to amino acid starvation. In contrast, all substitutions of N2(T) (mt6–mt8), N3(T) (mt9–mt11), N5(C) (mt15–mt17), N7(T) (mt21–mt23), N8(C) (mt24–mt26), and N9(A) (mt27–mt29) abolished the amino acid inducibility. These results establish the minimum consensus sequence in the 9-bp CHOPAARE that is required to confer amino acid responsiveness as 5′-(R/C)TT(R/T)CRTCA-3′ (R = G or A). The core sequence of the CHOP AARE has been shown to bindin vitro to a specific protein complex containing the transcription factor ATF-2, which plays a critical role in the transcriptional activation of CHOP by amino acids (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). To assess the importance of the 9-bp core sequence nucleotides in the binding of the protein complex, gel mobility shift assays were carried out with the 19-bp wild-type CHOP AARE oligonucleotide as a probe and mutant oligonucleotides as competitors. Among the three point mutants corresponding to one nucleotide of the AARE core sequence (Fig. 1), one mutant was chosen for electrophoretic mobility shift assay competition experiments (Fig. 2A). A major specific DNA·protein complex was detected after incubation of non-starved HeLa nuclear extracts with the 32P-labeled CHOP AARE probe (lane 1). Oligonucleotides containing mt4 and mt12, which did not lose the amino acid inducibility (Fig. 1), abolished the binding of the protein complex to the DNA (lanes 4 and5 and lanes 10 and 11, respectively). On the other hand, oligonucleotides containing mt18, mt21, mt24, and mt27, which abolished the amino acid responsiveness (Fig. 1), did not compete for the formation of the AARE·protein complex (lanes 14 and 15, 16 and 17,18 and 19, and 20 and 21, respectively). Oligonucleotides containing mt6, mt9, and mt15, which lost the amino acid inducibility (Fig. 1), competed weakly for complex formation (lanes 6 and 7, 8 and9, and 12 and 13, respectively). However, with the same amount of competitor (50-fold molar excess), oligonucleotides containing mt4 and mt12, which did not lose the amino acid inducibility, completely abolished the binding of the protein complex to the DNA. A supershift assay with the antibody against ATF-2 was performed to demonstrate directly the importance of individual nucleotides within the 9-bp core sequence of the CHOP AARE to ATF-2 binding (Fig. 2B). ATF-2 bound to the wild-type form of the CHOP AARE as shown by the presence of an ATF-2-supershifted DNA·protein complex (lane 3). If the mt4-containing oligonucleotide was used as a probe, anti-ATF-2 antibody supershifted the AARE mt4-bound complex (lane 6). In the case of mt15 and mt27, which showed no response to the amino acid availability, no ATF-2-supershifted DNA·protein complex was observed (lanes 9 and 12). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the nucleotides in the CHOP AARE core sequence required to confer amino acid responsiveness are also essential for the binding of ATF-2. The promoter of the human AS gene has been shown to contain twocis-elements, NSRE-1 and NSRE-2, which are both required to mediate the transcriptional activation of the gene in response to amino acid starvation (9Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of NSRE-1 (5′-GTTTCATCA-3′ on the bottom strand) revealed that it contains a sequence with high similarity to the 9-bp CHOP core consensus sequence (5′-(R/C)TT(R/T)CRTCA-3′) described above (Fig. 3A). Indeed the ASpromoter sequence on the bottom strand (nt −57 to −75) revealed a high identity to the CHOP AARE on the top strand (nt −313 to −295), not only in the AARE core, but also in both of the border sequences. By nucleotide substitutions, this ASsequence had been shown by independent laboratories to be important for the response to amino acid starvation (8Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Google Scholar, 9Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies had shown that the CHOP AARE-like NSRE-1 sequence is not functional in the absence of NSRE-2 (9Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Google Scholar). To determine whether there are any circumstances under which NSRE-1 can, by itself, render a heterologous promoter amino acid-responsive, synthetic ASsequence oligonucleotides (nt −57 to −75) were inserted as one, two, or five copies immediately upstream of the minimum TKpromoter (Fig. 3B). One or two copies of the ASsequence caused a very slight increase in transcription following amino acid deprivation (rows 5 and 6), whereas one or two copies of the CHOP AARE were sufficient to induce the luciferase activity (5- and 14-fold, respectively) in the absence of leucine (rows 2 and 3). However, five copies of the 19-bp AS promoter region (row 7) produced about the same strong amino acid response as obtained with five copies of the CHOP AARE (row 4). Therefore, we conclude that multiple copies of the AS NSRE-1 sequence can render a basal promoter amino acid-responsive and that it can be considered as an AARE. However, the CHOP AARE is notably more sensitive to amino acid starvation than is AS NSRE-1 alone. To determine whether it is the number of the NSRE-1 copies (five copies) or the distance of the fifth copy from the remainder of the promoter, three or four copies were mutated to leave one or two functional copies of the NSRE-1 sequence at a length equal to the construct containing five functional copies (rows 8 and9). The data illustrate that having one or two functional copies of the NSRE-1 sequence at positions 4 and 5 did not result in activated transcription. Therefore, only when NSRE-1 is present in at least three copies does it have AARE-like capability. Moreover, kinetic analysis of luciferase activity driven by five copies of either theCHOP AARE or AS NSRE-1 revealed that induction of the activity was detectable 8 h after starvation and that a maximum induction level was reached after 16 h (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that five copies of theCHOP AARE and the AS NSRE-1 share functional similarities in response to leucine starvation. To examine the respective role of the 9-bp AARE core and border sequences, chimeric AAREs were constructed in which the core sequences of the CHOP AARE and AS NSRE-1 were exchanged (Fig. 4). These 19-bp chimeric AAREs were inserted in a single copy upstream of the TKpromoter. The constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the response to leucine deprivation was determined by luciferase assay. Fusion of the AS border 1 and 2 sequences to theCHOP core sequence caused a decrease in the amino acid inducibility (compare rows 1 and 3), whereas theCHOP border sequences did not increase the amino acid responsiveness of a single copy of the AS core (comparerows 2 and 3). These data demonstrate that only the CHOP border sequences play a role in achieving the amino acid induction of the CHOP AARE. It has been shown previously that ATF-2 has a critical role in the transcriptional activation of CHOP by leucine starvation (25Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Reimold A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7192-7204Google Scholar). To determine the ro"
https://openalex.org/W1548663996,"The rapid loss of ATPase activity of myosin from the red, or slow, skeletal muscles of the rabbit under mild alkaline conditions has been studied in detail. The loss of ATPase activity is irreversible and consistent with a mechanism involving two first order reactions with rate constants of 0.3 and 0.007 min-1. No gross change in molecular structure accompanies inactivation, as judged by the lack of major change in optical rotatory dispersion or sedimentation. Slight increases in the rate of tryptic digestion and reactivity of sulfhydryl groups which may or may not be involved in the loss of enzymic activity are observed after inactivation. It appears that the molecular changes involved in loss of enzymic activity are relatively small and may be localized at or near the catalytic site. Myosin from rabbit cardiac muscle loses ATPase activity at pH 9.0 at the same rate as myosin from red skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2023423754,"The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase (RNAP) II subunit undergoes reversible phosphorylation throughout the transcription cycle. The unphosphorylated form of RNAP II is referred to as IIA, whereas the hyperphosphorylated form is known as IIO. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly at serine 2 and serine 5 within the CTD heptapeptide repeat and has functional implications for RNAP II with respect to initiation, elongation, and transcription-coupled RNA processing. In an effort to determine the role of the major CTD phosphatase (FCP1) in regulating events in transcription that appear to be influenced by serine 2 and serine 5 phosphorylation, the specificity of FCP1 was examined. FCP1 is capable of dephosphorylating heterogeneous RNAP IIO populations of HeLa nuclear extracts. The extent of dephosphorylation at specific positions was assessed by immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphoserine 2 or phosphoserine 5. As an alternative method to assess FCP1 specificity, RNAP IIO isozymes were prepared in vitroby the phosphorylation of purified calf thymus RNAP IIA with specific CTD kinases and used as substrates for FCP1. FCP1 dephosphorylates serine 2 and serine 5 with comparable efficiency. Accordingly, the specificity of FCP1 is sufficiently broad to dephosphorylate RNAP IIO at any point in the transcription cycle irrespective of the site of serine phosphorylation within the consensus repeat. The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase (RNAP) II subunit undergoes reversible phosphorylation throughout the transcription cycle. The unphosphorylated form of RNAP II is referred to as IIA, whereas the hyperphosphorylated form is known as IIO. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly at serine 2 and serine 5 within the CTD heptapeptide repeat and has functional implications for RNAP II with respect to initiation, elongation, and transcription-coupled RNA processing. In an effort to determine the role of the major CTD phosphatase (FCP1) in regulating events in transcription that appear to be influenced by serine 2 and serine 5 phosphorylation, the specificity of FCP1 was examined.

RNAP IIA, which contains an unmodified CTD, is actively recruited to the promoter as part of the preinitiation complex (2Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas RNAP IIO, which contains a hyperphosphorylated CTD, is responsible for transcript elongation (6Bartholomew B. Dahmus M.E. Meares C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, protein kinases and phosphatases that alter the state of CTD phosphorylation can serve as transcriptional activators or repressors depending on the point in the transcription cycle at which they function. CTD phosphorylation occurs predominantly at serines 2 and 5 within the heptapeptide repeat. Genetic evidence indicates that the roles of serines in positions 2 and 5 are different. First, the partial substitution of serines in either position 2 or 5 have different effects on viability (8West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, SRB (suppressors ofRNA Polymerase IIB) mutations suppress the lethal effect of position 2 substitutions but not position 5 substitutions (9Yuryev A. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence has also confirmed differences between the two predominant serine positions. Serine 5 but not serine 2 phosphorylation recruits and activates the 5′-capping machinery (10Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,11Rodriguez C.R. Cho E.-J. Keogh M.-C. Moore C.L. Greenleaf A.L. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nutritional stress and heat shock can independently alter the pattern of CTD phosphorylation, indicating that phosphoserine 2 and phosphoserine 5 are functionally different (12Dubois M.F. Vincent M. Vigneron M. Adamczewski J. Egly J.M. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R.

Vincent M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A recent study using chromatin immunoprecipitation inSaccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrates that the pattern of CTD phosphorylation changes as RNAP II transcribes a given gene (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Serine 5 phosphorylation is detected at the promoter regions, whereas serine 2 phosphorylation is increased as RNAP II leaves the promoter and transcribes the body of the gene. This dynamic phosphorylation of the CTD has functional consequences for the synthesis and processing of the primary transcript. During initiation, TFIIH phosphorylates the CTD at serine 5 (16Lu H. Zawel L. Fisher L. Egly J.M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1992; 358: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 17Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation presumably disrupts various protein-protein interactions important in the formation of the preinitiation complex (18Svejstrup J.Q. Li Y. Fellows J. Gnatt A. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Serine 5 phosphorylation specifically facilitates the recruitment and activation of the mammalian capping enzyme (10Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Capping of the 5′ end of the RNA occurs as soon as the nascent transcript becomes accessible, usually at an RNA length of 25–30 nucleotides (20Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Similarly in yeast, the recruitment and activation of Ceg1 (guanylyltransferase) and Abd1 (methyltransferase) are dependent on serine 5 phosphorylation (11Rodriguez C.R. Cho E.-J. Keogh M.-C. Moore C.L. Greenleaf A.L. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 19McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D.

The retention of these capping enzymes displays a 5′-3′ polarity on the gene (22Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Ceg1 is released early in elongation, whereas Abd1 is released toward the 3′ end of the gene. Although it is unclear what happens to phosphoserine 5, an increase in serine 2 phosphorylation is observed as RNAP II elongates past position 200 (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is the most likely candidate for serine 2 phosphorylation. P-TEFb preferentially phosphorylates serine 2 in early elongation complexes (23Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D.H. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and promotes processive transcript elongation by alleviating the negative effects of DSIF and NELF (24Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The dynamic phosphorylation of the CTD and the preferential phosphorylation of serine 2 and serine 5 can be viewed as molecular switches that control the progression of RNAP II and the recruitment of factors involved in the synthesis and processing of the primary transcript. The extent and specificity of CTD phosphorylation is maintained by the opposing actions of CTD kinases and CTD phosphatase(s). For example, Ctk1 (a putative P-TEFb homolog in yeast) and FCP1 (TFIIF-associating CTDphosphatase) appear to modulate the level of serine 2 phosphorylation in the RNAP II elongation complex (25Cho E.-J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, the level of phosphorylation of nontranscribing RNAP IIO inXenopus laevis early embryos is maintained by MAP kinase Xp42 and FCP1 (26Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike many CTD kinases that have been discovered and characterized, a single CTD phosphatase has been reported to date (for a review, see Ref. 27Lin P.S. Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 333-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies have demonstrated that FCP1 is required for transcription in vivo, and its inactivation leads to a global defect in mRNA synthesis (28Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of RNAP II is dependent on the interaction of FCP1 with a site on RNAP II that is outside of the CTD (29Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Kimura M. Suzuki H. Ishihama A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FCP1 activity is stimulated by RAP74, the larger of the two subunits of TFIIF (29Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TFIIB abrogates the stimulatory activity of TFIIF but has no influence on FCP1 activity in the absence of TFIIF. FCP1 dephosphorylates RNAP IIO generated by serine/threonine CTD kinases but is not sensitive to vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (31Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sensitivity of RNAP IIO in an elongation complex to FCP1 is dependent on its position with respect to the transcriptional start site (32Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although it has been established that FCP1 dephosphorylates phosphoserine 2 at the 3′ end of the gene (25Cho E.-J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and can recycle RNAP IIO to RNAP IIA (34Cho H. Kim T.K. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), it is unclear if FCP1 can dephosphorylate phosphoserine 5 during transcript elongation (15Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). To understand the involvement of FCP1 at discrete stages in the transcription cycle, it is necessary to determine its substrate specificity. To examine FCP1 specificity, two independent experimental approaches were used in this study. First, FCP1 activity was assayed toward endogenous RNAP IIO populations contained in HeLa nuclear extracts. Second, FCP1 activity was assessed using purified calf thymus RNAP IIO substrates prepared in vitro by the phosphorylation of RNAP IIA with different CTD kinases. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human recombinant casein kinase II and mouse recombinant MAP kinase 2/Erk 2 (MAPK2/ERK2) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and human recombinant Cdc2 kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Human CTDK1/CTDK2 were partially purified as previously described (35Payne J.M. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 80-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human TFIIH was generously provided by Dr. Jean-Marc Egly (36Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human P-TEFb was partially purified from HeLa S-100 extract by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), DEAE 15HR (Millipore), HiTrap S, and Phenyl-Superose (both from Amersham Biosciences). P-TEFb was dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Monoclonal antibody POL3/3 recognizes a conserved epitope within the largest RNAP II subunit that is distinct from the CTD (37Kramer A. Haars R. Kabisch R. Will H. Bautz F.A. Bautz E.K. Mol. Gen.

Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Covance. CC3 is an IgG isolated in a screen for chicken proteins with developmentally regulated expression (42Thibodeau A. Vincent M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). B3 is an IgM directed against nuclear matrix components (43Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8253-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared from control cells and cells treated with actinomycin D at 1 μg/ml for 1 h or serum-deprived for 24 h and stimulated with 20% serum for 1 h. After their respective treatments, the cell monolayers grown in 150-cm2 dishes were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and gently removed by scrapping in buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT). Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer B on ice. The cells were then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (10 times), and the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min and fractionated into nuclear pellets and cytosolic supernatants. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) through a syringe to fragment the DNA and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. The nuclear extracts were dialyzed against buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 120 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Calf thymus RNAP IIA was purified by the method of Hodo and Blatti (44Hodo H.D. Blatti S.P. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2334-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Kang and Dahmus (5Kang M.E. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25033-25040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific isozymes of 32P-labeled RNAP IIO were prepared by phosphorylation of purified RNAP IIA with recombinant casein kinase II and [γ-32P]ATP followed by phosphorylation in the presence of excess unlabeled ATP (2 mm) with either purified CTDK1/CTDK2, TFIIH, P-TEFb, recombinant MAPK2/ERK2, or Cdc2 kinase. Each RNAP IIO isozyme was purified by step elution from DE53 as previously described (4Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because only the most carboxyl-terminal serine (casein kinase II site) is labeled with 32P and lies outside the consensus repeat, dephosphorylation by CTD phosphatase results in an electrophoretic mobility shift of subunit IIo to the position of subunit IIa without loss of label. CTD kinase assays were performed as described previously (35Payne J.M. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 80-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 20 μl of CTD kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 8 mmMgCl2, 0.5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmDTT). Each reaction contained 2.75 fmol of 32P-labeled GST-CTDa and an equivalent molar amount of 32P-labeled RNAP IIA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of either TFIIH, P-TEFb, or MAPK2/ERK2 and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, and RNAP II subunits were resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel image was scanned in a Molecular Dynamics Image Scanner Storm 860 in the phosphor screen mode and analyzed by ImageQuant software. Both purified and recombinant human FCP1 were used in these studies. Human FCP1 was purified from HeLa cells as described previously (45Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and used in assays involving endogenous RNAP IIO substrates. Recombinant human FCP1 was expressed in Sf21 cells, purified to homogeneity, and used in assays involving RNAP IIO substrates prepared in vitro by CTD kinases. Recombinant FCP1 was purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and HiTrap SP and Q in series (both from Amersham Biosciences) and HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column that had been coupled with recombinant RAP74 (Amersham Biosciences). Purified FCP1 had a specific activity of 40,000 units/mg, whereas recombinant FCP1 had a specific activity of 270,000 units/mg. One unit of CTD phosphatase corresponds to the activity required to convert 1 pmol of free RNAP IIO to RNAP IIA in 1 min in the presence of a saturating amount of RAP74. CTD phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (31Chambers R.S. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26243-26248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reactions were performed in 20 μl of CTD phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.025% Tween 80, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT) in the presence of 20 mm KCl. Reactions involving endogenous RNAP II in HeLa nuclear extracts contained ∼200–250 fmol of RNAP IIO. Reactions involving purified RNAP II contained 18 fmol of RNAP IIO. Both reactions were carried out in the presence of 7 pmol of RAP74. Reactions were initiated by the addition of FCP1 and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, and RNAP II subunits were resolved on a 5 or 6% SDS-PAGE gel. CTD phosphatase assays of endogenous RNAP IIO contained in nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blots using dilutions of 1:1,000 POL3/3, 1:250 H5, 1:250 H14, 1:1,000 CC3, or 1:1,000 B3 followed by 1:10,000 anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). The blots were visualized by ECL Plus detection system (AmershamBiosciences). CTD phosphatase assays of FCP1 on purified casein kinase II-labeled RNAP IIO were analyzed by autoradiography. The corresponding blot and gel images were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics Image Scanner Storm 860 in blue fluorescence mode and phosphor screen mode, respectively. FCP1 specificity was initially examined with in vivo populations of heterogeneous RNAP IIO contained in HeLa nuclear extracts. The reactivity of endogenous RNAP IIO with phosphoserine-specific monoclonal antibodies was assessed before and after dephosphorylation with FCP1. Based on reactivity with synthetic peptides, monoclonal antibodies H5 and CC3 recognize phosphoserine in position 2 within the heptapeptide repeat, whereas H14 and B3 recognize phosphoserine in position 5 (Fig.1 A) (13Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). POL3/3, directed against an epitope in the largest RNAP II subunit that is outside of the CTD (37Kramer A. Haars R. Kabisch R. Will H. Bautz F.A. Bautz E.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 180: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Kontermann R.E. Liu Z. Schulze R.A. Sommer K.A. Queitsch I. Duebel S. Kipriyanov S.M. Breitling F. Bautz E.K.F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), permits the detection of the largest subunit irrespective of the state of CTD phosphorylation. The degree and the specificity by which FCP1 dephosphorylates endogenous RNAP IIO were measured by the disappearance of immunoreactivity. Because a variety of studies have shown that changes in growth conditions can give rise to changes in the level and pattern of CTD phosphorylation, HeLa nuclear extracts from differentially treated cells provide a source of heterogeneous RNAP IIO. The FCP1 sensitivity of RNAP IIO present in HeLa nuclear extracts of control cells, cells treated with actinomycin D, and cells stimulated with serum was examined. Treatment of cells with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or α-amanitin increases the ratio of RNAP IIO/IIA (46Cassé C. Giannoni F. Nguyen V.T. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. J. Biol.

The increase in IIo signals, as indicated by increases in POL3/3 immunoreactivity relative to control extracts, confirms the above-mentioned studies that RNAP IIO levels are elevated in response to environmental stimuli (Fig. 1 B, panel POL3/3, compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and5). Upon treatment of the three HeLa nuclear extracts with 100 milliunits of FCP1, the major fraction of RNAP IIO is converted to RNAP IIA (Fig.1 B, panel POL3/3, lanes 2,4, and 6). FCP1 processively dephosphorylates endogenous RNAP IIO. As indicated by the disappearance of immunoreactivity of H5 and H14, FCP1 is capable of removing phosphates from serine 2 and serine 5 in control HeLa nuclear extract (Fig.1 B, panels H5 and H14, lanes 1 and 2). Likewise, FCP1 shows similar specificity toward RNAP IIO in HeLa nuclear extract from cells treated with actinomycin D (Fig. 1 B, panels H5 andH14, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, phosphoserine 2 is relatively resistant to FCP1 dephosphorylation in HeLa nuclear extract from cells stimulated with serum (Fig.1 B, panels H5 and H14, lanes 5 and 6). These observations are confirmed by the use of CC3 and B3 in parallel Western blots (Fig. 1 B,panels CC3 and B3). In the presence of higher concentrations of FCP1, the complete dephosphorylation of phosphoserine 2 in serum-stimulated HeLa nuclear extract is observed (data not shown). These results indicate that FCP1 is capable of removing phosphates from serine positions 2 and 5. To investigate whether the resistance of phosphoserine 2 to FCP1 dephosphorylation is conferred with increasing time of serum exposure, HeLa cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with 20% serum for 0, 10, 30, and 60 min. The percentage of RNAP IIO that remained relatively resistant to dephosphorylation did not change as a function of time, suggesting that resistance of phosphoserine 2 to FCP1 dephosphorylation is conferred by serum starvation rather than serum stimulation (data not shown). An alternative approach to establishing the specificity of FCP1 is to examine the ability of FCP1 to dephosphorylate RNAP IIO prepared in vitro by the phosphorylation of RNAP IIA with distinct CTD kinases. The phosphorylation of purified calf thymus RNAP IIA and GST-CTDa in the presence of increasing amounts of TFIIH (lanes 1–5), P-TEFb (lanes 6–10), and MAPK2/ERK2 (lanes 11–15) is shown in Fig. 2. Both RNAP IIA and GST-CTDa are labeled with 32P at their terminal serine by phosphorylation with casein kinase II. Because RNAP IIA and GST-CTDa are present in equimolar amounts in the same reaction, the efficiency with which each is shifted to the phosphorylated form is a measure of the substrate specificity of the CTD kinase present. The relative difference in the intensity of radiolabeled GST-CTDa and radiolabeled subunit IIa is a consequence of the difference in the efficiency of32P incorporation by casein kinase II. TFIIH and P-TEFb efficiently convert RNAP IIA to RNAP IIO in a processive manner but show no or marginal activity toward GST-CTDa, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 1–5 and lanes 6–10). However, MAPK2/ERK2 converts both RNAP IIA and GST-CTDa to their phosphorylated forms in a distributive manner and with comparable efficiency (Fig. 2, lanes 11–15). This result indicates that the activities of TFIIH and P-TEFb are strongly dependent on the context in which the CTD is presented. In contrast, the activity of MAPK2/ERK2 appears to be insensitive to context. These findings suggest that the activities of TFIIH and P-TEFb are dependent on factors that are extrinsic to the CTD. Accordingly, react"

To test whether in postmitotic neurons the Rb/E2F1 pathway can be activated by the nonmitogenic stress signaling, we examined the role of the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in regulating Rb phosphorylation in response to Fas (CD95/APO1)-mediated apoptosis of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Anti-Fas antibody induced a dramatic and early activation of p38. Activated p38 was correlated with the induction of hyperphosphorylation of both endogenous and exogenous Rb. The p38-selective inhibitor, SB203580, attenuated such an increase in pRb phosphorylation and significantly protected CGNs from Fas-induced apoptosis. The cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated Rb phosphorylation played a lesser role in this neuronal death paradigm, since cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as olomoucine, roscovitine, and flavopiridol, did not significantly prevent anti-Fas antibody-evoked neuronal apoptosis. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb by p38 SAPK resulted in the release of Rb-bound E2F1. Increased E2F1 modulated neuronal apoptosis, since E2F1−/− CGNs were significantly less susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis in comparison with the wild-type CGNs. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that neuronal Rb/E2F1 is modulated by the nonproliferative p38 SAPK in Fas-mediated neuronal apoptosis.

Fas (CD95/APO1) death receptor-mediated neuronal apoptosis has been implicated in the development of a variety of neurological diseases. For example, following hypoxic ischemia, the increased expression of Fas receptor and its ligand mediates neuronal apoptosis and contributes to brain and spinal cord damage (1Rosenbaum D.M. Gupta G.

Once activated, the p38 SAPK can phosphorylate transcription factors, such as ATF-2, Elk-1, myelin basic protein (23Harper S.J. LoGrasso P.

However, in postmitotic neurons, the downstream target of the p38 SAPK in Fas-mediated neuronal apoptosis is not yet clear. One of the possible candidates is the Rb/E2F1 pathway. Works reported from many other laboratories, including our own, showed that the transcription factor E2F1 is an important mediator of neuronal apoptosis (26Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I.

E2F1-mediated apoptosis is tightly regulated by the Rb protein, which efficiently blocks E2F1-mediated apoptosis (32Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X.

Hyperphosphorylation of Rb by the CDK4/6-cyclin D complex leads to the dissociation of pRb from its binding partner E2F1 (34Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Inhibitors of the CDK-cyclin complex, such as olomoucine, roscovitine, and flavopiridol, reduce the phosphorylation of Rb, increase Rb binding to E2F1, and protect both cycling cells and neurons from E2F1-mediated apoptosis (35Ferguson K.L.

Because the Rb/E2F1 pathway plays a critical role in determining the fate of a cell, these proteins are the logical targets of multiple signaling pathways. In addition to the mitogenic signals such as the CDK-cyclin complex, other nonproliferative stress signals such as p38 SAPK may also target Rb to modulate E2F1-mediated apoptosis through phosphorylation of Rb, as has been demonstrated in Jurkat cells by Wang et al. (22Wang S. Nath N. Minden A. Chellappan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Google Scholar). However, little is known of whether the p38 SAPK modulates the Rb/E2F1 pathway to induce apoptosis of postmitotic neurons under physiological settings. In the present study, we used Fas-mediated apoptosis of cultured CGNs as a physiological model to examine the activation of p38 and to investigate whether p38 targets the Rb/E2F1 pathway to induce neuronal apoptosis. We show that Rb is targeted by the p38 SAPK via hyperphosphorylation, which leads to increased E2F1-mediated neuronal apoptosis. CGNs were prepared from 6–9-day postnatal mice (E2F1+/+ and E2F1−/− mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, bred, and genotyped locally as described previously (40MacManus J.P. Koch C.J. Jian M. Walker T. Zurakowski B. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2711-2714Google Scholar)). The cerebellum was removed and cultured exactly as described (26Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I. Kang L. Massie B. Morley P. Murray C. Rasquinha I. Slack R. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 91-100Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for at least 7 days before experimentation. CGNs cultured on a 24-well plate were treated with 2 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody (catalog no. sc-7886; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 2, 4, 6, 12, and 18 h or at 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2, and 2.4 μg/ml for 12 h. Neuronal viability was measured by adding the nonfluorescent hydrophobic dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to the culture medium at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml as described before (26Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I. Kang L. Massie B. Morley P. Murray C. Rasquinha I. Slack R. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 91-100Google Scholar). Cultured CGNs were also pretreated with SB203580 dissolved in Me2SO for 15 min and then stimulated with the anti-Fas antibody. The cells were subsequently fixed with 10% formalin for 20 min and stained with Hoechst 33528 for 5 min. Healthy and dead cells were counted under a fluorescent microscope. At least 500 nuclei were randomly selected and counted. The procedures for fluorescent immunocytochemistry were exactly as previously described (26Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I. Kang L. Massie B. Morley P. Murray C. Rasquinha I. Slack R. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 91-100Google Scholar). The primary antibody against Fas receptor was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Neuron-specific antibody to NeuN was a gift from Dr. R. J. Mullen (School of Medicine, University of Utah). A specific mouse monoclonal antibody to E2F1 (KH129) was a gift from C. Ngwu (Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Harvard Medical School). Antibodies to p38, phospho-p38, and phospho-pRb were purchased fromCell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The procedures for Western blotting were exactly as described previously (30Hou S.T. Cowan E. Dostanic S. Rasquinha I. Comas T. Morley P. MacManus J.P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 306: 153-156Google Scholar). The intensities of the bands were quantitated using Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant Software. The assay was performed as described previously (29Hou S.T. Cowan E. Walker T. Ohan N. Dove M. Rasqinha I. MacManus J.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 287-297Google Scholar). The results were presented as absolute fluorescent units/μg of protein/h. The -fold induction was normalized with the untreated controls. IP was performed using a streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads method (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) exactly as described (41Tu Y. Hou S.T. Huang Z. Robertson G.S. MacManus J.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 658-669Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μg of total protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody to Rb (BD Biosciences, Missisauga, Canada) or phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology). These primary antibodies had already been captured by the Dynal beads-secondary antibody complex. After washing away unbound proteins, the immunoprecipitated Rb/E2F1-beads protein complex was subjected to either Western blotting for E2F1 (see above) or E2F1 DNA binding assay;i.e. IP complex (Rb/E2F1-beads) was first washed with the DNA binding buffer three times and then resuspended in the binding buffer. The binding buffer contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 6% glycerol, 50 μg of denatured herring sperm DNA and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC). The Rb/E2F1-beads complex was then co-incubated with 0.2 ng of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled E2F1 specific double-stranded DNA (upper strand, 5′-GCTCTTTCGCGGCAAAAAGG-3′; lower strand, 5′-CCTTTTGCCGCAAAGAGC-3′) for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then washed three times with the binding buffer to eliminate the unbound radioactive oligonucleotides. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 10 min in the loading buffer. Magnetic beads were recaptured, and the supernatant at 10 μl was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, dried, and analyzed using autoradiography by exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat films. In order to show the specificity of E2F1 binding, excess amounts (100-fold) of unlabeled E2F1 probe or nonrelated, sequence-scrambled DNA probe were added to the mixture to either compete out or reduce the binding of the specific E2F1 band, respectively. To measure p38 SAPK activity, a nonradioactive IP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) was used exactly as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, p38 was immunoprecipitated from 250 μg of Fas-treated CGNs using an antibody to p38. The IP product was mixed with 2 μg of GST-ATF-2 or 2 μg of bacterially produced Rb protein (QED Biosciences) in the presence of 200 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1× gel loading buffer. The mixture was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Phosphorylated ATF-2 and Rb were detected using phospho-specific antibodies. All of the above described experiments were repeated at least three times, and the statistical significance was calculated using the method indicated in the figure legend. To understand the mechanisms of Fas-mediated neuronal death, we used cultured mouse CGNs as an in vitro model. The following three experiments showed that Fas indeed functioned as a death receptor in CGNs. (i) Fas expressed on the surface of postmitotic neurons (Fig. 1) as shown by double immunolabeling with an antibody to Fas and a neuron-specific antibody to NeuN (Fig1B). (ii) Treating CGNs with the Fas antibody (sc-7886) induced an increased expression of Fas (not shown) and a decreased neuronal viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). The viability of the Fas antibody-treated cultures was examined by the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate assay, which monitored the activities of esterase in cells. After an 18-h treatment with 2 μg/ml of the Fas antibody, the intensity of the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate assay decreased to about 40% of that of the untreated control cultures. The antibody interaction with Fas is specific, since the denatured Fas antibody (boiled for 10 min) and a nonspecific rabbit preimmune serum failed to induce neuronal death (not shown). (iii) Fas overexpression killed cultured CGNs (Fig. 2C) as has been shown in other cell types (42Lamboley C. Bringuier A.F. Camus E. Lardeux B. Groyer A. Feldmann G. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 385-394Google Scholar). A replication-defective adenovirus containing the Fas cDNA was added to the cultured CGNs at a concentration of 100 units of multiplicity of infection. After a 72-h infection with the virus, significant neuronal death occurred in comparison with the cultures treated with the control virus containing only green fluorescent protein. Neuronal death induced by the Fas antibody had condensed and punctate nuclear morphology, indicative of apoptosis (see Fig. 4B).Figure 2Fas-mediated reduction in neuronal viability.Cultured CGNs were treated with 2 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody for 0–24 h (A) or with a range of concentrations of anti-Fas antibody (B). The cellular viability was measured with the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) assay. A replication-defective adenovirus expressing Fas was added to the CGN culture at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 48 or 72 h. Infected cultures were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with Hoechst. Normal and apoptotic nuclei were counted and plotted. Overexpression of Fas (labeled as F in C) clearly induced significant neuronal death in comparison with the control virus (expressing only green fluorescence protein, labeled as G inC) and the nontreated control (N inC). **, statistical significance by Student's ttest (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Inhibition of p38 SAPK confers neuroprotection.The working concentrations of p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm, labeled as SB inG) and CDK inhibitors, olomoucine (200 μm, labeled as O in G), roscovitine (50 μm, labeled as R in G), and flavopiridol (2 μm, labeled as F inG), were determined empirically. The inhibitors at the above stated concentrations were added 15 min prior to treatment with 2 μg/ml of the anti-Fas antibody. The treated CGNs were then fixed with 10% formalin and stained with Hoechst. The number of apoptotic cells (arrowheads) were counted (A–F) and plotted (G) against healthy nuclei (arrows).

As shown in Fig. 3A, p38 was expressed ubiquitously in CGNs, whereas the phosphorylated form of p38 was expressed at a very low level almost beyond detection by the Western blotting (Fig. 3A). After 2-h treatment with the Fas receptor antibody, the expression of phosphorylated p38 increased dramatically, and the level of phospho-p38 stayed elevated after 4 and 6 h of treatment. Such a fast kinetics of induction of the phosphorylated p38 suggested that the p38 kinase was involved in the Fas receptor-mediated death signal transduction in neurons. Indeed, anti-Fas antibody induced a sharp increase in p38 kinase activity as measured by the increased phosphorylation of p38 substrate ATF-2 (Fig. 3B, lane 3, top panel), whereas the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor SB203580 dramatically reduced p38 phosphorylation of ATF-2 (Fig. 3B,lane 4). An equal amount of p38 was immunoprecipitated as shown by Western blotting in the lower panel of Fig. 3B. Bacterially expressed GST-Rb (lane 5) and ATF-2 (lane 6) were loaded on the same gel to serve as negative controls. Such a reduction in p38 kinase activity was associated with neuroprotection (Fig. 4, A–C andG). As indicated in Fig 4G, after 24-h treatment with 2 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody, 90% of the CGNs were apoptotic in comparison with about 45% of apoptotic cells in SB203580-treated cultures. One of the potential targets of p38 SAPK is the retinoblastoma gene product Rb. Rb is expressed in CGNs as a 110-kDa band on Western blotting (Fig. 5A). In response to anti-Fas antibody treatment, Rb phosphorylation increased. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb created a band shift of the 110-kDa Rb band to a molecular mass close to 116 kDa (Fig. 5A). A phospho-specific Rb antibody was also used to specifically detect increased hyperphosphorylation of Rb in response to the anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 5B). The induction of Rb phosphorylation correlated temporally with the increased activation of p38 (i.e. 2 h after treatment with the anti-Fas antibody). The level of pRb remained high after 6 h of treatment, albeit at a relatively lower level in comparison with that of the 2-h treated CGNs (Fig. 5, A and B). Such an induction of pRb phosphorylation is mediated by the p38 kinase but not the CDKs. The p38 inhibitor, SB203580, reduced the hyperphosphorylation of Rb in response to anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 5,A, lanes 3 and 6, andB, lanes 3, 5, and7) and protected CGNs from anti-Fas antibody-induced neuronal death (Fig. 4, A–C and G), whereas potent CDK inhibitors such as olomoucine (200 μm) and roscovitine (50 μm) and flavopirodal (2 μm) did not reduce the hyperphosphorylation state of the pRb in response to anti-Fas antibody treatment (not shown) and also failed to provide any neuroprotection (Fig. 4, D–G), indicating that Fas-mediated induction in hyperphosphorylation of Rb is unlikely to be mediated by the CDKs. To see whether the endogenous neuronal p38 can phosphorylate Rbin vitro, cell extracts were first immunoprecipitated with antibody to phospho-p38 and then mixed with bacterially expressed Rb as substrate. Indeed, Fas-activated p38 induced an increase in phosphorylation of exogenous Rb (Fig. 5C, lane 2), whereas SB203580 inhibited such an induction in Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 5C, lane 3). Nonphosphorylated Rb (lane 4) and ATF-2 (lane 5) were loaded on the same gel, serving as negative controls, and they were not recognized by the phospho-Rb-specific antibody. The consequence of increased phosphorylation of Rb is the release of Rb-bound E2F1, which, when overexpressed, is known to induce neuronal apoptosis (26Hou S.T. Callaghan D. Fournier M.C. Hill I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11553-11560Google Scholar). To see whether the total cellular E2F1 level changes following anti-Fas antibody treatment, we first used Western blotting to detect neuronal E2F1. No dramatic changes in the level of total E2F1 occurred (Fig. 6A). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to see changes in the level of “free” E2F1 capable of binding to DNA (Fig. 6B). Anti-Fas antibody elicited an induction in the “free” E2F1 band (arrow in lane 3 compared with that inlane 2 in B) and also the level of complexed E2F1, most likely bound with Rb. An excess amount of cold probe (100-fold) almost completely competed out these bands (lane 4). An adenovirus expressing E2F1 was used to overexpress E2F1 to serve as a positive control for the E2F1 band (lane 5). These experiments showed that anti-Fas antibody did not alter the expression level of E2F1; however, it increased the amount of E2F1 capable of binding to DNA. We next examined whether the interaction of Rb with E2F1 had changed. To do this, Rb-bound E2F1 was pulled out by immunoprecipitation with an antibody to Rb. The level of Rb-bound E2F1 was detected either by Western blotting or E2F1 DNA binding assay. First, Rb/E2F1-beads complex was dissociated from its bound magnetic beads by treatment with an acid elution buffer at pH 2.5. The eluted protein was renatured by adjusting the pH back to 7.4 using 1 m Tris buffer. The mixture was then boiled in loading buffer and subjected to Western blotting to detect E2F1 (Fig. 6C). Control CGNs showed a visible amount of E2F1 (Fig. 6C, lane 1), indicating the existence of Rb/E2F1-beads complexes in untreated neurons. CGNs treated with SB203580 alone had a slight increase in the level of E2F1 (lane 2) compared with the control, suggesting that inhibition of endogenous p38 activity reduced phosphorylation of Rb and increased the amount of unphosphorylated Rb that bound to E2F1. After a 2-h treatment with anti-Fas antibody, CGNs showed a much reduced level of Rb-bound E2F1 (lane 3) to a level barely visible on the Western blot when compared with the control, indicating increased release of Rb-bound E2F1. In the sample treated with both SB203580 and anti-Fas antibody, the E2F1 level was high (lane 4), again suggesting that inhibition of p38 activity with SB203580 reduced Rb phosphorylation and increased Rb binding with E2F1. The second method we used to detect Rb-bound E2F1 was by an E2F1 DNA binding assay. The Rb/E2F1-beads complex was captured on magnetic beads as described above. However, this made it impossible to elute the bound proteins under nondenaturing conditions for a gel mobility shift assay. Therefore, an alternative E2F1 DNA binding assay was used to examine the amount of Rb-bound E2F1. The immunoprecipitation product was washed three times under nondenaturing conditions using DNA binding buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) and then mixed with32P-labeled dsE2F1 oligonucleotides. After a 30-min incubation, the mixture was washed three times to eliminate the unbound probes. The mixture was boiled for 5 min and then loaded onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then exposed to an x-ray film. The dot intensity reflected the amount of Rb-bound E2F1 that was captured by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 6D, CGNs treated with the anti-Fas antibody had reduced dot intensity in comparison with the control, indicating less Rb-bound E2F1, whereas CGNs treated with both SB203580 and anti-Fas antibody had stronger dot intensity than that from the sample treated with anti-Fas antibody alone, indicating the presence of more Rb-bound E2F1. Taken together, these experiments showed that p38 phosphorylation of Rb affected E2F1. To investigate whether E2F1 is indeed implicated in the pathway of Fas-mediated neuronal death, we tested the susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis in CGNs derived from E2F1 knockout (E2F1−/−) mice. E2F1−/− CGNs were first compared with the wild-type (+/+) CGNs in their expression of Fas, p38, and Rb using immunostaining or Western blotting. Both the localization (not shown) and the level of Fas expression were indistinguishable between the E2F1+/+ and E2F1−/− CGNs (Fig. 7A). Similarly, there were no differences in the expression levels of p38, Rb, and their phosphorylated forms (Fig. 7, A and B). In response to the same dose of anti-Fas antibody, E2F1−/− CGNs also showed a similar level of induction of phospho-p38 as the wild-type CGNs (Fig. 7, C and D). Despite all of these similarities, E2F1−/− CGNs were significantly less susceptible to the anti-Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8) and showed less caspase-3-like activity (Fig. 8E). Interesting"

Membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins are thought to be scaffolding molecules in these processes and bind multiple proteins via their obligate postsynaptic density (PSD)-95/Disc Large/Zona Occludens-1, Src homology 3, and guanylate kinase-like domains. Subsets of MAGUK proteins have additional protein-protein interaction domains. An additional domain we identified in SAP97 called the MAGUK recruitment (MRE) domain binds the LIN-2,7 amino-terminal (L27N) domain of mLIN-2/CASK, a MAGUK known to bind mLIN-7. Here we show that SAP97 binds two other mLIN-7 binding MAGUK proteins. One of these MAGUK proteins, DLG3, coimmunoprecipitates with SAP97 in lysates from rat brain and transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. This interaction requires the MRE domain of SAP97 and surprisingly, both the L27N and L27 carboxyl-terminal (L27C) domains of DLG3. We also demonstrate that SAP97 can interact with the MAGUK protein, DLG2, but not the highly related protein, PALS2.

The ability of SAP97 to interact with multiple MAGUK proteins is likely to be important for the targeting of specific protein complexes in polarized cells. Polarized cells such as neurons and epithelia establish and maintain a nonhomogenous plasma membrane distribution of both integral and peripheral membrane proteins (1Craig A.M. Banker G.

Apical and basolateral membranes of epithelial cells are subdivided into even smaller subdomains, e.g. lipid rafts, adherens junctions, and tight junctions, each with unique sets of proteins and distinct functions. Neurons are also highly polarized cells segregating different protein complexes in the presynaptic axon and postsynaptic dendrite. Polarity can be a dynamic event where proteins are shuttled from one place to another or a more static process where proteins are retained at a particular cell surface (4Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mostov K.E. Verges M. Altschuler Y. Curr.Opin.Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Large complexes of proteins are involved in each of these cellular processes. Several members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase, or MAGUK, 1The abbreviations used for: MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; PDZ, postsynaptic density 95/discs large/zona occludens 1; SAP97, synapse associated protein 97; MRE, MAGUK recruitment; L27, LIN2,7; KIF17, kinesin superfamily member 17; MPP, membrane protein, palmitoylated; PALS, protein associated with Lin Seven; Dlg, discs large; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase. family of proteins have been implicated in polarity processes. MAGUKs are a subclass of PDZ domain-containing proteins. Several members of the PDZ domain-containing family have been reported to form large multiprotein complexes to accomplish specific cellular tasks. One example is the mLIN-10/mLIN-2/mLIN-7 complex of proteins (6Butz S. Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1998; 94: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 7Kaech S.M.

In neurons, the scaffolding MAGUK mLIN-2 binds mLIN-10, which in turn binds KIF17, a motor protein (9Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Movement of protein cargo along microtubules was shown to depend on the interaction of KIF17 with mLIN-10. Intriguingly, mLIN-2 binds mLIN-7 in epithelial cells where mLIN-7 acts to retain betaine-glutamate transporter 1 at the basolateral surface (10Perego C. Vanoni C. Villa A. Longhi R. Kaech S.M. Frohli E. Hajnal A. Kim S.K. Pietrini G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hence, protein complexes that include mLIN-2 seem to serve both dynamic and static functions. Recently, a subset of MAGUKs was defined by the presence of a novel protein-protein interaction domain found to bind mLIN-7 (11Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This group has several members including mLIN-2/CASK, DLG2 (MPP2), DLG3 (MPP3), MPP4, PALS1 (MPP5), and PALS2 (MPP6). Each protein contains a PDZ domain, an Src homology 3 domain, and a catalytically inactive guanylate kinase domain in addition to two novel domains that were named L27N (located closer to the amino terminus) and L27C (positioned closer to the carboxyl terminus) (12Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The L27C domain of mLIN-2 and PALS1 has been shown to bind mLIN-7 (11Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The L27N domain of mLIN-2/CASK binds SAP97 (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J.Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the L27N domain of PALS1 binds the Pals1-associated tight junction protein (15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Subtle differences were noted between the mLIN-7 binding proteins. For example, a protein 4.1 binding domain (or hook domain) is present in all except DLG3 and MPP4. Protein 4.1 binding domains provide a link to the cortical actin cytoskeletion by binding to members of the Protein 4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moeisin superfamily (16Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A. Branton D.

Also, mLIN-2 and PALS1 have an extra domain at their extreme amino termini, calmodulin kinase type 2 and U1 (unknown interaction domain 1), respectively. Because large complexes of PDZ domain-containing proteins seem to be important mediators of polarity establishment and maintenance, defining these complexes could elucidate novel cellular functions. SAP97, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Dlg (19Muller B.M. Kistner U. Veh R.W. Cases-Langhoff C. Becker B. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. J.Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2354-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is a MAGUK protein that was reported to bind mLIN-2/CASK via a newly described MAGUK recruitment (MRE) domain (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Here we show that SAP97 binds two other mLIN-7 associated MAGUKs via this MRE domain. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of mouse DLG3 reported in GenBank contained the amino acids EPAASSELS, which was highly divergent from other mLIN-7 binding proteins and the reported sequence for human DLG3. We obtained and sequenced a mouse expressed sequence tag (GenBank accession number AI1498811), which contained sequence that coded for a carboxyl terminus highly homologous to both human DLG3 and other mLIN-7 binding proteins. We amplified mouse DLG3 from this clone and subcloned it into PCDNA3.1 in frame with an amino-terminal Myc tag and sequenced this construct. The sequence coded for a protein that was almost identical to human DLG3. The coding sequence for DLG3 was also subcloned into the RK5-Myc vector. The pGSTag-DLG3 (1–222) construct was created by subcloning a restriction enzyme-digested PCR product using standard methods. Construction of pGSTag-SAP97 (1–78), pGSTag-mLIN-2/CASK(L27N) (329–403) for expression as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins has been described elsewhere (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The deletions constructs RK5-Myc-DLG3(ΔL27N), RK5-Myc-DLG3(ΔL27C), and RK5-Myc-DLG3(ΔPDZ) were made by the single primer method as described elsewhere (20Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The point mutation contructs RK5-Myc-DLG3(L91G) and RK5-Myc-DLG3(L34G:F38G) were also made by the single primer method. The coding sequence for DLG2 was amplified from a mouse cDNA library and subcloned into PCDNA3.1 in frame with an amino-terminal Myc tag. Bacterial expression, purification, and labeling of GST-mLIN-7 (mouse), GST-DLG3 (1–222) (mouse), and GST-mLIN-2 (329–403) (human) for use in Far Western blotting was performed as previously described (11Kamberov E.

Blots were done either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature. Additionally, dried membranes were either exposed to film with intensifying screens or processed for analysis using a PhosphorImager. Polyclonal antibodies against GST-DLG3 (289–365) were raised in rabbits with the fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose beads as the immunogen. Affinity purification of anti-DLG3 antibodies was carried out with DLG3 (289–365) expressed as a NusA fusion protein coupled to Affi-Gel support as described elsewhere (22Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody was only used for Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of DLG3 was performed using an antibody which was the kind gift of Elior Peles. Antibodies directed against PALS2 and mLIN-7 were reported elsewhere (11Kamberov E. Makarova O.

A monoclonal antibody to SAP97 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies. The mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 was used wherever an anti-Myc antibody was indicated. MDCK cells were transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche) as previously described (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For constructs cloned into the PCDNA3.1/zeocin vector, stably expressing clones were selected in 200 μg/ml zeocin, picked, and maintained in 100 μg/ml zeocin. For constructs cloned into the pRK5-Myc vector, cells were cotransfected with either PCDNA3.1/Hyg or pSV2/Neo. Antibiotic selection and maintenance concentrations were 500 μg/ml and 250 μg/ml for hygromycin and 600 μg/ml and 300 μg/ml for G418. Cells were processed for immunostaining and imaged as previously described (22Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Confocal microscopy was performed at the Microscopy and Image Analysis Laboratory at the University of Michigan using a Zeiss LSM510 Axiovert 100M inverted confocal microscope.

Using this technique, we found that in addition to mLIN-2/CASK, other mLIN-7 binding proteins were present in SAP97 immunoprecipitations (11Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S.

To explore this further, rat brain lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against known mLIN-7 binding proteins including DLG3 and PALS2. Immunoprecipitations were also performed with mLIN-7 and SAP97 antibodies (Fig. 1 B). Pre-immune serum was included as a control for nonspecific binding to the protein-A Sepharose beads. Three mLIN-7 binding proteins clearly coimmunoprecipitated with SAP97. Two co-migrated with proteins in the DLG3 and mLIN-2 lanes at ∼64 kDa and 110 kDa, respectively. The third migrated close to PALS2 at ∼55–60 kDa. However, PALS2 seemed to migrate slightly below this molecular mass and was seen as a doublet when blotting with a PALS2 antibody (data not shown). Based on the immunoprecipitation experiments in rat brain, DLG3 was investigated as a putative partner for SAP97. To see whether the interaction was direct, we used Far Western blotting using [32P]GST-DLG3 (1–222) as a probe. This probe, which includes both L27 domains and the PDZ domain of DLG3, was chosen because shorter probes containing one or both L27 domains were poorly expressed in bacteria. Lysates from MDCK cells transfected with Myc-tagged mouse DLG3 were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Myc, SAP97, mLIN-7, or pre-immune serum (Fig.2 A). It should be noted that the mouse DLG3 we subcloned was obtained from an expressed sequence tag and differs from the sequence reported in GenBank (see “Experimental Procedures”). The probe bound a protein that migrated at ∼130 kDa in all lanes except pre-immune. This membrane was stripped and reprobed with [32P]GST-mLIN-7 to confirm that Myc-DLG3 was efficiently immunoprecipitated (data not shown). This experiment strongly suggested that DLG3 directly bound SAP97 via either its L27N domain, L27C domain, PDZ domain, or some combination of the three. Before discriminating between those possibilities we wanted to study the interaction further. Previously published data from our lab showed that the first 78 amino acids of SAP97 containing the MRE domain were necessary and sufficient for mLIN-2/CASK binding (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). By GST-pull down, we tested whether SAP97 bound DLG3 via the same domain (Fig.2 B). Bacterially expressed GST-SAP97 (1–78) or GST alone were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads and incubated with lysates from MDCK cells expressing Myc-DLG3 or Myc-mLIN-2. Both Myc-DLG3 and Myc-mLIN-2 bound SAP97 via this MRE domain. We next wanted to determine whether SAP97, Myc-DLG3, and mLIN-7 exist in a complex in MDCK cells. Antibodies against Myc, SAP97, or pre-immune serum were incubated with lysates from MDCK cells expressing Myc-DLG3. Resolved immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blotting with anti-mLIN-7, anti-Myc, and anti-SAP97 antibodies (Fig.2 C). Both Myc and SAP97 immunocomplexes contained all three proteins, which strongly suggested that they form a complex in MDCK cells. To show that this interaction may have some physiological relevance we repeated the rat brain immunoprecipitation experiment. However, instead of a Far Western blot, we immunoblotted with both anti-SAP97 and an affinity-purified DLG3 antibody raised against GST-DLG3 (289–365). This epitope was chosen because it was the region of DLG3 that shared the least homology with the other mLIN-7 binding MAGUKs. Both DLG3 and SAP97 can be detected when anti-DLG3 or anti-SAP97 antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate proteins from brain lysates (Fig. 2 D). These data indicated that endogenous DLG3 and SAP97 interact in rat brain. In Fig. 2 A we demonstrated that SAP97 and DLG3 (1–222) directly interact. In other reports, the L27C domain of mLIN-7 binding proteins bound mLIN-7 whereas the L27N domain bound the MRE domain of another partner (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). DLG3 constructs lacking the L27N, L27C, or PDZ domain were made to further investigate the exact region of DLG3 necessary for the interaction with SAP97. Lysates from MDCK cells overexpressing Myc-tagged full-length DLG3, DLG3 deletion constructs, or Myc-mLIN-2 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. SAP97 was visualized by a previously reported Far Western assay utilizing [32P]GST-mLIN-2(L27N) (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SAP97 coprecipitated with Myc-mLIN-2, Myc-DLG3, and Myc-DLG3(ΔPDZ) (Fig. 3 B) The L27N deletion still bound mLIN-7, suggesting that the L27C domain was intact. As expected, deleting the L27C domain of DLG3 resulted in the inability of mLIN-7 to interact with this protein. Surprisingly, deleting either the L27N or L27C of DLG3 resulted in the failure of SAP97 to coprecipitate. This result was unexpected, because the L27N domain of mLIN-2 was solely responsible for SAP97 binding (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Point mutations were made in DLG3 to further investigate the possibility that both L27 domains of DLG3 are necessary for SAP97 binding. Point mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues, either singly in the L27C domain or in tandem in the L27N domain, have been shown to negate binding of the domains to target proteins (11Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For example, mLIN-2(L422G), a mutation in the L27C domain, does not bind mLIN-7, 2D. Karnak, unpublished observation. and a double point mutation in the L27N domain of PALS1(L150G→V154G) does not bind the Pals1-associated tight junction protein (15Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Hence, analogous mutations were created in the L27C and L27N domains of DLG3, Myc-DLG3(L91G), and Myc-DLG3(L34G:F38G), respectively. The experiment shown in Fig. 3 B was repeated using these constructs and omitting the Myc-mLIN-2 control. As expected, Myc-DLG3(L91G) did not bind mLIN-7, but neither did it bind SAP97 (Fig. 3 C). SAP97 only coprecipitated with wild-type Myc-DLG3. Taken together with the deletion analysis, these data strongly suggested that both L27 domains of DLG3 were required for SAP97 binding. Previous work showed that SAP97 and mLIN-2/CASK colocalized to the basolateral surface in MDCK cells and this localization was dependent on the L27N domain of mLIN-2/CASK (13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine where Myc-DLG3 would localize. To this end, we seeded MDCK cells overexpressing Myc-DLG3 or Myc-mLIN-2/CASK, as a control, on polycarbonate filters and processed them for immunostaining (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, Myc-mLIN-2 and mLIN-7 colocalized at the basolateral surface (22Straight S.W. Karnak D. Borg J.P. Kamberov E. Dare H. Margolis B. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F464-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Myc-DLG3 displayed a diffuse localization and appeared to mislocalize a portion of endogenous mLIN-7. This effect was most evident when comparing a cell expressing Myc-DLG3 to an adjacent cell that was not. One possible explanation for this diffuse localization of Myc-DLG3 is that DLG3 lacks a hook domain. Hook domains are believed to bind members of the protein 4.1/ezrin/radixin/moeisin superfamily, which can provide a link between MAGUK proteins and the actin cytoskeleton (16Marfatia S.M. Leu R.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All studied mLIN-7 associated MAGUKs except DLG3 contain a hook domain and localize to a lateral surface in MDCK cells. In accordance with this hypothesis, a chimeric Myc-DLG3 protein with the hook domain of mLIN-2/CASK inserted in-frame (Myc-DLG3:hook) localized predominantly to the basolateral surface (data not shown). In Fig. 4 B, we show that a portion of endogenous mLIN-7 was mislocalized in cells expressing Myc-DLG3. To confirm that this effect was attributable to DLG3, we compared mLIN-7 localization in cells expressing Myc-DLG3 versus Myc-DLG3(ΔL27C), which lacks the ability to bind mLIN-7 (Fig. 4 C). Endogenous mLIN-7 was partially mislocalized only if DLG3 had an intact L27C domain. This result strongly suggested that mLIN-7 interacts with Myc-DLG3 and the two exist in a complex in the cytosol. Deleting the L27C domain of Myc-DLG3 ablates binding and hence mLIN-7 remains at the basolateral surface, wheras Myc-DLG3(ΔL27C) localizes diffusely throughout the cell. DLG3 and mLIN-2/CASK have been established as two of the three mLIN-7-associated partners for SAP97. We sought to identify the third partner. Although the third partner migrated close to PALS2 (Fig.1 B), DLG2 was also a possibility. Because we had an antibody to PALS2 but not DLG2, we overexpressed Myc-DLG2 in MDCK cells. Immunoprecipitations with anti-SAP97, anti-PALS2, anti-Myc, or pre-immune serum were performed on lysates containing exogenously expressed Myc-DLG2. Control immunoprecipitations were performed on mock-transfected cells or cells expressing Myc-DLG3 or Myc-mLIN-2. SAP97 was efficiently coprecipitated with exogenously expressed Myc-DLG2, Myc-DLG3, and Myc-mLIN-2 (Fig.5 A). No SAP97 could be detected in complex with endogenous PALS2 in either Myc-DLG2-expressing cells or mock-transfected cells. Admittedly, the amount of immunoprecipitated PALS2 was less than Myc-DLG2, Myc-DLG3, or Myc-mLIN-2. Because DLG2 and PALS2 migrate at approximately the same molecular weight, we wanted to confirm that PALS2 did not associate with SAP97 in brain. Previous experiments in rat brain indicated that PALS2 was a very abundant protein and could be efficiently precipitated with anti-PALS2 antibody (Fig. 1 B). Hence, we repeated the rat brain immunoprecipitation experiment of Fig. 1 B but instead of a Far Western blot, we immunoblotted for SAP97 and PALS2 (Fig. 5 B). PALS2 and SAP97 did not coprecipitate in this experiment. Additionally, GST-MRE of SAP97 can precipitate exogenously expressed Myc-DLG2 from MDCK cell lysates (data not shown). We concluded that DLG2, and not PALS2, was a third mLIN-7 associated binding partner for SAP97. Multiprotein complexes of PDZ domain-containing proteins are important mediators of polarity in epithelial cells and neurons. Several reported protein scaffolds include SAP97 as an integral player (23Nix S.L. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. Walther Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41192-41200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Wu H. Reuver S.M. Kuhlendahl S. Chung W.J. Garner C.C. J.

Here we provide data that a total of three mLIN-7 binding proteins interact with SAP97: mLIN-2/CASK (which was previously described in Refs. 13Lee S. Fan S. Makarova O. Straight S. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41192-41200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), DLG2, and DLG3. Promiscuous binding of MAGUKs to other family members as well as themselves has also been widely reported. Discovering why SAP97 binds DLG2, DLG3, and mLIN-2/CASK but not PALS2 and PALS1 will be an important next step in understanding the molecular mechanisms of L27 domain interactions. In particular, PALS2 is 66% identical and 84% similar to DLG2 yet does not bind SAP97. It is possible that other binding partners play some role in determining specificity. One clue as to why SAP97 binds multiple mLIN-7 binding MAGUKs may come from the report that KIF1Bα binds SAP97 (25Mok H. Shin H. Kim S. Lee J.R. Yoon J. Kim E. J.Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5253-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This report suggests a role for a SAP97 complex in vesicle targeting. It is possible that SAP97 binds different scaffolds to mediate the targeting of subsets of vesicles or receptors to specific membrane locations or organelles along microtubules. An unpredicted finding of this study is that DLG3 binding to SAP97 requires both the L27N and L27C domains of DLG3. One possibility is that mLIN-7 somehow assists DLG3 binding to SAP97. This seems unlikely, because a direct interaction between GST-DLG3 (1–222) and SAP97 can be observed in the Far Western overlay assay. Secondary structure algorithms predict that L27 domains are made up of two α-helices (12Doerks T. Bork P. Kamberov E. Makarova O. Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In theory, two α-helices from one L27 domain may fold onto the adjacent L27 domain to form a four-helix bundle. It is possible that in most mLIN-7-binding MAGUKs, the two helices from the L27C domain interact with mLIN-7 while both of the L27N helices interact with another partner. The DLG3:SAP97 interaction may be different in that it requires one helix from each L27 domain of DLG3 to form a stable complex with SAP97. However, in circular dichroism studies of the L27 domains of mLIN-7, mLIN-2, and orthologues, Harris et al.found that L27 domains seem to be largely unfolded until binding to another L27 domain (26Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, more structural studies of L27 domains will be required before any definitive conclusions can be reached. Our group previously reported a possible role for mLIN-7 in endosomal trafficking of proteins (27Straight S.W. Chen L. Karnak D. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to visualize mLIN-7 in an endosomal compartment. Here we show that endogenous mLIN-7 localization is altered in MDCK cells expressing Myc-DLG3. This staining appears to be diffusely cytosolic, but could also represent an association with intracellular membranes including endosomes. Further staining with markers of different intracellular membranes will be necessary to address this prospect. Due to problems with antibodies, we have been unable to determine whether SAP97 is mislocalized in cells expressing Myc-DLG3. Further experimentation is necessary to determine whether Myc-DLG3 and SAP97 colocalize in the cytosol. Most mLIN-7 is associated with mLIN-2 in MDCK cells and is thus tethered to the actin cytoskeleton via the protein 4.1 binding domain of mLIN-2/CASK (11Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Because DLG3 lacks a protein 4.1 binding domain, it may play a role at a non-plasma-membrane site, such as an endosome. Previous data indicate that basolateral localization of mLIN-2 requires an intact hook domain. Additionally, we found that a DLG3:hook chimera localizes to the basolateral surface, which suggests that this domain has the power to redirect a cytosolic MAGUK to the basolateral surface. It would be interesting to test whether this domain alone could direct any cytosolic protein to the plasma membrane. In summary, we have demonstrated that the MRE domain of SAP97 has multiple binding partners including DLG3, DLG2, and mLIN-2/CASK. These multiple interactions allow SAP97 to be present in different protein complexes within cells. These differential interactions could control the targeting and localization of different SAP97 complexes. Additionally, signaling complexes containing SAP97 (29Colledge M. Dean R.A. Scott G.K.

Because NF-κB activation contributes to cancer therapy resistance, this study was undertaken to test whether GD3 modulates the response of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to radio- and chemotherapy. NF-κB was activated in HepG2 cells shortly after therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation or daunorubicin treatment that translated into up-regulation of κB-dependent genes. These effects were accompanied by minimal killing of HepG2 cells by either ionizing radiation or daunorubicin. However, GD3 pretreatment blocked the nuclear translocation of active κB members, without effect on Akt phosphorylation, induced by either treatment. The suppression of κB-dependent gene induction by GD3 was accompanied by enhanced apoptotic cell death caused by these therapies. Furthermore, the combination of GD3 plus ionizing radiation stimulated the formation of reactive species followed by the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo and caspase 3 activation. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A before radiotherapy protected HepG2 cells from the therapeutic combination of GD3 plus ionizing radiation. These findings underscore a key role of mitochondria in the response of tumor cells to cancer therapy and highlight the potential relevance of GD3 to overcome resistance to cancer therapy by combining its dual action as a mitochondria-interacting and NF-κB-inactivating agent.

Among the different molecular strategies that contribute to the resistance of tumor cells to radio- and chemotherapy, the role played by transcription factor NF-κB 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; Ac-DEVD-AMC, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin; CsA, cyclosporin A; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; GSL, glycosphingolipid; GD3, ganglioside GD3; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; ROS/RNS, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species; PDMP, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-propanol has been well defined.

Although ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents activate apoptosis pathways, the impact of these is often antagonized by the early activation of NF-κB-dependent survival pathways induced by these treatments (8Brach M.A. Hass R.

NF-κB is usually kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with an endogenous inhibitor protein of the IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) family. The most common pathway leading to NF-κB activation by a wide variety of stimuli, including cancer therapy involves the phosphorylation of IκB at specific serine residues that targets its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (3Baldwin A.S.

The released subunits of NF-κB then translocate to the nuclei where they bind to specific sites in the promoter/enhancer region of target genes. NF-κB is known to induce the expression of many different genes involved in the regulation of immune or stress response and apoptosis (3Baldwin A.S. J. Clin.

Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), increasing evidence has further documented the anti-apoptotic activity of NF-κB against a variety of stimuli (11Van Antwerp D.J.

The central role of NF-κB in the prevention of apoptosis is mediated through the induction of antiapoptotic genes, including Bcl-XL, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, A1/Bfl1, or antioxidant enzymes such as Mn-SOD (14Wang C.Y.

Glycosphingolipids (GSLs), carbohydrate-bearing lipid components of biological membranes, participate in the regulation of various cellular functions, including cell adhesion and signal transduction (18Hakomori S.

In addition to the direct apoptosis-promoting activity of GD3 through mitochondrial interaction, this GSL species counteracts survival signals by suppressing the NF-κB activation and subsequent κB-dependent gene induction (27Colell A.

This dual function of GD3 has been shown to render rat hepatocytes susceptible to tumor necrosis factor-mediated cell death through the inactivation of NF-κB (27Colell A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Roman J. Ballesta A. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1068-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, despite the available evidence supporting the pro-apoptotic function of GD3, the role of glycolipids in apoptosis is controversial. The inhibition of glycolipid synthesis has been shown to enhance apoptosis, reversing multidrug resistance in certain tumor cells (29Lavie Y. Cao H. Bursten S.L. Giuliano A.E. Cabot M.C. J. Biol.

Hence, in light of these findings and due to the pivotal role of NF-κB in mediating the resistance of tumor cells to cancer therapy, the purpose of the present work was to test the hypothesis that GD3 pretreatment sensitizes human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to ionizing radiation and chemotherapy by its combined function as a mitochondria-recruiting and NF-κB-disabling agent. Daunorubicin and CsA were purchased from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). Hoescht 33258 was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GD3, 99% purity by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), was from Matreya, Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Caspase 3 substrate, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) and anti-Smac/Diablo were from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salisbury, Wilts, UK) and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose levels. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Subconfluent HepG2 cells were irradiated in a linear accelerator (KDS Siemens) at room temperature using an electron beam of 18 MeV as described previously (31Morales A. Miranda M. Sánchez-Reyes A. Biete A. Fernández-Checa J.C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Phys. 1998; 42: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Doses between 2 and 20 Gy were applied at a rate of 3 Gy/min. Estimate errors on dose have been calculated to be below 1%. Alternatively, cells were treated with daunorubicin (1–10 μm) for 2–72 h. In some cases, cells were preincubated with GD3 (5 μm in ethanol) 4 h before radiation or daunorubicin treatment and examined for cell survival (2–72 h). The final concentration of the carrier solvent did not exceed 0.1% nor affected any of the parameters determined. NF-κB DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts was assessed by EMSA using NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) as described previously (32Roman J. Gimenez A. Lluis J.M. Gasso M. Rubio M. Caballeria J. Pares A. Rodes J. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14684-14690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After radiation or daunorubicin treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected with a rubber policemen, and lysed with Nonidet P-40 (10%). The nuclear pellet was recovered by spinning (13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s), resuspended in ice-cold 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and stored at −80 °C. Binding reaction contained 7 μg of nuclear extracts, 5 μl of incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 4% glycerol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 15 min on ice, the labeled oligonucleotide (30,000 cpm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel for 90 min at 150 V. HepG2 cells were transfected with the plasmid pNF-κB-Luc containing four tandem copies of the κB enhancer upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase fused to the luciferase reporter using LipofectAMINE reagent as described previously (32Roman J. Gimenez A. Lluis J.M. Gasso M. Rubio M. Caballeria J. Pares A. Rodes J. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14684-14690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In each experiment, six 35-mm wells containing 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 5 μg of a DNA and 5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase vector as control to monitor transfection efficiency. After 24–48 h, transfection cells were irradiated (4 Gy) or treated with daunorubicin (1–10 μm), and 6 h later, they were harvested in a reporter lysis buffer and supernatants were used to determine luciferase activity. Results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration. To determine the distribution of NF-κB p65 subunit, HepG2 cells were fixed with formalin 10% and incubated with anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 300 ng/ml in antibody diluent (Dako, Carpenteria, CA) for 1 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Santa Cruz, CA) and analyzed by a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope. Total cell proteins were resolved in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated Akt was detected using an anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Membranes were then stripped and incubated with anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) to estimate the levels of Akt. Cells were permeabilized with digitonin (40 μg/ml) in 0.5 ml of intracellular medium composed of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mmHepes-Tris, pH 7.2, supplemented with 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin for 15 min. Upon centrifugation at 14,000 × g the supernatant and the mitochondria-containing pellet were resolved by SDS-PAGE (15% gels). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were incubated with anti-cytochromec antibody (Pharmingen) and anti-Smac/Diablo antibody (Calbiochem) followed by ECL-based detection. To monitor the specificity of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo release, parallel aliquots were immunoblotted with human monoclonal antibody anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Molecular Probes). Cytosolic extracts were used to measure caspase 3 activity from the release of 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin from Ac-DEVD-AMC, and fluorescence was continuously recorded with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm as described previously (23Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Parı́s R. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Reactive species formation were determined using chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which becomes highly fluorescent upon oxidation by peroxides (17Tanaka H.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). DCF formation was continuously recorded in a fluorometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Relative fluorescence units were normalized per milligram of cellular protein. Cell death was determined by the measurement of the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium and in the remaining cell monolayer after lysis with 5% Triton X-100, which expresses the percentage of LDH release in the medium as the fraction of LDH (medium plus cells). Results were confirmed by the MTT assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, cells were stained with Hoescht 33258, and morphologic features of apoptosis were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. More than 200 cells per condition were examined for apoptotic features, including the presence of chromatin condensation or fragmentation. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and averages of three to five experiments. Statistical analysis of mean values for multiple comparisons were may by one-way analysis of variance. NF-κB activation has been reported in different tumor cell lines after chemotherapeutic treatments and ionizing radiation and thought to function as a defense mechanism to counteract the cell death cascades generated by these cancer therapies (3Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 4Wang C.Y. Cusack J.C. Liu R. Baldwin A.S. Nat.

To study the effect of ionizing radiation or chemotherapy on the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in human hepatoblastoma cells, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts obtained from HepG2 cells after exposure to ionizing radiation (2–20 Gy). As shown (Fig.1 A), ionizing radiation enhanced in a dose-dependent fashion the DNA binding activity of several complexes of NF-κB. Although these complexes were displaced by molar excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotide (not shown), indicating their specificity for κB binding sites, only the two upper bands were identified as RelA·p52 and p52·p50 dimers by supershifts assays using antibodies against individual NF-κB components (RelA, p52, and p50). The activation of these dimers by ionizing radiation occurred within 30 min post-treatment and lasted for 6–8 h (not shown). Treatment of HepG2 cells with daunorubicin (1 μm) resulted in a similar pattern of NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 B). The level of activation of both RelA·p52 and p52·p50 dimers ranged from 3- to 4-fold with respect to untreated control cells (Fig. 1 B). Because previous findings in cultured rat hepatocytes revealed that GD3 suppressed the activation of NF-κB induced by tumor necrosis factor (27Colell A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Roman J. Ballesta A. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1068-1070PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined whether GD3 pretreatment abolished the activation of NF-κB by ionizing radiation and daunorubicin treatments. As observed (Fig. 1 B), GD3 preincubation prevented the activation of NF-κB induced by ionizing radiation (4 Gy) or daunorubicin (1 μm), decreasing the intensity of RelA·p50 and p50·p52 complexes to control levels. Thus, these findings confirm the activation of NF-κB upon cancer therapy treatment of HepG2 cells, which is blocked by pretreatment of cells with GD3. To confirm if NF-κB-active complexes from GD3-pretreated cells remained in the cytosol after exposure to radiotherapy, we determined the cellular localization of NF-κB p65 subunit. As seen (Fig.2), compared with control HepG2 cells, which display a diffuse fluorescence pattern, ionizing radiation induced the localization of p65 into the nuclei. This shift in the cellular distribution of p65 induced by ionizing radiation was blunted by GD3 pretreatment (Fig. 2). Moreover, EMSA assays confirmed the presence of DNA binding activity of NF-κB in cytosolic extracts (not shown). Similar findings were observed when HepG2 cells were exposed to daunorubicin with or without GD3 pretreatment (not shown). Because the blocking effect of GD3 on the nuclear translocation of competent DNA-binding NF-κB members may be translated at the gene level, we next examined the transactivation of NF-κB using a luciferase reporter gene construct controlled by four κB-binding sites. Ionizing radiation and daunorubicin treatment enhanced the κB-dependent luciferase expression by 8- to 10-fold (Fig.2). However, the preincubation of HepG2 cells with GD3 abolished the inducible expression of luciferase by ionizing radiation or daunorubicin. Thus, taken collectively, these findings underscore the impact of GD3 pretreatment in suppressing the inducible expression of κB-regulated genes. Because NF-κB is known to induce the expression of antiapoptotic genes that counteract apoptosis pathways, we next assessed the consequences of the inactivation of NF-κB by GD3 on the survival of HepG2 cells following cancer therapy. As shown (Fig.3 A), HepG2 cells were relatively resistant to a therapeutic dose of ionizing radiation or daunorubicin treatment displaying slight signs of cell injury after 3 days post-treatment (17 ± 7% and 22 ± 6%, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). Of note, when HepG2 cells were pretreated with GD3 at a sublethal dose, it rendered HepG2 cells vulnerable to both ionizing radiation and daunorubicin treatment (Fig. 3). This sensitization was observed as early as 24 h after GD3 pretreatment (17 ± 4% and 19 ± 6% cell death after ionizing radiation or daunorubicin treatment, compared with 5 ± 3% and 7 ± 4%, without GD3, respectively). Similar findings were observed when cell survival was quantitated by the MTT assays (not shown). To investigate if the cell death caused by these treatments after GD3 preincubation was accompanied by apoptotic features, HepG2 cells were exposed to the DNA-binding fluorochrome H-33258, and chromatin morphology was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As shown (Fig.4) the combination of GD3 plus ionizing radiation or daunorubicin resulted in increased presence of cells displaying chromatin disruption, indicative of apoptosis. Indeed, the estimation of apoptotic cell death indicated a significant sensitization 24 h after the combination of ionizing radiation or daunorubicin after GD3 compared with either therapy alone (Fig.4 B). Clearly, these findings indicate that the pretreatment of HepG2 cells with GD3 increases the efficiency of therapies intended to kill human tumor cells. Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase, has been shown to regulate cell survival signals by rendering key components of the apoptotic cascade inactive (34Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R.

Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Therefore, in view of the preceding findings, we next assessed whether GD3 disabled the Akt signaling pathway thus contributing to the susceptibility of HepG2 cells toward cancer therapy. To study the contribution of this pathway, we determined the level of Akt and its phosphorylated form (at serine 473) using cell extracts from ionizing radiation-exposed cells with or without GD3 preincubation. As seen, compared with the phosphorylation induced by insulin, ionizing radiation did not induce the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 5). The phosphorylated form of Akt was determined at different times (from 15 min to 6 h) after ionizing radiation without observing a significant increase in the active form induced by ionizing radiation (4 Gy) with or without the presence of GD3. Similar results were obtained with daunorubicin (not shown). Thus, these findings indicate that Akt-dependent survival signals do not play a role either in the resistance of HepG2 cells to cancer therapy or in the sensitization by GD3. Mitochondria function as a strategic cell death control center (37Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this role the commitment to cell death is mediated by a regulated release of specific proteins from the intermembrane space that assist in the assembly of the apoptosome. Because reactive species have been implicated as early mediators of cancer therapy-induced cell death (31Morales A. Miranda M. Sánchez-Reyes A. Biete A. Fernández-Checa J.C. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Phys. 1998; 42: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,39Leach J.K. Van Tuyle G. Lin P. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Mikkelsen R.B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3894-3901PubMed Google Scholar), we next assessed the regulation of ROS generation by cancer therapy with or without GD3 pretreatment. A significant increase in DCF fluorescence was observed in HepG2 cells within 30 min after exposure to ionizing radiation that declined gradually over time (Fig.6). Because this fluorescent probe is sensitive to both peroxides and peroxynitrite (33Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), these findings indicate that ionizing radiation generates a modest burst of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species insufficient to cause cell death. Treatment of HepG2 cells with GD3 increased the DCF fluorescence to a level similar to that caused by ionizing radiation that did not decline as long as GD3 was present. This outcome reflects the ability of GD3 to stimulate mitochondrial ROS generation (23Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Colell A. Parı́s R. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 27Colell A. Garcı́a-Ruiz C. Roman J. Ballesta A. Fernández-Checa J.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1068-1070PubMed Google Scholar). However, when HepG2 cells were pretreated with GD3 and then irradiated there was an overgeneration of ROS/RNS compared with either of the treatments alone (Fig. 6). To examine whether the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) modulates the generation of reactive species induced by GD3 and ionizing radiation, we investigated the effect of CsA, an inhibitor of MPT. Although CsA by itself did not affect the DCF fluorescence, preincubation of cells with CsA before exposure to ionizing radiation abolished the ROS/RNS formation (Fig. 6). Because MPT allows the release of apoptosis-promoting proteins from mitochondria, we examined the mitochondrial release of cytochromec and Smac/Diablo in HepG2 cells. Consistent with the findings on ROS/RNS generation, the combination of GD3 plus ionizing radiation resulted in enhanced release of both cytochrome cand Smac/Diablo compared with either stimuli alone (Fig.7 A). Furthermore, CsA pretreatm"
https://openalex.org/W2127462625,"We have used synthetic oligomers of DNA and RNA to assemble nucleic acid scaffolds that, when mixed with T7 RNA polymerase, allow the formation of functional transcription complexes. Manipulation of the scaffold structure allows the contribution of each element in the scaffold to transcription activity to be independently determined. The minimal scaffold that allows efficient extension after challenge with 200 mm NaCl consists of an 8-nt RNA primer hybridized to a DNA template (T strand) that extends 5-10 nt downstream. Constructs in which the RNA-DNA hybrid is less than or greater than 8 bp are less salt-resistant, and the hybrid cannot be extended beyond 12-13 bp. Although the presence of a complementary nontemplate strand downstream of the primer does not affect salt resistance, the presence of DNA upstream decreases resistance. The addition of a 4-nt unpaired tail to the 5' end of the primer increases salt resistance, as does the presence of an unpaired nontemplate strand in the region that contains the 8-bp hybrid (thereby generating an artificial transcription bubble). Scaffold complexes having these features remain active for over 1 week in the absence of salt and exhibit many of the properties of halted elongation complexes, including resistance to salt challenge, a similar trypsin cleavage pattern, and a similar pattern of RNA-RNA polymerase cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1998413062,"The enzyme phosphoglucomutase plays a key role in cellular metabolism by virtue of its ability to interconvert Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P. It was recently shown that a yeast strain lacking the major isoform of phosphoglucomutase (pgm2Δ) accumulates a high level of Glc-1-P and exhibits several phenotypes related to altered Ca2+ homeostasis when d-galactose is utilized as the carbon source (Fu, L., Miseta, A., Hunton, D., Marchase, R. B., and Bedwell, D. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5431–5440). These phenotypes include increased Ca2+ uptake and accumulation and sensitivity to high environmental Ca2+ levels. In the present study, we overproduced the enzyme UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase to test whether the overproduction of a downstream metabolite produced from Glc-1-P can also mediate changes in Ca2+ homeostasis. We found that overproduction of UDP-Glc did not cause any alterations in Ca2+ uptake or accumulation. We also examined whether Glc-6-P can influence cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. A yeast strain lacking the β-subunit of phosphofructokinase (pfk2Δ) accumulates a high level of Glc-6-P (Huang, D., Wilson, W. A., and Roach, P. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22495–22501). We found that this increase in Glc-6-P led to a 1.5–2-fold increase in total cellular Ca2+. We also found that the pgm2Δ/pfk2Δ strain, which accumulated high levels of both Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P, no longer exhibited the Ca2+-related phenotypes associated with high Glc-1-P levels in the pgm2Δ mutant. These results provide strong evidence that cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is coupled to the relative levels of Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P in yeast.

Ca2+ homeostasis in eukaryotic cells is a complex process involving the regulated internalization and sequestration of Ca2+ ions into a variety of intracellular compartments. The basic mechanisms that mammalian and yeast cells employ to carry out this process are similar, such that the cytosolic Ca2+concentration in both cell types is normally maintained in the range of 50–200 nm (1Iida H.

In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used for: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CCE, capacitative Ca2+ entry; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. serves as a storage compartment that provides a readily mobilizable source of Ca2+ for use in Ca2+ signaling. Upon receiving an appropriate stimulus, ER Ca2+ stores can be released to generate a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration. This elevated Ca2+ level can then activate various signaling pathways in a tightly regulated manner (5Putney Jr., J.W. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 143-160PubMed Google Scholar). In a variety of non-excitable cell types, the release of ER Ca2+can lead to the generation of a store depletion signal that results in an influx of Ca2+ ions across the plasma membrane in a process termed capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). CCE amplifies the transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ initiated by the release of ER Ca2+ and ultimately serves as a source of cytosolic Ca2+ for refilling the depleted ER Ca2+ store (6Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Mammalian ER Ca2+ stores are maintained by the activity of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pumps (7Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 8MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

In addition, past work suggests that glucose metabolites also play a role in sequestering mammalian ER Ca2+ stores. Several studies have shown that both the rate and yield of ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport in microsomes isolated from a variety of tissues are stimulated by Glc-6-P (9Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Comporti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 816: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Benedetti A. Fulceri R. Romani A. Comporti M. J. Biol.

This effect appears to be mediated by a dedicated Glc-6-P transporter located in the ER membrane. The ER-localized Glc-6-P transporter has been cloned and is expressed as two distinct mRNA species (14Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Van Schaftingen E.

The longer isoform is highly enriched in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, whereas the shorter isoform shows a more ubiquitous tissue distribution. The vacuole, which is the major Ca2+ storage compartment in yeast cells, contains >95% of the total cellular Ca2+(17Dunn T. Gable K. Beeler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7273-7278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, this large store of vacuolar Ca2+ was thought to be relatively inert due to its association with polyphosphate. However, a recent study found that vacuolar Ca2+ can be released in a regulated manner through the action of Yvc1p, a TRP channel homolog (18Palmer C.P. Zhou X.L. Lin J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Ca2+release through this channel was shown to be induced by hypotonic shock and may be responsive to the HOG/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade (19Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The Golgi apparatus has also been shown to play an important role in cellular Ca2+ storage in yeast through the action of the Golgi-localized Ca2+-ATPase Pmr1p (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been shown that pmr1Δ mutants display a constitutively elevated cellular Ca2+ uptake phenotype that may be related to the CCE response of mammalian cells (25Csutora P. Su Z. Kim H.Y. Bugrim A. Cunningham K.W. Nuccitelli R. Keizer J.E. Hanley M.R. Blalock J.E. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This yeast version of the CCE response is mediated through the action of a high affinity Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane containing at least theMID1 and CCH1 gene products as subunits (26Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The increased Ca2+ accumulation that occurs in thepmr1Δ strain can stimulate the expression of a large number of genes by the transcription factor Tcn1p/Crz1p following its activation by the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling pathway (27Cunningham K.W.

These results suggest that the yeast Golgi apparatus may normally play a role that is functionally similar to the that of mammalian ER because it has the potential to mediate a transient rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that can subsequently be amplified by a CCE-like mechanism. The yeast ER appears to play a lesser role in cellular Ca2+storage because the free Ca2+ concentration of this compartment has been reported to be only ∼10 μm (31Strayle J. Pozzan T. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4733-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that the COD1/SPF1 gene product is an ER-localized P-type Ca2+-ATPase that sequesters cytosolic Ca2+ into the ER (32Suzuki C. Shimma Y.I. Mol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) also play a role in maintaining ER Ca2+ stores under certain conditions. In contrast to mammalian cells, a Glc-6-P transporter capable of stimulating Ca2+ sequestration into the ER (or possibly the Golgi apparatus) has not been identified in yeast cells. However, it has been shown that Glc-1-P appears to play a role in yeast Ca2+homeostasis (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two genes that encode phosphoglucomutase (PGM), a key metabolic enzyme that interconverts Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P (see Fig. 1). The PGM2 gene encodes the major isoform that accounts for ∼90% of the total PGM activity in galactose-grown cells, whereas the PGM1 gene product accounts for the remaining 10% (36Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When glucose is utilized as the carbon source, a low level of PGM activity is required to maintain enough Glc-1-P for use as substrate in the synthesis of sugar nucleotides such as UDP-Glc. UDP-Glc is needed for anabolic reactions such as glycogen synthesis and cell wall biosynthesis. However, a much higher level of PGM activity is required during growth in medium containing galactose as the carbon source to provide the Glc-6-P used in both the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. Consistent with this need for a greater metabolic flux from Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P, apgm2Δ mutant accumulates a high level of intracellular Glc-1-P when grown in medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that this high level of Glc-1-P is accompanied by a high rate of Ca2+ uptake and accumulation, suggesting a possible link between glucose metabolites and Ca2+ homeostasis in yeast. The goal of this study was to further examine the hypothesis that the glucose metabolites Glc-1-P and/or Glc-6-P play a role in Ca2+ homeostasis in yeast. We show that Ca2+homeostasis defects in the pgm2Δ mutant are specific to accumulated Glc-1-P using three strategies. First, we show thatEscherichia coli PGM expression can rescue galactose-specific growth defects in pgm2Δ yeast strains. These data support the hypothesis that the loss of Pgm2p enzymatic activity is directly responsible for the observed alterations in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Second, we show that increased synthesis of UDP-Glc, a metabolite synthesized directly from Glc-1-P and UTP by the enzyme UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, has no effect on Ca2+ homeostasis. This result demonstrates that the increased synthesis of Glc-1-P, rather than sugar nucleotides derived from Glc-1-P, influences cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Third, we show that the accumulation of Glc-6-P also has an effect on Ca2+ homeostasis that is distinct from Glc-1-P accumulation. The strains used in this study include Sc252 (SJ21R) (MAT a ade1 leu2,3-112 ura3-52 MEL) (36Oh D. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), YDB0171 (MAT a ade1 leu2,3-112 ura3-52 MEL pgm2Δ::LEU2) (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol.

Strain Sc252 was kindly provided by J. E. Hopper. The pfk2Δ strain YDB0397 was generated by disruption of the PFK2 gene in YDB0355 (MAT a ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2,3-112 lys2-Δ201 ura3-52) by insertion ofHIS3. To do this, a 2.9-kb fragment containing thePFK2 gene was amplified by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as template. The forward primer was DB732 (5′-ACG CGTCGACCA TAC GCA ATG ACT GTT AC), which contains a SalI restriction endonuclease site (underlined). The reverse primer was DB733 (5′-GC TCTAGAC CAA ATG GTC AGC AAT GAG), which contains anXbaI site (underlined). The PCR product was digested withSalI and XbaI and subcloned into the same sites within plasmid pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) to generate pDB0657. The 1.3-kb BglII/EcoRI fragment inPFK2 was removed from pDB0657 and replaced with anEcoRI/XhoI fragment from pJJ215 (37Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) to generate pDB0658. The SalI/XbaI fragment containing the disrupted PFK2 gene was then used to transform strain YDB0355 by standard methods (38Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 99-102Google Scholar). Thepgm2Δ/pfk2Δ strain YDB0395 was constructed by transforming the same SalI/XbaI fragment from pDB0658 into YDB0313 (MAT a ade2-101 his3-Δ200 leu2,3-112 ura3-52 pgm2Δ::URA3). In each strain constructed above, gene knockouts were confirmed by Southern blotting and enzyme assay for either PGM (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or phosphofructokinase (39Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activity. Bacterial strains used for cloning and plasmid maintenance were grown in standard medium as described (40Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Similarly, yeast media were prepared as described (38Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 99-102Google Scholar). Yeast extract/peptone (YP) medium and synthetic medium were supplemented with 2% glucose (dextrose) (YPD or SMD) or 2% galactose (YPGal). YPD and YPGal media were routinely buffered to pH 5.5 with 40 mm MES/Tris. Liquid cultures were grown for a minimum of six to seven generations to ≤0.8A 600 units/ml prior to harvesting unless otherwise indicated. The centromeric plasmid pDB0608 was used to express E. coli PGM from the PGM2 promoter in yeast strains SJ21R and YDB0171. Plasmid pDB0608 was constructed as follows. pDB0197, which contains a 3.3-kbBamHI/XhoI fragment with the yeastPGM2 locus in pBluescript II KS(+), was digested withHpaI/EcoRI to remove the entire PGM2coding sequence. This sequence was replaced with anHpaI/EcoRI fragment from pNK3476 containing the 3′-coding sequence of E. coli PGM (41Lu M. Kleckner N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5847-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The 5′-coding sequence was amplified by PCR using DB431 (5′-AAA GTTAAC ATA ACA TGG CAA TCC ACA ATC G) and DB432 (5′-CTG ATCGTTAAC GAT AGT CAG G), both of which contain an HpaI cut site (underlined). The resultant PCR product was cut and ligated into the HpaI site in the plasmid described above to yield full-length E. coli PGM under the control of the yeast PGM2 promoter in pDB0540. A 3.6-kbEcoRI/BamHI fragment containing the entireE. coli PGM gene under the control of the yeastPGM2 promoter was removed from pDB0540 and ligated into the same sites of pSEYC58 (42Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to give pDB0608. Finally, the multicopy plasmid pYJM1 (a kind gift from Jean François) was used to overexpress the UGP1 gene. This plasmid contains theUGP1 gene on a 4.7-kb SphI/BamHI fragment inserted into the same site of plasmid YEp351 (43Daran J.M. Dallies N. Thines-Sempoux D. Paquet V. François J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P levels were measured as described previously (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Glc-6-P was measured in acid-soluble cell extracts using a coupled enzyme assay with Glc-6-P dehydrogenase (Sigma) (44$$Google Scholar). Glc-1-P was measured similarly with the addition of PGM (Sigma). UDP-Glc was measured in acid-soluble extracts of mid-log phase cells grown in YPD medium using a coupled enzyme assay with UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (45$$Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake measurements were carried out as described previously (22Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at a cell density of <0.8 A 600 units/ml, washed, and resuspended at a cell density of 1 A 600 unit/ml in uptake buffer (40 mm MES/Tris (pH 5.5) and 20 mmd-glucose). Cells were incubated in uptake buffer for 10 min at 30 °C, and 45Ca2+uptake was initiated by the addition of 45Ca2+to a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. At the indicated times, 1-ml aliquots of cells were filtered through a 0.45-μm Gelman GN-6 Metricel filter prewashed with buffer containing 20 mmMgCl2 and 0.2 mm LaCl3. The filters were washed three additional times with the same buffer, and the amount of cell-associated 45Ca2+ was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular Ca2+ in unlabeled cells was determined by flame photometry as previously described (3Miseta A. Fu L. Kellermayer R. Buckley J. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50–100 A 600 units of yeast grown in YPD or YPGal medium as indicated were harvested and washed with YP medium. The cell pellets were lyophilized and then resuspended in 1 m HCl. Total Ca2+ in this acid-soluble extract was measured by flame photometry and is expressed in mmol of Ca2+/kg of cells (dry mass). Previous work has shown that disruption of the PGM2 gene in S. cerevisiaeleads to high Ca2+ uptake and accumulation when thepgm2Δ strain is grown in medium containing galactose as the carbon source (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This phenotype may be related to an inability to efficiently convert Glc-1-P to Glc-6-P, a step required for cells to utilize galactose as the carbon source (Fig.1). However, it is also possible that Pgm2p has another cellular function that leads to alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis when the gene encoding this protein is deleted. This alternative function could be related to the previous finding that Pgm2p undergoes a post-translational modification in the form of a glucosyl residue attached by a phosphodiester linkage to one or more O-linked mannose residues (46Marchase R.B. Bounelis P. Brumley L.M. Dey N. Browne B. Auger D. Fritz T.A. Kulesza P. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of the post-translational modification of Pgm2p is regulated by both the carbon source and heat shock; however, it is unclear what role this modification plays in Pgm2p function (47Dey N.B. Bounelis P. Fritz T.A. Bedwell D.M. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27143-27148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Fu L. Bounelis P. Dey N. Browne B.L. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cytosolic proteins are not glycosylated in bacteria and because E. coli PGM shares only limited homology (31% sequence identity) with yeast Pgm2p, we asked whether the expression of E. coliPGM can suppress the Ca2+ homeostasis defects associated with the pgm2Δ mutation. As shown in Fig.2, the pgm2Δ strain exhibited several phenotypes, including slow growth in YPGal medium, sensitivity to high extracellular Ca2+ levels, and sensitivity to cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of calcineurin function). However, the pgm2Δ strain expressing E. coliPGM grew normally under each of these conditions. These results suggest that the Ca2+ homeostasis defects observed when thepgm2Δ mutant was grown in YPGal medium are directly related to the loss of PGM enzymatic activity, and not other putative functions of Pgm2p. The results described above support the hypothesis that a loss of Pgm2p enzymatic activity and the resultant accumulation of cellular Glc-1-P are responsible for the observed alterations in cellular Ca2+homeostasis. We next asked whether these effects are attributable specifically to the accumulation of Glc-1-P or to a metabolic derivative of this molecule. Other than the formation of Glc-6-P by PGM, the major way to consume Glc-1-P is through the action of the enzyme UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, which uses Glc-1-P and UTP to catalyze the formation of UDP-Glc (Fig. 1). If the cellular level of either UDP-Glc or a downstream metabolite was increased in thepgm2Δ mutant in medium containing galactose as the carbon source, it could be responsible for the observed Ca2+homeostasis defects in the pgm2Δ null mutant, rather than the high level of Glc-1-P. To explore this possibility, we overexpressed UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase to determine whether an elevated level of UDP-Glc can affect Ca2+ homeostasis in yeast. UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase is encoded by the UGP1 gene. It was previously reported that introduction of UGP1 into a multicopy plasmid leads to an increase in both UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase activity and the cellular UDP-Glc concentration in glucose-grown cells (43Daran J.M. Dallies N. Thines-Sempoux D. Paquet V. François J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with that report, we observed a 10-fold increase in the cellular UDP-Glc concentration in wild-type cells carrying a multicopy plasmid expressing UGP1 when this strain was grown in YPD medium (Fig.3 A). However, this strain exhibited normal 45Ca2+ uptake when grown in YPD medium (Fig. 3 B) or YPGal medium (data not shown). These results demonstrate that an increased level of UDP-Glc is not responsible for the observed alterations in Ca2+homeostasis when the pgm2Δ mutant is grown with galactose as the carbon source. When grown in medium containing galactose as the carbon source, the pgm2Δ mutant accumulates an elevated level of Glc-1-P and exhibits a reduced growth rate, as well as sensitivity to cyclosporin A and high levels of extracellular Ca2+ (35Fu L.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we next asked whether an elevated level of Glc-6-P could mediate similar phenotypes in yeast. Previous studies have shown that strains containing a disruption of the PFK2gene, which encodes the β-subunit of phosphofructokinase, accumulate a high level of Glc-6-P (49Huang D. Wilson W.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22495-22501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether Glc-6-P also plays a role in yeast Ca2+ homeostasis, we compared the Ca2+-related phenotypes of the wild-type,pgm2Δ, pfk2Δ, andpgm2Δ/pfk2Δ strains. We first determined the cellular concentrations of Glc-6-P and Glc-1-P in strains carrying these mutations. As previously reported (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5431-5440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the levels of these two metabolites were similar in the wild-type andpgm2Δ strains when grown in YPD medium (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the cellular level of Glc-6-P was increased by 5–6-fold in the pfk2Δ and pgm2Δ/pfk2Δ strains grown in YPD medium. When grown in YPGal medium, the pgm2Δ mutant accumulated 10–15-fold more Glc-1-P than the wild-type strain (Fig.4 B), as previously reported (35Fu L. Miseta A. Hunton D. Marchase R.B. Bedwell D.M. J.

Here, we show that M protein can be imported into the nucleus by an active transport mechanism, even though it is small enough (∼27 kDa) to diffuse through nuclear pore complexes. We map two distinct nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing regions of M protein, each of which is capable of directing the nuclear localization of a heterologous protein. One of these regions, comprising amino acids 47–229, is also sufficient to inhibit nucleocytoplasmic transport. Two amino acids that are conserved among the matrix proteins of vesiculoviruses are important for nuclear localization, but are not essential for the inhibitory activity of M protein.

In eukaryotic cells, molecular transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; M, matrix protein; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Nup, nucleoporin 1The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; M, matrix protein; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Nup, nucleoporin large proteinacious structures that span the nuclear envelope (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ryan K.J.

Small molecules can diffuse through NPCs, but larger molecules must be actively transported. Active transport through NPCs is mediated by receptor proteins (also known as importins, exportins and transportins, or karyopherins), which interact with localization signals on cargo molecules, RanGTP, and proteins of the NPC (nucleoporins or Nups) (for reviews, see Refs. 3Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Google Scholar, 4Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar, 5Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 400-408Google Scholar). Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are amino acid sequences that promote the active nuclear import of proteins, even when these proteins are small enough to diffuse through the NPC (for example, see Refs. 6Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 333-346Google Scholarand 7Turpin P. Hay R.T. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6804-6812Google Scholar). A wide variety of sequences have been identified that can function as NLSs, the best characterized of which are the highly basic mono- and bi-partite NLSs of SV40 T antigen and nucleoplasmin, respectively (for review, see Ref. 8Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Google Scholar). In addition, many other NLSs have been identified that differ from these sequences with respect to size and/or highly basic character (for example, see Refs. 9Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Google Scholar, 10Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Google Scholar, 11Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G.

Thus, it is difficult to predict the identity of an NLS without empirical evidence. Previously, we and others have shown that the matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) inhibits active nucleocytoplasmic transport (13Her L.-S. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1845-1848Google Scholar, 14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar, 15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar). In the absence of other viral components, M protein inhibits nuclear export of mRNAs, snRNAs, and rRNAs, but not tRNAs, and slows nuclear import of proteins containing highly basic mono- and bi-partite NLSs (13Her L.-S. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1845-1848Google Scholar, 14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). The M proteins from two other vesiculoviruses, chandipura virus and spring viremia carp virus, also have inhibitory activity (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar). Earlier work from our laboratory demonstrated that M protein must be present in the nucleus to inhibit nucleocytoplasmic transport and that this inhibitory activity correlates with the ability of M protein to associate with NPCs (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the findings that M protein associates with the intranuclear nucleoporin Nup98, and that this association is important for the inhibitory activity of M protein (15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar, 17Enninga J. Levy D.E. Blobel G. Fontoura B.M.A. Science. 2002; 295: 1523-1525Google Scholar). The mechanism by which M protein gains access to Nup98 or other potential nuclear targets remains to be determined. Even though the size of M protein (∼27 kDa) is below the diffusion limit of the NPC (4Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar), nuclear entry might occur by active import. Here, we show that M protein can localize to the nucleus by an active import mechanism. We identify two regions of M protein that are each sufficient to direct the nuclear localization of a heterologous protein. These regions share a common sequence of 10 amino acids. We show that the region spanning amino acids 47–229 contains an NLS and is sufficient for the inhibitory activity of M protein. Finally, we identify two amino acids within M-(47–229) that are important for nuclear localization, but are not necessary for inhibitory activity. Thus, the interactions between M protein and cellular protein(s) that occur during nuclear localization are likely to be different from interactions involved in the inhibitory activity of M protein. The pEGFP-C3 vector encoding three tandem copies of GFP (pEGFP3-C3) was kindly provided by Y. Lazebnik (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The reading frame within the multiple cloning site of pEGFP3-C3 was shifted by generating a double-stranded DNA fragment for insertion into the SacII site using the following complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-GGGCTGCAGAGATCTCCGC-3′ and 5′-GGAGATCTCTGCAGCCCGC-3′. Oligonucleotides were gel-purified, phosphorylated using T4 DNA kinase (Promega), annealed, and ligated into pEGFP3-C3 vector that had been digested withSacII. Correct orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid, pEGFP3-C1, was used as the vector for all constructs encoding GFP3-M fusion proteins. To make pEGFP3-M-(1–229), a DNA fragment encoding M protein was released from pEGFP-C1-OM (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar) by BamHI digestion. This fragment was ligated into pEGFP3-C1 that had also been digested with BamHI. All truncations of M protein for ligation into pEGFP3-C1 were made by PCR using pGEX-2T-OM (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar) as template (see Table Ifor oligonucleotides). PCR products were digested with Bam H1 and ligated into pEGFP3-C1 that had also been digested withBamHI. Correct orientation and sequence of all clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table IOligonucleotides used to generate PCR products for ligation into pEGFP3-C1 vectorCloneOligonucleotidespEGFP3-M-(1–57)5′-CATCATGGGATCCTTAAAGAAAGATTCTCGG-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCATGCGGATCATGAGTGTCC-3′pEGFP3-M-(23–57)5′-CGGGATCCGCACCACCCCCTTATG-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCATGCGGATCATGAGTGTCC-3′pEGFP3-M-(32–57)5′-TGGGATCCATGGAGTATGCTCCGAGCG-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCATGCGGATCATGAGTGTCC-3′pEGFP3-M-(47–229)5′-CGGGATCCGGAGTTGACGAGATGGAC-3′; 5′-GGGAGCTCGCCCGGGGATCC-3′pEGFP3-M-(57–229)5′-CGGGATCCCATCAATTAAGATATGAGAAAAA-3′; 5′-GGGAGCTCGCCCGGGGGGATCC-3′pEGFP3-M-(47–194)5′-CGGGATCCGGAGTTGACGAGATGGAC-3′; 5′-CGGGATCCATTGAAATCATCCCAGATC-3′For each oligonucleotide pair, the 5′-oligonucleotide is listed first, followed by the 3′-oligonucleotide. Open table in a new tab For each oligonucleotide pair, the 5′-oligonucleotide is listed first, followed by the 3′-oligonucleotide. To make a vector encoding GST with an HA epitope tag fused to the C terminus, PCR was done using the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) as template, and the following primers (5′ and 3′, respectively): 5′-GTCTATGGCCATCATACGTTA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAAGAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAACGCGGAACCAGATCCG-3′. The resulting PCR product, encoding a carboxyl-terminal portion of GST with the HA epitope tag, was digested with BalI andBamHI. The pGEX-2T vector was also digested withBalI and BamHI. The gel-purified vector fragment of pGEX-2T was ligated to the PCR product to generate the vector pGEX-2T-HA. The presence and orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To make a plasmid encoding GST-HA-M-(1–229), a DNA fragment encoding the M protein was released from pEGFP-C1-OM (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar) by digestion withBamHI. This fragment was ligated into the vector pGEX-2T-HA that had also been digested with BamHI. A construct encoding GST-HA-M-(47–229) was made by ligating theBamHI-digested PCR product coding for M-(47–229) (see above) into BamHI-digested pGEX-2T-HA vector. DNA sequencing was done to confirm the orientation and sequence of inserts. Activity assays (described below) confirmed that the presence of the HA epitope tag had no detectable effect on the inhibitory activity of the M protein. Point mutations within M protein were made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To generate constructs encoding mutant GFP3-M fusion proteins for transient transfection, the following templates were used: pEGFP3-M-(1–229), pEGFP3-M-(47–229), and pEGFP3-M-(23–57). To generate constructs encoding mutant GST-HA fusion proteins for overexpression in Escherichia coli, pGEX-2T-HA-M-(1–229) and pGEX-2T-HA-M-(47–229) were used as templates. In all cases, the presence of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For production of recombinant proteins, all plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Overnight cultures were used to inoculate fresh LB-amp to an OD600 of 0.04. Cultures were grown at room temperature to an OD600 of ∼0.6 and then induced for 8 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and protein was affinity-purified as previously described (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). Preparation and injection of stage VI X. laevis oocytes was as described (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). Purified GST-HA-M proteins (∼100 μg/ml) were injected into the nucleus (12 nl) or into the cytoplasm (24 nl) 1 h prior to injection of RNA export substrates. A mixture of in vitro-synthesized (18Pasquinelli A.E. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. RNA. 1995; 1: 957-967Google Scholar)32P-labeled RNAs, which contained ∼5 fmol of each species of RNA, was injected into the oocyte nuclei (12 nl). To control for the accuracy of injection and dissection, all injected samples included blue dextran, and the RNA mixture contained U3 snoRNA, which is not exported from the nucleus (19Terns M.P. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 959-961Google Scholar). At indicated time points, oocytes were manually dissected into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Total RNAs were isolated from each fraction and analyzed by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography as previously described (20Grimm C. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 793-806Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for Western blots. HeLa cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to Immobilon™-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with antibodies (1:250) in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Tween 20) containing 5% powdered milk (Carnation) and developed using LumiGLO® (KPL). One day prior to performing transient transfections, a 6-well tissue culture plate containing coverslips was seeded with 4 × 105 HeLa cells per well. Transfections were done according to the Invitrogen protocol, using 1 μg of DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy 24 h after transfection by fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. To assay for NPC association of GFP3-M fusion proteins (data not shown, but see “Discussion”), cells were extracted first with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min and then fixed with paraformaldehyde for 20 min (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). Fluorescent proteins were visualized using the ×100 objective of an Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). To score the nuclear localization of GFP3-M fusion proteins, levels of fluorescence were quantified using Labworks Imaging Software (UVP, Inc). The ratio of average fluorescence in the nucleus to average fluorescence in the cytoplasm over a defined region of three representative cells was calculated and averaged for each protein. The values (Navg/Cavg)avg < 1 were scored as (−) for nuclear localization. Values 1 < (Navg/Cavg)avg ≤ 1.2 and values (Navg/Cavg)avg > 1.2 were scored as (+) and (++), respectively. Since nuclear localization is essential for the inhibitory activity of VSV M protein, it is important to understand how this protein enters the nucleus. To analyze the localization properties of M protein, we generated a fusion protein that contains M protein and three tandem copies of GFP3 and thus is much larger (∼108 kDa) than the size limit for diffusion (∼60 kDa) through the NPC (4Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection, and protein localization was visualized in fixed cells by fluorescence microscopy. The expressed GFP3 protein was stable in HeLa cells, as indicated by the predominance of full-length protein (86% of total protein detected) in cell extracts analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.1 B, lane a). Localization of GFP3 was almost exclusively cytoplasmic (Fig.1 A,panel a). In contrast, the fusion protein containing M protein and GFP3(GFP3-M-(1–229)), which was also stable when expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B,lane b), accumulated strongly in cell nuclei (Fig. 1 A,panel b). In addition, GFP3-M-(1–229) was visible at the nuclear rim, consistent with previous reports (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar, 15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar). The ability of M protein to direct import of a cytoplasmic protein into the nucleus demonstrates that M protein contains at least one NLS that is capable of mediating active transport. To identify sequence(s) within M protein that function as an NLS, we examined the localization of GFP3-M fusion proteins containing truncated versions of M protein (diagrammed in Fig.1 C). An amino-terminal truncation was made to generate GFP3-M-(47–229), based on previous reports of a stable carboxyl-terminal fragment of M protein produced by trypsin digestion (21Morrison T.G. McQuain C.O. J. Virol. 1978; 26: 115-125Google Scholar, 22Pal R. Grinnell B.W. Snyder R.M. Wiener J.R. Volk W.A. Wagner R.R. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 298-306Google Scholar). Expressed GFP3-M-(47–229) was stable (Fig.1 B,lane c), and this protein accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1 A,panel c), demonstrating that amino acids 47–229 of M protein are sufficient for nuclear localization. The NLS within M-(47–229) was defined further by making truncations based on a computer-generated prediction of the secondary structure of M protein (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar). Sequence was deleted from either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends of M-(47–229) to generate GFP3-M-(57–229) and GFP3-M-(47–194), respectively. Although both expressed proteins were stable in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B,lanes d and e), neither protein accumulated in cell nuclei (Fig. 1 A,panels d and e). Thus, both amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of M-(47–229) are necessary for function of the NLS in this carboxyl-terminal region of M protein. We refer to the NLS in M-(47–229) as NLS-C. To determine which amino acids are necessary for the function of NLS-C, we made single alanine substitutions throughout GFP3-M-(47–229) at the positions of residues conserved among vesiculoviral M proteins (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A, numbered residues inboldface), reasoning that amino acids important for protein function are likely to be conserved. Single alanine substitutions were also made at the positions of three carboxyl-terminal residues that are not identically conserved (Fig. 2 A, residues denoted byasterisks), but which were previously implicated as being important for the inhibition of cellular gene expression in VSV-infected cells (23Desforges M. Charron J. Bérard S. Beausoleil S. Stojdl D.F. Despars G. Laverdière B. Bell J.C. Talbot P.J. Stanners C.P. Poliquin L. Virus Res. 2001; 76: 87-102Google Scholar). For each mutant protein, levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence were quantified and scored (TableII). Representative cells that were scored as (−) (Fig. 2 B,panels a andb), (+) (panel c), and (++) (panel d) for nuclear localization are shown. The stabilities of all mutant proteins were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown).Table IIThe effects of single amino acid substitutions on nuclear localization of GFP3-M-(47–229)SubstitutionNuclear localizationM51A+P77A++W91A−Y95A++G97A++K101A++F104A++Y105A−Y105E−Y105F++K117A++Y131A++G137A++H143A+G146A+P149A++E156A++F158A++G169A++G209A+L210A++E213A++V221A++S226A++The ratio of average fluorescence in the nucleus to average fluorescence in the cytoplasm over a defined region of three representative cells was calculated and averaged for each mutant (Labworks Imaging Software, UVP, Inc.).

Nuclear localization of the wild-type versions of GFP3-M(1–229) and GFP3-M-(47–229) were also quantified, and scores are shown in Fig. 1 C. Of the 22 single alanine substitutions made in GFP3-M-(47–229), 20 had little or no effect on nuclear localization (Table II). However, when alanine substitutions were made at positions 91 (W91A) or 105 (Y105A) in GFP3-M-(47–229), the resulting mutant proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 B, panels a and b), suggesting that these residues are important for the function of NLS-C. We asked if phosphorylation of Tyr-105 contributes to the function of NLS-C, since it had previously been shown that M protein can be phosphorylated at several Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues (24Clinton G.M. Huang A.S. Virology. 1981; 108: 510-514Google Scholar, 25Kaptur P.E. McCreedy Jr., B.J. Lyles D.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5384-5392Google Scholar). When Tyr-105 was replaced by glutamic acid, to introduce a negative charge (mimicking constitutive phosphorylation), the resulting protein (Y105E) accumulated in the cytoplasm like Y105A (Fig. 2 C,panel a, compared with Fig. 2 B,panel b); conversely, replacement of Tyr-105 with Phe, which cannot be phosphorylated, resulted in a protein (Y105F) that accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2 C,panel b) like wild-type GFP3-M-(47–229) (Fig. 1 A,panel c). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-105 is not important for the nuclear localization of M-(47–229), but that the presence of an aromatic residue at position 105 is important.

Fontoura B.M.A. Science. 2002; 295: 1523-1525Google Scholar) established a correlation between the abilities of M protein to associate with NPCs and to inhibit nucleocytoplasmic transport. Since GFP3-M-(47–229) was visible at the nuclear rim as well as within the nucleoplasm (Fig. 1 A,panel c), we asked if M-(47–229) was active as an inhibitor of nucleocytoplasmic transport. The inhibitory activity of M-(47–229) was assayed by testing the ability of a chimeric protein (GST-HA-M(47–229)) to inhibit RNA export in X. laevis oocytes (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar). The GST-HA-M-(47–229) protein inhibited export of snRNA and mRNA when injected into oocyte nuclei (Fig. 3, compare panel b with panel a) or cytoplasms (data not shown). Therefore, M-(47–229) is sufficient for the inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport. The inhibitory activities of variants of GST-HA-M-(47–229) containing W91A or Y105A substitutions were also assayed for inhibitory activity in oocytes. Since GST-HA-M-(47–229) is small enough (∼52 kDa) to access the nucleus by diffusion, results were the same when the mutant proteins were injected into either oocyte nuclei or cytoplasms. Both mutant proteins inhibited snRNA and mRNA export (Fig. 3, panels c and d, compared withpanel a), showing that Trp-91 and Tyr-105 are not necessary for the inhibitory activity of M protein. In the presence of either mutant protein, some snRNA and mRNA was detectable in the cytoplasm at the second time point (Fig. 3, panels c and d,far right lanes), indicating that these proteins may not be as potent as the wild-type GST-HA-M-(47–229) protein. Thus, although Trp-91 and Tyr-105 are important for the function of NLS-C in the context of M-(47–229), they are not essential for the inhibitory activity of M protein. We conclude that distinct amino acids in M protein are required for inhibitory activity and for nuclear localization. We next examined the effects of W91A and Y105A mutations on nuclear localization of the full-length M protein. The expressed mutant proteins were both stable in HeLa cells (data not shown). The presence of the amino-terminal 46 residues of M protein did not alter the effect of the Y105A mutation on nuclear localization, since GFP3-M-(1–229) (Y105A) accumulated mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panel c), as did GFP3-M-(47–229) (Y105A) (Fig. 2 B,panel b). In contrast, addition of amino acids 1–46 to GFP3-M-(47–229) (W91A) resulted in a protein, GFP3-M-(1–229) (W91A), which localized predominantly within the nucleus (Fig. 4, panel b). Thus, the effect of the W91A mutation on the function of NLS-C is suppressed in the context of full-length M protein, suggesting that amino acids 1–46 could comprise an alternative NLS. To determine if the amino-terminal region of M protein functions autonomously as an NLS, we examined the localization of several GFP3-M fusion proteins (diagrammed in Fig.5 A), all of which were stable when expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown). Although some GFP3-M-(1–47) protein was observed in nuclei, it did not accumulate there (Fig. 5 B,panel a). However, the slightly larger fusion protein, GFP3-M-(1–57), did accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 5 B,panel b), indicating that a second NLS is contained within amino acids 1–57 of the M protein. To further define this NLS, amino-terminal truncations and alanine substitutions were made. Unexpectedly, GFP3-M-(23–57), which lacks the highly basic amino-terminal region of M protein, also accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 5 B,panel c). When additional residues were removed from the N terminus of M-(23–57), to generate GFP3-M-(32–57), nuclear accumulation was abolished (Fig. 5 B,panel d). Thus, the amino-terminal NLS (NLS-N) is contained within amino acids 23–57 (Fig. 5 C,underlined). In the context of GFP3-M-(23–57), single alanine substitutions (and one Ala to Leu substitution) were made at positions that are conserved among the vesiculoviral M proteins (Fig.5 C, numbered residues in boldface). Three of the six single amino acid substitutions reduced, but none abolished, nuclear accumulation of GFP3-M-(23–57) (TableIII). Representative cells that were scored as (+) (Fig. 5 C,panel a) and (++) (panel b) for nuclear localization are shown. The sequence in M-(23–57) displays no striking homology to previously reported NLSs, suggesting that NLS-N is a novel NLS.Table IIIThe effects of single amino acid substitutions on nuclear localization of GFP3-M-(23–57)SubstitutionNuclear localizationP24A++P25A+Y27A++A39L++P40A+M51A+Values of (+) and (++) are assigned as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend for Table 2.

Nuclear localization of the wild-type version of GFP3-M-(23–57) was also quantified, and the score is shown in Fig. 5 A We have shown that the M protein of VSV can be actively imported into the nucleus, since it can direct nuclear accumulation of a large cytoplasmic protein, GFP3, in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Whereas it has previously been shown that M protein distributes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm during VSV infection (26Lyles D.S. Puddington L. McCreedy Jr., B.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4387-4392Google Scholar), the mechanism by which M protein enters the nucleus was unclear. This work demonstrates that, even though it is smaller than the diffusion limits of the NPC, M protein is able to exploit cellular mechanisms for active nuclear import. Perhaps active import allows for nuclear localization that is more rapid and efficient than nuclear localization via simple diffusion. The region of M protein containing NLS-N was mapped to amino acids 23–57. Interestingly, the highly basic region (amino acids 1–22) of M protein, which resembles the classical NLSs of SV40 T antigen (PKKKRKVE) and nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLD), was not required for nuclear localization, nor does it function as an NLS when fused to GFP3 (data not shown). While M-(23–57) has no apparent similarity to published NLSs, it does contain two motifs, PPXY (amino acids 24–27 of M protein) and P(T/S)XP (amino acids 37–40 of M protein), that can each bind WW domain-containing proteins, including members of the Nedd 4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (27Harty R.N. Paragas J. Sudol M. Palese P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2921-2929Google Scholar, 28Harty R.N. Brown M.E. Wang G. Huibregtse J. Hayes F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13871-13876Google Scholar, 29Strack B. Calistri A. Accola M.A. Palù G. Göttlinger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13063-13068Google Scholar). Since it has recently been shown that Nedd 4 is a nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling protein (30Hamilton M.H. Tcherepanova I. Huibregtse J.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26324-26331Google Scholar), it is plausible that NLS-N could promote nuclear import via a piggyback mechanism, bound to a WW domain-containing protein, such as a Nedd 4 family member. This model is consistent with our inability to abolish the function of NLS-N with a single alanine substitution, since each individual motif would be capable of independently binding a WW domain-containing protein. A second NLS was mapped to amino acids 47–229. NLS-C appears to be rather complex, in that amino acids located at its amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends are necessary for nuclear import. These sequences could promote nuclear localization either directly, by interacting with one or more cellular proteins, or indirectly, by contributing to the proper folding of M protein. In addition to elements at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of M-(47–229), conserved amino acids at positions 91 and 105 are also important for the function of NLS-C, since the amino acid substitutions W91A and Y105A abolished nuclear accumulation of GFP3-M-(47–229). Importantly, these substitutions did not destroy the ability of M protein to inhibit transport, indicating that there is no gross misfolding of the mutant proteins. Some insight into the organization of NLS-C can be gained from the recently solved crystal structure of a fragment of M protein containing amino acids 48–229 (31Gaudier M. Gaudin Y. Knossow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2886-2892Google Scholar). From this work, it is clear that both Trp-91 and Tyr-105 are buried residues that are not exposed at the surface of the protein, so they are likely to contribute to the maintenance of a specific structural motif important for the function of NLS-C. The contributions of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of M-(47–229) to the organization of NLS-C are less obvious. While the amino-terminal region of the crystal structure (amino acids 48–58) is disordered, the carboxyl terminus is exposed and lies along the surface of the protein. It is unclear whether the impaired nuclear localization of GFP3-M-(47–194) (Fig. 1 A,panel e) arises from structural changes induced by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 35 residues or from the absence of one or more specific residues in this region that is recognized by a cellular protein required for nuclear localization. Further mutational analysis of this region, based on information from the crystal structure, may be helpful in distinguishing between these possibilities. In addition to containing NLS-C, M-(47–229) is also sufficient for the inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Moreover, consistent with previous findings that transport inhibition activity correlates with NPC association (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar, 15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar, 17Enninga J. Levy D.E. Blobel G. Fontoura B.M.A. Science. 2002; 295: 1523-1525Google Scholar), M-(47–229) is sufficient for association with NPCs (nuclear rim staining visible in Fig. 1 A,panel c). Within M-(47–229), two amino acids, Trp-91 and Tyr-105, were shown to be important for nuclear localization (Fig. 2), but not for inhibitory activity (Fig. 3) or association with NPCs (data not shown). Conversely, the alanine substitution of Met-51, a residue previously shown to be essential for inhibitory activity (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar, 15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar), reduced, but did not abolish, nuclear localization in the context of either M-(47–229) or M-(23–57) (Tables II and III). Moreover, in the context of M-(1–229), the M51A substitution had no detectable effect on nuclear localization (data not shown), as was previously shown for an M51L substitution (16Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8590-8595Google Scholar). Thus, Met-51 is an amino acid in M protein that is essential for inhibitory activity (14Petersen J.M. Her L.-S. Varvel V. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8590-8601Google Scholar, 15von Kobbe C. van Deursen J.M. Rodrigues J.P. Sitterlin D. Bachi A. Wu X. Wilm M. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1243-1252Google Scholar) but is not required for nuclear localization. We conclude that distinct amino acids in M protein are required for nuclear localization and for inhibitory activity. In the context of full-length M protein, it is unclear whether NLS-N and NLS-C can function independently or whether they work together. Both NLSs require a common region of M protein (M-(47–57)) for their function, but this region is not sufficient for nuclear localization, since neither GFP3-M-(32–57) (Fig. 5 B,panel d) nor GFP3-M-(47–194) (Fig.1 A,panel e) accumulated in the nucleus. Therefore, additional sequences unique to each NLS are essential for function. Curiously, even though our data indicate that M-(23–57) contains an NLS that can function autonomously and that can overcome the deleterious effects of W91A on nuclear localization, we observed a lack of nuclear accumulation of GFP3-M-(1–229) (Y105A). Thus, in the context of full-length M protein, Tyr-105 could be important for both NLSs to work together efficiently. Why might M protein contain multiple NLSs? The presence of multiple NLSs has been observed in several viral, as well as cellular, proteins (35Segref A. Mattaj I.W. Ohno M. RNA. 2001; 3: 351-360Google Scholar, 36Schwamborn K. Albig W. Doenecke D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 206-217Google Scholar, 37Jenkins Y. McEntee M. Weis K. Greene W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 875-885Google Scholar). Perhaps more than one NLS is present in M protein to ensure efficient entry into the nucleus by active import. Different cellular proteins bound to both NLSs could work cooperatively during nuclear import of the full length M protein. It will be interesting to learn which cellular proteins recognize the NLSs of VSV M protein to mediate its nuclear localization. We thank Yuri Lazebnik for kindly supplying the vector encoding GFP3.

Although these three proteins have been described as antifungal molecules, no data regarding their mode of action have been so far reported. We herein report the interaction of AFP with DNA.

The phage suspension was digested for 20 min at room temperature with RNase A (1 mg/ml), and its ssDNA was extracted and kept at −20 °C until used. The concentration of DNA was determined spectrophotometrically based on A 260 (1-cm optical path) = 1.0 for a 50 μg/ml solution (0.154 mm nucleotide concentration using the average nucleotide molecular weight of 325). Two different 27-mer deoxyoligonucleotides were also used. They were synthesized at the DNA sequence facility of the Universidad Complutense (Madrid, Spain).

The protein and nucleic acid mixtures were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in 40 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA (TAE buffer) (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and then loaded on 0.7% agarose gels equilibrated in the same buffer. The electrophoresis was performed at 5 V/cm for different lengths of time. The gels were stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and the nucleic acids were visualized on a UV transilluminator equipped with a 312 nm wavelength emitting lamp. The intensity of the bands obtained was used to quantify the amount of free and bound nucleic acid. The volumogram (density or quantity of a spot calculated from its volume made of the sum of all pixel intensities composing the spot) of each nucleic acid band was obtained on a Photodocumentation System (UVItec). A linear relationship between the amount loaded on the gel and the value of the corresponding volumogram was previously verified with control samples. Fluorescence emission spectra of AFP were obtained at 25 °C using an SLM Aminco 8000 spectrofluorimeter as described previously (3Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.M. Gasset M. Patiño B.

Cross (90°/0°) polarizers were used for the excitation and emission beams, respectively, to avoid interferences due to the turbidity of some DNA-protein samples. The fluorescence intensities were corrected for the inner filter effect, contribution of the water Raman signal, and dilution during titrations. Fluorescence quenching promoted by either DNA or oligonucleotides was calculated as 1 −F/Ff, whereFf is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of nucleic acid. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) displacement was assayed following the decrease of the fluorescence emission at 595 nm (for excitation at 510 nm) after addition of AFP to a solution of DNA prelabeled with the probe (15Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar). Displacement was calculated as (F −Ff)/(Fb −Ff), where Ff andFb are the fluorescence intensities of EtBr in the absence and presence of DNA, respectively. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 25 °C in the 350–200 nm wavelength range in 0.01-cm optical path cuvettes. The instrument used was a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were obtained at 0.2-nm/s scanning speed with a response time of 2 s. The results shown are the accumulation of at least four spectra in each case. Base lines were conveniently subtracted. Mean residue ellipticity is expressed in units of degree × cm2 × dmol−1 referred to the nucleotide molar concentration. The contribution of AFP to the CD spectra of polydeoxynucleotides is negligible at wavelengths above 250 nm since this protein shows a CD spectrum that is rather unique, with a major positive contribution centered around 230 nm, due to its high content of aromatic residues (3Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.M. Gasset M. Patiño B. Campos-Olivas R. Vázquez C. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Arch. Biochem.

Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The folding pattern of AFP consists of five antiparallel highly twisted β strands, defining a small and compact β barrel stabilized by four disulfide bridges, the eight cysteine residues being deeply buried in the protein core (Fig.1 A) (17Campos-Olivas R. Bruix M. Santoro J. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3009-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A five-stranded β barrel capped by an α-helix was first noted as a structural motif in some proteins that bind single-stranded nucleic acids or oligosaccharides, and it was termed the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding motif or OB fold (18Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The number of known protein structures containing the OB fold has been steadily increasing, and there are now 10 families for which this common structural motif has been identified (19Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 20Draper D.E. Reynaldo L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Antson A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Some of the features originally considered as characteristics of the OB fold appear not to be conserved for all these proteins. This is the case of the α-helix capping the barrel, which can be reduced to a single turn or even an irregular loop. The three-dimensional structure of AFP closely resembled the OB fold. This similar folding pattern became more evident when the backbone atoms of the five β strands of AFP were superimposed on those equivalents in known OB fold-containing proteins (Fig. 1 B), although no significant sequence similarity was observed when AFP and OB fold-containing proteins were compared (Fig. 1 C; only about 10% identity is observed upon sequence alignment based on the structure fitting). The AFP folding most closely resembled the cold shock domain (CSD), which defines a superfamily of proteins, the bacterial cold shock proteins being the first identified members (22Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Among the structural determinants of the OB fold, and in particular of the CSD, the presence of a long and strongly coiled β-1 strand is highly remarkable. This coiling is promoted by a small residue (usually glycine). In addition, a β bulge in strand 1 and usually a glycine residue at the beginning of strand 4, opposite the β bulge, are also characteristic. These features are not invariant, but at least one of them is always present in the known OB folds (19Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These structural determinants are present in AFP (Fig. 1 B) and correspond to Gly-5 and Tyr-8 in strand 1 and Gly-37 at the beginning of strand 4. Thus, AFP could be considered as a member of the CSD-containing family of proteins based on these structural criteria. The proteins of the OB fold superfamily have unrelated functions with many of them having an unknown functionality. As indicated above, many OB fold-containing proteins bind nucleic acids. In particular, CSD-containing proteins have been shown to bind both dsDNA and ssDNA in vitro (19Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied this possibility, and we in fact observed that AFP bound polydeoxynucleotides. Considering that AFP is a cationic polypeptide (5Nakaya K. Omata K. Okahashi I. Nakamura Y. Kolkenbrock H. Ulbrich N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 19: 31-38Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we first tested the effect of the protein on the electrophoretic behavior of the nucleic acid. Fig. 2summarizes the results of gel shift electrophoresis assays under non-denaturing conditions for double-stranded calf thymus DNA. This assay allows separation of free nucleic acid from protein-bound nucleic acid by retardation of the electrophoretic mobility. This study was also performed for phage F1 circular single-stranded DNA with similar results (data not shown). Complete retardation of DNA was produced with no bands of intermediate mobility observed, indicating charge neutralization of the nucleic acid by the protein. The fraction of free nucleic acid decreased as the amount of AFP increased, and no free nucleic acid was observed at a minimum protein/nucleotide molar ratio of about 0.1. AFP contains 1 Arg and 12 Lys residues and 1 Glu and 3 Asp residues; its net charge is about +9 at neutral pH. Thus, no free nucleic acid was observed when a protein (+)/nucleotide (−) charge molar ratio of ∼0.9 was reached in the assayed mixture (Fig.2). The cationic character of AFP and the observed charge neutralization strongly suggested that DNA condensation occurred. In fact, 89–90% of the DNA charge (as observed in this case) must be neutralized for condensation to occur (23Wilson R.W. Bloomfield V.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). AFP-DNA mixtures were also analyzed by measuring the intensity of the 90° scattered light, and they were also centrifuged at high speed in Eppendorf tubes to evaluate the nucleic acid in the supernatant. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 3. At about a 0.1 protein/nucleotide molar ratio, virtually all the DNA was pelleted, and a maximum of scattered light was also observed at such a ratio in agreement with the results obtained from the electrophoretic study. In addition, these assays demonstrated a high affinity of the protein for the deoxyoligonucleotides since virtually all added protein is bound to the polynucleotide. Moreover, the DNA-protein interaction did not require any specific nucleotide sequence because 90% charge neutralization was achieved. However, the results of this assay did not allow the estimation of a binding stoichiometry. The nucleic acid could bind more protein molecules than those producing charge neutralization.Figure 3Condensation of DNA promoted by AFP. Variation of percentage of DNA (%DNA) remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation of AFP-calf thymus DNA samples (triangles) and 90° scattered light of these samples (circles) at different protein/nucleotide molar ratios (average values ± S.D. of three different experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The simplest DNA-condensing agents are multivalent cations with valence ≥3 as demonstrated for the trivalent cation spermidine (24Chattoraj D.K. Gosule L.C. Schellman J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). But, in addition to the nonspecific interaction of charge neutralization, specific interactions depending on the condensing agent have important impacts on DNA condensation (25Bloomfield V.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Three types of interactions account for binding of proteins by DNA involving different amino acid side chains: hydrogen bonding (hydrophilic side chains), stacking (aromatic side chains), and ionic (positively charged side chains). The results from the above assays indicated the involvement of ionic interactions in AFP-DNA binding. Aromatic residues on the twisted surface of a β sheet are a means to bind bases of nucleic acids by stacking interactions (20Draper D.E. Reynaldo L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). AFP contains 1 Phe and 6 Tyr residues, three of them displaying a high solvent accessibility (Tyr-29, Tyr-45, and Tyr-50) (17Campos-Olivas R. Bruix M. Santoro J. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3009-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of AFP is related to these three exposed tyrosines since the characteristic protein fluorescence was abolished when three Tyr were titrated to tyrosinate ion at around pH 10 (3). Thus, the interaction between AFP and nucleic acids was also studied by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the protein. The interaction of AFP with DNA resulted in quenching of the tyrosine fluorescence (Fig. 4). Calf thymus DNA promoted a maximum quenching of about 45%, and the saturation was observed at a nucleotide/protein molar ratio of ∼6 (Fig. 4 A). These results were corroborated by titrating a DNA solution with AFP. This plot should display two portions, the first one corresponding to the bound protein and the second one to the free unbound protein after saturation of the nucleic acid. Addition of the protein produced an increase of the fluorescence emission up to an AFP/nucleotide molar ratio of about 0.15 (∼6 nucleotides/AFP) but lower than that corresponding to the free protein at identical concentration (Fig. 4 B). Upon further addition of AFP, a linear increase was observed with a slope corresponding to that of the free protein (Fig. 4 B). This indicated that all the excess protein above such a saturating ratio remained unbound. The ratio of the slopes of the two portions of the plot would give an estimation of the proportion of unquenched fluorescence. This ratio was about 0.6 (40% quenching) in fair agreement with the maximum quenching observed upon titration of the protein. Similar results were obtained when F1 DNA was used (data not shown) and also when these assays were performed for both the single-nd double-stranded27-mer oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 4). The saturating protein/nucleotide molar ratios were identical, but the maximum quenching was 55 and 65% for double- and single-stranded oligonucleotide, respectively. These results would indicate that polynucleotide chain length is not decisive for the interaction, and this would not require a double-stranded structure. Considering that the fluorescence emission of AFP arises from three tyrosines, the obtained results may suggest that 1–2 Tyr residues were involved in the interaction with the nucleic acids if it is assumed that each of these 3 residues have a similar contribution to the protein fluorescence. Protein fluorescence quenching upon nucleic acid binding has also been observed for other OB fold-containing proteins. Thus, the fluorescence emission of the gene V protein encoded by bacteriophage M13, which binds to single-stranded DNA, is quenched upon binding to different oligodeoxynucleotides. The extent of maximum quenching is in the range of 17–45% depending on the length of the oligonucleotide (26Bulsink H. Harmsen B.J.M. Hilbers C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The major cold shock protein of Bacillus subtilis, which also binds to single-stranded deoxynucleic acids, also shows fluorescence quenching upon nucleic acid binding (27Lopez M.M. Yutani K. Makhatadze G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33601-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the quenching ranging from 25–90% depending on the sequence of the considered oligonucleotide since this protein can preferentially bind polypyrimidine templates. DNA-AFP binding produced turbidity, characteristic of a DNA condensation process. Thus, the course of the binding was also analyzed by measurement of the scattered light at a right angle. The results obtained are given in Fig. 5. Titration of the polynucleotides by addition of AFP produced a variation of the scattered light that showed a maximum at an AFP/nucleotide molar ratio of ∼0.1, the scattered intensity decreasing in the order DNA > ds27-mer > ss27-mer (Fig. 5 A), which would be correlated with the decrease in size of the corresponding aggregates. This ratio is that at which charge neutralization of DNA was observed from the retardation electrophoretic mobility assays (Fig. 2). It is well known that addition of cationic peptides to DNA promotes charge neutralization and a collapse of the DNA structure resulting in compact condensed structures (25Bloomfield V.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 28Golan R. Pietrasanta L.I. Hsieh W. Hansma H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14069-14076Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, this result was consistent with a protein binding by strong electrostatic interactions followed by aggregation as charge neutralization occurs (29Durand M. Maurizot J.-C. Borazan H.N. Hélène C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, more protein molecules than those required for charge neutralization can be bound to the nucleic acid as deduced from the fluorescence titrations and also from the measurement of the scattering in titration of AFP by addition of polydeoxynucleotides (Fig. 5 B). A continuous increase of the light scattering up to a saturating value of ∼6 nucleotide/AFP molar ratio was observed in agreement with the results from the protein fluorescence quenching measurements (Fig. 4), the maximum value also decreasing in the order DNA > ds27-mer > ss27-mer. EtBr, a widely used fluorescent probe for DNA, is bound by intercalation between the base pairs. EtBr fluorescence enhancement when the probe intercalates DNA and the subsequent fluorescence decrease upon probe displacement by ligand binding to DNA are well known. The binding constant of this probe is dependent on the molecular flexibility of DNA, which is altered through cationic compaction (30Härd T. Nielsen P.E. Norden B. Eur. J. Biophys. 1988; 16: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA condensation promotes exclusion of EtBr from the DNA (31Gershon H. Ghirlando R. Guttman S.B. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNA condensation induced by AFP was studied by an EtBr displacement assay. The results obtained for AFP are summarized in Fig. 6. AFP promoted a decrease of the fluorescence emission of EtBr-DNA complex (about 60 and 30% for calf thymus DNA and ds27-mer, respectively). These values were roughly in the same proportion as those corresponding to the intensity of the scattered light in the equivalent experiments (Fig. 5 A) as it would be expected if the probe displacement was a consequence of the extent of DNA condensation. The interaction of AFP with polydeoxynucleotides (calf thymus DNA, ds27-mer, and ss27-mer) was also analyzed by circular dichroism measurements. These studies can only be reliably performed up to an AFP/nucleotide molar ratio of about 0.05 since at higher ratios the turbidity of the samples distorted the CD spectra. Short (0.01-cm) optical path cells were used to minimize the effect of turbidity. The obtained results are given in Fig. 7. A progressive decrease in the amplitude of the positive CD band at about 280 nm was observed for the three polydeoxynucleotides as the proportion of AFP increased, suggesting a loss of the stacking interactions. Thus, the interaction of AFP with DNA would be consistent with a protein binding by strong electrostatic interactions with alteration of the base stacking interactions, involving Tyr residues of AFP, followed by collapse of the nucleic acid as charge neutrality is approached. There are many strategies found in protein-nucleic acid interaction. Exposed aromatic amino acids and extended loops, frequently poorly structured, are among them (20Draper D.E. Reynaldo L.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and they are present in the AFP structure. In addition to AFP two other antifungal proteins from molds, PAF and Anafp, have been described (8Marx F. Haas H. Reindl M. Stöffler G. Lottspeich F. Redl B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Lee D.G. Shin S.Y. Maeng C.-Y. Jin Z.Z. Kim K.L. Hahn K.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). AFP displays 45 and 31% sequence identity, respectively, with these two proteins. There are 14 positions conserved within the three proteins and four more exhibiting substitutions of conservative character. Eleven of the conserved positions are in the protein core according to the known structure of AFP. Six of the remaining conserved positions are highly exposed (Lys-17, Gln-19, Lys-22, Lys-32, Asp-36, and Tyr-45). Although PAF and Anafp have not been described to bind nucleic acids, the sequence similarity between these three proteins may suggest a relevant role for these exposed and conserved residues in the AFP-nucleic acid interaction. The three conserved positively charged residues deserve more significance because PAF and Anafp display a lower net positive charge (+5 and 0, respectively) than AFP (+9). The results obtained from the spectroscopical analysis of the AFP-nucleic acid interaction strongly suggest a particular role for the conserved Tyr-45 residue in the binding. In summary, the antifungal protein AFP can be considered as an OB fold-containing protein based on the similarities observed at the level of three-dimensional structure between AFP and these proteins. In addition, AFP exhibits the characteristic ability of this group of proteins to bind nucleic acids. This in vitro interaction of AFP with nucleic acids resulting from its OB fold structure strongly suggests that this ability is related to its physiological activity. The CSD is regularly found in proteins involved in translation initiation and in RNA turnover (for a review, see Ref. 32Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, the major cold shock protein from E. coli is a chaperone for mRNA during the cold shock response (33Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). AFP and α-sarcin appear in the extracellular medium of A. giganteus under a “shock” circumstance once the corn starch, the glucose source, is consumed (2Olson B.H. Jennings J.C. Roga V. Junek A.J. Schuurmans D.M. Appl. Microbiol. 1965; 13: 322-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and α-sarcin is related to the RNA structure (it is a highly specific cytotoxic ribonuclease degrading a single phosphodiester bond of the ribosomal RNA). In addition, it has been recently reported that the expression of the afp gene is up-regulated by heat shock upon growth in the presence of excess NaCl and ethanol and under conditions of carbon starvation (34Meyer V. Wedde M. Stahl U. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). AFP also interacts with phospholipid membranes (3Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A.M. Gasset M. Patiño B. Campos-Olivas R. Vázquez C. Martı́nez-Ruiz A. Mancheño J.M. Oñaderra M. Gavilanes J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other nucleic acid-binding proteins also interact with acidic phospholipids. This is the case for DnaA protein, the initiator of DNA replication in E. coli that specifically binds to oriC, the unique sequence for the initiation of the chromosomal DNA replication, and recruits other replication proteins (35Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 36Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This protein interacts with acidic phospholipids, and its activity seems to be regulated by membrane binding in cells (37Hase M. Yoshimi T. Ishikawa Y. Ohba A. Guo L. Mima S. Makise M. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28651-28656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since AFP is an extracellular protein, the potential involvement of its two binding abilities, to membranes and DNA, in its antifungal action should be considered. In regard to this, it has been reported that AFP completely inhibits the growth of phytopathogenic fungi in rice with no toxicity toward plant protoplasts (38Vila L. Lacadena V. Fontanet P. Martı́nez del Pozo A. San Segundo B. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and that heterologous expression of the afp gene enhanced fungal resistance in transgenic wheat (39Oldach K.H. Becker D. Lorz H. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 14: 832-838Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which opens the potential use of the afp gene to enhance crop protection against fungal pathogens in transgenic plants. Finally, the activity of AFP on promoting DNA condensation and interacting with lipid membranes may also be useful in designing non-viral gene delivery systems."

Mutant G95A displayed a rather low MDH activity, whereas mutant S97G was insensitive to activator protein but displayed ""fully activated"" MDH reaction rates. The various roles of these amino acid residues in coenzyme and/or cofactor NAD(H) binding in MDH are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2166711342,"In addition to being the universal carbon and energy source, glucose also regulates gene expression in many organisms.

Therefore the glucose repression defect of the snf3 rgt2 strain is indirect and is due to the lack of glucose uptake in this double mutant. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose has two major effects on gene transcription. First it represses expression of genes encoding enzymes for the metabolism of alternate sugars such as galactose and sucrose (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar, 2Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Google Scholar). Second it induces the transcription of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters required for efficient glucose metabolism (3Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Google Scholar, 4Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Google Scholar).Although the repressive effect of glucose on gene expression has been known for decades, the primary signal required for glucose repression remains unknown. Recent data indicate that glucose repression requires the uptake and metabolism of glucose (5Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Dam K.v. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Google Scholar, 22Lafuente M.J. Gancedo C. Jauniaux J.C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Google Scholar). Derepression of glucose-repressed genes (such as GAL1 andSUC2) in the absence of high concentrations of glucose requires the protein kinase Snf1 (6Zimmermann F.K. Kaufmann I. Rasenberger H.

Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar). Based on work carried out with the mammalian homologue of Snf1, the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), it has been suggested that changes in AMP:ATP ratio generate the signal for glucose repression (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 10Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Google Scholar, 11Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr.

Both proteins have similarities to glucose transporters and function as sensors of extracellular glucose. In the snf3 rgt2 double mutant, induction of HXT gene expression by glucose is completely abolished. As a consequence of this defect thesnf3 rgt2 strain is defective for glucose uptake and displays impaired growth on glucose-containing media. Interestingly, the snf3 rgt2 double mutant is also defective for glucose repression of GAL1 and SUC2 genes, indicating the requirement of these sensors for the glucose repression pathway (13Özcan S.

It demonstrates that the generation of the signal for glucose repression of gene expression requires the uptake and the metabolism of glucose. Furthermore, it shows that the induction of HXTgene expression by glucose is essential for the generation of the glucose repression signal.DISCUSSIONIn the yeast S. cerevisiae, glucose has both positive and negative regulatory effects on gene expression. While expression of the genes encoding glucose transporters such as theHXT genes is 10- to 300-fold induced by glucose, transcription of genes required for metabolism of alternate carbon sources such as GAL1 and SUC2 genes is inhibited by 10- to 1000-fold (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar, 2Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Google Scholar). The signal for induction of HXTgene expression by glucose is generated by two glucose sensors, Snf3 and Rgt2, and does not require the transport and metabolism of glucose (4Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Google Scholar, 12Özcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wölfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Google Scholar, 13Özcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Google Scholar). The nature of the primary signal mediating glucose repression of gene expression is unknown. Recent data indicate that the signal for glucose repression of gene expression is determined by the intracellular concentration of the glucose (5Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Dam K.v. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Google Scholar, 19Meijer M.C. Boonstra J. Verkleij A.J. Verrips C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24102-24107Google Scholar).It has been previously shown that the snf3 rgt2 double mutant, which is defective in induction of the HXT gene expression, is also defective in glucose repression of GAL1and SUC2 gene transcription (13Özcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Google Scholar, 14Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that Snf3 and Rgt2 may be also involved in generation of the glucose repression signal. Alternatively, it was possible that the glucose repression defect of the snf3 rgt2 mutant was due to diminished glucose uptake and metabolism in this mutant. In this report I demonstrate that the glucose repression defect of the snf3 rgt2 mutant is due to the lack of HXT gene expression in this mutant (Fig. 7). Consistent with this idea, a strain deleted for six of the HXT genes (hxt null), unable to grow on glucose due to lack of glucose transport, is also defective in glucose repression GAL1 andSUC2 genes. Furthermore, restoration of the glucose transport defect in the hxt null mutant by overexpression of Hxt1 glucose transporter restores the glucose repression defect. Similarly, overexpression of HXT1 from the ADH1promoter in the snf3 rgt2 double mutant restores the glucose repression but not the glucose induction defect of this mutant.In summary, these data indicate that repression and induction of gene expression by glucose is regulated by two different primary signals. While the glucose repression signal requires the uptake and metabolism of glucose, the glucose induction signal is generated in a receptor-mediated process. Furthermore, the glucose induction pathway is connected to the glucose repression pathway via the expression of glucose transporter (HXT) genes. The snf3 rgt2mutant, unable to induce the expression of the HXT genes is also defective in glucose repression of GAL1 andSUC2 genes.While Snf3 and Rgt2 sense extracellular glucose and generate the signal for induction of HXT gene expression, the nature of the intracellular signal and how it is transmitted from the cytoplasm into the nucleus is unknown. Recent data indicate that two homologues proteins, Mth1 and Std1, may be involved in the transmission of the signal from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. 1Sabire Özcan, unpublished data. Generation of the primary signal for glucose repression requires the uptake and metabolism of glucose; however the protein(s) involved in sensing the glycolytic flux remain to be identified. The protein kinase Snf1 has been shown to be essential for derepression of glucose-repressed genes (6Zimmermann F.K. Kaufmann I. Rasenberger H. Haubetamann P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 151: 95-103Google Scholar, 7Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 213-220Google Scholar, 8Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar). In a snf1 mutant, expression of GAL1 andSUC2 genes is repressed even in the absence of glucose. The mammalian homologue of Snf1, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to be regulated by the AMP:ATP ratio (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 10Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Google Scholar). Therefore it has been proposed that changes in the AMP:ATP ratio provide the signal for glucose repression (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar). Although it is known that switching yeast cells from high to low glucose causes increases in AMP levels; however, this increase appears to have no effect on Snf1 kinase activity in vitro (11Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Google Scholar).Transcription of genes coding for lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes in liver and/or adipose tissue is up-regulated by glucose. To generate the signal for this up-regulation, glucose needs to be metabolized. The signal metabolite required for induction of gene expression in the liver appears to be glucose-6 phosphate (20Foufelle F. Girard J. Ferre P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 323-328Google Scholar, 21Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Google Scholar). In yeast, repression of transcription by glucose also requires the transport and metabolism of glucose. Although, mutations in Hxk2, the major glucose-phosphorylating enzyme in yeast, lead to defects in glucose repression, recent data indicate that glucose-6 phosphate is not the signal metabolite in yeast. The signal for glucose repression in yeast appears to be upstream of glucose-6-phosphate (5Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Dam K.v. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Google Scholar, 19Meijer M.C. Boonstra J. Verkleij A.J. Verrips C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24102-24107Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose has two major effects on gene transcription. First it represses expression of genes encoding enzymes for the metabolism of alternate sugars such as galactose and sucrose (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Google Scholar, 2Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Google Scholar). Second it induces the transcription of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters required for efficient glucose metabolism (3Johnston M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 29-33Google Scholar, 4Özcan S. Johnston M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 554-569Google Scholar). Although the repressive effect of glucose on gene expression has been known for decades, the primary signal required for glucose repression remains unknown. Recent data indicate that glucose repression requires the uptake and metabolism of glucose (5Ye L. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Dam K.v. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4673-4675Google Scholar, 22Lafuente M.J. Gancedo C. Jauniaux J.C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Google Scholar). Derepression of glucose-repressed genes (such as GAL1 andSUC2) in the absence of high concentrations of glucose requires the protein kinase Snf1 (6Zimmermann F.K. Kaufmann I. Rasenberger H. Haubetamann P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 151: 95-103Google Scholar, 7Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 213-220Google Scholar, 8Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar). Based on work carried out with the mammalian homologue of Snf1, the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), it has been suggested that changes in AMP:ATP ratio generate the signal for glucose repression (9Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Google Scholar, 10Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Google Scholar, 11Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Google Scholar). The signal for glucose induction of hexose transporter (HXT) gene expression is generated by two membrane receptors, Snf3 and Rgt2 (12Özcan S. Dover J. Rosenwald A.G. Wölfl S. Johnston M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12428-12432Google Scholar, 13Özcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Google Scholar). Both proteins have similarities to glucose transporters and function as sensors of extracellular glucose. In the snf3 rgt2 double mutant, induction of HXT gene expression by glucose is completely abolished. As a consequence of this defect thesnf3 rgt2 strain is defective for glucose uptake and displays impaired growth on glucose-containing media. Interestingly, the snf3 rgt2 double mutant is also defective for glucose repression of GAL1 and SUC2 genes, indicating the requirement of these sensors for the glucose repression pathway (13Özcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Google Scholar, 14Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wölfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Google Scholar). This report provides evidence that two different signals are responsible for repression and induction of transcription by glucose in yeast. It demonstrates that the generation of the signal for glucose repression of gene expression requires the uptake and the metabolism of glucose.

Sulfhydryl modification of ion channels is a proven approach for studying their structure-function relationships; here we examined the effects of the hydrophilic sulfhydryl-modifying agents methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA+) and methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate (MTSES−) on wild-type (WT) and engineered HCN1 channels. External application of MTSEA+ to WT channels irreversibly reduced whole-cell currents (I MTSEA/I Control = 42 ± 2%), slowed activation and deactivation kinetics (∼7- and ∼3-fold at −140 and −20 mV, respectively), and produced hyperpolarizing shifts of steady-state activation (V12[MTSEA]=−125.8±9.0mVversusV12[control]=−76.4±1.6mV). Sequence inspection revealed the presence of five endogenous cysteines in the transmembrane domains of HCN1: three are putatively close to the extracellular milieu (Cys303, Cys318, and Cys347 in the S5, S5-P, and P segments, respectively), whereas the remaining two are likely to be cytoplasmic or buried. To identify the molecular constituent(s) responsible for the effects of MTSEA+, we mutated the three “external” cysteines individually to serine. C303S did not yield measurable currents. Whereas C347S channels remained sensitive to MTSEA+, C318S was not modified (I MTSEA/I Control = 101 ± 2%, V12(MTSEA)=−78.4±1.1 mV, and V12(Control)=−79.8±2.3 mV.

In this study, we established L6 cell lines either underexpressing or overexpressing PTPα by stable transfection of cells with antisense PTPα or with full-length wild-type human or mouse or double catalytic site Cys → Ala mutant (DM8) PTPα cDNA. Expression of PTPα in these cell lines was determined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Cells harboring antisense PTPα exhibited a significantly reduced growth rate and thymidine incorporation when compared with the wild-type L6 cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing PTPα showed more rapid (2-fold) proliferation. Myoblasts with diminished PTPα failed to undergo fusion and did not form myotubes in reduced serum whereas overexpression of PTPα promoted myogenesis 2 days earlier than wild-type L6 cells. Overexpression of phosphatase-inactive mutant PTPα recapitulated the phenotype of the antisense cells. The different myogenic activities of these cell lines were correlated with the expression of myogenin and creatine kinase activity. Consistent with previous reports, PTPα positively regulated the activity of the protein-tyrosine kinase Src. Treatment of L6 cells with PP2 or SU6656, specific inhibitors of Src family kinases, and transient transfection of dominant-inhibitory Src inhibited the formation of myotubes and expression of myogenin. Moreover, enhanced expression of PTPα and activation of Src was detected during myogenesis. Together, these data indicate that PTPα is involved in the regulation of L6 myoblast growth and skeletal muscle cell differentiation via an Src-mediated signaling pathway.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating various cellular events, including cell proliferation and differentiation (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). PTPs catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoryl groups on Tyr residues in proteins. Two classes of PTPs have been identified, the receptor-like, membrane-spanning PTPs, which may act as receptors, and the cytosolic PTPs characterized as intracellular low molecular weight enzymes (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). PTPα is a member of the receptor-like PTP family with a relatively short (123-amino acid) extracellular domain that is highly glycosylated (4Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like most transmembrane PTPs, PTPα has two homologous cytoplasmic catalytic domains: the domain proximal to the cell membrane, which exhibits the majority of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, and the second domain, which has low but detectable phosphatase activity (5Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PTPα is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and has been implicated in a variety of signaling pathways. It has been suggested that PTPα plays an important role in regulating insulin signaling. In baby hamster kidney cells, PTPα appeared to be a negative regulator of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, which transmits its signal by tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates-1 and -2 (7Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Hoppe E. Wiberg F.C. Sures I. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In GH4 pituitary cells, PTPα blocked the effect of insulin to increase prolactin gene expression (8Jacob K.K. Sap J. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4800-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Rat adipose cells overexpressing PTPα showed significantly lower insulin-stimulated levels of cell surface GLUT4 and a 3-fold decrease in insulin sensitivity (9Cong L.-N. Chen H. Li Y. Lin C.H. Sap J. Quon M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although, in the first study (7Moller N.P.H. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23126-23131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), PTPα overexpression decreased insulin receptor Tyr phosphorylation, the demonstration that the insulin receptor is a substrate of PTPα has not been a consistent finding (8Jacob K.K.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9792-9796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PTPα has also been suggested to be involved in Grb2-mediated signaling (11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Thus PTPα can be tyrosine-phosphorylated in its carboxyl-terminal domain (Tyr-789) forming a binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (6den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 12Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because PTPα·Grb2 complexes have been isolated but are not associated with the exchange factor mSOS, the function of this binding is not clear (6den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PTPα may also participate in the activation of MAPK and the c-Jun transcription factor (13Zheng X.M. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23302-23309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, p130cas, which is localized to focal adhesions, has been shown to interact with and be a substrate for PTPα (14Buist A. Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G.J. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20754-20761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The most clearly defined substrate of PTPα is the protein-tyrosine kinase Src (pp60c-Src) (15den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W.

PTPα activates Srcin vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of PTPα leads to the dephosphorylation and activation of cytoplasmic Src (15den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J.

Cancer Lett. 1995; 93: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) where Src is commonly found to be activated. Furthermore, PTPα null cells (PTPα−/− cells) derived from PTPα knock-out mice have greatly reduced Src kinase activity and are defective in cell adhesion and spreading, all of which are restored upon ectopic expression of PTPα (18Ponniah S. Wang D.Z.M. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 19Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Regulation of Src activity by PTPα is believed to occur by the dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory Tyr site (Tyr-527) of Src (16Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that the binding of the Src SH2 domain to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal Tyr-789 in PTPα results in displacement of Src pTyr-527 from the SH2 domain, thus allowing PTPα to dephosphorylate pTyr-527, and thereby specifically activating Src (20Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PTPα has been shown to play a role in both cellular differentiation and cellular transformation. Thus overexpression of PTPα in rat embryo fibroblasts caused transformation, whereas in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells this induced neuronal differentiation (15den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M.

Science. 1986; 234: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of PTPα enhanced the development of neurotransmitter response during neuronal differentiation (23Yang X.H. Seow K.T. Bahri S.M. Oon S.H. Chia W. Cell. 1991; 67: 661-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and an up-regulated expression of PTPα was observed during differentiation of embryonic stem cells into a neuronal phenotype (24Van Inzen W.G.

Differentiation of skeletal muscle precursor cells is a highly ordered multistep process initiated in response to a number of environmental signals (25Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Extensive studies of this process have demonstrated that it involves expression of muscle regulatory factors, withdrawal from the cell cycle, induction of muscle-specific gene expression, and changes of the cytoskeleton into specialized structures. Morphologically, muscle differentiation is characterized by cell alignment, elongation, fusion, and formation of multinucleated myotubes. This process is accompanied by an increase in the expression of muscle-specific proteins such as myogenin, myosin heavy chain, and creatine kinase (25Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Some hormones and growth factors, in particular IGF-1 (26Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacin M.

Physiol. 2001; 186: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), appear to stimulate differentiation through various signal transduction pathways. Thus, activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is associated with and appears to be required for muscle differentiation (29Tamir Y. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34424-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol.

On the other hand, the specific noncompetitive inhibitor of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MAPK kinase), PD098059, partially inhibited the fusion of myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes without affecting the expression of muscle-specific markers (32Gredinger E.

In this study, L6 cells were transfected with either PTPα antisense, with full-length human or mouse wild type, or double catalytic site Cys to Ala phosphatase-dead mutant PTPα cDNA with the ultimate aim of examining the effects of PTPα on insulin metabolic effects. During these studies we observed unexpected alterations in cell growth and myogenic differentiation. Thus, although cells harboring PTPα antisense displayed diminished PTPα protein and exhibited a slowed growth rate, overexpressing PTPα enhanced cell growth. More significantly, the PTPα antisense myoblasts were incapable of fully differentiating into myotubes, progressing only to alignment in low serum-containing medium that promoted wild-type L6 cells to fully differentiate. In contrast, overexpression of PTPα accelerated myotube formation and differentiation. Overexpression of mutant phosphatase-dead PTPα resulted in a phenotype similar to that of antisense consistent with a dominant-negative effect. As reported previously, the extent of PTPα expression and activity correlated with dephosphorylation of pTyr-527 and activation of Src. Moreover, inhibition of Src kinase activity with an Src kinase family-specific inhibitor, PP2, completely blocked the formation of myotubes in L6 cells and in the cells overexpressing PTPα. These data indicate that a PTPα-c-Src signaling pathway is involved in the process of myogenesis. The anti-PTPα antibody was prepared by injecting rabbits with a GST-PTPα cytoplasmic domain fusion protein. The Myogenin (M-225), SRC2, Src (N16), and FAK antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), Src (GD11) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-myosin heavy chain (MF-20) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Nitrocellulose membrane Hybond-C, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and the ECL reagents were obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. [3H]Thymidine (70–90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. G418 was obtained from Invitrogen. Inhibitors PP2, SU6656, SB203580, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Human insulin was a kind gift from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). The spontaneously fusing rat skeletal muscle cell line L6, a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada), was used as the parent strain for all transfection experiments. Full-length rat PTPα (kindly provided by Dr. B. Goldstein, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) (33Ding W. Zhang W.R. Sullivan K. Hashimoto N. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was cloned into PKK233–2 (Clontech) and cleaved with EcoRI andBamHI yielding two fragments of 697 bp (bp 722–1419) and 917 bp (bp 1419–2336). The blunt-ended fragments were cloned into theEcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 containing the SV40 promoter and neomycin resistance gene. The orientation of the inserts was determined by restriction digestion and sequencing. PTPα underexpression was accomplished by transfecting cells with the plasmids containing antisense −917 cDNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure, and colonies were selected with G418. PTPα overexpression was achieved by co-transfecting cells with pMJ30 that contained full-length mouse or human PTPα cDNA (34Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and pcDNA3.1. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3 alone or untransfected (referred to herein as L6) and used as controls. The α12 cell line, PTPα overexpressing L6 cells in which L6 were obtained from ATCC, have been described previously (12Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dominant-negative (DN)-Src cDNA containing two point mutations, K296R and Y528F, in pUSEamp Upstate Biotechnology Inc. or empty vector was co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression vector (Clontech) using the Effectene kit (Qiagen) into parental L6 cells and L6 cells overexpressing PTPα according to the manufacturer's instructions. L6 cells were grown and maintained as myoblasts in α-minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotics in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described (35Tsiani E. Ramlal T. Leiter L. Klip A. Fantus I.G. Endocrinol. 1995; 136: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were maintained as above with the addition of 400 μg/ml G418. Cell differentiation into myotubes was induced by reducing the serum concentration in the medium to 2% FBS. For cell growth rate and cell differentiation studies, cells were plated in six-well plates and grown in medium with or without addition of inhibitors. Cell numbers at various days after cell seeding were counted after trypsinization. Cell differentiation was observed after Giemsa staining under a microscope (LEITZ LABORLUX S) linked to a JVC color video camera head (model TK-1280U) and photographed with a computer program, Leica Q500MC. Fusion indices were measured as described previously (36Lee K.H. Kim D.G. Shin N.Y. Song W.K. Kwon H. Chung C.H. Kang M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The extent of myoblast fusion was expressed as the number of fused, multinucleated cells as a percentage of the total number of cells in ten randomly chosen fields. Cells containing more than two nuclei were regarded as fused cells. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was performed as described previously (37Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, myoblasts of L6 and transfected lines were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS to 30–40% confluence. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in α-MEM containing 0.1% FBS (serum-deprived) followed by addition of 20% FBS or 10−7m insulin for 24 h. [3H]Thymidine (0.67 μCi/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for 18 h. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were solubilized with 200 μl of 0.1% SDS, and the lysates were collected and precipitated with 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 30 min) the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Creatine kinase activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using a diagnostic kit (Sigma). Briefly, day 4, 6, and 8 cultures grown in differentiation medium were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped. Cells were spun at 1000 ×g and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated on ice for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Protein content in the samples was then adjusted to 0.4 μg/μl with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and, typically, 100 μl of sample was used for creatine kinase assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of the enzyme was determined by measuring the absorbance at 510 nm and expressed as units/mg protein. A unit of creatine kinase activity was defined as (ΔA 510 units/min·1000)/6.22 (extinction coefficient). Culture plates (160-mm) were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and scraped. The cell suspension was spun down and homogenized in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 7.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μm pepstatin A. Insoluble cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. After determination of protein content, extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in Tris buffered saline with Tween (TBST; 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk powder for 1 h. After washing with fresh TBST, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed with TBST for 1 h and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST the immunoreactive bands were revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intensity of the bands was determined by scanning the bands using a Vivitar scanner (model VSF-200) and appropriate software. For the study of the association of Src with its substrate, FAK, FAK was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cell lysate with a polyclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and were washed twice with a solution containing 500 mm LiCl3, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and then washed twice with Buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein samples were separated and immunoblotted as above. Cells grown on glass coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine were washed with PBS and fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS for 5 min and permeabilized with a solution containing 10% normal goat serum (Vector) and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (1:100 in normal goat serum solution) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with secondary antibody, Cy3 anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:400 in normal goat serum solution), and the coverslips were light-protected by wrapping in foil. After washing with PBS four times, the glass coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Cells were viewed with appropriate filter blocks for fluorescein, and images were acquired with use of the DeltaVision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Results are expressed as means ± S.E., and the Student's t test or analysis of variance was used to evaluate significance, which was taken as a minimum ofp < 0.05. Stable transfectants of L6 cells with underexpression and overexpression of PTPα were established. Underexpression of PTPα was achieved by transfection of wild-type L6 cells with PTPα antisense cDNA, whereas overexpression was obtained by transfecting cells with either a full-length mouse or human PTPα cDNA (38Su J. Yang L.T. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28086-28096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the transfection on the expression of PTPα was assessed by immunoblotting of PTPα. Whole cell extracts isolated from different lines at day 5 in culture were used. In addition to the PTPα band at 130 kDa (34Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), a second band with a larger molecular weight, the glycosylated form of PTPα (4Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also detected with our antibodies (Fig.1, A and B). In comparison to untransfected L6 cells, densitometric analysis of the PTPα bands from cells transfected with antisense PTPα, cell lines AS14 and AS22, showed that expression of PTPα was about 30 and 50%, respectively, of the level in L6 cells (Fig. 1 C). In cell lines WT5 and M4 from cells overexpressing human or mouse PTPα, PTPα protein content was increased about 3- and 5-fold, respectively, when compared with L6 cells (Fig. 1 C). The different expression of PTPα in these cell lines was further examined using immunofluorescence staining and deconvolution microscopy. Cells harboring PTPα antisense or overexpressing PTPα were grown on glass coverslips and stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against PTPα. As shown in Fig. 1 D, PTPα was distributed widely but more concentrated in the perinuclear area. There was no nuclear staining. The intensity of staining of PTPα in AS14 was decreased markedly when compared with that in L6, whereas it was much higher in M4 than that in L6, consistent with the immunoblot results (Fig.1 D). To determine the effects of the expression of PTPα on cell proliferation, equal amounts (105 cells/well) of cells were plated and cultured in the presence of 10% FBS. The medium was changed at 48-h intervals, and cells were trypsinized and counted at the indicated times. After a 4-day lag there was a rapid increase in cell number from day 4 to 6 with a plateau at day 7 (Fig.2 A). M4 and α12, both overexpressing PTPα, showed significantly faster proliferation than L6 cells. Cell numbers in these lines were already increased above control L6 after 4 days in culture and were more than 2-fold greater by day 6. In contrast, cells harboring either antisense PTPα or double mutant PTPα, AS14, AS22, and DM8, grew significantly more slowly than L6, and cell numbers remained at about 50% of L6 from day 5 onwards (Fig. 2 A). The growth rate of L6 cells transfected with an empty vector PC10 was similar to untransfected L6 cells. We further investigated the rate of proliferation by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, an indirect measure of proliferation. In comparison with L6 cells, basal levels of DNA synthesis were significantly lower in cells harboring antisense PTPα, and, in contrast, cells overexpressing PTPα exhibited a considerable increase (data not shown). Stimulation of control L6 cells with either 20% serum or with 10−7m insulin caused a 2-fold increase in the level of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Treatment of AS14 cells with serum or insulin induced an increase in DNA synthesis significantly lower than in L6 cells (70% of L6; see Fig. 2 B) (p < 0.05). On the other hand, [3H]thymidine incorporation observed in M4 cells was ∼170% of control L6 in response to serum or insulin (Fig.2 B). In conjunction with differences observed in the growth rate of cell lines harboring antisense PTPα and overexpressing PTPα, we examined the capacity of these cells to differentiate into myotubes. Wild-type L6 myoblasts (70–80% confluent) transferred to α-MEM containing 2% FBS began to form multinucleated myotubes after 4–5 days in culture (Fig. 3) and reached the maximum (near 100% fusion) by day 9 (Fig. 3 B). Cells transfected with either antisense PTPα or with the phosphatase-dead double mutant PTPα showed alignment at day 5 but failed to fuse into myotubes (Fig.3 A). This apparent lack of differenti"
https://openalex.org/W1493466607,"Abstract Mycobacterium marinum, like a number of nonphotosynthetic microorganisms, produces only traces of carotenoids when grown in the dark. On illumination, the dark grown bacteria synthesize substantial amounts of carotenoids de novo. This study shows that antimycin A can also induce the synthesis of carotenoids in M. marinum in the absence of light. The amounts of carotenoids synthesized are proportional to the amount of antimycin A added; for maximal carotenogenesis, a concentration of 37.5 µm is required. Antimycin A is 300 to 400% more effective than saturating amounts of light in the induction of carotenoid synthesis. The effects of light and antimycin A are additive. Chromatography of the carotenoid pigments reveals that the same polyenes are synthesized regardless of the means of induction—light alone, antimycin A in the dark, or antimycin A plus light. Evidence is presented that both light and antimycin A act by inducing protein synthesis (carotenogenic enzymes). In the antimycin A-induced system protein synthesis continues for more than 20 hours. In the light-induced system, on the other hand, protein synthesis continues for 4 hours and then stops. However, a second illumination at this time can lead to a resumption of protein synthesis. Inasmuch as the inductive effects of light and antimycin A are additive, it is concluded that the sites of action of light and antimycin A are different. Antimycin A may act either as an inducer for the synthesis of carotenogenic enzymes or by inactivating a repressor. Light may have an analogous role but at a different site; it may act either by photo-oxidizing a repressor or by producing a photo-oxidized metabolite which can act as an inducer for the synthesis of carotenogenic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2079537646,"The epididymis is a useful model system to understand the mechanisms that govern region-specific gene expression, as many gene products display spatially restricted expression within this organ. However, surprisingly little is known about how this regulation is achieved. Here, we report regulatory sequences from thePem homeobox gene that drive expression in different subregions of the mouse epididymis in vivo. We found that the 0.3-kb 5′-flanking sequence (region I) from the Pemproximal promoter (Pem Pp) was sufficient to confer androgen-dependent and developmentally regulated expression in the caput region of the epididymis. Expression was restricted to the normal regions of expression of Pem in the caput (segments 2–4), but there was also aberrant expression in the corpus region. This corpus misexpression was extinguished when 0.6 kb of Pem Pp5′-flanking sequence was included in the transgene, indicating that one or more negative regulatory elements exist between 0.6 and 0.3 kb upstream of the Pem Pp start site (region II). When heterologous sequences were introduced upstream of the Pem Pp, expression was further restricted, mainly to caput segment 3, implying that the Pem Pp has segment-specific regulatory elements. To our knowledge, the regulatory regions we have identified are the shortest so far defined that dictate regionally localized expression in the epididymis in vivo. They may be useful for identifying the factors that regulate region-specific expression in the epididymis, for expressing and conditionally knocking out genes in different subregions of the epididymis, for treating male infertility, and for generating novel methods of male contraception.

The adult epididymis is a highly convoluted tubule divided into three different regions: the caput, the corpus, and the cauda. These regions are further organized into infra-regional segments divided by connective tissue called septula. This regionalization creates different luminal fluid environments that probably play a crucial role regulating sperm motility and fertilizing capacity within the caput and corpus, and storing mature spermatozoa in the cauda. The function and identity of each region are thought to be dictated by the particular constellation of proteins expressed in each region. For example, cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic (Cres) 1The abbreviations used are: Cres, cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic; mE-Rabp, murine epdidymal retinoic acid-binding protein; Gpx-5, glutathione peroxidase-5; Crisp-1, cysteine-rich secretory protein-1; Spg2, sulfated glycoprotein-2; Pem Pp, Pem proximal promoter; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; tet, tetracycline-regulated; BGH, bovine growth hormone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; ARE, androgen response element; AR, androgen receptor; nt, nucleotide(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is restricted to the proximal end of the caput region, where it probably acts as a protease inhibitor that regulates proprotein processing (1Cornwall G.A.

The subject of this report, the proximal promoter (Pem Pp), is expressed exclusively in the male reproductive tissues epididymis and testis. Expression of the Pem Pp is restricted to somatic cells in the caput region of the epididymis and Sertoli cells in the testis (14Maiti S. Doskow J. Li S. Nhim R.P. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. J.

In both the mouse and rat epididymis, Pem transcripts are dramatically up-regulated between day 20 and 30 postpartum, suggesting thatPem Pp transcription is developmentally regulated in this organ (12Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 471-484Google Scholar, 13Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 975-983Google Scholar). Experiments in gonadotropin-deficient rats have demonstrated that Pem expression in the epididymis requires androgen (13Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 975-983Google Scholar), as does Pem expression in both mouse and rat Sertoli cells (12Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 471-484Google Scholar, 16Sutton K.A. Maiti S.

In this study, we report the identification of Pem Pp5′-flanking sequences sufficient to direct the normal pattern of expression of Pem in vivo. Analysis of transgenic mice containing different lengths of Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence revealed that a 0.3-kb region immediately upstream of thePem Pp transcription start site is sufficient to confer high levels of androgen-dependent and developmentally regulated expression in the caput region of the epididymis. We also identified another 0.3-kb regulatory region just upstream of this that restricts expression to the caput region by preventing expression in the corpus region. Lastly, introduction of heterologous sequences upstream of thePem Pp generated an expression pattern that suggested that the Pem Pp contains elements that control expression in individual segments within the caput region. Our study is the first to indicate that multiple regulatory elements collaborate to generate regionally localized patterns of expression in the epididymis. All experiments were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of animals. Castration was performed through the abdominal route to mice anesthesized with light isoflurane (as recommended by the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center animal care committee). Testosterone replacement was accomplished by subcutaneously inserting 0.5-cm-long testosterone capsules made from SILASTIC brand tubing (number 602-305, Dow Corning, Midland, MD) as described previously (23Ewing L.L. Gorski R.A. Sbordone R.J. Tyler J.V. Desjardins C. Robaire B. Biol. Reprod. 1979; 21: 765-772Google Scholar, 24Kangasniemi M. Wilson G. Parchuri N. Huhtaniemi I. Meistrich M.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2881-2888Google Scholar). Male mice 6–8 weeks old were divided into three groups for sham, castrated, and castrated plus testosterone treatment for a duration of 7 days. The animals were then sacrificed, and their epididymides were collected. The Pem-121transgene was made in three steps. First, a fragment containing the mouse Pem Pp transcription start site and 0.6-kb 5′-flanking sequence was subcloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript (KS+). This fragment was generated by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using the primers mPem-L and mPem-M (TableI), which correspond to mousePem exons 2 and 6, respectively. Second, tetracycline-regulated (tet) promoter sequences excised from pUHC13–3 (25Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) using SalI were subcloned at the SalI site just upstream of the 0.6-kb Pem 5′-flanking sequences. Third, the bovine growth hormone 3′-untranslated and polyadenylation region (BGH pA), obtained by partial digestion of pGKneocbpA (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Matzuk, Baylor College of Medicine) with BclI and NotI, was ligated downstream of Pem at the BamHI andNotI sites. Pem-213 was made by subcloning a 4.8-kb SalI/NotI fragment from Pem-121 (containing Pem sequences and the BGH pA region but without tet promoter sequences) into pGem-11Zf (Promega Inc.).Pem-214 was made by subcloning a 4.5-kbEcoRV/NotI fragment from Pem-213(containing 0.3-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequences, Pem coding exons and introns, and the BGH pA region) into KS+. Pem-212was made by subcloning 0.6-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequences into EGFP-hMT2A-N1 (kindly provided by Dr. Gilbert Cote) at theAseI and KpnI sites. This fragment, which encompasses −655 to −1 with respect to the Pem start ATG in exon 3, was generated by PCR from Pem-121 using the primers MDA-654 and -758 (Table I). EGFP-hMT2A-N1 is identical with EGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) except that it has hMT2A intron 1 inserted in the EGFP coding region at nt 898.Table IOligonucleotideNameOrientationSequencemPem-LSense5′ GTG GAC AAG AGG AAG CAC AAA 3′mPem-MAntisense5′ GGG AAT CCA CCT CTT TAT TGC 3′MDA-654Antisense5′ GAATGGTACCACCCTGAATAGGATCAATGATG 3′MDA-758Sense5′ CACGATTAATGTGGACAAGAGGAAGCAC 3′MDA-870Sense5′ ATCACATATGCCGGCTATGAC 3′MDA-871Antisense5′ GCTGGTTCTTTCCGCCTCAGA 3′MDA-981Sense5′ ATAAGGATCCAGGGAGTTCTCACCTCTG 3′MDA-982Antisense5′ ATTAAAGCTTAGCAGGACCATGTGATCG 3′ Open table in a new tab To generate transgenic mice, the transcription units from each of the four constructs were excised with restriction enzymes that uniquely cut at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the transcription units, gel-purified, and injected into the male pronuclei of c57/Bl6 mouse embryos. ThreePem-121 (121.2, 121.5, 121.7), twoPem-213 (213.6, 213.10), threePem-214 (214.8, 214.9, 214.10), and three Pem-212 (212.3. 212.9, 212.12) founder mice were generated, as assessed by PCR of tail DNA using the primers MDA-981 and MDA-982 for Pem-212 and MDA-870 and MDA-871 for all other transgenic constructs (Table I). Mouse testes were fixed in Bouin's solution (Sigma) overnight at room temperature. Samples were destained with 1m saturated Li2CO3 in 80% ethanol until the dye was no longer visible. After dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol, the tissues were embedded in paraffin wax, and 4-μm tissue sections were cut and mounted on siliconized slides. The paraffin sections were dewaxed with xylene followed by absolute ethanol, hydrated in decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The samples were treated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase and then rinsed with PBS. A protein-blocking solution containing 3% normal goat serum was applied to the sections for at least 30 min at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at room temperature in a humidified chamber with antibody in 1× PBS containing 1% normal goat serum. The samples were incubated with either polyclonal antisera against Pem (kindly provided by Dr. Carol MacLeod), Cres (kindly provided by Dr. Gail Cornwall; Ref.1Cornwall G.A. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Hann S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1653-1664Google Scholar), Sgp2 (kindly provided by Michael Griswold; Ref. 26Sensibar J.A. Qian Y. Griswold M.D. Sylvester S.R. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Lee C. Biol.

The slides were then rinsed with PBS, incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 45 min at room temperature, rinsed again with PBS, incubated with ABC solution (Vectastain ABC kit) for 30 min, rinsed again with PBS, incubated with diaminobenzidine for 2–10 min, rinsed with distilled water, and counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma). The sections were then mounted with Permount and examined by bright-field microscopy. Low magnification images of epididymides were acquired using Sprint Scan 35 (Polaroid Inc.) and Path Scan enabler (Meyer Instruments, Houston, TX). Total tissue RNA was isolated as described previously by guanidinium isothiocynate lysis and centrifugation over a 5.7 m CsCl cushion (27Wilkinson M. Brown T.A. Essential Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 69-88Google Scholar). RNA was analyzed by RNase protection analysis, performed as described previously (12Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 471-484Google Scholar). Probe A, which contains 61 nt ofPem exon 6 and 250 nt of the BGH 3′-untranslated region, was generated by digesting Pem-121 with NdeI. Probe B, which contains 92 nt of Pem 3′-untranslated region, was generated by digesting a plasmid containing mouse PemcDNA (Pem-27) with MslI. Probe C, which contains nt 482–693 (with respect to the ATG) of the GFP coding region, was amplified by PCR using the template Pem-212 and the primers MDA-981 and MDA-982 (Table I). The β-actin probe contains nt 135–169 of human β-actin exon 3 (GenBankTM accession number X00351). A set of RNA size markers generated from the century ladder template (Ambion, Inc.) was included in all gels. We showed previously that the Pem Pp is expressed in rodent epididymides and testes in a developmentally regulated manner (12Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev.

Pem expression in the mouse epididymis is restricted to the caput region (17Rao M. Wilkinson M.F. Robaire B. Hinton B.T. The Epididymis: From Molecules to Clinical Practice. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2002: 269-283Google Scholar, 22Pitman J.L. Lin T.P. Kleeman J.E. Erickson G.F. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 196-214Google Scholar). In the study reported here we set out to identifyPem Pp regulatory sequences that provide its region-specific and developmentally regulated expression pattern in the epididymis. Toward this goal, we generated a transgene containing 0.6-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequences upstream of Pem coding exons and introns (Fig. 1A). Two independent transgenic mice lines were generated that contained thisPem-213 transgene: Pem-213.6 andPem-213.10. RNase protection analysis with a transgene-specific probe (probe A) demonstrated that both of these transgenic mouse lines expressed the transgene in epididymis and testis but not any other tissues that we tested, including brain, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, thymus, tongue, skin, and vas deferens (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Analysis with a probe that distinguishes between transgene and endogenous Pemtranscripts (probe B) demonstrated that the level of transgene mRNA in epididymides from Pem-213.10 mice was ∼50-fold higher than that of endogenous Pem mRNA (data not shown). Expression of endogenous Pem transcripts was not significantly altered in the transgenic mice (data not shown), indicating that the Pem protein expressed from the transgene did not autoregulate its own promoter. There was a dramatic increase in mRNA expression from the transgene between days 20 and 30 postpartum in epididymides from Pem-213.10 mice (Fig. 1C), which is the same expression pattern as that from the endogenous Pem gene (12Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 471-484Google Scholar). We conclude from these results that the 0.6-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence is sufficient to direct high levels of expression in the epididymis in a normal developmentally regulated manner. To examine whether 0.6-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence is also sufficient to drive caput-specific expression, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on serial cross-sections of the epididymis by using a Pem polyclonal antisera shown previously to specifically recognize Pem protein (16Sutton K.A. Maiti S. Tribley W.A. Lindsey J.S. Meistrich M.L. Bucana C.D. Sanborn B.M. Joseph D.R. Griswold M.D. Cornwall G.A. Wilkinson M.F. J. Androl. 1998; 19: 21-30Google Scholar, 22Pitman J.L. Lin T.P. Kleeman J.E. Erickson G.F. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 196-214Google Scholar, 28Lin T.P. Labosky P.A. Grabel L.B. Kozak C.A. Pitman J.L. Kleeman J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 170-179Google Scholar). In agreement with Pitman et al. (22Pitman J.L. Lin T.P. Kleeman J.E. Erickson G.F. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 196-214Google Scholar), we found that nontransgenic mice expressed Pem only in the caput region and that Pem was restricted to less than 5% of the somatic cells within the tubules in this region (Fig. 2A).Pem-213.10 transgenic mice recapitulated this caput-specific expression pattern (Fig. 2C) and expressed Pem in a much higher percentage of the cells in this region than in littermate controls (Fig. 2B). The greater percentage of cells expressing Pem is consistent with our finding thatPem-213.10 mice expressed ∼50-fold higher levels of transgene mRNA than they do endogenous Pem mRNA. As with the nontransgenic littermate controls, Pem-213transgenic mice expressed Pem protein only in principal cells (not in basal or clear cells) (Fig. 2B) within the caput region. No Pem protein was observed in the corpus (Fig. 2C) or cauda (data not shown). Within the caput, we found that Pem expression was restricted to segments 2–4 in Pem-213.10 mice (Fig. 2C). This same segment-specific expression pattern was also observed inPem-213.6 mice and control littermates (data not shown). We judged the position of the segments in our sections based on 1) the natural septula between the segments, 2) known differences in cell size in different segments, and 3) by using Cres and Sgp2 as markers. In agreement with its reported expression pattern (1Cornwall G.A. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Hann S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1653-1664Google Scholar), we found that Cres expression was highest in segment 1 (the initial segment), at intermediate levels in segment 2 (the most proximal segment that expresses Pem), and at trace levels in more distal segments where it is probably deposited by luminal fluid (Fig. 2C). Sgp2, which is also a secreted protein, was present on spermatozoa and the luminal walls of somatic epididymal cells in caput segments 3–5 and the corpus (Fig. 2C), similar to its localization in the rat (26Sensibar J.A. Qian Y. Griswold M.D. Sylvester S.R. Bardin C.W. Cheng C.Y. Lee C. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 49: 233-242Google Scholar, 29Hermo L. Brian K. Oko R. Anat. Rec. 1994; 240: 327-344Google Scholar,30Law G.L. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 669-679Google Scholar). In contrast to its rather ubiquitous presence as a secreted protein, Sgp2 was only present in the cytoplasm of some somatic cells in segments 3 and 4 (thus, it overlapped with Pem in these segments) and in a few cells in segment 5 (not observable at the magnification shown in Fig. 2C). We interpret this as indicating that Sgp2 is primarily secreted by cells in segments 3 and 4 and that its presence in more distal regions is mainly the result of luminal deposition. Based on this analysis using Sgp2 and Cres as markers, we conclude that the 0.6-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence directs Pem expression to its normal site of expression in segments 2–4 of the caput epididymis. To further map the regulatory regions essential for epididymis expression, we generated thePem-214 transgene, which contains only 0.3-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence (Fig. 3A). Analysis of two independent Pem-214 transgenic lines (Pem-214.8and Pem-214.10) showed that like Pem-213 mice,Pem-214 mice expressed the transgene specifically in epididymis and testis (Fig. 3B; other tissues tested but not shown are brain, kidney, lung, muscle, thymus, tongue, skin, and vas deferens). Both transgenic lines expressed much higher levels of transgene mRNA than endogenous Pem mRNA in the epididymis (60–130-fold higher levels, based on RNase protection analysis with probe B; data not shown). The transgene displayed a normal pattern of developmentally regulated expression (Fig. 3C). To determine whether this 0.3-kb Pem Pp 5′-flanking sequence also directs region-specific expression, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on epididymal sections fromPem-214 mice. We found that, like Pem-213 mice,Pem-214 mice expressed Pem protein in segments 2–4 (Fig. 2,D and E). Although we consistently observed expression in segments 2–4 in all Pem-214 mice that we checked, we noted that individual transgenic mice displayed differences in the number of cells that expressed Pem, particularly in segment 4 (compare Fig. 2, D and E). Surprisingly, unlikePem-213 mice, Pem-214 mice also expressed Pem in the corpus epididymis (Fig. 2, D–F). This strongly suggests that there are at least two regulatory regions in the Pem Pp5′-flanking sequence that control region-specific expression in the epididymis (Fig. 3D). The 0.3-kb region immediately proximal to the Pem Pp transcription start site (region I) is a positive regulatory region that contains sequences necessary to drivePem expression in regions 2–4 of the caput in a normal developmentally regulated manner. The more distal 0.3-kb region with respect to the Pem Pp transcription start site (region II) contains one or more negative regulatory elements that prevent inappropriate Pem expression in the corpus."
https://openalex.org/W2079136503,"The small transmembrane E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus (BPV) transforms cells by forming a stable complex with and activating the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGFβR). The E5/PDGFβR interaction is thought to involve specific physical contacts between the transmembrane domains of the two proteins. Lys<sup>499</sup> at the extracellular juxtamembrane position and Thr<sup>513</sup> within the transmembrane domain of the PDGFβR are required for the interaction and are predicted to contact analogously positioned residues in the E5 protein. Here, mutagenic analysis of the transmembrane region of the PDGFβR was performed to further characterize the nature of the E5/PDGFβR interaction. We show that the receptor transmembrane domain, with minimal extracellular and intracellular sequence, is sufficient for the interaction. In addition, we provide evidence that the polar nature of Thr<sup>513</sup> as well as its positioning along the transmembrane α-helix is important for the interaction. We also identify the receptor transmembrane amino acids Ile<sup>506</sup> and Leu<sup>520</sup> as additional requirements for the interaction. Because Lys<sup>499</sup>, Thr<sup>513</sup>, Ile<sup>506</sup>, and Leu<sup>520</sup> all align along the same face of the predicted PDGFβR transmembrane α-helix, our data support the model that the PDGFβR contacts the E5 protein via multiple amino acids along a single α-helical interface."

https://openalex.org/W2061430251,"Abstract ς38 is a non-essential but highly homologous member of the ς70 family of transcription factors. In vitro mutagenesis and in vivo screening were used to identify 22 critical amino acids in the promoter interaction domain of Escherichia coliς38. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies showed that residues involved in duplex DNA binding largely segregated into distinct regions that coincided with those of ς70. However, the majority of these amino acids were in non-conserved positions. Analysis indicates that this region of the two ςs probably has a common overall organization but differs in how its amino acids are used to form functional open complexes. Placement of the mutations on the known ς70 holoenzyme structure shows two clusters; one appears to be used for duplex DNA recognition and the other for the subsequent isomerization events.

https://openalex.org/W1509209363,"Abstract The synthesis of ribonucleic acid, catalyzed by highly purified preparations of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase under the direction of native calf thymus DNA, was powerfully inhibited by high molecular weight fractions obtained from extracts of steroid-induced and noninduced Pseudomonas testosteroni by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. When heat-treated DNA was used as primer, the inhibitory effect of these macromolecular fractions was no longer observed. Likewise, polyadenylate formation catalyzed by the polymerase was not affected by the macromolecular fractions with either native or heat-denatured DNA as a primer. The major components of the macromolecular fractions are DNA, RNA, and protein. Analysis of the mechanism of this inhibitory effect on RNA synthesis revealed that it was probably not the result of the breakdown of input nucleoside triphosphates or the breakdown of the product RNA. The inhibitory activity of the macromolecular fractions was greatly enhanced upon heating. The inhibition was observed when the system was saturated with primer DNA, and also when the inhibitor was added after exposure of the enzyme to primer DNA. Contrary to the reports of others, our study showed that the inhibitory activity of the macromolecular fraction derived from noninduced cells was not reversed by prior incubation with testosterone. Furthermore, no quantitative difference was observed between the inhibitory potency of macromolecular fractions derived from steroid-induced and noninduced cells. These results do not support the claim that experiments of this type permit direct demonstration of changes by enzyme inducers of the priming capacity of DNA for RNA synthesis."

Commun. 1997; 235: 79-82Google Scholar, 3Boss O. Samec S. Paoloni-Giacobino A. Rossier C. Dulloo A. Seydoux J. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between UCP1 and UCP3 suggested to us that UCP3, like UCP1, might be a mitochondrial uncoupling protein involved in adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure in muscle. Moreover, biochemical experiments based on the overexpression of UCP3 in yeast or reconstituted transport activity of UCP3 in liposomes have confirmed the uncoupling activity of the UCP3 protein (4Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Mootha V.K. Slieker L.J. Lowell B.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 129-134Google Scholar, 5Bouillaud F. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1999; 23: S19-S23Google Scholar). Furthermore, a correlation between the increase in UCP3 protein in skeletal muscle and the nonphosphorylating mitochondrial respiration rates was demonstrated in rats by modulating their metabolic status via triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Despite accumulating evidence that UCP3 plays a role as a mitochondrial uncoupling protein, UCP3 does not appear to be involved in adaptive thermogenesis in rodents in response to cold exposure and diet. Moreover, the role of UCP3 in energy expenditure and uncoupling effect is subject to controversy. First, homozygousUCP3 −/− mice lacked the obese phenotype and displayed an unchanged metabolic rate in response to cold exposure, fasting, stress, or T3 (6Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16258-16266Google Scholar, 7Gong D.W. Monemdjou S. Gavrilova O. Leon L.R.

Second, transgenic mice overexpressing human UCP3 (hUCP3) in skeletal muscle are hyperphagic and nonobese with increased energy expenditure (8Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C.

Harper A.J. Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Brand M.D. Abuin A. Nature. 2000; 406: 415-418Google Scholar), a phenotype that could result from some sort of UCP3 expression and uncoupling artifact (9Cadenas S. Echtay K.S. Harper J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Buckingham J.A. Grau E. Abuin A. Chapman H. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2773-2778Google Scholar) as had already been described in yeast (10Harper J.A. Stuart J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Roussel D. Brindle K.M. Dickinson K. Jones R.B. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 49-56Google Scholar). In humans, even though their impact on these phenotypes seems to be modest, several genetic analyses have shown an association between UCP3 gene polymorphism in basal lipid oxidation reduction (11Argyropoulos G. Brown A.M. Willi S.M. Zhu J. He Y. Reitman M. Gevao S.M. Spruill I. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1345-1351Google Scholar) or body mass index in relation to morbid obesity or physical activity (12Otabe S. Clement K. Dubois S. Lepretre F. Pelloux V. Leibel R. Chung W. Boutin P.

Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 245-249Google Scholar). A new proposed role for UCP3 arose from several studies in rodents and humans showing that the UCP3 gene was up-regulated in physiological situations associated with high free fatty acid plasma levels such as starvation (14Gong D.W. He Y. Karas M. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24129-24132Google Scholar, 15Millet L. Vidal H. Andreelli F. Larrouy D. Riou J.P. Ricquier D. Laville M. Langin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2665-2670Google Scholar), postnatal development (16Brun S. Carmona M.C. Mampel T. Vinas O. Giralt M. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 205-209Google Scholar), or high fat diets (17Matsuda J. Hosoda K. Itoh H. Son C. Doi K. Tanaka T. Fukunaga Y. Inoue G. Nishimura H. Yoshimasa Y. Yamori Y. Nakao K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 200-204Google Scholar). Fatty acids themselves when administered in vivoinduce UCP3 gene expression in both rodents and humans (18Brun S. Carmona M.C. Mampel T. Vinas O. Giralt M. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1217-1222Google Scholar, 19Khalfallah Y. Fages S. Laville M. Langin D. Vidal H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 25-31Google Scholar). Altogether, these data favor the hypothesis that the primary function of UCP3 in skeletal muscle may be to either passively or actively regulate the utilization of lipids as a fuel substrate. In muscle, UCP3 gene expression is regulated both by to the metabolic and the hormonal status. Multiple hormonal treatments in vivo, such as leptin, thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, and especially peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists, cause dramatic changes in UCP3 gene expression in muscle (14Gong D.W. He Y. Karas M. Reitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24129-24132Google Scholar) (18Brun S. Carmona M.C. Mampel T. Vinas O. Giralt M. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1217-1222Google Scholar). Although studies have been carried out on the UCP3 promoter (20Acin A. Rodriguez M. Rique H. Canet E. Boutin J.A. Galizzi J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 278-283Google Scholar), the hormonal signals and responsive elements regulating UCP3 gene transcription in skeletal muscle have not yet been identified. One of the problems in characterizing this promoter is due to the fact that virtually all cultured muscle cells express little if any UCP3. These data suggest that specific transcriptional programs generating full muscle phenotype are exclusively activated in vivo but not in cultured muscle cells. Alternatively, in vivo muscle fibers might receive external signals triggering UCP3 gene expression (16Brun S. Carmona M.C. Mampel T. Vinas O. Giralt M. Iglesias R. Villarroya F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 205-209Google Scholar). To study the mechanisms regulating hUCP3 gene transcription and identify cis-/trans-acting DNA elements, we searched for an experimental model that would express a hUCP3 mRNA at levels similar to that found in human skeletal muscle biopsies. In the present work, we have injected human myoblasts into the tibialis anterior (TA) of immunodeficient mice RAG2−/−/γc/C5− (21Cooper R.N. Irintchev A. Di Santo J.P. Zweyer M. Morgan J.E. Partridge T.A. Butler-Browne G.S. Mouly V. Wernig A. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 823-831Google Scholar). In thisin vivo environment, injected cells proliferate and fuse to form muscle fibers that become innervated and contract. In these reconstituted muscles, we were able to detect normal levels of hUCP3 gene expression. Moreover, the hUCP3 promoter appears to be fully functional, since the effect of T3 on hUCP3 mRNA expression was similar to that found on mouse UCP3 (mUCP3) mRNA expression. To our knowledge, this is the first model that permits both the characterization of the hUCP3 promoter and the physiological function of the putative uncoupling protein UCP3. A biopsy from the quadriceps muscles of a 5-day-old infant was obtained during autopsy in accordance with the French legislation on ethical rules. From this biopsy, satellite cell populations were isolated from biopsies as described previously (22Decary S. Mouly V. Butler-Browne G.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1347-1350Google Scholar, 23Edom-Vovard F. Mouly V. Barbet J.P. Butler-Browne G.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 191-199Google Scholar). These cells were expanded in growth medium, which consists of Ham's F-10 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml of gentamycin and 20% fetal calf serum (Biomedia), and were called CHQ5B. The cells displayed a myogenic purity of 80%, as assessed by desmin staining (21Cooper R.N. Irintchev A. Di Santo J.P. Zweyer M. Morgan J.E. Partridge T.A. Butler-Browne G.S. Mouly V. Wernig A. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 823-831Google Scholar, 24Kaufman S.J. Foster R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9606-9610Google Scholar). To induce myotube formation, confluent cultures were cultivated for 10 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml of insulin (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml of transferrin (Invitrogen). Fifty-five immunodeficient RAG2−/−/γc− mice, 2–3 months old, were used in this study as recipients for human myoblast implantation. All experiments were carried out in the specific pathogen-free animal facilities at the Pasteur Institute. The cells used for transplantation (CHQ5B) were expanded to 20 population doubling levels. Prior to injection the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (360 × g) and resuspended in growth medium. Sufficient aliquots of cells were prepared in siliconized Eppendorf tubes. Following additional centrifugation, the supernatant was aspirated leaving a pellet containing 5 × 105cells per injection. For implantation, the mice were anesthetized with hypnorm/hypnovel. The TA muscles of both hindlimbs were exposed, and the proximal and distal portions of the muscle received a localized frozen lesion for 10 s (25Irintchev A. Langer M. Zweyer M. Theisen R. Wernig A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 775-785Google Scholar). This was repeated three times before injecting the cells using a 5-μl Hamilton syringe. The cells were injected into three to five different sites along the length of the muscle. The skin was then closed with fine sutures. Mice were sacrificed at different weeks post-implantation, and the TA muscles were dissected, mounted in gum tragacanth (6% in water; Sigma), and frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen or kept for mRNA extraction. Surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions and in accordance with the legal regulations in France. Eight weeks after implantation, immunofluorescence staining on serial transverse cryostat sections (5 μm) of the TA muscle was performed using the Vector Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M.) immunodetection kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). On unfixed sections, a human-specific monoclonal anti-spectrin (NCL-Spec1, Novacastra) antibody was used at a dilution of 1/50, and an anti-slow myosin (NCL-MHCs, Novacastra) antibody was used at a dilution of 1/5. Primary antibodies were visualized with either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated to streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Montluçon, France). Images were digitalized using the Photometrics and MetaView image analysis system. Mice received a single T3 injection at 2.5, 10, and 100 μg/100 g body mass (in 100 μl), whereas the control received the vehicle only (5 mm NaOH). Injections were given intraperitoneally in the morning. The mice were sacrificed 24 h later, and the TA muscles were dissected and stored frozen for mRNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from the TA of mice using the RNAXel kit (Eurobio, Paris, France). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in 20 μl of its own buffer (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) at 37 °C for 1 h. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with a LightCycler using FastStart DNA Master SYBR GreenI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNA product was amplified in a total volume of 20 μl with 0.5 μm of each primer, 4 mm MgCl2 (final concentration). All the primers were designed to anneal and amplify only mRNA. Moreover, primers were chosen to distinguish between human and mice sequences. The sequence primers are presented in TableI. A negative control for PCR consisted of omitting cDNA in the reaction tube. hUCP3 and α-actin levels were normalized to human β2-microglobulin and mUCP3 was normalized to mouse β2-microglobulin. This was noted REL for relative expression level.Table IPrimers sequence designed for and used in the quantitative PCR experiments for the measurement of the expression of mouse and human uncoupling protein-3 and control mouse α-actinPrimersForwardReverseHuman β2-microglobulin5′-GTG-TCT-GGG-TTT-CAT-CCA-TC-3′5′-AAT-GCG-GCA-TCT-TCA-ACC-TC-3′Mouse β2-microglobulin5′-TCA-GTA-ACA-CAG-TTC-CAC-CC-3′5′-GTT-CAA-ATG-AAT-CTT-CAG-AGC-AT-3′Human UCP35′-TCA-CCT-CCA-GGC-CAG-TAC-TT-3′5′-CGT-TAG-CTA-CCA-GTG-GCC-TT-3′Mouse UCP35′-CCA-ACA-TCA-CAA-GAA-ATG-C-3′5′-TAC-AAA-CAT-CAT-CAC-GTT-CC-3′Human α-actin5′-GCG-CAA-ATA-CTC-GGT-GTG-GA-3′5′-CCC-CCC-CAT-TGA-GAA-GAT-TC-3′All the primers were designed to anneal and amplify only mRNA.

Moreover, primers were chosen to distinguish between human from mice sequences. UCP3 mRNA levels were evaluated in cultures of human myoblasts and myotubes as well as in human muscle biopsies using real-time RT-PCR. As reported in TableII, the levels of UCP3 expressed in both myoblasts and myotubes were very much lower than that expressed in muscle biopsies. Indeed, in human muscle biopsies, the level of UCP3 mRNA was 500- and 423-fold greater than that measured either in myoblasts or myotubes. There was virtually no difference between undifferentiated and differentiated myoblast. This would suggest that the in vitro culture conditions do not allow sufficient maturation to induce UCP3 expression to the level measured in mature skeletal muscle fibers.Table IIEvaluation of UCP3 mRNA level in myoblast, myotubes, CHQ5B cells, and in human muscle biopsies by real-time RT-PCRRELStandard deviationHuman skeletal muscle0.220.0015CHQ5B0.000440.00025Differentiated CHQ5B0.000520.00013 Open table in a new tab Human myoblasts were injected into the TA muscle of an immunodeficient RAG2−/−/γc/C5− mouse. The presence of human muscle fibers in regenerated TA muscle was verified by immunohistochemistry using a species-specific (human, non-mouse) antibody against spectrin that specifically stains the basal lamina fibers (Fig. 1 A). All mouse muscles studied contained donor-derived (human) tissue after 1 week of transplantation (data not shown). The formation of muscle fibers containing human nuclei was examined by immunohistochemistry 8 weeks after cell transplantation, using the differentiation marker adult slow MHC and mRNA quantification of the α-actin marker using real-time RT-PCR. The co-expression of MHC and spectrin in skeletal muscle sections could be clearly seen 8 week after transplantation (Fig.1 B). The human α-actin was amplified by real-time RT-PCR using human-specific primers that did not cross-react with the mouse α-actin. Fig. 2 shows that 8 weeks after transplantation, the α-actin mRNA level reached a level similar to that measured in the human muscle biopsies, whereas in myoblast and myotubes CHQ5B cultured in vitro, the α-actin mRNA level was, respectively, 1272- and 315-fold less than in human muscle biopsies. PCR amplification of the α-actin product was not due to genomic contamination, since PCR amplification without reverse transcriptase did not produce any fluorescent signal. The specificity of the PCR products was assessed by Southern blotting with an internal oligonucleotide probe.Figure 2α-Actin mRNA expression was measured in RAG2 −/− / γ c/C5 − mouse tibialis muscle 8 weeks following CHQ5B myoblast transplantation. α-Actin mRNA expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR.

The hUCP3 mRNA level was measured immediately after myoblast transplantation and at 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10-week intervals (Fig. 3). These results show that the hUCP3 mRNA level increased between 2 and 7 weeks after transplantation and then reached a plateau at 7–8 weeks, at which time hUCP3 mRNA levels in human implants and human muscle biopsies were comparable (Fig. 3). Eight weeks after transplantation, mice were injected intraperitoneally with T3, and 24 h later the TA muscles were removed. The in vivo effect of T3 on both human and mouse UCP3 mRNA expression is presented in Fig.4. T3 induced a dose-dependent increase in hUCP3 mRNA levels with 2-, 6.7-, and 8.5-fold induction at 0.1, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg T3, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, T3 induced a dose-dependent increase in mUCP3 mRNA levels with 3.6-, 4.6-, and 6.9-fold induction at 0.1, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg T3, respectively (Fig. 4 B). In this study we described for the first time an efficient model study UCP3 gene expression in human myoblasts. In this model, following transplantation of human CHQ5B myoblasts into the TA muscle of immunodeficient mice RAG2−/−/γc/C5−, human muscle fibers were formed. When human myoblasts were cultured using standardin vitro culture conditions, UCP3 gene expression was hardly detectable compared with its expression in vivo. Results from quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that in human muscle biopsies the level of UCP3 mRNA was 500- and 423-fold greater than that measured in either myoblasts or myotubes, respectively. Such a low level of expression of UCP3 mRNA is a classical feature of muscle cells in culture and has also been observed in rat L6 and murine C2C12 myotubes (26Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Google Scholar, 27Hwang C.S. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 464-469Google Scholar). In vitro differentiated skeletal muscle cells form large multinucleated myotubes, but their gene expression profiles are markedly different to that of mature muscle fibersin vivo. For example, GLUT-4 is poorly expressed in myotubes (28Michael L.F. Wu Z. Cheatham R.B. Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Lehman J.J. Kelly D.P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3820-3825Google Scholar), whereas strong expression can be measured in muscle tissue. The most important finding in the present study is that the hUCP3 mRNA level was fully restored by transplantation of human CHQ5B myoblasts in the TA of an immunodeficient mouse. This model permits transplantation tolerance for periods of time sufficient to allow maturation of donor-derived muscle cells. In this study, we first confirmed that transplantation of human myoblast into regenerating TA muscle of RAG2−/−/γc/C5− mice produced fully differentiated human muscle fibers. The expression of human spectrin and differentiation markers, including the human α-actin and the slow adult MHC 8 weeks post-transplantation, confirmed the presence of regenerated mature human muscle fibers muscles in the TA of RAG2−/−/γc/C5− mice. Second, we showed that transplantation of human myoblasts restores the expression of the human UCP3 gene from a very low level in myoblast to a level similar to that found in human muscle biopsies. In the reconstituted human skeletal muscle UCP3 gene expression followed a kinetic pattern that reached a plateau at 7–8 weeks post-transplantation. Taken together these results indicate that an increase in UCP3 gene expression at 7–8 weeks following human myoblast transplantation was associated with in vivo human muscle cell differentiation and maturation. The results also suggest that an additional specific in vivo transcriptional program is required to trigger UCP3 gene expression. Alternatively, in vivo biological signals absent in vitro might participate in UCP3 gene expression. Numerous studies have shown that T3 treatment strongly stimulates UCP3 gene expression in rodent and human skeletal muscles. As expected, we found that T3 treatment increased UCP3 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in human implants, thus confirming the stimulatory effect of T3 on UCP3 gene expression. In addition, UCP3 gene regulation by T3 in humans and mice likely shares common features, as T3 treatment increases both human and mouse UCP3 transcripts to a similar level. Several mechanisms could account for the effect of T3 on UCP3 gene expression. The hUCP3 promoter contains a sequence that varies by a single base from the canonical thyroid response element (TRE) (20Acin A. Rodriguez M. Rique H. Canet E. Boutin J.A. Galizzi J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 278-283Google Scholar), but it is not known whether this putative TRE is functional. Interestingly, the mUCP3 promoter might also contain a similar TRE motif. Therefore the transplant of human myoblasts stably expressing the hUCP3 promoter region should help to functionally characterize the putative TRE-responsive element. Despite the increasing number of reports on UCP3, the molecular and/or cellular mechanism controlling UCP3 gene expression in human skeletal muscle remains poorly understood. This might be due to the fact that all studies aiming at characterizing UCP3 promoter were carried outin vitro where the UCP3 gene is poorly expressed, thus making it difficult to identify the cis-regulatory elements controlling UCP3 gene transcription. The means to restore UCP3 gene expression in differentiated human myoblast in vitro has not yet been found, despite considerable research on this topic. Therefore, myoblast transplantation into immunodeficient mouse skeletal muscles appears to be the model of choice to study hUCP3 gene regulation and its promoter. Screening assays based on promoter knowledge should help to select compounds that stimulate hUCP3 gene expression with a view to potential application in obesity therapy.

In Escherichia coli, translocation of presecretory proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by the Sec translocation machinery (translocase). SecA is the preprotein-driving ATPase, whereas SecY, SecE, and SecG form a membrane-embedded complex that presumably functions as a translocation channel.

The SecYE(G) complex also interacts with SecA, and specific interaction between these components is crucial for the SecA reaction cycles, which include insertion of SecA into the membrane and its subsequent deinsertion. Presumably, the SecYEG channel serves as the site of the SecA actions (14Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Google Scholar, 15Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar). Thus, the ATPase activity of SecA (translocation ATPase) is activated in a manner coupled with preprotein translocation (17Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Google Scholar). Among a number of cold-sensitive secY mutants we characterized, those having mutational alterations in the C5-C6 domains are defective in the SecA activation function (18Taura T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 261-269Google Scholar, 19Taura T. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 512-517Google Scholar). Specifically, a Tyr-429 to Asp substitution in the C6 domain by the secY205mutation (see Fig. 1) impairs the SecA insertion reaction in response to ATP and a preprotein (16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar). We are particularly interested in this mutation because it may provide invaluable means to our structural and functional studies of the SecYEG channel. In this study, we carried out isolation and characterization of intragenic suppressor mutations against the secY205 deficiency. Although the mutations obtained turned out to suppress other defective alleles ofsecY as well, they proved useful for our understanding of how SecYEG channel is tuned in its activity to accept preproteins. Minimal medium M9 was as described previously (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar). L medium contained 10 g of bactotryptone, 5 g of yeast extracts, and 5 g of NaCl per liter. P1 transduction was carried out by standard procedures (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar), and unselected markers were scored as described previously (16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar). E. coli strains used in this study are listed in Table I. In order to introduce the zhd33::Tn10-linkedsecY mutations by P1 transduction, the TetSderivatives of the sec mutants, GN15 (secY205), TW155 (ΔuncBC) (16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar), and NH192 (secE501), were used. To construct strain NH192, prototrophic P1 transductants were selected to eliminate argE::Tn10 linked to secE501 (12Riggs P.D. Derman A.I. Beckwith J.

About 20–50 colonies (frequency, about 10−5) appeared after 3 days of incubation at 20 °C. Revertants from each independent source were pooled for preparation of a P1 vir phage lysate, which was used to infect GN15 (secY205 tetS) to select TetR transductants at 20 °C. We only saved at most two transductants from an independent source. They were all confirmed to have a Cs+ determinant cotransducible with the transposon by individual transduction experiments into GN15 again. Thus we established 33 revertants from 19 independent pools. Their chromosomalsecY regions were sequenced as described previously (21Matsuo E. Mori H. Shimoike T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18835-18840Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were introduced into pHMC5A (Ref.22Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Google Scholar; a pBR322-based plasmid carrying secY+) by the QuickChange method (Stratagene) using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. All the constructs were confirmed for nucleotide sequence changes as well as for the lack of any unwanted changes. Some segments were replaced by those from the original plasmid. Strain SY92 (secY743) was constructed as follows. EM155 (polA1 secY24 zhd33::Tn10) was transformed with a plasmid pSY3 carrying the secY743 allele, yielding an ampicillin-resistant strain in which pSY3 had been integrated into the chromosome by single crossover homologous recombination. This strain was then cultured in the absence of ampicillin, and ampicillin-sensitive segregants were obtained after replica platings. One of the temperature-resistant segregants was shown by DNA sequencing to have the secY743 nucleotide change on the chromosome. Finally, the secY743 allele was introduced into AD202 by P1 transduction to construct strain SY92. Strain HM1315 (secY762) was constructed as follows. First, we constructed a plasmid pHM448 by inserting the secY762 gene between theBssHII site and HindIII site of pK18mobsacB (23Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Google Scholar). The plasmid was integrated into the chromosome of HM1285 (polA1 zhd33::Tn10) by homologous recombination, and the plasmid-integrated strain was subjected to excision of the plasmid sequence by growing them on a plate containing 5% sucrose. One of segregants had the secY762 allele, which was introduced into AD202 by P1 transduction to obtain strain HM1315. AsecY mutation was first introduced into GN73 carrying thelamB60 signal sequence mutation of the λ receptor, and cells were examined for the efficiency of infection with this phage. Briefly, suspension (2 × 108 in 4 ml of 10 mm MgSO4) of cells grown in M9 maltose (0.4%) was mixed with 2 × 107 infectious particles of λ. After 20 min at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 0.84% NaCl, and assayed for the numbers of infectious centers using MC4100 as indicator strain. Export of OmpA (an outer membrane protein) and MBP (a periplasmic protein) was examined by pulse-labeling cells for the indicated times with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation of these proteins. They were then separated by SDS-PAGE into the precursor and mature forms. Intracellular accumulation of SecY and SecE was examined by SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins and their staining with respective antibodies. All the details of the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were described previously (24Shimoike T. Taura T. Kihara A. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5519-5526Google Scholar). Visualization and quantification were by a Fuji BAS1800 PhosphorImager and a Fuji LAS1000 lumino-imager, respectively, for pulse-chase and immunoblotting experiments. In vitrotranslocation reactions were carried out according to the published procedures (22Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Google Scholar, 25Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proOmpA was prepared as described previously (25Uchida K. Mori H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30862-30868Google Scholar). Standard translocation reactions contained IMV (250 μg protein/ml), SecA (20 μg/ml), SecB (15 μg/ml), ATP (1 mm), phosphocreatine (60 mm), and creatine kinase (25 μg/ml) in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgSO4, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After preincubation at 37 °C for 20 s,35S-labeled proOmpA (1/20 the total volume) was added to start the reaction. To stop the reaction, samples were chilled on ice and treated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K on ice for 20 min followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and SDS-PAGE for quantification of translocated OmpA species. The PMF was generated by inclusion of 5 mm succinate and dissipated by 10 μmCCCP. A coupled spectrophotometric assay involving pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase was performed as described (26Mori H. Sugiyama H. Yamanaka M. Sato K. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 122-129Google Scholar). A SecA overproducing strain, GN50 (16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar), was grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of M9 medium supplemented with 18 amino acids (20 μg/ml), glucose (0.4%), and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) until a mid-log phase, and transcription ofsecA was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and 5 mm cAMP for 12 min, followed by labeling with [35S]methionine for 30 min. Cells were resuspended in 1× SecA buffer (27Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9429-9436Google Scholar) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm Pefabloc (Merck) and were disrupted by sonication. After removal of debris and membranes by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 350 μl (bed volume) of Blue-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 1× SecA buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed with 1× SecA buffer containing 0.3 m KCl and eluted with 1× SecA buffer containing 1 m KCl. SecA preparation thus obtained was at least 90% pure. It was desalted and stored at −80 °C. The specific radioactivity was 6.3 × 104cpm/μg. SecA insertion assay was performed essentially according to the procedures described previously (15Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Google Scholar). ThesecY205 mutant that carried an insertion ofzhd33::Tn10 was mutagenized with ultraviolet light, and revertants were selected at 20 °C. Nineteen independent revertant pools were used as the donor sources in P1 transduction into a TetS version of the same mutant. Tetracycline-resistant transductants were selected again at 20 °C, and 1–2 transductants were saved from each of the independent sources. Thus, a total of 33 mutants were studied further. They all carried a Cs+ element cotransducible with the transposon. Sequencing revealed a single nucleotide change, with an accompanying amino acid change, for each of the mutants (Table IIand Fig. 1). We identified 9 suppressor alleles, 2 pseudoreversions, and 1 true reversion (some of them, repeatedly). The allele names shown in Table II and Fig. 1indicate only the second site mutations. The second site mutations were distributed in the SecY periplasmic regions 1 and 4, transmembrane regions 1, 5, and 10, and cytoplasmic region 5.Table IIIntragenic suppressors against secY205secYallelesNucleotide changesNo. independect isolatesAmino acid changesaPseudoreversions are underlined.SecY domain affected by suppressor% export of MBPbCells of each strain were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min at 20 °C, and MBP was immunoprecipitated.

Values represent % of labeled mature species.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Suppression of the secY205 protein export defect was examined by pulse labeling the cells of different genotypes and immunoprecipitating MBP. Proportions of the mature form of this protein were taken as the indication of its export (Table I). Pulse labeling for 1 min at 20 °C gave about a 90% mature form of MBP in wild-type cells, whereas this value was only 38% in the secY205mutant. The values in the suppressed mutant cells were significantly increased, up to 78% for the secY711-secY205double mutant cells (the secY716-secY205 cells did not grow on the synthetic medium used for pulse labeling). Thus, these second site mutations alleviated both the growth defect and the protein export defect of the original secY205 mutation. We engineered cloned secY to construct a series of variants containing the secY205 as well as one of thesecY711, secY733, secY743, andsecY762 sequence alterations. These plasmids were introduced into the secY205 mutant cells and examined for their ability to complement the protein export defect of this mutant host. The double mutant plasmids allowed nearly wild-type levels of MBP export, whereas non-suppressed secY205 plasmid allowed only 50% processing (Fig. 2). Plasmids carrying only the suppressor mutations were indistinguishable form thesecY + plasmid (data not shown). Similar complementation results were obtained with respect to the cell growth defects of the host (data not shown). These experiments provided formal proof that the second site mutations were indeed responsible for the suppression. The intragenic suppressorssecY711, secY733, secY743, andsecY762 obtained against secY205 were also combined, on plasmids, with the secY39 mutation affecting an essential SecY residue, Arg-357 (22Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Google Scholar). Each plasmid was introduced into the cold-sensitive strain carrying the chromosomal secY39mutation. Each of the double mutant plasmids, unlike the nonsuppressedsecY39 plasmid, showed positive complementation against this host strain. This was demonstrated with respect to cell growth (data not shown) and MBP export (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1–4 with lane 5) at 20 °C. Thus, the intragenic suppressors act not only against the original secY205mutation but also against the Arg-357 → His alteration bysecY39. Another mutation of Arg-357, Arg-357 → Glu, exhibits a dominant negative effect when expressed from plasmid (22Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5128-5133Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B, lane 5). When this mutation on a plasmid was combined with the suppressor mutations, the dominant interference became significantly less pronounced (Fig. 3B, comparelanes 1–4 with lane 5). One possible explanation for these results might be that the suppressor alterations significantly restore the SecY functionality that had been compromised by the Arg-357 alterations. IMVs were prepared from the secY205 mutant as well as the same mutant that carried one of the seven suppressor mutations shown in Fig. 4. They were combined with SecA and assayed for activities to translocate proOmpA at 20 °C with or without imposition of the PMF. Even under the PMF-imposed conditions, the SecY205 mutant IMV exhibited lower than normal activity (13% translocation in 10 min as compared with the wild-type value of 50%). In contrast, IMVs from the suppressed strains gave much higher translocation (28–81% depending upon the suppressor alleles). Remarkably, translocation activities of the SecY762-SecY205 and the SecY752-SecY205 IMVs were even higher than that of the wild-type IMV, allowing 81 and 71% translocation, respectively. At this reaction temperature (20 °C), wild-type IMV exhibited strong dependence on the PMF (Fig. 4, lane 18); the PMF independence value (translocation yield in the absence of PMF/that in the presence of PMF) was only 0.02. IMVs from some of the suppressed mutants showed strikingly higher values. For instance, PMF independence values for SecY762-SecY205 IMV, SecY743-SecY205 IMV, and SecY733-SecY205 IMV were 0.7, 0.49, and 0.3, respectively. The other double mutant IMVs examined also showed significantly increased PMF independence values (0.13–0.25). Assays of the SecA translocation ATPase revealed that the suppressed IMVs supported higher ATPase activities than the SecY205 single mutant IMV (data not shown). We showed previously (16Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Google Scholar) that the SecY205 alteration impairs the SecA insertion reaction in the presence of ATP and proOmpA protein. This was based on experiments using 125I-labeled SecA, in which a 30-kDa C-terminal fragment was detected as a trypsin-protected “insertion segment” (14Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Google Scholar, 28Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Google Scholar). Eichler and Wickner (29Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Google Scholar) showed that [35S]methionine-labeled SecA enabled detection of another insertion segment of 65 kDa derived from the N-terminal region of SecA. We now used this latter reaction system. Additionally, NaN3was added to stabilize the inserted state of SecA (15Eichler J. Rinard K. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21675-21681Google Scholar). Whereas reaction with the wild-type IMV evidently generated the protease-protected 65-kDa fragment when incubated with35S-SecA, proOmpA, and ATP (Fig. 5, lane 13), the SecY205 IMV did not significantly support the reaction (Fig. 5, lane 10). The suppressed IMVs showed recovered abilities to support the generation of the 65-kDa trypsin-protected fragment (representative data for the SecY711, the SecY733, and the SecY743 effects are shown inlanes 1, 4, and 7). These results show that the secY205 mutation impairs the insertion of not only C-terminal but also N-terminal portions of SecA and that the suppressor mutations restored the SecA insertion defect caused by thesecY205 mutation. They are consistent with the suppressor-dependent recovery of SecA translocation ATPase activity. However, the insertion-deinsertion equilibrium might have been shifted slightly toward the latter, because the suppression effect was less clear without NaN3 added to inhibit deinsertion (data not shown). We constructed single mutant strains having the secY743 or thesecY762 mutation on the chromosome as described under “Materials and Methods.” These two mutations most effectively alleviated the PMF dependence of in vitro translocation in the presence of the secY205 alteration (Fig. 4). The secY762 single mutant cells showed slightly slower growth rate than the wild-type cells. Otherwise, these mutants had no obvious growth phenotypes at different temperatures. The secY762 mutant exhibited normal ability of MBP export (Fig. 6A, lane 2). We then introduced these secY alleles into thesecE501 mutant strain that is cold-sensitive for growth (12Riggs P.D. Derman A.I. Beckwith J. Genetics. 1998; 118: 571-579Google Scholar). This secE mutation affects the translation initiation region of secE resulting in its reduced translation. Because unassembled SecY molecules are eliminated by rapid proteolysis, the mutant cells contain a reduced amount of SecY as well (13; see Fig. 6B, lane 3). Thus, the secE501mutant cells contain an insufficient amount of the SecYE translocase complex. The secY762 and the secY743 mutations proved to suppress the cold sensitivity when combined with thesecE501 mutation (data not shown) and to stimulate significantly the MBP export ability of this mutant (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 3 and 4; data not shown for the secY743-secE501 combination). Interestingly, this suppression was not accompanied by any increase in the cellular abundance of SecE or SecY, which was decreased by about 50% by thesecE501 mutation (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 3 and 4; data not shown for thesecY743-secE501 combination). Thus, the suppressor mutations enhance the SecYE translocase function such that the 50% reduction in its amount is tolerated. It is possible that a mutant translocation channel can handle an increased number of secretory proteins for their export per unit of time. The mutated translocases were studied in vitro. IMVs were prepared fromsecY743-ΔuncBC andsecY762-ΔuncBC strains and subjected toin vitro translocation assays at 20 °C. SecY762 IMV (Fig. 6C, open squares) supported proOmpA translocation more efficiently than the wild-type IMV (Fig. 6C, open circles). The difference between these two IMVs was much more striking in the absence of PMF. Under the latter conditions, the wild-type IMV was virtually inactive (Fig. 6C, solid circles), but the SecY762 IMV exhibited the activity (Fig. 6C, solid squares) that exceeded even the PMF-stimulated wild-type activity. Increased PMF independence of the SecY762 IMV was observed also at 37 °C (data not shown). Similar high translocation activity was observed with the SecY743 IMV, although its dependence on PMF was higher than that observed with the SecY762 IMV (data not shown). Treatment of IMV with 6 m urea partially removes and almost completely inactivates SecA molecules that are bound to wild-type IMV (Fig. 7, lane 1, SecY+). Thus, protein translocation activity of urea-washed wild-type IMV exhibits almost exclusive dependence on SecA added exogenously (Fig. 7, open circles). We found that the SecY762 IMV was inactivated by urea treatment by only about 40% (Fig. 7, filled circle on the ordinate versus activity of untreated IMV). The lost activity was recovered by exogenous SecA (Fig. 7, filled circles). Thus, the SecY762 translocase seems to utilize SecA more efficiently and to stabilize SecA molecules that had been bound to the active translocation channel in a form ready to function.

https://openalex.org/W1984197871,"We previously reported that the N-terminal domain (1–147 residues) of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI) was essential for import into the outer mitochondrial membrane and for maintenance of a malonyl-CoA-sensitive conformation. Malonyl-CoA binding experiments using mitochondria ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI or previously constructed chimeric CPTs (Cohen, I., Kohl, C., McGarry, J.D., Girard, J., and Prip-Buus, C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29896–29904) indicated that the N-terminal domain was unable, independently of the C-terminal domain, to bind malonyl-CoA with a high affinity, suggesting that the modulation of malonyl-CoA sensitivity occurred through N/C intramolecular interactions. To assess the role of the C terminus in malonyl-CoA sensitivity, a series of C-terminal deletion mutants was generated. The kinetic properties of Δ772–773 and Δ767–773 deletion mutants were similar to those of L-CPTI, indicating that the last two highly conserved Lys residues in all known L-CPTI species were not functionally essential. By contrast, Δ743–773 deletion mutant was totally inactive and unfolded, as shown by its sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis. Because the C terminus of the native folded L-CPTI could be cleaved by trypsin without inducing protein unfolding, we concluded that the last 31 C-terminal residues constitute a secondary structural determinant essential for the initial protein folding of L-CPTI. We previously reported that the N-terminal domain (1–147 residues) of rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPTI) was essential for import into the outer mitochondrial membrane and for maintenance of a malonyl-CoA-sensitive conformation. Malonyl-CoA binding experiments using mitochondria ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI or previously constructed chimeric CPTs (Cohen, I., Kohl, C., McGarry, J.D., Girard, J., and Prip-Buus, C.

The carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI, 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; L-CPTI, liver isoform of CPTI; M-CPTI, muscle isoform of CPTI; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; TM, transmembrane; N/C, N-terminal/C-terminal EC 2.3.1.21) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation in all mammalian tissues that converts long-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). A unique feature of CPTI is its potent inhibition by malonyl-CoA, the first committed intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis (2McGarry J.D. Leatherman G.F. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4128-4136Google Scholar). This provides a mechanism for physiological regulation of β-oxidation in liver and other tissues and for cellular fuel sensing based on the availability of fatty acids and glucose (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar,3Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Google Scholar, 4Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Google Scholar). In recent years the concept has emerged that lipid disorders, such as inefficient fatty acid oxidation, may contribute in the etiology of insulin resistance, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and other heart diseases (5Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Google Scholar, 6Bergman R.N. Ader M. TEM. 2000; 11: 351-356Google Scholar, 7Unger R.H. Orci L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 312-321Google Scholar, 8McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Google Scholar). Acute metabolic complications of uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis, mainly stem from excessive fatty acid oxidation (9McGarry J.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55S: 29-38Google Scholar). An ideal design of a drug to control the CPT system in such metabolic disorders has not come into being (10Anderson R.C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 1-16Google Scholar), largely because the molecular mechanisms underlying CPTI inhibition by malonyl-CoA have not thoroughly been understood. In mammalian tissues, there are two CPTI isoforms, the liver type (L-CPTI) and the muscle type (M-CPTI), encoded by distinct genes (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar). The M-CPTI is ∼30–100-fold more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than L-CPTI. L-CPTI is a polytopic outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein harboring two hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TM1 and -2) (11Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Google Scholar). Its membrane topology is such that both the N terminus (residues 1–47) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 123–773) are located on the cytosolic face of mitochondria (12Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (1–147 residues) of L-CPTI is not only responsible for mitochondrial targeting and import into the OMM but is also involved in maintenance of a folded active and malonyl-CoA-sensitive conformation of the enzyme (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar). Recently, TM2 was shown to be essential for the correct folding of the catalytic domain of L-CPTI, suggesting that some N/C intramolecular interactions may be directly involved in the establishment and/or maintenance of the native functional conformation of L-CPTI (14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Google Scholar). The malonyl-CoA binding site as well as the molecular basis for malonyl-CoA inhibition remain largely unknown despite clues that have begun to emerge from functional mutagenesis studies. Deletion of the highly conserved 18 N-terminal residues of L-CPTI or mutation of Glu3 and His5 led to a decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity and impairment of malonyl-CoA binding (15Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Google Scholar, 16Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Google Scholar, 17Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar). However, whether Glu3 participates directly to malonyl-CoA binding or allows the extreme cytosolic N terminus to interact with the catalytic C-terminal domain in order to maintain a conformational malonyl-CoA binding site is still unclear. We have previously shown that the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI cannot confer malonyl-CoA sensitivity to the malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPTII (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar), which allowed two hypotheses to be formulated. The first one was that, if malonyl-CoA binds only the N terminus of L-CPTI, the CPTII component of the CPTI (1–147)-CPTII chimera must have a tertiary conformation that is unable to interact with this domain. The second hypothesis was that the C-terminal region of L-CPTI is critical for malonyl-CoA binding and that the necessary site(s) is not present in CPTII. Since this observation, different studies have indicated that (i), the different malonyl-CoA sensitivities of the CPTI isoforms result primarily from differences in their C termini (16Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Google Scholar, 18Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Google Scholar, 19Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Google Scholar) and (ii), the nature of the cytosolic N/C interaction of the L-CPTI is involved in the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (20Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Google Scholar, 21Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Google Scholar). The existence of such a physical N/C interaction was recently supported by the identification of a highly trypsin-resistant 60-kDa folded core within the catalytic C-terminal domain that is hidden in the native protein by its cytosolic N-terminal residues (14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Google Scholar). However, whether the extreme N terminus (and particularly Glu3) participates directly to malonyl-CoA binding or allows the extreme cytosolic N terminus to interact with the catalytic C-terminal domain in order to maintain a conformational malonyl-CoA binding site is still unclear. In the present study, we examined whether the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI exhibits a high affinity for malonyl-CoA binding independently of the presence of the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI, and we investigated for the first time whether the extreme C terminus of L-CPTI, which exhibits notable differences with its M-CPTI counterpart, could be involved in the N/C intramolecular interactions that determine the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity. For this purpose, three C-terminal deletions of L-CPTI, ranging in size from 2 to 31 residues, were generated and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to compare their functional and conformational properties. The results outlined below reveal that the high malonyl-CoA affinity binding site does not reside within the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI and that the extreme C terminus of L-CPTI is not involved in malonyl-CoA sensitivity but plays an unexpected role in the initial folding of the enzyme. The S. cerevisiae strains expressing rat L-CPTI, pOM29-CPTII, pOM29-CPTIΔ148, and CPTI (1–147)-CPTII were obtained as described previously (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar, 22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar). Briefly, pOM29-CPTII and -CPTIΔ148 correspond to the fusion of pOM29 (a specific OMM signal anchor sequence), to the mature form of CPTII, or to L-CPTI lacking the first 148 N-terminal residues, respectively. CPTI (1–147)-CPTII is the fusion of the mature form of CPTII to the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI. Escherichia coli DH5α strain was used to propagate various plasmids. The yeast expression vector pYeDP1/8–10 containing the full-length rat L-CPTI cDNA (pYeDP1/8–10-L-CPTI) (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar) was used to generate the deletion mutants. All DNA manipulations (restriction and ligation) were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer's protocols for the respective enzymes. The C-terminal deletion rat L-CPTI mutants were constructed as follows. PCR was performed to copy a 336-nucleotide stretch of the 3′-coding sequence of the rat L-CPTI by using the 5′-primer (5′-TATGTGGTGTCCAAGTAT-3′) located upstream the uniqueSalI restriction site of L-CPTI cDNA and the 3′-primer (5′-TCCCCGCGGTTAAGAATTGATGGTGAG-3′) introducing a stop codon and a SacII site immediately downstream the codon encoding Ser771. The PCR product was cut by SalI andSacII and ligated into pYeDP1/8–10-L-CPTI cut by the same enzymes. This construct encodes an L-CPTI lacking the last two C-terminal amino acids. These constructs were obtained in a similar manner to CPTIΔ772–773 by using the same 5′-primer but different 3′-primers as follows:CPTIΔ767–773, 5′-TCCCCGCGGTTAGCCAAACAAGGTGAT-3′;CPTIΔ743–773, 5′-TCCCCGCGGTTAGCTAGAGAACTTGGA-3′. All subsequent procedures were identical to those used for the construction of CPTIΔ772–773. These constructs encode an L-CPTI protein deleted of the last 7 and 31 C-terminal residues, respectively. The fidelity of all PCR reactions, the DNA sequences of the mutants, and the quality of DNA subcloning were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Each cDNA was placed under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter, and the constructs were used to transform S. cerevisiae (haploid strain W303:MATα, his3, leu2, trp1,ura3, ade2–1, can1–100). Methods for yeast transformation and culture, subcellular fractionation, and isolation of yeast mitochondria were as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar). CPT activity was assayed at 30 °C as palmitoyl-L-[methyl-3H]carnitine formed from L-[methyl-3H]carnitine (200 μm; 10 Ci/mol) and palmitoyl-CoA (80 μm) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA concentration varied over 0.01 to 150 μm for estimation of the IC50 value. The apparentK m for carnitine was measured at 600 μm palmitoyl-CoA with 5–800 μm carnitine and the apparent K m for palmitoyl-CoA at 200 μm carnitine with 10–900 μm palmitoyl-CoA in the presence of a fixed molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA/albumin (6.1:1) (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar). [14C]Malonyl-CoA binding was determined by a modified centrifugation assay as described previously (23Mills S.E. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 83-91Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (400 μg of protein) from wild-type and mutants were resuspended in 0.4 ml of ice-cold medium containing 250 mmsucrose, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.01–5 μm [2-14C] malonyl-CoA (56 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) in the absence or presence of 200 μm unlabelled malonyl-CoA. Incubations were started by addition of the mitochondria and were continued for 20 min at 0 °C with gentle mixing at 4-min intervals. Bound and free malonyl-CoA were then separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded, and 0.25 ml of 1 m KOH was immediately added to the pellets. Solubilization of the mitochondria was facilitated by heating at 50 °C for 30 min, after which time the contents of the tube, together with 0.8 ml of water wash, were transferred to counting vials and assayed for radioactivity after addition of 10 ml of Aquasol. The final malonyl-CoA binding values for the wild-type and mutants were corrected for background malonyl-CoA binding by the yeast control strain that carried the vector but without the CPTI insert. Saturation binding experiments were analyzed with the non-linear least squares curve-fitting procedure of the EBDA/LIGAND program (Biosoft Elsevier, Cambridge, UK). After subtraction of nonspecific malonyl-CoA binding to the CPTI-free yeast control strain, data were always best fitted according to a one-site model. When needed, the validity of a one-siteversus two-site model was verified using an F-test. Proteolytic analysis of the full-length L-CPTI and mutants was performed as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Eighty μg of mitochondria isolated from yeast strains expressing the different proteins were resuspended in SH buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 0.5 mg of protein/ml in the absence or in the presence of 30 μg/ml trypsin. Samples were kept on ice for 30 min, and then soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) was added in a 30-fold excess. After 10 min, mitochondria were reisolated, washed once with SH buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mg/ml STI, and then lysed directly in Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Aliquots of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) in an 8% gel. The detection of proteins after blotting onto nitrocellulose was performed as described previously (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar) using the ECL detection system (Pierce) according to the supplier's instructions. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Ref. 25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Lewis Farr A. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar with bovine serum albumin as a standard. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Biolabs (Ozyme, Saint-Quentin en Yvelines, France). PCR reagents and T4 DNA polymerase were obtained from Invitrogen. Yeast culture media products were from Difco, and Zymolase 20T was from ICN Biomedicals, France. Others chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney Utest. The first purpose of this study was to determine whether the N-terminal domain (the first 147 N-terminal amino acids) of L-CPTI was able to bind malonyl-CoA with a high affinity, independently of the presence of the C-terminal domain. For this purpose, we further characterized some chimeric CPTs previously generated and expressed inS. cerevisiae (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar), a system devoid of endogenous CPT enzyme (22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar, 26Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Google Scholar). CPTI (1–147)-CPTII (fusion of the mature form of CPTII to the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI) offered the possibility of directly addressing the former question. pOM29-CPTII and pOM29-CPTIΔ148 were used as negative control proteins, pOM29 being a specific OMM signal anchor sequence (27Li J.-M. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Google Scholar). All of these chimeric proteins were expressed in yeast at similar steady-state levels and were located at the OMM, their C terminus exposed to the cytosol (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar). As previously reported (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar), both pOM29-CPTII and CPTI (1–147)-CPTII were catalytically active, whereas pOM29-CPTIΔ148 retained only 8% of that observed with L-CPTI (Table I). In contrast to L-CPTI, which exhibited an IC50 for malonyl-CoA of 0.6 μm(Table I and Fig. 1), pOM29-CPTII, pOM29-CPTIΔ148, and CPTI (1–147)-CPTII were largely insensitive to malonyl-CoA whatever the malonyl-CoA concentration tested. Malonyl-CoA binding to mitochondria from yeast strains expressing L-CPTI and chimeric CPT was clearly saturable (Fig.2 A). As shown by the Scatchard plots in Fig. 2 B, saturation binding experiments were resolved into a single high affinity site (L-CPTI) or a single low affinity site (chimeric CPT). Replacement of the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI by pOM29 completely abolished the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding (Fig. 2 B), increasing the K Dvalue by 20-fold whereas the B max value decreased only slightly (Table I). In agreement with the fact that CPTII does not possess a malonyl-CoA binding domain, pOM29-CPTII exhibited a K D value 30-fold higher than that of L-CPTI (Table I). Anchorage of CPTII at the OMM by the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI instead of pOM29 did not result in the appearance of a high affinity malonyl-CoA binding (Fig. 2 B and Table I). This clearly shows that the insensitivity of CPTI (1–147)-CPTII to malonyl-CoA resulted from the absence of high affinity malonyl-CoA binding.Table ICPT activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and binding in yeast strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI and chimeric CPTsStrainActivityIC50K DB maxnmol/min/mgμmnmpmol/mgL-CPTI2.65 ± 0.260.56 ± 0.1011 ± 220 ± 3pOM29-CPTII2.92 ± 0.14N/A312 ± 7120 ± 4pOM29-CPTIΔ1480.19 ± 0.06N/A264 ± 7415 ± 3CPTI(1–147)-CPTII2.07 ± 0.25N/A281 ± 712 ± 2Mitochondria were isolated from the yeast strains separately expressing wild-type L-CPTI and the chimeric CPTs and were assayed for CPT activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The IC50 value is the concentration of malonyl-CoA needed to inhibit 50% of the CPT activity, and the results are the means ± S.E. of three to five independent experiments.

Amino acid sequence alignment of the last 33 C-terminal residues of CPTI isoforms from different mammalian species is shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to the N terminus, the C terminus exhibits a low degree of sequence conservation because no more than 13 of the last 33 residues are identical. The major difference between the L- and M-CPTI isoforms is the presence of two lysine residues at the C-terminal end of all known mammalian L-type isoforms. Secondary structure prediction methods predict that residues 747–768 of the rat L-CPTI form an amphipathic α-helix, as for the corresponding residues in the other CPTI isoforms. Therefore, three deletion mutants of rat L-CPTI were constructed in which the last 2 (2 lysines), 7 (downstream the α-helix), or 31 (encompassing the α-helix) C-terminal residues were deleted (Fig. 3). All these constructs, as well as the full-length L-CPTI, were expressed in S. cerevisiae. Western blot analysis of mitochondria isolated from yeast cells expressing the different proteins using a polyclonal antibody directed against residues 317–430 of L-CPTI is shown in Fig.4. All proteins were synthesized at predicted sizes and were expressed at similar steady-state levels. Subcellular fractionation experiments did not reveal any change in the mitochondrial targeting of these expressed proteins (results not shown). This strengthened the fact that only the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI is involved in its import into the OMM (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar, 14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Google Scholar). As shown in TableII, Δ772–773 and Δ767–773 retained significant CPT activity that was 96 and 99%, respectively, of that observed for the wild-type L-CPTI. By contrast, deletion of the last 31 C-terminal residues resulted in a protein that was totally inactive (Table II), despite similar levels of protein when compared with wild-type L-CPTI (Fig. 4). Deletion of the last 2 or 7 C-terminal residues did not affect malonyl-CoA sensitivity, whatever the concentration of the inhibitor tested (Fig.5 A), and the IC50values for malonyl-CoA of the wild-type L-CPTI, Δ772–773, and Δ767–773 were similar (Table II). All active CPTI mutants exhibited normal saturation kinetics when the carnitine concentration varied relative to a fixed concentration of palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 5 B) or when palmitoyl-CoA concentration varied when the molar ratio of palmitoyl-CoA:albumin was fixed at 6.1:1 (Fig. 5 C). The calculated K m for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA of Δ772–773 and Δ767–773 were similar to those of the wild-type L-CPTI (Table II).Table IICPT activity, malonyl-CoA sensitivity, and kinetic parameters of the yeast strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI and C-terminal deletion mutantsStrainActivityIC50malonyl-CoAK m carnitineK mpalmitoyl-CoAnmol/min/mgμmL-CPTI3.38 ± 0.060.53 ± 0.13102 ± 1441.2 ± 11.1Δ772–7733.25 ± 0.100.50 ± 0.15113 ± 644.1 ± 1.7Δ767–7733.33 ± 0.310.55 ± 0.08111 ± 1853.9 ± 4.1Δ743–773undetectableN.D.N.D.N.D.Mitochondria were isolated from yeast strains expressing wild-type L-CPTI, Δ772–773, Δ767–773, and Δ743–773 and were assayed for CPTI activity in the presence of 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA and 200 μm carnitine and in the absence or in the presence of 150 μm malonyl-CoA.

To understand the abolition of CPT activity upon deletion of the last 31 C-terminal residues, we examined the possibility that the conformational state of L-CPTI could have been affected. We have previously shown that native or yeast-expressed L-CPTI exhibited a highly folded conformation resistant to trypsin proteolysis (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar, 14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Google Scholar,22Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Google Scholar). When intact mitochondria isolated from the different expressing yeast strains were incubated in the presence of trypsin, both Δ772–773 and Δ767–773 remained largely resistant to the protease treatment, indicating that their conformation was not dramatically affected by the deletion (Fig. 6). By contrast, Δ743–773 was totally digested by trypsin (Fig. 6) without apparent detectable proteolytic fragments (results not shown). Thus, in the absence of the last 31 C-terminal residues, the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI did not harbor the highly folded core characteristic of the native enzyme. Therefore, we concluded that, in the case of Δ743–773, disappearance of functional activity directly resulted from an unfolded state of the protein. The N-terminal domain of rat L-CPTI is not only responsible for protein targeting to the outer mitochondrial membrane but is also essential for malonyl-CoA sensitivity (13Cohen I. Kohl C.

Inhibition of L-CPTI activity by malonyl-CoA involves two sites of malonyl-CoA interaction. The first one is the low affinity site, near the catalytic acyl-CoA-binding domain (28Dai J. Zhu H. Shi J. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22020-22024Google Scholar, 29Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar, whereas the second site, the high affinity site, is separated from the active site and does not compete with acyl-CoA (31Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 639-647Google Scholar, 32Zammit V.A. Corstorphine C.G. Gray S.R. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 335-342Google Scholar, 33Cook G.A. Mynatt R.L. Kashfi K. J. Biol.

Although previous studies have shown that the N-terminal domain influences the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, it has not been ascertained whether the N-terminal residues of L-CPTI contribute directly to a malonyl-CoA binding site. Using heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae, we have previously shown that fusion of the N-terminal domain of L-CPTI (1 to 147 amino acids) to the mature form of the malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPTII allowed a specific OMM targeting of the resulting protein leaving the CPTII moiety on the cytosolic face of the mitochondria, as for the catalytic domain of L-CPTI (12Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Google Scholar). This chimeric CPTI (1–147)-CPTII protein was functionally active but totally malonyl-CoA-insensitive (13Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that chimeric CPTI (1–147)-CPTII does not exhibit a high affinity for malonyl-CoA binding when compared with pOM29-CPTII. These results indicate that (i), the N-terminal domain of rat L-CPTI has not the ability by itself (i.e. in the absence of the C-terminal domain) to bind malonyl-CoA and (ii), the high affinity binding site for malonyl-CoA likely involves either residues located both in the N- and C-terminal domains or only residues within the C-terminal domain. In the first hypothesis, physical N/C interactions are necessarily involved in order to constitute the malonyl-CoA binding site. Any modification within the N terminus would then be expected to alter profoundly the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding. Initial deletion mutation analysis of the conserved first 18 N-terminal residues of rat L-CPTI was in agreement with this statement (15Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Google Scholar, 17Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar), whereas further studies indicated that the mechanism of malonyl-CoA inhibition is more complicated because the cytosolic N terminus contained both positive and negative determinants of malonyl-CoA sensitivity (20Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Google Scholar). Moreover, functional characterization of several L-CPTI chimeras has predicted that malonyl-CoA binding sites were located in the cytosolic C-terminal domain (16Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Google Scholar, 19Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Google Scholar). If this is true, the cytosolic N terminus should (i), stabilize the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding site through its interaction with the catalytic C-terminal domain and (ii), modulate the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity through conformational changes that alter these N/C intramolecular interactions, as previously suggested (19Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Google Scholar, 20Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Google Scholar). Whatever the location of the high affinity malonyl-CoA binding site within L-CPTI, it might be a conformational site that is highly sensitive to interaction(s) with the N terminus. Which part(s) of the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI do interact with the N terminus? Because the negative charge of Glu3 has been shown to be essential for mediating the inhibitory effects of malonyl-CoA (17Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Google Scholar, 21Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Google Scholar), we asked whether the positive charges of the 2 Lys residues present at the COOH terminus of all known L-CPTI species (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Google Scholar) could play a role in these N/C intramolecular interactions and/or explain the discrepancies in the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity between the L- and M-CPTI isoforms. The kinetic properties of the L-CPTI mutants lacking the last 2 or 7 C-terminal amino acids were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type. We concluded that the two highly conserved Lys residues in the C terminus of all known L-CPTI species are essential for neither functional activity nor malonyl-CoA sensitivity and hence are not involved in a physical interaction with the N terminus of the enzyme. To further investigate the role of the C terminus of L-CPTI, we constructed two other deletion mutants, Δ743–773 and Δ719–773. Among the seven independent yeast clones transfected with pYeDP1/8-Δ719–773, no protein expression was detected. 2Y. Pan, J. Girard, and C. Prip-Buus, unpublished results. This was in contrast with the three other deletion mutants (Δ772–773, Δ767–773, and Δ743–773) for which we observed correct protein expression in all tested yeast clones. This observation suggested that the last 55 C-terminal amino acids are critical for protein stability. Moreover, Δ743–773 mutant was correctly imported into the OMM but was not folded, as shown by its high sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis and, hence, was functionally inactive. The effect of this deletion was unexpected from our previous observations (14Cohen I. Guillerault F. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5403-5411Google Scholar). Indeed, we have shown that once imported into the OMM, L-CPTI adopts its native functional conformation that is characterized by a highly folded state resistant to trypsin proteolysis (Fig. 7,a and b). However, when the loop connecting TM1 and -2 is first cleaved by the protease, such as during the swelling procedure (Fig. 7 c), possible trypsin cleavage sites occur C-terminal to Arg595 or Arg598 and Lys631 or Lys634, and the highly folded trypsin resistant core (likely to be in part the catalytic core) is still detected after solubilization by Triton X-100 in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 7 d). This indicates that the last 139–178 C-terminal amino acids of L-CPTI can be cleaved from the native protein without impairing the folding of the remaining C-terminal domain. By contrast, if deletion of the last C-terminal amino acids occurs previous to mitochondrial protein import, such as in Δ743–773, then the resulting imported protein is unable to reach its correct folded conformation (Fig. 7 e). This observation indicates that the last 31 C-terminal amino acids, which are predicted to form an amphipathic α-helice, are critical for initial protein folding of the catalytic C-terminal domain of L-CPTI. Once folded, the tertiary structure of this domain is thereafter stabilized by other intramolecular interactions independently of the last 31 C-terminal residues. The functional relevance of these results is of great importance and must be kept in mind when performing functional analysis of L-CPTI mutants. Indeed, not enough caution has been taken in differentiating between whether a specific mutation within the C-terminal domain directly affects catalytic activity without drastically altering protein folding (functional determinant) or whether it induces protein unfolding (structural determinant) that secondarily decreases functional activity. During their course of folding, proteins undergo different types of structural rearrangements, ranging from local to large-scale conformational changes that lead to a series of sequential transition folding states. In this protein folding pathway, cooperative interactions of specific residues may be critical in establishing a bonding network that transiently stabilizes the intermediate conformations (35Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 733-740Google Scholar, 36Kursula I. Partanen S. Lambeir A.M. Wierenga R.K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 39-42Google Scholar). For instance, point mutations can increase local flexibility or affect kinetic folding without altering the average native conformation of the protein (37Garcia C. Nishimura C. Cavagnero S. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11227-11237Google Scholar, 38Battiste J.L. Li R. Woodward C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2237-2245Google Scholar, 39Fukao T. Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Perez-Cerda C. Baldellou A. Barrionuevo C.R. Castello F.G. Kohno Y. Ugarte M. Kondo N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 235-243Google Scholar). Such a direct effect of mutations on the degree and/or rate of protein folding independently of function could be proposed for the L-CPTI-H277A and L-CPTI-H277A/H483A mutants described recently in Ref. 30Morillas M. Gomez-Puertas P. Rubi B. Clotet J. Arino J. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. Serra D. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11473-11480Google Scholar. These mutants expressed in yeast showed different sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition, depending on the time after galactose induction, the kinetics of inhibition by malonyl-CoA being affected only at the time of 1 h of induction but not after 20 h. Such time-dependent behavior of the mutants could be due to a slower kinetic of folding and not necessarily be linked to the level of protein expression and/or organization within mitochondrial membrane. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the last 31 C-terminal residues of rat L-CPTI are not involved in malonyl-CoA sensitivity but constitute a “secondary structural specificity determinant” that may prevent neighboring residues from adopting an alternate protein fold by acting as a folding initiation site."
