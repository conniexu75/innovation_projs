https://openalex.org/W1992381837,"Transient receptor potential melastatin-3 (TRPM3) is a broadly expressed Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel. Previous work has demonstrated robust activation of TRPM3 by the neuroactive steroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS), but its in vivo gating mechanisms and functions remained poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that TRPM3 functions as a chemo- and thermosensor in the somatosensory system. TRPM3 is molecularly and functionally expressed in a large subset of small-diameter sensory neurons from dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, and mediates the aversive and nocifensive behavioral responses to PS. Moreover, we demonstrate that TRPM3 is steeply activated by heating and underlies heat sensitivity in a subset of sensory neurons. TRPM3-deficient mice exhibited clear deficits in their avoidance responses to noxious heat and in the development of inflammatory heat hyperalgesia. These experiments reveal an unanticipated role for TRPM3 as a thermosensitive nociceptor channel implicated in the detection of noxious heat."

Here we show that the β4 subunit is rate limiting for receptor activity, and that current increase by β4 is maximally competed by one of the most frequent variants associated with tobacco usage (D398N in α5). We identify a β4-specific residue (S435), mapping to the intracellular vestibule of the α3β4α5 receptor in close proximity to α5 D398N, that is essential for its ability to increase currents. Transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of Chrnb4 to endogenous sites display a strong aversion to nicotine that can be reversed by viral-mediated expression of the α5 D398N variant in the medial habenula (MHb). Thus, this study both provides insights into α3β4α5 receptor-mediated mechanisms contributing to nicotine consumption, and identifies the MHb as a critical element in the circuitry controlling nicotine-dependent phenotypes.

The principal addictive component of tobacco is the plant alkaloid nicotine, which binds and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Dani and Heinemann, 1996Dani J.A. Heinemann S.

These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) include noncoding variants across the gene cluster, as well as amino acid substitutions (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). Given that cis-regulatory elements within the cluster coordinate transcription of these genes for assembly of α3β4-containing (α3β4∗) and α3β4α5 functional nAChRs (Scofield et al., 2010Scofield M.D. Tapper A.R.

Biol. 2006; 26: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the fact that a large number of SNPs map to noncoding segments of the cluster suggests that altered regulation of these genes can contribute to the pathophysiology of tobacco use. Indeed the risk for nicotine dependence seems to stem from at least two separate mechanisms: the variability in the mRNA levels of these genes and functional changes due to nonsynonymous amino acid variants (Lu et al., 2009Lu B. Su Y. Das S. Wang H. Wang Y. Liu J. Ren D. Peptide neurotransmitters activate a cation channel complex of NALCN and UNC-80.Nature. 2009; 457: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A number of mouse models with gene deletions, point mutations, or strain-specific variants in nAChR subunits have been critical to elucidate the role of the different nAChR combinations in nicotine addiction and withdrawal. For instance, α4β2 nAChRs, accounting for 80% of the high-affinity nicotine binding sites in the brain (Whiting and Lindstrom, 1988Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J.M. Characterization of bovine and human neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors using monoclonal antibodies.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3395-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are major contributors to nicotine self-administration, as shown in β2 knockout (KO) mice (Maskos et al., 2005Maskos U. Molles B.E.

McKinney S.L. Nashmi R. Schwarz J. Deshpande P. Labarca C. Whiteaker P. Marks M.J. Collins A.C. Lester H.A. Nicotine activation of alpha4∗ receptors: sufficient for reward, tolerance, and sensitization.Science. 2004; 306: 1029-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The nAChR β4 subunit is almost always coexpressed with α3, while the auxiliary α5 subunit assembles with the α3β4 combination, but can also be incorporated in α4β2 receptor complexes. The expression of the α3β4∗ nAChR combination is restricted to a few discrete brain areas, including the medial habenula (MHb) and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), and to autonomic ganglia (Zoli et al., 1995Zoli M. Le Novère N. Hill Jr., J.A. Changeux J.P. Developmental regulation of nicotinic ACh receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat central and peripheral nervous systems.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1912-1939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α3β4∗ nAChRs have a lower affinity for nicotine than α4β2 receptors and are likely less desensitized at the nicotine levels found in smokers than α4β2 nAChRs are, suggesting that α3β4∗ nAChRs could play an important role in tobacco addiction, since they retain their sensitivity to fluctuating nicotine levels in smokers (Rose, 2007Rose J.E. Multiple brain pathways and receptors underlying tobacco addiction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). β4 and α5 KO mice show similar phenotypes, including decreased signs of nicotine withdrawal symptoms (Jackson et al., 2008Jackson K.J.

It has been more difficult to assess the role of α3∗ nAChRs because KO mice die within 3 weeks after birth due to severe bladder dysfunction (Xu et al., 1999Xu W. Gelber S. Orr-Urtreger A. Armstrong D. Lewis R.A. Ou C.N. Patrick J. Role L. De Biasi M. Beaudet A.L. Megacystis, mydriasis, and ion channel defect in mice lacking the alpha3 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Here we show that α3β4α5 nAChR activity in vitro and in vivo is limited by the level of Chrnb4 expression, and that the ability of the β4 subunit to increase α3β4α5 currents depends on a single, unique residue (S435). This residue maps to the intracellular vestibule of the nAChR complex adjacent to the rs16969968 SNP in CHRNA5 (D398N), which is linked to a high risk of nicotine dependence in humans. We present a transgenic mouse model of the Chrnb4-Chrna3-Chrna5 gene cluster, referred to as Tabac (transgenic a3b4a5 cluster) mice, in which Chrnb4 overexpression enhances α3β4∗ nAChR levels, resulting in altered nicotine consumption and nicotine-conditioned place aversion (CPA). Lentiviral-mediated transduction of the MHb of Tabac mice with the D398N Chrna5 variant reversed the nicotine aversion induced by β4 overexpression. This study provides a mouse model for nicotine dependence, demonstrates a critical role for the MHb in the circuitry controlling nicotine consumption, and elucidates molecular mechanisms contributing to these phenotypes. Recently it has been shown that α5 competes with β4 for association with α4, and that this competition does not occur if β4 is substituted with β2 (Gahring and Rogers, 2010Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. Nicotinic receptor subunit alpha5 modifies assembly, up-regulation, and response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26049-26057Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Given that the CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster regulates the coexpression of α5, β4, and α3 subunits, and that SNPs in the cluster regulatory regions and nonsynonymous variants such as rs16969968 (corresponding to D398N in CHRNA5) associate with nicotine dependence (Bierut, 2010Bierut L.J.

To measure this, we performed electrophysiological recordings in oocytes injected with cRNA transcripts of the different mouse subunits. In these experiments (Figure 1), the cRNA concentration of α3 was held constant (1 ng/oocyte), whereas the concentration of β4 or β2 input cRNA was varied among 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 ng. These experiments showed that β4, but not β2, was able to increase current amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1A and 1B). β4 overexpression did not shift the dose response curves for nicotine (Figure S1A, available online). Next we held constant the concentrations of α3 and β4 at 1:10 and added the cRNA of α5 WT or α5 D397N variant (corresponding to the human α5 variant D398N) at ratios of 1:10:1, 1:10:5, and 1:10:10 (Figure 1A). We observed a significant decrease of current amplitudes at higher concentrations of α5, and this effect was significantly more pronounced with α5 D397N. These results suggest that α5 and β4 may compete for binding to α3, in line with the studies showing such competition for binding to α4 (Gahring and Rogers, 2010Gahring L.C. Rogers S.W. Nicotinic receptor subunit alpha5 modifies assembly, up-regulation, and response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26049-26057Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Given that overexpression of β2 with either α3 (Figure 1A) or α4 (Figure S1B) did not increase currents, we were interested in identifying the residues differing between β4 and β2 that mediate this effect. Since the long cytoplasmic loop is the most divergent domain between nAChR subunits (Figure S1C), and since it has been implicated in cell-surface expression and trafficking of β2 subunits (Nashmi et al., 2003Nashmi R. Dickinson M.E. McKinney S. Jareb M. Labarca C. Fraser S.E. Lester H.A. Assembly of alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors assessed with functional fluorescently labeled subunits: effects of localization, trafficking, and nicotine-induced upregulation in clonal mammalian cells and in cultured midbrain neurons.J.

Structural determinants of alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we generated β2–β4 chimeras exchanging either this domain, or short motifs and single residues within this domain. Replacement of the cytoplasmic loop of β2 with the corresponding sequences present in β4 (β2/β4 322–496) led to strong increase of nicotinic currents (Figure 1C). Introduction of two β4-specific motifs (a serine/tyrosine rich motif [β2/+β4 382–391] and gephyrin-like-binding motif [β2/+β4 401–419] into the β2 loop) had no influence on current amplitudes (Figure 1C). We next performed bioinformatic analyses and singled out eight β4-specific residues (indicated as T-1 to T-8 in Figure S1C) present within highly conserved motifs. Six of these residues were not further considered: T-2, T-3, T-6, and T-7 residues differ between mouse and chicken β4 subunits, which are equally potent in enhancing nicotine-evoked currents (Figure S1B); T-4 residue lies within the tested motif in the β2/+β4 382–391 chimera; and residues at position T-8 have the same charge (Figure S1C). The remaining two candidates, T-1 (S324 in β4 and T327 in β2) and T-7 (S435 in β4 and R431 in β2) (Figure S1C) were tested by point mutagenesis in the β2 subunit backbone. The β2 T327S point mutant did not increase current, whereas replacement of β2 R431 with serine resulted in a 3.5-fold current increase (Figure 1C). Furthermore, point mutation of the native S435 in the β4 subunit to the arginine residue present in β2 (β4 S435R) abolished the β4-specific activity. Thus, these data demonstrate that the distinctive ability of β4 to increase currents when overexpressed maps to a single residue (S435) that is required in β4 for current increase and can confer this property to β2. Alignment of mouse, human, and Torpedo nAChR subunit sequences indicated that S435 in β4 and D397N in α5 are located in the 25 amino-acid-long amphipathic membrane-associated stretch (MA-stretch) described in the Torpedo subunits (Unwin, 2005Unwin N. Refined structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 4A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ). Electron microscopy studies of the Torpedo nAChR have proposed a 3D density map of the receptor complex. In particular, these analyses predict that the MA-stretch of each subunit forms a curved α-helix that helps create, with other α-helices, an inverted pentagonal cone vestibule. To locate the S435 (β4) and D397 (α5) residues within the receptor pentamer, we performed homology modeling with the Torpedo nAChR using one possible α3β4α5 subunit arrangement. This model predicted the formation of a very similar disposition of α helices in the α3β4α5 and mapped both residues to the intracellular vestibule (Figure 2B). Electrostatic mapping of the vestibule showed a particular disposition of charges with S435 and D397 located at the more distal and positively charged part of the vestibule (Figure 2C). These data indicate first that the critical residue in β4 that mediates the β4 effect is located in the receptor structure near the most common SNP of α5 to be associated with heavy smoking; and second, that this is a highly charged domain of the receptor where single residue changes may have a particularly strong effect on receptor activity. To test the hypothesis that β4 is rate limiting for nAChR assembly and function in vivo and that overexpression of β4 can strongly influence nicotine-evoked currents and behavioral responses to nicotine, we characterized a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic line spanning the Chrnb4-Chrna3-Chrna5 gene cluster (Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The BAC transgene included the intact coding sequences of the Chrnb4 gene, modified sequences of Chrna3, and incomplete sequences of Chrna5. Chrna3 was modified by insertion of an eGFP cassette followed by polyadenylation signals at the ATG translation initiator codon of Chrna3 (Figure 3A ). The upstream sequences of Chrna5, encoding exon 1 splice variants (Flora et al., 2000Flora A. Schulz R. Benfante R. Battaglioli E. Terzano S. Clementi F. Fornasari D. Transcriptional regulation of the human alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit gene in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), are missing in the BAC transgene (Figure 3A). To promote correct expression of Chrnb4, the BAC included the intergenic and 5′ flanking regions encompassing the cis-regulatory elements that coordinate cotranscriptional control of the genes in the cluster (Bigger et al., 1997Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. Sp1 and Sp3 regulate expression of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta4 subunit gene.J. Biol.

Shared long-range regulatory elements coordinate expression of a gene cluster encoding nicotinic receptor heteromeric subtypes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As a result of these modifications in the BAC transgene, these Tabac mice express high levels of β4, but not α5 (Figure 3B), and expression of α3 is replaced by expression of an eGFP reporter cassette to monitor the sites expressing the transgene (Figures 3C–3H). As shown in Figure 3, neurons expressing eGFP were evident in autonomic ganglia (Figure 3C), and in very restricted brain structures (Figures 3D–3H) known to express these genes (Zoli et al., 1995Zoli M. Le Novère N. Hill Jr., J.A. Changeux J.P. Developmental regulation of nicotinic ACh receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat central and peripheral nervous systems.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1912-1939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining with cholinergic (ChAT) and dopaminergic (TH) markers indicated high expression of Chrna3/eGFP in ChAT neurons of the Hb-IPN system (Figures 3G and 3H). Intense Chrna3/eGFP expression was also detected in other brain areas (Figures 3D and 3E) involved in nicotine addiction, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the caudal linear nucleus (Cli), the supramammilary nucleus (SuM) (Ikemoto et al., 2006Ikemoto S. Qin M. Liu Z.H. Primary reinforcing effects of nicotine are triggered from multiple regions both inside and outside the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (Figure 3F), which provides modulatory input to the VTA (Maskos, 2008Maskos U. The cholinergic mesopontine tegmentum is a relatively neglected nicotinic master modulator of the dopaminergic system: relevance to drugs of abuse and pathology.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: S438-S445PubMed Google Scholar). We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments to verify that the BAC accurately directed expression of transgenic Chrnb4 transcripts to eGFP-positive brain areas. Tabac mice showed a prominent enrichment of Chrnb4 transcripts in α3β4∗-positive areas, such as MHb and IPN, and in brain areas that have been shown to express lower levels of Chrnb4, such as SuM (Dineley-Miller and Patrick, 1992Dineley-Miller K. Patrick J. Gene transcripts for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit, beta4, are distributed in multiple areas of the rat central nervous system.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and VTA (Yang et al., 2009Yang K. Hu J. Lucero L. Liu Q. Zheng C. Zhen X. Jin G. Lukas R.J. Wu J. Distinctive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor functional phenotypes of rat ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 345-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figures 3I and 3J). RT-PCR studies showed that Chrna4, Chrna7, and Chrnb2 transcripts (which are not present in the BAC) are not altered in Tabac mice (Figure S2). Taken together these data show that Tabac mice express high levels of β4, but not α5, in α3/eGFP-labeled cells in CNS and PNS structures known to express the Chrnb4-Chrna3-Chrna5 nicotinic gene cluster, and are thus a useful mouse model in which to test the consequences of enhanced β4 expression at endogenous sites. Given the demonstration that the level of β4 expression is rate limiting for the function of α3β4α5 receptors in vitro (Figure 1), we were next interested in determining whether enhanced expression of Chrnb4 in Tabac neurons resulted in elevated nicotine-evoked currents in vivo. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the MHb express high levels of α3β4α5 receptors (Quick et al., 1999Quick M.W. Ceballos R.M. Kasten M. McIntosh J.M. Lester R.A. Alpha3beta4 subunit-containing nicotinic receptors dominate function in rat medial habenula neurons.Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we employed patch-clamp recordings to measure nicotine-evoked currents in MHb neurons of Tabac mice. A large proportion of MHb neurons in WT mice (n = 20 of n = 23 neurons recorded) responded to local fast application (50 ms) of nicotine (Figures 4A and 4B ). In Chrna3/eGFP-labeled MHb neurons of Tabac mice, nicotine elicited significantly increased peak currents in comparison to WT littermates (on average, 3.4-fold at 100 μM nicotine, two-way ANOVA, p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). Similarly increased responses were obtained using acetylcholine (ACh) (data not shown). Dose-response curves for nicotine showed no significant differences between WT and Tabac mice, indicating that the affinity of the receptors in the transgenic mice is not altered (Figure 4C). Application of mecamylamine (MEC), a nonselective potent inhibitor of α4β2∗ and α3β4∗ nAChRs (Bacher et al., 2009Bacher I. Wu B. Shytle D.R. George T.P. Mecamylamine - a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist with potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2009; 10: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), resulted in a blockade of as much as 90% of the nicotine-elicited responses in Tabac mice (Figure 4D), demonstrating that the enhanced nicotine responses in Tabac neurons result directly from elevated levels of functional nAChRs. To determine whether these additional receptors cause enhanced neuronal excitability, the firing rate of habenular neurons was measured in current-clamp assays in response to nicotine. Neurons from WT and Tabac mice were silent at rest (−70 mV). Local nicotine application (1 μM for 3 s) elicited single action potentials in WT neurons, whereas nicotine induced a robust burst of action potentials with a 13-fold higher firing frequency on average in Tabac neurons (p < 0.005) (Figures 4E and 4F). Together, these results indicate that the increased sensitivity of MHb neurons to nicotine in Tabac mice results from the presence of additional functional nAChRs, rather than from changes in the nicotine affinity of existing receptors. To assay for elevated receptor expression across different brain structures, we performed autoradiographic radioligand binding assays with iodinated epibatidine, which mainly binds α4β2∗ and α3β4∗ nAChRs (Perry and Kellar, 1995Perry D.C. Kellar K.J. [3H]epibatidine labels nicotinic receptors in rat brain: an autoradiographic study.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1030-1034PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 5A and 5B ). Competition with cold cytisine, which binds with higher affinity to α4β2∗ than to α3β4∗ receptors (Marks et al., 2010Marks M.J. Laverty D.S. Whiteaker P. Salminen O. Grady S.R. McIntosh J.M. Collins A.C. John Daly's compound, epibatidine, facilitates identification of nicotinic receptor subtypes.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2010; 40: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was done to distinguish α3β4∗ from overlapping α4β2∗ binding sites (Zoli et al., 1998Zoli M. Léna C. Picciotto M.R. Changeux J.P. Identification of four classes of brain nicotinic receptors using beta2 mutant mice.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4461-4472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 5C and 5D). In WT mice, discrete brain regions resistant to cytisine competition labeled well-known α3β4∗ sites such as MHb, IPN, and superior colliculus (Figure 5C). In Tabac mice, increased radioligand binding to cytisine-resistant sites was detected in these areas and in additional brain structures, including the VTA, SuM, substantia nigra, and striatum (Figure 5D). A strong correlation between radioligand signal and eGFP fluorescence was detected in all analyzed CNS structures (Figure 5E and Table S1). Densitometric analyses indicated significantly increased cytisine-resistant signals in α3β4∗-expressing regions in Tabac mice (Table S1), while α4β2∗ epibatidine binding sites such as cortex and thalamus did not differ between control and Tabac mice (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that elevated surface receptors are present in sites corresponding to endogenous β4 expression sites. To exclude the possibility that the increased radioligand signal could reflect increased cell number, we quantified the cell density in MHb of Tabac and WT mice and observed no significant differences (Figure S3). These data show that the enhanced nicotine-evoked currents in Tabac mice result from β4-mediated recruitment of additional functional α3β4∗ nAChR complexes on the cell surface. Taken together, the anatomic mapping and ISH results presented in Figure 3 and the"
https://openalex.org/W2012440423,"The dominant view that perceptual learning is accompanied by changes in early sensory representations has recently been challenged. Here we tested the idea that perceptual learning can be accounted for by reinforcement learning involving changes in higher decision-making areas. We trained subjects on an orientation discrimination task involving feedback over 4 days, acquiring fMRI data on the first and last day. Behavioral improvements were well explained by a reinforcement learning model in which learning leads to enhanced readout of sensory information, thereby establishing noise-robust representations of decision variables. We find stimulus orientation encoded in early visual and higher cortical regions such as lateral parietal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, only activity patterns in the ACC tracked changes in decision variables during learning. These results provide strong evidence for perceptual learning-related changes in higher order areas and suggest that perceptual and reward learning are based on a common neurobiological mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2138895288,"In natural situations, movements are often directed toward locations different from that of the evoking sensory stimulus. Movement goals must then be inferred from the sensory cue based on rules. When there is uncertainty about the rule that applies for a given cue, planning a movement involves both choosing the relevant rule and computing the movement goal based on that rule. Under these conditions, it is not clear whether primates compute multiple movement goals based on all possible rules before choosing an action, or whether they first choose a rule and then only represent the movement goal associated with that rule. Supporting the former hypothesis, we show that neurons in the frontoparietal reach areas of monkeys simultaneously represent two different rule-based movement goals, which are biased by the monkeys' choice preferences. Apparently, primates choose between multiple behavioral options by weighing against each other the movement goals associated with each option."
https://openalex.org/W2132098040,"Ecological relationships of krill and whales have not been explored in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), and have only rarely been studied elsewhere in the Southern Ocean. In the austral autumn we observed an extremely high density (5.1 whales per km(2)) of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding on a super-aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in Wilhelmina Bay. The krill biomass was approximately 2 million tons, distributed over an area of 100 km(2) at densities of up to 2000 individuals m(-3); reports of such 'super-aggregations' of krill have been absent in the scientific literature for >20 years. Retentive circulation patterns in the Bay entrained phytoplankton and meso-zooplankton that were grazed by the krill. Tagged whales rested during daylight hours and fed intensively throughout the night as krill migrated toward the surface. We infer that the previously unstudied WAP embayments are important foraging areas for whales during autumn and, furthermore, that meso-scale variation in the distribution of whales and their prey are important features of this system. Recent decreases in the abundance of Antarctic krill around the WAP have been linked to reductions in sea ice, mediated by rapid climate change in this area. At the same time, baleen whale populations in the Southern Ocean, which feed primarily on krill, are recovering from past exploitation. Consideration of these features and the effects of climate change on krill dynamics are critical to managing both krill harvests and the recovery of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W1976272474,"The regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals and metabolic imbalances is a key step in maintaining cellular homeostasis. BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is a heme-binding transcription factor repressing the transcription from a subset of MAF recognition elements at low intracellular heme levels. Upon heme binding, BACH1 is released from the MAF recognition elements, resulting in increased expression of antioxidant response genes. To systematically address the gene regulatory networks involving BACH1, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of BACH1 target genes in HEK 293 cells with knockdown of BACH1 using three independent types of small interfering RNAs followed by transcriptome profiling using microarrays. The 59 BACH1 target genes identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing were found highly enriched in genes showing expression changes after BACH1 knockdown, demonstrating the impact of BACH1 repression on transcription. In addition to known and new BACH1 targets involved in heme degradation (HMOX1, FTL, FTH1, ME1, and SLC48A1) and redox regulation (GCLC, GCLM, and SLC7A11), we also discovered BACH1 target genes affecting cell cycle and apoptosis pathways (ITPR2, CALM1, SQSTM1, TFE3, EWSR1, CDK6, BCL2L11, and MAFG) as well as subcellular transport processes (CLSTN1, PSAP, MAPT, and vault RNA). The newly identified impact of BACH1 on genes involved in neurodegenerative processes and proliferation provides an interesting basis for future dissection of BACH1-mediated gene repression in neurodegeneration and virus-induced cancerogenesis.

The newly identified impact of BACH1 on genes involved in neurodegenerative processes and proliferation provides an interesting basis for future dissection of BACH1-mediated gene repression in neurodegeneration and virus-induced cancerogenesis. The coupling of key metabolic activities and gene expression is central to the coordination of cellular homeostasis. The transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is a heme-binding protein belonging to the cap‘n'collar type of basic leucine zipper factors and constitutes a major link between the cellular heme level, the redox state, and the transcriptional response. BACH1 was identified as a key player in the physiological regulation of oxidative stress, where it acts as a repressor of its main target, HMOX1 (1Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting enzyme of the heme degradation pathway that cleaves heme to form ferrous iron and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin, a potent radical scavenger, and carbon monoxide. Although heme is essential to life, it can exert toxic effects through its ability to catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species, whose action is counterbalanced by HMOX1. The regulation of HMOX1 expression involves a direct sensing of heme levels by BACH1, an analogy with the lac repressor sensitivity to lactose, generating a feedback loop whereby the substrate effects a repressor-activator antagonism (2Hira S. Tomita T. Matsui T. Igarashi K. Ikeda-Saito M. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Heme induces export of BACH1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (3Suzuki H.

Iwai K. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6962-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Other BACH1 targets include the NAD(P)H menadione oxidoreductase 1 (6Dhakshinamoorthy S.

Plummer S.M. Higgins L.G. Penning T.M. Igarashi K. Hayes J.D. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Bach1 can bind the p53 apoptosis effector Perp and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A together with p53, resulting in negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence (9Dohi Y. Ikura T. Hoshikawa Y. Katoh Y. Ota K. Nakanome A. Muto A. Omura S. Ohta T. Ito A. Yoshida M. Noda T. Igarashi K. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Among other proteins involved in the heme degradation pathway, HMOX1 and the biliverdin reductases A and B were proposed as serum biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer disease (10Mueller C. Zhou W. Vanmeter A. Heiby M. Magaki S. Ross M.M. Espina V. Schrag M. Dickson C. Liotta L.A. Kirsch W.M. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 19: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BACH1 expression was down-regulated by microRNAs in viral infection-associated cancerogenesis (11Miyazaki T. Kirino Y. Takeno M. Samukawa S. Hama M. Tanaka M. Yamaji S. Ueda A. Tomita N.

At low heme levels, BACH1 forms heterodimers with small MAF proteins and functions as a competitive repressor at MAF recognition elements (MAREs). 2The abbreviations used are: MAREMAF recognition elementChIP-seqchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencingesiRNAendoribonuclease-prepared siRNARPKMreads per kilobase and million readsTSStranscription start siteGCLCglutamate-cysteine ligase catalyticGCLMglutamate-cysteine ligase modifierMAFGmusculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog GMAPTmicrotubule-associated protein TauPSAPprosaposin. In this, BACH1 competes with nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2, also termed NRF2), which acts as a transcriptional activator at MAREs together with small MAFs (14Sun J. Brand M. Zenke Y. Tashiro S. Groudine M. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NFE2L2 controls the expression of genes associated with antioxidant response elements encoding, among others, a number of phase II detoxification enzymes. NFE2L2 is recognized as master redox switch in turning on the cellular signaling involved in the induction of cytoprotective genes in response to oxidative stress. The binding of NFE2L2 to antioxidant response elements is regulated through competition with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) and BACH1 (8MacLeod A.K. McMahon M. Plummer S.M. Higgins L.G.

However, the full subset of MARE-driven genes regulated by BACH1 has not been characterized systematically, although BACH1 knockdown by arsenite identified a small set of potential genes (17Reichard J.F.

To address the global gene regulatory networks involving BACH1, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) as well as knockdown of the BACH1 transcription factor in HEK 293 cells using three independent small interfering RNAs. The integration of the genome-wide data sets allowed the identification of transcriptional regulatory networks targeted by BACH1 to outline associated metabolic and signal transduction pathways. Additional information on the experimental procedures can be found in the supplemental material. Chromatin immunoprecipitation from HEK 293 cells was performed as described previously (18Schmidt D. Wilson M.D. Spyrou C. Brown G.D. Hadfield J. Odom D.T. Methods. 2009; 48: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) using a well characterized goat polyclonal BACH1 antibody (sc-14700X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The input and ChIP DNA were used for preparation of sequencing libraries according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Illumina Genome Analyzer, with some modifications. After PCR preamplification, size selection was performed by agarose gel electrophoresis, excision, and purification of DNA fragments in the range of 150–250 bp. The purified libraries were sequenced on an Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome (UCSC hg18) using the Eland algorithm allowing up to two mismatches without insertions or deletions, resulting in 8,153,703 ChIP reads and 8,008,492 control reads with unique match to the genome. Redundant reads were removed for identification of candidate peak regions using QuEST-2.4 (19Valouev A. Johnson D.S. Sundquist A. Medina C. Anton E. Batzoglou S. Myers R.M. Sidow A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). After removal of artifactual peaks, we obtained a final list of 84 BACH1-bound genomic regions. The 300-bp genomic sequences surrounding each peak were extracted for MEME motif over-representation analysis (20Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar) with default parameters. The strongest log-odds matrix from the MEME output was compared with known motifs in the Transfac data base using TOMTOM (21Gupta S. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Bailey T.L. Noble W.S. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and was used for MAST motif search (22Bailey T.L. Gribskov M. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) in the peak sequences. Average conservation scores for peaks and DNA-binding motifs were determined using Galaxy (23Taylor J. Schenck I. Blankenberg D. Nekrutenko A. Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2007; (Chapter 10, Unit 10.15)PubMed Google Scholar) with phastCons on 17-species multiZ alignment of UCSC hg18. Conservation plots were obtained from the cis-regulatory element annotation system (CEAS) (24Ji X. Li W. Song J. Wei L. Liu X.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W551-W554Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nearby RefSeq genes within 15 kb of the peak regions were annotated using CisGenome version 1.2 (25Ji H. Jiang H. Ma W. Johnson D.S. Myers R.M. Wong W.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). RNA interference experiments for BACH1 were performed using three independent types of silencing molecules against BACH1, one unmodified synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA1, Qiagen SI00309876), one chemically modified synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA2) (HSS100910, Invitrogen), and one independent high complexity pool of 20–30-bp siRNA-like molecules (esiRNA). HEK 293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates together with esiRNA-HiPerFect complexes or siRNA-HiPerFect complexes according to the HiPerFect fast forward protocol (Qiagen). For the mock transfections, cells were treated with HiPerFect reagent only. Knockdown transfections were performed in triplicates and mock transfections and nontransfections in quadruplicate. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells at 24 and 72 h post-transfection using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. All RNA samples were DNase-treated, purified, quantified, and inspected for integrity. For quantitative real time PCR analysis, complementary DNA was prepared from total RNA. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with random hexamer primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For hybridizations on microarrays, biotinylated cRNA was synthesized using the GeneChip expression 3′ amplification one-cycle target labeling and control reagents (Affymetrix). Following integrity control, the cRNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U133Plus2. The arrays were washed, stained, and scanned following recommended protocols from Affymetrix. The knockdown efficiency of each silencing molecule was measured 24 and 72 h after transfection, both at the BACH1 mRNA and protein level. The genome-wide expression changes from the BACH1 knockdowns were analyzed in triplicate, together with four controls (mock transfections). The array probe intensities from the knockdown samples were normalized together with those from the control samples using GCRMA from the R/Bioconductor package (26Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S. Irizarry R. Leisch F. Li C. Maechler M. Rossini A.J. Sawitzki G. Smith C. Smyth G. Tierney L. Yang J.Y. Zhang J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Probes with significant expression changes were defined by a p value<0.05 from t test and expression ratio >1.3 or <0.75. Genes with significant expression changes were defined by significant changes of the same probes among at least two of three different RNAi experiments. Gene ontology enrichment analysis among up-regulated genes was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (27Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ChIP enrichment as compared with input DNA was calculated from quantitative real time PCR results as fold-enrichment according to the ΔΔCt method (28Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) with 20 pg/μl ChIP or input DNA. The primer sequences can be found in the supplemental material. The knockdown efficiency for the BACH1 mRNA and expression changes of the vault RNAs VTRNA1-1 and VTRNA1-2 was calculated from quantitative real time PCR results as fold-changes compared with β-actin (ACTB) according to the ΔΔCt method. PCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) with a cDNA concentration of 12.5 ng/μl RNA equivalent from reverse transcription. The primer sequences can be found in the supplemental material. ChIP-seq reads were quantified in reads/kb and million aligned reads values (RPKM) as described before (29Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (10028) Google Scholar). Mean expression ratios from the different RNAi experiments were calculated as arithmetic mean of the individual ratios. The S.E. was calculated as the root of the mean squared S.E. of the individual RNAi experiments. To assess the correlation between RPKM values and RNAi expression ratios, we calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Promoter sequences of 2 kb length, stretching 1.8 kb upstream to 200 bp downstream of the respective TSS, were used for transcription factor affinity prediction as described before (30Roider H.G. Kanhere A. Manke T. Vingron M. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) using 554 transcription factor binding matrices in TransFac (version 12.1) and a human promoter-based background model. p values for the individual sequences were combined by Fisher's method and multiple test-corrected according to Benjamini-Hochberg. The top-ranking factors described under “Results” met the additional thresholds of a combined and corrected p <10−29 and a mean affinity score across the whole sequence sets of at least 0.01 (for up-regulated genes) or 0.005 (for down-regulated genes). We identified the genome-wide gene targets of BACH1 by ChIP-seq experiments in HEK 293 cells, taking advantage of the endogenous expression of BACH1 in this cell line (31Warnatz H.J. Querfurth R. Guerasimova A. Cheng X. Haas S.A. Hufton A.L. Manke T. Vanhecke D. Nietfeld W. Vingron M. Janitz M. Lehrach H. Yaspo M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6112-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We obtained a 137-fold enrichment of the known BACH1-binding enhancer region upstream of the HMOX1 gene (supplemental Fig. 1). We compared the sequencing output (Illumina Genome Analyzer GA1) of the enriched ChIP DNA with that of the control (input) DNA. From 8.15 million reads with unique alignment to the human genome, we identified 84 significantly enriched regions defining sharp peaks of ChIP reads (see supplemental Table 1) using the QuEST-2.4 package (19Valouev A. Johnson D.S. Sundquist A. Medina C. Anton E. Batzoglou S. Myers R.M. Sidow A. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For validation, we performed quantitative real time PCR analysis of 10 BACH1 target regions ranging from weak to strong binding based on the read density, using the DNAs from two independent ChIP experiments. The ChIP-seq and the ChIP-quantitative real time PCR results showed a strong correlation (R2 = 0.878; supplemental Fig. 2), demonstrating experimental reproducibility among biological replicates using different experimental techniques. We proceeded to the discovery of transcription factor binding motifs in the 300-bp sequences around all BACH1 peaks using the MEME algorithm (20Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a highly significant sequence motif (E = 10−203, Fig. 1A) reminiscent of three previously known motifs, namely that of BACH1 deduced from in vitro studies (32Kanezaki R. Toki T. Yokoyama M. Yomogida K. Sugiyama K. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Ito E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and those of its competitors NFE2L2 (1Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and NRF1:MAFG (33Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, the newly identified consensus sequence captured the in vivo binding motif more accurately and differed by three nucleotide positions from the previously reported BACH1 motif (Fig. 1A). This binding motif was found present in 80 of the 84 identified peaks. About half of these peaks (55%) contained only one binding motif, whereas the other peaks harbored two, three, or more motifs (Fig. 1B). The highest numbers of BACH1-binding motifs were seen in the promoter of HMOX1 (seven motifs) and of the noncoding gene AFG3L1 (36 motifs). The resolution of the ChIP-seq approach was high, given that the average distance between the identified motifs and the centers of the BACH1 binding peaks was only 12 bp, with 74% of the motifs residing within 50 bp around the peak centers. The genomic binding motif sequences showed a strong conservation among mammals (phastCons on 17-species multiZ alignment), with significantly higher conservation of the motifs than the surrounding 2 kb of genomic sequence (Fig. 1C). The distance between adjacent motifs ranged between 1 and 65 bp, with over-representation of distances of 7 bp (10 motif pairs in AFG3L1 and 1 in SLC25A10) as well as 21 bp (11 motif pairs in AFG3L1), pointing to BACH1 homo- or heterodimerization (see supplemental Fig. 3 for an example region in the AFG3L1 gene). To assess whether the sequencing coverage was high enough to detect the majority of the BACH1-bound regions, we calculated the dynamic range of our BACH1 ChIP-seq approach. After sub-sampling of smaller read populations, we repeated the peak calling with the same parameters and calculated the rank abundance curve for the called peaks (Fig. 2A). This saturation analysis showed that eight million aligned reads were sufficient to call the majority of binding peaks. From extrapolation of the curve, it could be deduced that doubling the number of sequencing reads would have increased the number of called peaks by about 20%. Fig. 2A shows that the vast majority of BACH1-bound genomic regions in HEK 293 cells has been detected here. To identify the BACH1 target genes, we investigated the location of the 84 BACH1-bound regions relative to nearby genes. A total of 67 peaks were located within 15 kb of a gene (Fig. 2B), of which 28 peaks were in promoter regions or at the TSS, 32 were intragenic, and 7 were found downstream of genes. The remaining 17 peaks were located more than 15 kb away from any annotated genes. Nevertheless, 12 of those peaks showed conservation among placental mammals, suggesting that they could be functional. Indeed, in seven cases, the conserved region was associated with features evoking transcriptional activity, from either neighboring CpG islands (34Bock C. Walter J. Paulsen M. Lengauer T. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e110Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), TSS sequencing (35Yamashita R. Wakaguri H. Sugano S. Suzuki Y. Nakai K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D98-D104Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), or expressed sequence tags. Four of these conserved peaks were located within 5 kb of RNA polymerase IIA-bound regions in HEK 293 cells, and two of these peaks showed putative exons defined by mRNA sequencing read clusters within 15 kb (36Sultan M. Schulz M.H. Richard H. Magen A. Klingenhoff A. Scherf M. Seifert M. Borodina T. Soldatov A. Parkhomchuk D. Schmidt D. O'Keeffe S. Haas S. Vingron M. Lehrach H. Yaspo M.L. Science. 2008; 321: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Regarding the five intergenic peaks without mammalian conservation, we found expressed sequence tags defining nonannotated potential target genes for four of these, and nearby mRNA sequencing read clusters for two of these. Altogether, 67 BACH1 peaks were found associated with nearby genes, and 16 of 17 intergenic peaks were located in regions displaying features suggesting transcriptional activity. We assigned the potential target genes to the 67 peaks close to genes and identified a total of 59 genes representing the primary targets of BACH1 in HEK 293 cells according to our ChIP-seq analysis (see supplemental Table 2). We found all of the previously known BACH1 target genes, including heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), the ferritin heavy and light chains (FTH1 and FTL), the NAD(P)H menadione oxidoreductase (NQO2), and the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits (GCLC and GCLM), except for thioredoxin reductase 1, which was not bound by BACH1 in this cell line. Newly identified target genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes were the malic enzyme ME1, the aldolase ALDOA, and the transketolase TKT. We identified additional target genes involved in cellular transport processes (including the cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A11, the mitochondrial dicarboxylate transporter SLC25A10, the heme transporter SLC48A1, prosaposin, and the microtubule-associated proteins Tau and calsyntenin 1). Interestingly, we also identified a significant number of target genes involved in signal transduction (calmodulin 1 and COPS6), cell cycle regulation (CDK6, MAFG, EWSR1, and LRRC8D), and apoptosis (BCL2L11, sequestosome 1, RHBDD3, and the tumor necrosis factor receptor TNFRSF1A), indicating an important function of BACH1 at the crossroads of cellular redox control and cell cycle progression. Three genes were found associated with more than one BACH1 binding peak (AFG3L1 with nine peaks and HMOX1 and SQSTM1 with two peaks each), whereas two peaks were located in the bidirectional promoters of ZNF3/COPS6 and RHBDD3/EWSR1. In addition to 55 protein-coding genes, we could annotate two noncoding genes (AFG3L1 and ANXA2P2) and two noncoding vault RNA genes (VTRNA1-1 and VTRNA1-2) as BACH1 targets. Except for two cases (KIAA1751 and MXRA8), all targets were associated with BACH1-binding motifs. We investigated the distance of the 67 BACH1 peaks near genes relative to the closest associated TSS (Fig. 2C) and found a preference for the peaks to reside within 5 kb upstream of a TSS. Another fraction of the gene-associated peaks (45%) were found far downstream (>15 kb) of the respective TSSs, showing that BACH1 binding is not only found in the promoter/TSS regions, but also inside genes. We compared the target genes of BACH1 in HEK 293 with the recently described list of functional Nfe2l2 target genes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (37Malhotra D. Portales-Casamar E. Singh A. Srivastava S. Arenillas D. Happel C. Shyr C. Wakabayashi N. Kensler T.W. Wasserman W.W. Biswal S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5718-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Of the 59 BACH1 target genes in the human cells, 15 genes were also functional Nrf2 targets in the mouse cells. Among those were genes involved in iron ion homeostasis (Hmox1, Fth1, and Slc48a1), redox regulation (Gclm, Gclc, Tkt, and Slc7a11), cell cycle/apoptosis regulation (Sqstm1, Itpr2, Mafg, Sema3e, and Tnfrsf1a), and intracellular transport (Clstn1 and Synj2), as well as Srcrb4d, a soluble member of the scavenger receptor family. The considerable overlap of BACH1 and Nrf2 target genes between human and mouse further validates the present data and shows the strong evolutionary conservation of the core BACH1-NFE2L2 regulatory network. We performed knockdown experiments of BACH1 in HEK 293 cells by means of RNA interference (RNAi) and interrogated the transcriptome response by hybridization on microarrays (Affymetrix U133Plus2) at 24 and 72 h post-transfection. We used three different types of silencing molecules as follows: one high complexity pool of 20–30 bp of siRNA-like molecules (esiRNA) and two independent synthetic small interfering RNA molecules without and with chemical modification (siRNA1 and siRNA2, respectively; see supplemental Methods for details). Three replicate RNAi experiments were performed for each silencing molecule, and four replicates were performed for the controls (mock transfections, see supplemental Methods). We minimized artifactual off-target effects by considering only common targets of at least two independent silencing molecules. Consequently, genes with significant expression changes were defined by changes of the same probes among at least two of three different RNAi experiments with an expression ratio >1.3 or ratio <0.75 and a p value <0.05 from t test. Besides, we ruled out the activation of the interferon response at both time points, based on the expression analysis of six canonical genes of this pathways (IFNB1, IRF9, IFITM1, MX1, OAS1, and OAS2), ensuring the integrity of the dataset. As expected, we observed a significant reduction of the BACH1 mRNA (down by 74–78%) with all three silencing molecules at both time points and a virtually complete knockdown of the BACH1 protein at 72 h (supplemental Fig. 4). Consistent with the view that BACH1 is mainly a transcr"

Large datasets on genetic polymorphism that can provide an historical benchmark against which to test for recent evolutionary responses are very rare, but an exception is found in the brown-lipped banded snail (Cepaea nemoralis). This species is sensitive to its thermal environment and exhibits several polymorphisms of shell colour and banding pattern affecting shell albedo in the majority of populations within its native range in Europe. We tested for evolutionary changes in shell albedo that might have been driven by the warming of the climate in Europe over the last half century by compiling an historical dataset for 6,515 native populations of C. nemoralis and comparing this with new data on nearly 3,000 populations. The new data were sampled mainly in 2009 through the Evolution MegaLab, a citizen science project that engaged thousands of volunteers in 15 countries throughout Europe in the biggest such exercise ever undertaken. A known geographic cline in the frequency of the colour phenotype with the highest albedo (yellow) was shown to have persisted and a difference in colour frequency between woodland and more open habitats was confirmed, but there was no general increase in the frequency of yellow shells. This may have been because snails adapted to a warming climate through behavioural thermoregulation. By contrast, we detected an unexpected decrease in the frequency of Unbanded shells and an increase in the Mid-banded morph. Neither of these evolutionary changes appears to be a direct response to climate change, indicating that the influence of other selective agents, possibly related to changing predation pressure and habitat change with effects on micro-climate."

IntroductionThe transient receptor potential (TRP) 3The abbreviations used are: TRPtransient receptor potentialMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinCRACcholesterol recognition amino acid consensusDRMdetergent-resistant membranesDSMdetergent-soluble membranes. family of ion channels is found throughout the animal kingdom and has been shown to subserve numerous functions. One extensively studied member of this family is the TRPV1 (Vanilloid 1) channel. Structurally, TRPV1 is thought to be a tetramer comprised of subunits each with six transmembrane domains (S1–S6), with the putative pore of the channel located between S5 and S6. It also contains large intracellular amino and carboxyl termini that have been shown to be involved both in channel gating and regulation (for review, see Ref. 1Jara-Oseguera A. Simon S.A. Rosenbaum T. Curr. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 1: 255-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies have shown that TRPV1 is an outwardly rectifying, non-selective, and calcium-permeable cation channel (2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar).Although TRPV1 is found in many organs, it is predominantly expressed in primary sensory neurons where it acts as a sensor and integrator for noxious stimuli (2Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar). In addition to being a temperature sensor and weakly voltage-dependent, TRPV1 is sensitive to a variety of chemicals (1Jara-Oseguera A. Simon S.A. Rosenbaum T. Curr. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 1: 255-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among its many chemical agonists is capsaicin, the principal pungent compound in chili peppers. The intracellular binding pocket for capsaicin has been identified in a region that spans from S2 to S4 (for review, see Ref. 1Jara-Oseguera A. Simon S.A. Rosenbaum T. Curr. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 1: 255-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to capsaicin, many complex amphiphilic molecules have been shown to activate or inhibit TRPV1. These include polyring compounds such as resiniferatoxin (3Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), quinazolinone (4Culshaw A.J. Bevan S.

Pharmacol. 2008; 1: 255-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, TRPV1 activity is regulated by the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate (9Stein A.T. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Hua L. Santana L.F. Gordon S.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 10Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Klein R.M. Hua L. Angueyra J. Gordon S.E. J. Biol.

PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e46Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).Another important membrane lipid in terms of TRPV1 activity is cholesterol (Fig. 1). Cholesterol is a major component of plasma membranes where it increases bilayer mechanical strength, thereby helping to prevent cell lysis (12Salton M.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1968; 52: 227-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Importantly, cholesterol has been shown to modify the function of many classes of ion channels (for review, see Ref. 13Levitan I. Fang Y. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Romanenko V. Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 51: 509-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cholesterol can modify channel activity indirectly by altering the thickness and elastic properties of the surrounding lipid bilayer (14Levitan I. Christian A.E. Tulenko T.N. Rothblat G.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, in recent years compelling evidence has shown a specific interaction between cholesterol and several protein channels (13Levitan I. Fang Y. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Romanenko V. Subcell. Biochem. 2010; 51: 509-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Levitan I. IUBMB Life. 2009; 61: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). That is, based on experiments with structural analogs of cholesterol and channels with specific point mutations, it has been found that cholesterol binds to certain channel proteins, including some with structural similarities to TRPV1 (16Singh D.K. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Nichols C.G. Enkvetchakul D. Levitan I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30727-30736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For either of these indirect or direct mechanisms, cholesterol modifies the energy difference between the open and closed states of the channel.Previous studies of the effect of cholesterol on TRPV1 in whole cells showed that cholesterol depletion by incubation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) causes large decreases in capsaicin-evoked responses (17Liu M. Huang W. Wu D. Priestley J.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Szoke E. Börzsei R. Tóth D.M. Lengl O. Helyes Z. Sándor Z. Szolcsányi J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 628: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Both studies suggest that these effects could be due to TRPV1 being functional only when present in cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains (rafts) that can modulate the activity of some receptors and transport proteins. However, cholesterol depletion from whole cells also reduces TRPV1 concentration in the plasma membrane, thus making it difficult to determine whether the observed results are due to cholesterol effects on: 1) TRPV1 located in the plasma membrane or 2) TRPV1 trafficking in the cell (17Liu M. Huang W. Wu D. Priestley J.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Given this information, we thought it important to further explore the mechanisms by which cholesterol modifies TRPV1 activity. To avoid possible effects of TRPV1 cellular trafficking, we measured capsaicin-activated currents by patch clamping excised plasma membranes from HEK293 cells containing heterologously expressed rTRPV1. We found that the rTRPV1 currents were not changed by cholesterol depletion, but were markedly decreased by cholesterol enrichment, indicating that rTRPV1 function was modulated by cholesterol concentration in the plasma membrane. Therefore we also determined the membrane microdomain location of rTRPV1.To determine whether there were specific cholesterol-binding sites in rTRPV1 three additional series of patch clamp experiments were performed. First, epicholesterol (α-3-OH-cholesterol epimeric form) was substituted for cholesterol (see Fig. 1), as previously done with other channels (16Singh D.K. Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Nichols C.G. Enkvetchakul D. Levitan I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30727-30736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Second, capsaicin-induced currents were measured for membranes transfected with rTRPV1s with specific point mutations in the S5 transmembrane helix, which has a sequence consistent with the cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC) sequence found in several transmembrane proteins that bind cholesterol (20Hanson M.A. Cherezov V. Griffith M.T. Roth C.B. Jaakola V.P. Chien E.Y. Velasquez J. Kuhn P. Stevens R.C. Structure. 2008; 16: 897-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 21Oddi S. Dainese E. Fezza F. Lanuti M. Barcaroli D. De Laurenzi V. Centonze D. Maccarrone M. J. Neurochem. 2011; 116: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Third, currents were measured for two common hTRPV1 variants with the same S5 sequence as wild-type rTRPV1 except for one amino acid residue in the hydrophobic region of the helix. In addition, experiments were performed to determine whether cholesterol enrichment also modified heat-activated and voltage-activated TRPV1. The results from these experiments indicate that there is a cholesterol-binding site in the TRPV1 S5 helix that when occupied by cholesterol prevents the channels from opening.DISCUSSIONIn these studies we have shown that cholesterol, an important component of cell plasma membranes, modulates the function of the cation-selective channel TRPV1. Although depletion of membrane cholesterol had no effect on capsaicin-induced TRPV1 currents, augmentation of cholesterol markedly reduced these currents in both wild-type rat TRPV1 and one of the major human variants of TRPV1. Specifically, we found that the addition of cholesterol inhibits TRPV1 by binding to specific sites along the S5 helix having a putative CRAC motif. These data suggest the extent cholesterol alters the function of TRPV1 is dependent on the species and membrane cholesterol content.All of the electrophysiology experiments reported in this article were performed on patches excised from HEK293 cells with heterologously expressed rTRPV1 channels. Therefore, the observed effects of membrane cholesterol depletion or augmentation had to be due to changes within this excised membrane, rather than to possible modifications in cell trafficking. We found that cholesterol depletion had no effect on the currents (Fig. 2), which contrasts to electrophysiological data from whole cells where cholesterol depletion reduced capsaicin-induced currents (17Liu M. Huang W. Wu D. Priestley J.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Szoke E. Börzsei R. Tóth D.M. Lengl O. Helyes Z. Sándor Z. Szolcsányi J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 628: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We argue that this means that the observed results in whole cells upon MβCD treatment were due to the role of cholesterol in membrane trafficking in the cell, consistent with the observation that cholesterol depletion decreased the concentration of rTRPV1 in the plasma membrane (17Liu M. Huang W. Wu D. Priestley J.V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the results of Liu et al. (41Liu B. Hui K. Qin F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2988-3006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) who found for whole cells that cholesterol removal caused no appreciable change in temperature-induced rTRPV1 currents over a range of temperatures (44 to 50 °C).In contrast to the non-effect of cholesterol depletion, cholesterol augmentation significantly and reversibly reduced capsaicin-induced rTRPV1 currents (Fig. 2). In terms of molecular mechanism, the similarity in shape of the dose-response curves before and after cholesterol augmentation (Fig. 2C) suggests that cholesterol addition had no appreciable effect on the affinity of capsaicin to its binding site. The similar shapes of the I-V curves (Fig. 2D) suggest that there was little change in the voltage-sensing domain. Importantly, the noise analysis experiments revealed that the decrease in current with cholesterol addition did not arise from a significant change in the conducting channels as reflected in no appreciable changes in the single channel current (i) or open probability (Po), but rather a decrease in the number of agonist-responsive channels in the patch (Fig. 3B). Our single-channel recordings also suggest that cholesterol sequesters the channel in a non-conducting state. These data could be interpreted to mean that cholesterol impedes channel opening (see Refs. 19Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 42Morenilla-Palao C. Pertusa M. Meseguer V. Cabedo H. Viana F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9215-9224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Unlike cholesterol, epicholesterol did not modify the capsaicin-evoked current (Fig. 4), indicating that the effect of cholesterol is not due to a nonspecific membrane effect, but rather to a stereospecific binding site. Similar results with other channels, including inward-rectifier K+ channels and large-conductance voltage/Ca2+-gated K+ channels, have also been interpreted to mean that the effect of cholesterol are not due to an indirect modification of lipid bilayer properties, but rather to a stereospecific interaction at the surface of the protein (19Romanenko V.G.

Rychnovsky S. Dopico A.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2011; 137: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).We consequently explored rTRPV1 for possible cholesterol-binding sites. One established sequence selective for binding cholesterol is the putative CRAC motif, first identified in the benzodiazepine receptor (43Jamin N. Neumann J.M. Ostuni M.A. Vu T.K. Yao Z.X. Murail S. Robert J.C. Giatzakis C. Papadopoulos V. Lacapère J.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and later identified in many other proteins and peptides (40Epand R.F. Thomas A. Brasseur R. Vishwanathan S.A. Hunter E.

This motif is defined as a sequence pattern of -(Leu/Val-(X)1–5-Tyr-(X)1–5-Arg/Lys)-, in which (X)1–5 represents between one and five residues of any amino acid (40Epand R.F. Thomas A. Brasseur R.

Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cholesterol interacts with the CRAC motif with both attractive van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic surfaces and electrostatic interactions between the positively charged Arg or Lys residue and the cholesterol -OH group (40Epand R.F.

Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In a study of a peptide from the fusogenic gp41 protein of HIV-1, Epand et al. (40Epand R.F. Thomas A. Brasseur R. Vishwanathan S.A. Hunter E. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6105-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that the single Leu to Ile substitution in the CRAC motif (from LWYIK to IWYIK) resulted in no preferential interaction with cholesterol (33Rosenbaum T. Gordon S.E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another cholesterol binding motif, called the cholesterol consensus motif, also found in many proteins, has three sites (Trp/Tyr)–(Ile/Val/Leu)–(Lys/Arg) on one helix and one site (Phe/Tyr/Trp) on an adjoining helix (20Hanson M.A. Cherezov V.

For example, in the crystal structure of the human β2-adrenergic receptor, Hanson et al. (20Hanson M.A. Cherezov V. Griffith M.T. Roth C.B. Jaakola V.P. Chien E.Y. Velasquez J. Kuhn P. Stevens R.C.

As with the CRAC motif, key features of the cholesterol consensus motif are the van der Waals interactions of the cholesterol with the aromatic residues and electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues (20Hanson M.A. Cherezov V.

Our experiments showing different sensitivities to cholesterol augmentation of specific rat mutants (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6) and human variants (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8) provide strong evidence for the presence of a cholesterol-binding site in helix S5. Two points here are worth discussing. First, the abrogation of most of the sensitivity to cholesterol augmentation by the rTRPV1-L585I mutation (Fig. 6) and the restoration of this sensitivity by the inverse mutation in hTRPV1-I585L (Fig. 8), shows the importance of hydrophobic interactions for this cholesterol effect. Given that the Leu to Ile mutation is rather subtle, its effect also highlights the importance of steric factors in the interaction. Second, given that the CRAC sequence contains a positively charged (Arg or Lys) residue, it might seem surprising that the R579D mutation (positive to negative charge with different side chain volumes) retained sensitivity to cholesterol augmentation, albeit reduced (Fig. 5B). However, the interaction with the -OH dipole can occur with charges of either sign (20Hanson M.A. Cherezov V. Griffith M.T. Roth C.B. Jaakola V.P. Chien E.Y. Velasquez J. Kuhn P. Stevens R.C. Structure. 2008; 16: 897-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) in a manner that may be enough to stabilize the interaction of cholesterol with the protein. Our data imply that in the case of rTRPV1, the positive charge Arg579 contributed a fraction of the stabilization energy because charge neutralization (R579Q) rendered TRPV1 more sensitive to cholesterol than charge reversal (R579D) (Fig. 5).Recently, Rosenhause-Dankster et al. (46Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Logothetis D.E. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 381-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have further characterized the interaction of Kir2.1 channels with cholesterol. By using a combination of electrophysiological recordings and mutagenesis as well as modeling based on the crystal structure of Kir2.1 they have concluded that cholesterol does not appear to have a typical binding pocket in Kir2.1. Rather they found that a more complex belt-like structure is formed to contain the apex of the flexible G-loop near the interface with the transmembrane region, affecting channel gating in a manner that stabilizes the closed state of the channel (46Rosenhouse-Dantsker A. Logothetis D.E. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2011; 100: 381-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The question remains whether other regions of TRPV1 also interact with the S5 CRAC motif to form a more complex cholesterol-stabilizing structure.Although there are many variants of human hTRPV1 subunits (47Schumacher M.A. Eilers H. Front. Biosci. 2010; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), two very common alleles (I and V) were identified at position 585 (see Fig. 7A). In a genetic and functional screening of hTRPV1 variants obtained from a human population, Cantero-Recasens et al. (48Cantero-Recasens G. Gonzalez J.R. Fandos C. Duran-Tauleria E. Smit L.A. Kauffmann F. Antó J.M. Valverde M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27532-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) found that at amino acid 585, 51% are heterozygous (Ile/Val), 15% are homozygous for Val/Val, and 34% homozygous for Ile/Ile. They found these variants could be activated by capsaicin, which we have confirmed. Moreover, we found that the two variants had different responses to cholesterol addition (Fig. 7, B–D), which represents, to our knowledge, the first demonstrated functional difference between these two variants. Given that rTRPV1-L585I was insensitive to cholesterol augmentation (Fig. 6), it was gratifying to find that hTRPV1-Ile585, with the same S5 sequence as rTRPV1-L585I, was also insensitive to cholesterol augmentation (Fig. 7B). Thus, a single amino acid substitution dramatically altered the sensitivity of TRPV1 to cholesterol among species.It follows that the observed decreases in capsaicin-induced currents by cholesterol augmentation were due to specific interactions with a cholesterol-binding site in the S5 transmembrane helix of TRPV1. We have identified critical amino acids on the S5 helix that greatly affected how TRPV1 responds in the presence of cholesterol. Based on the similarities of capsaicin dose-response and I-V curves before and after cholesterol addition, the cholesterol effects are not due to changes in capsaicin binding or channel selectivity. Rather we argue that cholesterol binding must cause a conformational change in TRPV1 that stabilizes the closed state(s) (41Liu B. Hui K. Qin F. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2988-3006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of the channel. A similar conclusion was reached in a noise analysis study of Kir2.1 channels (19Romanenko V.G. Fang Y. Byfield F. Travis A.J. Vandenberg C.A. Rothblat G.H. Levitan I. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3850-3861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).The time required to inhibit rTRPV1 with MβCD:cholesterol incubation was greater than the time for recovery of the current with the same concentration of MβCD (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). Let us consider possible reasons for this observation. First, the membrane bilayer contains many more cholesterol-binding sites (each monolayer with its raft and non-raft regions) than do the TRPV1 channels embedded in the bilayer. Thus, from mass action principle, it follows that cholesterol would initially preferentially partition into the bilayer sites and the channel sites would take longer to fill. The TRPV1 channel is formed from tetramers, and cholesterol has to partition between subunits to get to its sites within the protein. Moreover, it may take all four sites to be occupied for the channels to fully close. We argue that this latter process may be the rate-limiting step. One possibility for the faster recovery time is that the removal of cholesterol from only one (or two) of the subunits may be sufficient for the channel to reopen.Our result (see supplemental Fig. S4) that rTRPV1 is primarily located in cholesterol-poor DSMs (thought to be related to non-raft microdomains) is similar to results for TRPC3 and TRPC6 (49Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 839-845PubMed Google Scholar), but in contrast to other TRP channels, such as TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 (49Brownlow S.L. Sage S.O. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 94: 839-845PubMed Google Scholar) and TRPM8 (42Morenilla-Palao C. Pertusa M. Meseguer V. Cabedo H. Viana F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9215-9224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), that have been associated with cholesterol-rich DRMs. Although the reasons for these different microdomain locations are not clear, the different locations can impact on the TRP channels' response to cholesterol. Thus, the cholesterol-rich raft microdomain location of TRPM8 helps to explain why MβCD treatment increases cold-evoked TRPM8 currents in cells (42Morenilla-Palao C. Pertusa M. Meseguer V. Cabedo H. Viana F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9215-9224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas the non-raft localization of rTRPV1 (data seen in supplemental Fig. S4) helps explain why MβCD treatment does not modify the capsaicin-induced current of this channel in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1).TRPV1 is known to serve many physiological functions and is also involved in pathological conditions (for review, see Ref. 1Jara-Oseguera A. Simon S.A. Rosenbaum T. Curr. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 1: 255-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we consider the physiological significance of the observations that the activity of both rTRPV1 and hTRPV1 can be diminished by cholesterol. This is relevant because different cells have different cholesterol concentrations, with the cholesterol unequally partitioned between plasma and organelle membranes. Moreover, many plasma membranes contain transient cholesterol-rich raft and cholesterol-poor non-raft microdomains. Here we have shown that rTRPV1 is located in DSM (non-raft) fractions (supplemental Fig. S4). We speculate that the activity of TRPV1 could be regulated by expression of the Val/Val or Ile/Ile variants in cells with different cholesterol concentrations, or by transferring them between non-raft (low cholesterol) and raft (high cholesterol) microdomains within a given plasma membrane. For example, after exposure to bradykinin TRPM7 channels have been shown to relocalize from cholesterol-poor (non-raft) to cholesterol-rich (raft) domains (50Yogi A. Callera G.E. Tostes R. Touyz R.M. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2009; 296: R201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the future, these variants may prove to display a physiologically important role in humans containing both variants of TRPV1 under conditions of hypercholesterolemia, for instance. Our data also argue in favor of a species-specific sensitivity of TRPV1 to cholesterol as happens for the Kir6 channel, which shows differences in cholesterol sensitivity in a porcine model (51Mathew V. Lerman A. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 154: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as compared with a rabbit model (52Genda S. Miura T. Miki T. Ichikawa Y. Shimamoto K. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2002; 40: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings and our own suggest that the same channel can be differentially regulated by cholesterol in different species.

https://openalex.org/W2057446426,"Studies on language-trained bonobos have revealed their remarkable abilities in representational and communication tasks. Surprisingly, however, corresponding research into their natural communication has largely been neglected. We address this issue with a first playback study on the natural vocal behaviour of bonobos. Bonobos produce five acoustically distinct call types when finding food, which they regularly mix together into longer call sequences. We found that individual call types were relatively poor indicators of food quality, while context specificity was much greater at the call sequence level. We therefore investigated whether receivers could extract meaning about the quality of food encountered by the caller by integrating across different call sequences. We first trained four captive individuals to find two types of foods, kiwi (preferred) and apples (less preferred) at two different locations. We then conducted naturalistic playback experiments during which we broadcasted sequences of four calls, originally produced by a familiar individual responding to either kiwi or apples. All sequences contained the same number of calls but varied in the composition of call types. Following playbacks, we found that subjects devoted significantly more search effort to the field indicated by the call sequence. Rather than attending to individual calls, bonobos attended to the entire sequences to make inferences about the food encountered by a caller. These results provide the first empirical evidence that bonobos are able to extract information about external events by attending to vocal sequences of other individuals and highlight the importance of call combinations in their natural communication system."
https://openalex.org/W2064795263,"The accelerating growth in the number of protein sequences taxes both the computational and manual resources needed to analyze them. One approach to dealing with this problem is to minimize the number of proteins subjected to such analysis in a way that minimizes loss of information. To this end we have developed a set of Representative Proteomes (RPs), each selected from a Representative Proteome Group (RPG) containing similar proteomes calculated based on co-membership in UniRef50 clusters. A Representative Proteome is the proteome that can best represent all the proteomes in its group in terms of the majority of the sequence space and information. RPs at 75%, 55%, 35% and 15% co-membership threshold (CMT) are provided to allow users to decrease or increase the granularity of the sequence space based on their requirements. We find that a CMT of 55% (RP55) most closely follows standard taxonomic classifications. Further analysis of this set reveals that sequence space is reduced by more than 80% relative to UniProtKB, while retaining both sequence diversity (over 95% of InterPro domains) and annotation information (93% of experimentally characterized proteins). All sets can be browsed and are available for sequence similarity searches and download at http://www.proteininformationresource.org/rps, while the set of 637 RPs determined using a 55% CMT are also available for text searches. Potential applications include sequence similarity searches, protein classification and targeted protein annotation and characterization."

Although APP processing and release are known to occur in response to neuronal stimulation, the exact mechanism by which APP reaches the neuronal surface is unclear. We now demonstrate that a small but relevant number of synaptic vesicles contain APP, which can be released during neuronal activity, and most likely represent the major exocytic pathway of APP. This novel finding leads us to propose a revised model of presynaptic APP trafficking that reconciles existing knowledge on APP with our present understanding of vesicular release and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2041544548,"Local recurrent excitatory circuits are ubiquitous in neocortex, yet little is known about their development or architecture. Here we introduce a quantitative technique for efficient single-cell resolution circuit mapping using 2-photon (2P) glutamate uncaging and analyze experience-dependent neonatal development of the layer 4 barrel cortex local excitatory circuit. We show that sensory experience specifically drives a 3-fold increase in connectivity at postnatal day (P) 9, producing a highly recurrent network. A profound dendritic spinogenesis occurs concurrent with the connectivity increase, but this is not experience dependent. However, in experience-deprived cortex, a much greater proportion of spines lack postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and synaptic connectivity via NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is the same as in normally developing cortex. Thus we describe a approach for quantitative circuit mapping and show that sensory experience sculpts an intrinsically developing template network, which is based on NMDAR-only synapses, by driving AMPARs into newly formed silent spines."

We have explored the role of neurexin and neuroligin at sensory-to-motor neuron synapses of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia, which undergoes sensitization, a simple form of learned fear. We find that depleting neurexin in the presynaptic sensory neuron or neuroligin in the postsynaptic motor neuron abolishes both long-term facilitation and the associated presynaptic growth induced by repeated pulses of serotonin. Moreover, introduction into the motor neuron of the R451C mutation of neuroligin-3 linked to autism spectrum disorder blocks both intermediate-term and long-term facilitation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent regulation of the neurexin-neuroligin interaction may govern transsynaptic signaling required for the storage of long-term memory, including emotional memory that may be impaired in autism spectrum disorder.

In addition to their roles in de novo synapse formation during development, an increasing body of evidence suggests that synaptic cell adhesion molecules also are critically involved in the functional expression and plasticity of the synapse in the adult brain (reviewed in Yamagata et al., 2003Yamagata M. Sanes J.R. Weiner J.A. Synaptic adhesion molecules.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 621-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Dalva et al., 2007Dalva M.B. McClelland A.C. Kayser M.S. Cell adhesion molecules: Signalling functions at the synapse.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Neuroligin (NLG) and neurexin (NRX) undergo a heterophilic interaction with each other and are among the most studied synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the nervous system. The neuroligins are postsynaptic transmembrane proteins produced from at least four genes in mammals (NLG-1 to 4; Ichtchenko et al., 1995Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M.

Südhof T.C. Structures, alternative splicing, and neurexin binding of multiple neuroligins.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The neurexins are predominantly presynaptic transmembrane proteins generated from at least three genes in mammals (NRX-1 to 3), each with two promoters (thus α- and β-neurexins) and many alternative splice sites (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A.

The cytoplasmic domain of both neurexin and neuroligin contains PDZ-binding motifs that can recruit signaling molecules thought to mediate differentiation of the presynaptic and the postsynaptic compartment, respectively. Indeed, in vitro, neurexin and neuroligin promote synapse formation by inducing post- and presynaptic differentiation, by interacting with each other (Scheiffele et al., 2000Scheiffele P. Fan J.

However, in vivo studies using gene ablation of neurexins or neuroligins in mice found no obvious changes in synapse number, leading to the suggestion that in vivo neurexin and neuroligin affect synaptic remodeling and maturation rather than initial synapse formation (Missler et al., 2003Missler M.

Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The finding that chronic inhibition of NMDA receptors suppresses the synaptogenic activity of neuroligin-1 in vitro further supports the idea that neuroligin contributes to the activity-dependent modification of developing neural circuits (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A. Atasoy D. Etherton M.R. Brose N. Kavalali E.T. Gibson J.R. Südhof T.C.

Since children with ASD often develop normally up to a point and only then regress in their social and emotional development, ASD is thought not to affect initial synapse formation but rather the synaptic remodeling that accompanies maturation of the nervous system and the subsequent stabilization of these synaptic connections (Zoghbi, 2003Zoghbi H.Y. Postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders: Meeting at the synapse?.Science. 2003; 302: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The postulated role of neurexin and neuroligin in synaptic remodeling and maturation and in the pathogenesis of ASD makes it interesting to explore their role in emotional learning and memory. As a first step in this direction, we examined the role of neuroligin-1 in mammals and found it to be important for memory of learned fear and for associated LTP at mature neural circuits in the amygdala (Kim et al., 2008bKim J. Jung S.Y. Lee Y.K. Park S. Choi J.S. Lee C.J. Kim H.S. Choi Y.-B. Scheiffele P.

USA. 2008; 105: 9087-9092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More recently, neuroligin-1 has also been found to contribute to hippocampus-dependent spatial memory (Dahlhaus et al., 2010Dahlhaus R. Hines R.M. Eadie B.D. Kannangara T.S. Hines D.J. Brown C.E. Christie B.R. El-Husseini A.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2115-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, there have been no detailed molecular studies thus far of how neuroligin contributes to the different stages of emotional memory formation or how it contributes to the learning-induced structural remodeling that leads to the growth of new synaptic connections associated with the storage of long-term emotional memory. Moreover, although neurexin-1α knockout mice have enhanced motor learning despite a defect in excitatory neurotransmission (Etherton et al., 2009Etherton M.R. Blaiss C.A. Powell C.M. Südhof T.C. Mouse neurexin-1alpha deletion causes correlated electrophysiological and behavioral changes consistent with cognitive impairments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 17998-18003Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), there are also no studies examining the role of neurexins in learning-related synaptic plasticity. To explore the role of the neurexin-neuroligin transsynaptic interaction in learning and memory, we have paralleled our study of emotional learning in mammals (Kim et al., 2008bKim J. Jung S.Y. Lee Y.K. Park S. Choi J.S. Lee C.J. Kim H.S. Choi Y.-B. Scheiffele P. Bailey C.H. et al.Neuroligin-1 is required for normal expression of LTP and associative fear memory in the amygdala of adult animals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9087-9092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with studies of an elementary neural circuit that underlies a simple form of learned fear in Aplysia—sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex. A critical component of this reflex that contributes importantly to the behavior is a direct monosynaptic connection from the siphon sensory neurons to the gill motor neurons. The sensory-to-motor neuron synapse can be reconstituted in dissociated cell culture where it is modulated, as in the intact animal, by serotonin (5-HT), a modulatory transmitter released during the learning of fear (Marinesco et al., 2006Marinesco S. Wickremasinghe N. Carew T.J. Regulation of behavioral and synaptic plasticity by serotonin release within local modulatory fields in the CNS of Aplysia.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12682-12693Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Five applications of 5-HT over a period of 1.5 hr—designed to simulate five shocks to the tail that produce behavioral sensitization—produce both a long-term increase in the strength of the sensory-to-motor neuron synaptic connection lasting several days (long-term facilitation: LTF, Montarolo et al., 1986Montarolo P.G.

Our recent finding that neurexin and neuroligin are cargo of kinesin transport and are upregulated by 5-HT at the Aplysia sensory-to-motor neuron synapse (Puthanveettil et al., 2008Puthanveettil S.V.

We report here that the Aplysia homologs of neurexin (ApNRX) and neuroligin (ApNLG) exhibit strong similarities with their vertebrate counterparts in both domain structure and subcellular localization. Next, we find that depleting ApNRX in the presynaptic sensory neuron or ApNLG in the postsynaptic motor neuron abolishes both LTF and the associated 5-HT-induced presynaptic structural changes. In addition to their role in the initiation of LTF, we find that ApNRX and ApNLG also play a critical role in the stabilization and persistence of LTF. Finally, we find that overexpression of the ApNLG autism-linked mutant in the postsynaptic motor neuron blocks both intermediate-term and long-term facilitation. We used a primer design strategy for PCR amplification of distantly related gene sequences based on consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOPs, http://blocks.fhcrc.org/codehop.html; Rose et al., 2003Rose T.M. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S.

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of ApNLG with vertebrate and invertebrate homologs shows that ApNLG shares 39% identities with human neuroligin-3 (NLG-3) (Figure S1 available online). Despite repeated and rigorous efforts utilizing PCR-based cloning as well as screening cDNA libraries prepared from the Aplysia CNS extracts, we did not find any splice isoforms of ApNLG. The domain structure of ApNLG is similar to vertebrate neuroligins. As in vertebrates, the sequence of ApNLG is composed of a cleavable signal peptide, a single extracellular domain that is homologous with acetylcholinesterase followed by the single transmembrane region and then a short cytoplasmic region (Figure 1A ). A highly conserved arginine (R) residue that is mutated in human NLG-3 R451C linked to ASD (Jamain et al., 2003Jamain S. Quach H. Betancur C. Råstam M. Colineaux C. Gillberg I.C. Soderstrom H. Giros B. Leboyer M. Gillberg C. Bourgeron T. Paris Autism Research International Sibpair StudyMutations of the X-linked genes encoding neuroligins NLGN3 and NLGN4 are associated with autism.Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) is present in the ApNLG (Figure 1B). We next determined the subcellular localization of endogenous ApNLG by immunocytochemical analysis using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody generated against the extracellular region of ApNLG (Figure S2). In sensory-to-motor neuron cocultures, immunostaining with ApNLG antibody showed clustering of ApNLG at the initial segment and the proximal regions of major axons of the postsynaptic motor neuron where the majority of functionally competent synaptic connections are found in sensory-to-motor neuron cocultures (Figure 1C). Immunostaining in nonpermeabilized condition showed a similar ApNLG staining pattern suggesting that they are clusters at the cell surface (data not shown). The subcellular localization of endogenous ApNLG is consistent with the exclusive localization of mammalian neuroligins in the postsynaptic density (Song et al., 1999Song J.Y. Ichtchenko K. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Neuroligin 1 is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule of excitatory synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). When GFP was expressed in sensory neurons as a whole-cell marker, it became readily evident that presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities, especially the ones in contact with the initial segment and major axons of postsynaptic motor neurons and thus containing functional presynaptic compartments (Kim et al., 2003Kim J.-H. Udo H. Li H.-L. Youn T.Y. Chen M. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H.

Employing a PCR-based strategy and using the partial sequence homologous to known neurexin sequences found in the Aplysia EST database (Moroz et al., 2006Moroz L.L. Edwards J.R. Puthanveettil S.V. Kohn A.B. Ha T. Heyland A. Knudsen B. Sahni A. Yu F. Liu L. et al.Neuronal transcriptome of Aplysia: Neuronal compartments and circuitry.Cell. 2006; 127: 1453-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we cloned a single Aplysia homolog of neurexin (ApNRX). ApNRX also shares a high degree of sequence conservation with other invertebrate and with mammalian neurexins (35% identity and 52% similarity with human neurexin-1α) (Figure S1). The domain organization of ApNRX is very similar to mammalian α -neurexins. It has a cleavable signal peptide, a large extracellular domain that contains three repeats consisting of two LNS (Laminin-Neurexin-Sex hormone globulin) motifs flanking an EFG motif, followed by single transmembrane domain, and then a short cytoplasmic tail (Figure 2A ). Furthermore, four out of the five alternative splice sites present in mammalian α-neurexin, including splice site 4, which is common to both α- and β-neurexins and determines binding affinity to neuroligin (Ichtchenko et al., 1995Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Südhof T.C. Neuroligin 1: A splice site-specific ligand for beta-neurexins.Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), are also present in equivalent locations in ApNRX, suggesting a high degree of functional conservation (Figure S1 and Table S1). The high degree of conservation extends to the PDZ binding motif at the C-terminal end, which is conserved and characteristic for “true” neurexins as opposed to the related but different neurexin IV, which shares a number of the other domains of neurexin (Figure 2B). Despite repeated and rigorous efforts, we have not found a shorter β-like neurexin variant expressed in the Aplysia CNS. This is consistent with the absence of β-neurexins from the invertebrate genomes of Drosophila and C. elegans (Tabuchi and Südhof, 2002Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: Insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing.Genomics. 2002; 79: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We next determined the subcellular localization of endogenous ApNRX by immunocytochemical analysis by using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody generated against the cytoplasmic tail region of ApNRX (Figure S1). In isolated sensory neurons, ApNRX immunostaining was distributed along neurites in a punctate pattern (Figure 2C). The punctate appearance of endogenous ApNRX cluster is similar to the distribution reported for endogenous neurexin in mammals (Dean et al., 2003Dean C. Scholl F.G. Choih J. DeMaria S. Berger J. Isacoff E. Scheiffele P. Neurexin mediates the assembly of presynaptic terminals.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Interestingly, clusters of ApNRX also appear to be distributed along the neurites of the motor neuron in sensory-to-motor cocultures (Figure 2D). When GFP was expressed in sensory neurons as a whole-cell marker, it became clear that some ApNRX clusters do not colocalize with the neurites of the sensory neuron outlined by GFP fluorescence; thus they presumably are located on the motor neuron. These ApNRX clusters in the motor neuron may represent a pool of ApNRX in postsynaptic compartments since there is a significant amount of neurexin in postsynaptic compartments in mammals (Taniguchi et al., 2007Taniguchi H. Gollan L. Scholl F.G. Mahadomrongkul V. Dobler E. Limthong N. Peck M. Aoki C. Scheiffele P. Silencing of neuroligin function by postsynaptic neurexins.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2815-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, it became clear that some ApNRX clusters overlap with some presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities in contact with the major receptive surface of the postsynaptic motor neuron where the majority of functionally competent synaptic connections are found in culture (Figure 2D, Kim et al., 2003Kim J.-H. Udo H. Li H.-L. Youn T.Y. Chen M. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H. Presynaptic activation of silent synapses and growth of new synapses contribute to intermediate and long-term facilitation in Aplysia.Neuron. 2003; 40: 151-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These ApNRX clusters overlapping with presynaptic varicosities may represent enrichment of ApNRX in presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities, clustering of ApNRX in postsynaptic motor neuron in apposition to presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities, or perhaps both. Since many known functions of neurexin and neuroligin require their binding to each other across the synaptic cleft, we set out to find whether ApNRX and ApNLG also bind to each other. To address this point, we generated Ig fusion constructs that contain the extracellular domain of either HA-tagged ApNLG or VSV-G-tagged ApNRX with the Ig Fc at their C-termini (ApNLG-Fc and ApNRX-Fc). We then incubated soluble ApNRX-Fc with cell lysates prepared from GFP-ApNLG transfected HEK293 cells and soluble ApNLG-Fc with cell lysates prepared from GFP-ApNRX transfected HEK293 cells, respectively. We found that ApNRX-Fc specifically binds to GFP-ApNLG, but not to GFP control (Figure 3A ), and conversely, ApNLG-Fc binds to GFP-ApNRX, but not to GFP control (Figure 3B). These results provide evidence that recombinant ApNRX and ApNLG bind to each other, as is the case for their vertebrate counterparts. Next, we wondered whether endogenous ApNRX and ApNLG colocalize at the synapse. Thus, we immunostained sensory-to-motor neuron cocultures with both ApNRX and ApNLG antibodies. In this fashion, we were able to demonstrate that clusters of ApNLG and ApNRX do indeed overlap or juxtapose each other at the initial segment and the proximal regions of major axons of the postsynaptic motor neuron where the majority of functionally competent synaptic connections are found (Figure 3C). However, there are the clusters of ApNRX and ApNLG that do not colocalize especially at the distal neuritis, which may represent, in part, mobile clusters that contribute to preformed scaffolding transport complexes and/or extrasynaptic clusters. Overexpression of neurologin-1 in cultured mammalian neurons increases excitatory postsynaptic currents induced by local extracellular stimulation (Chubykin et al., 2007Chubykin A.A. Atasoy D. Etherton M.R. Brose N. Kavalali E.T. Gibson J.R. Südhof T.C. Activity-dependent validation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses by neuroligin-1 versus neuroligin-2.Neuron. 2007; 54: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of overexpressing ApNLG in the postsynaptic motor neuron or ApNRX in the presynaptic sensory neuron on the strength of the sensory-to-motor neuron synaptic connection. Overexpression of ApNRX alone in the presynaptic sensory neuron or ApNLG alone in the postsynaptic motor neuron did not lead to an increase in the amplitude of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) measured at 24 hr after the injection. However, simultaneous overexpression of ApNRX in the presynaptic sensory neuron and ApNLG in the postsynaptic motor neuron led to a significant increase in the strength of the sensory-to-motor neuron synaptic connection measured at 24 hr after the injection (Figures 3D and 3E; % increase in EPSP amplitude: no expression –6.3 ± 4.2, n = 27; ApNRX expression alone –15.6 ± 8.0, n = 6; ApNLG expression alone −6.7 ± 6.1, n = 8; ApNRX and ApNLG expression 61.1 ± 27.5, n = 10, p < 0.001 versus no expression). Thus, the concomitant overexpression of ApNRX in the presynaptic sensory neuron and ApNLG in the postsynaptic motor neuron can, by itself in the absence of 5-HT training, induce long-lasting synaptic facilitation. These results support the idea of a functional transsynaptic interaction between ApNRX and ApNLG since ApNRX and ApNLG bind to each other and the overexpression of either ApNRX or ApNLG alone does not induce long-lasting synaptic facilitation. When the whole-cell marker Alexa-594 was injected into sensory neurons in combination with presynaptic overexpression of the ApNRX-GFP construct, it became evident that some presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities are completely filled with ApNRX whereas other varicosities are only partially filled and some varicosities appear to lack ApNRX entirely (Figure 4A ). This heterogeneous distribution is similar to the pattern reported for other presynaptic markers in Aplysia such as synaptophysin (Kim et al., 2003Kim J.-H. Udo H. Li H.-L. Youn T.Y. Chen M. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H. Presynaptic activation of silent synapses and growth of new synapses contribute to intermediate and long-term facilitation in Aplysia.Neuron. 2003; 40: 151-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and allowed us to examine, by time-lapse imaging of living cells in culture, the time course and spatial distribution of ApNRX that may be recruited to the individual presynaptic sensory neuron varicosities during the development of LTF. In addition to the formation of new varicosities filled with ApNRX, there is also the enrichment of ApNRX in previously existing empty varicosities when cells were reimaged at 24 hr after 5-HT treatment (Figure 4B). We have defined an empty varicosity as any varicosity that was labeled by Alexa-594 but contains no ApNRX-GFP (see Experimental Procedures). Such empty varicosities represent 45.6% ± 5.5% (11.0/25.0 varicosities, n = 15) of the total varicosities. When cells were reimaged 24 hr after 5-HT treatment, 46.4% ± 7.4% (5.6/11.0 varicosities) of the empty varicosities were filled with ApNRX-GFP. There was little change in the distr"
https://openalex.org/W2074704277,"Brain and behavioural lateralization at the population level has been recently hypothesized to have evolved under social selective pressures as a strategy to optimize coordination among asymmetrical individuals. Evidence for this hypothesis have been collected in Hymenoptera: eusocial honey bees showed olfactory lateralization at the population level, whereas solitary mason bees only showed individual-level olfactory lateralization. Here we investigated lateralization of odour detection and learning in the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris L., an annual eusocial species of Hymenoptera. By training bumble bees on the proboscis extension reflex paradigm with only one antenna in use, we provided the very first evidence of asymmetrical performance favouring the right antenna in responding to learned odours in this species. Electroantennographic responses did not reveal significant antennal asymmetries in odour detection, whereas morphological counting of olfactory sensilla showed a predominance in the number of olfactory sensilla trichodea type A in the right antenna. The occurrence of a population level asymmetry in olfactory learning of bumble bee provides new information on the relationship between social behaviour and the evolution of population-level asymmetries in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2086725413,"HCN1 channel subunits, which contribute to the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), are selectively targeted to distal apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, we addressed the importance of the brain-specific auxiliary subunit of HCN1, TRIP8b, in regulating HCN1 expression and localization. More than ten N-terminal splice variants of TRIP8b exist in brain and exert distinct effects on HCN1 trafficking when overexpressed. We found that isoform-wide disruption of the TRIP8b/HCN1 interaction caused HCN1 to be mistargeted throughout CA1 somatodendritic compartments. In contrast, HCN1 was targeted normally to CA1 distal dendrites in a TRIP8b knockout mouse that selectively lacked exons 1b and 2. Of the two remaining hippocampal TRIP8b isoforms, TRIP8b(1a-4) promoted HCN1 surface expression in dendrites, whereas TRIP8b(1a) suppressed HCN1 misexpression in axons. Thus, proper subcellular localization of HCN1 depends on its differential additive and subtractive sculpting by two isoforms of a single auxiliary subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2135116086,"We have observed that, in renal proximal tubular cells, cardiotonic steroids such as ouabain in vitro signal through Na/K-ATPase, which results in inhibition of transepithelial 22Na+ transport by redistributing Na/K-ATPase and NHE3.

In Sprague-Dawley rats, high salt diet activated c-Src and induced redistribution of Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 in renal proximal tubules. In Dahl salt sensitive (S) and resistant (R) rats given high dietary salt, we found different effects on blood pressure but, more interestingly, different effects on renal salt handling. These differences could be explained by different signaling through the proximal tubular Na/K-ATPase.

Based on this background, we performed the following studies to examine whether the proximal tubules of Dahl R and S rats had different responses to CTS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (290–310 g body weight) were purchased from Charles River. Male, age-matched Dahl R (SS/JrHsd) and S (SR/JrHsd) rats were bred and maintained in-house and used at the age of 12–14 weeks. Rats were maintained with 12 h dark/light cycle and had ad libitum access to the food (Teklad Laboratory animal diets from Harlan Laboratories) and water. All animal experimentation was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals using protocols approved by the University of Toledo Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. All chemicals, except otherwise mentioned, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin and ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin-agarose beads were from Pierce Biotechnology. Antibodies against Rab7, integrin-β1, and c-Src were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody against the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit (clone α6F) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Monoclonal antibodies against NHE3 (clone 4F5) and early endosome antigen-1 (EEA-1) were from Millipore Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal anti-Src [pY418] phosphospecific antibody was from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA). Antibodies against phosphor-p44/42 ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and p44/42 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Type 2 collagenase (activity of 323U/mg) was from Worthington Biochemical Corp (Lakewood, NJ). Sterile Percoll was from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ). Biomol Green was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Radioactive 22Na+ was from DuPont NEN Life Science (Boston, MA). For salt-loading studies in Sprague-Dawley rats, the rats were randomly divided into two groups (10 rats per group) after adjustment to the new environment. The rats were then fed with 0.3% NaCl (as low salt diet) or 4% NaCl chow for 7 days. For salt-loading studies in Dahl rats, age-matched, male R and S rats (total 48 rats) were given either 0.3% NaCl (low salt, LS, n = 12 per strain) or 2% NaCl (high salt, HS, n = 12 per strain) diet for 7 days. Only 2% NaCl loading was used with the Dahl rats because of the profound effects on BP and food consumption (inferred from urinary Na+ excretion data, see Table 2) salt-loading has on the S animals.TABLE 2HS diet (2% NaCl, 7 days) caused differential regulation between the R and S ratsStrainLSHSBPR133 ± 2.2 (n = 12)134 ± 2.6# (n = 12)S146 ± 3.1 (n = 12)169 ± 5.6** (n = 12)Plasma Na+R145 ± 2.8 (n = 12)146 ± 1.4 (n = 12)S146 ± 2.1 (n = 12)147 ± 3.6 (n = 12)Plasma K+R8.7 ± 1.8 (n = 12)8.6 ± 1.3 (n = 12)S8.8 ± 1.4 (n = 12)8.7 ± 1.5 (n = 12)UNa+V (mmol/24 h)R2.9 ± 0.6 (n = 8)20.1 ± 1.6**,# (n = 8)S2.7 ± 0.25 (n = 8)6.5 ± 1.0** (n = 8)FENa+R0.073 ± 0.008 (n = 8)0.287 ± 0.064**,# (n = 8)S0.071 ± 0.004 (n = 8)0.132 ± 0.021** (n = 8)Creatinine clearance (ml/min)R1.99 ± 0.14 (n = 8)2.66 ± 0.38 (n = 8)S2.06 ± 0.32 (n = 8)2.67 ± 0.64 (n = 8) Open table in a new tab At days 0 and 7, BP was measured in conscious rats by the tail-cuff plethysmography with the aid of a computerized system (Amplifier model 229, Monitor model 31, Test chamber Model 306; IITC Life Science). All rats were first trained for BP measurement over a period of 2 days before day 0 to accustom them to the apparatus and restraint (13Kennedy D.J. Vetteth S. Periyasamy S.M. Kanj M. Fedorova L.

After that, the actual BP (average of at least three measurements) was recorded. RPTs were isolated from the outer cortices as described by Vinay et al. (14Vinay P. Gougoux A. Lemieux G. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F403-F411PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, harvested kidneys were decapsulated and rinsed with ice-cold oxygenized PBS. Cortices were dissected, minced, and digested in digesting solution (oxygenized DMEM with 1 mg/ml collagenase Type 2, 0.5% filtered BSA Fraction V) four times at 37 °C, 15 min each. Pooled tubular segments were further separated with 42% Percoll gradient (pH 7.4), and the RPT segments were collected from the lowest two bands. The enrichment and purity of RPT isolation was determined by measuring RPT brush-border membrane vehicles (BBMVs) marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase activity (∼10-fold increases). For in vitro primary culture, RPTs were isolated from R and S rats fed with low salt diet. Isolated RPTs were cultured in collagen I-coated culture dishes in DMEM/F-12 medium (1:1 mixture, with 10% FBS and insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite media supplement, Sigma) until 90–100% confluency in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. Before ouabain treatment, cells were serum-starved (cultured in medium with 0.5% FBS) for 16–18 h. Early endosome (EE, EEA-1- and Rab5-positive) and late endosome (LE, Rab7-positive) fractions were isolated by sucrose flotation centrifugation as previously reported (7Periyasamy S.M. Liu J.

The enrichment of EE and LE fractions was assessed by the EE marker EEA1 and LE marker Rab7, respectively; Equal amounts of total proteins from EE or LE fraction of each sample were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for subsequent Western blot. Surface biotinylation studies were conducted as previously described (8Liu J. Kesiry R. Periyasamy S.M. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I.

Crude membrane isolation and Na/K-ATPase enzymatic activity determinations (each performed in triplicate) were performed as previously described (9Liu J. Periyasamy S.M. Gunning W. Fedorova O.V.

The ouabain-sensitive Na/K-ATPase activity assay was performed by measuring the Pi released from hydrolysis of ATP. Before assay, the samples were treated with alamethicin (1:10, μg:μg, alamethicin: protein) for 30 min on ice and exposed to about 100× volume reaction solution. RPT BBMVs were prepared from isolated RPTs using the protocol described by Murer's Laboratory (16Biber J. Stieger B. Stange G. Murer H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1356-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After homogenization, BBMVs were isolated with Mg2+ precipitation method (final concentration of MgCl2 is 12 mm, 15 min on ice) and differential centrifugation. Alkaline phosphatase activity was enriched ∼10-fold by this procedure. NHE3 activity (H+-driven 22Na+ uptake) in RPT BBMVs was determined in triplicate using the filtration protocol described by Moe's Laboratory (17Bacic D. Kaissling B. McLeroy P. Zou L. Baum M. Moe O.W. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 2133-2141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RPT whole cell lysates were prepared with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol (pH 7.4), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture for general use (Sigma). After clarification, 300 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with antibody against c-Src and protein G-agarose beads (Millipore), and then eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer. After immunoblotting for phospho-c-Src (p-Src), the same membrane was stripped and immunoblotted for total c-Src (t-Src). The activation of c-Src was expressed as ratio of p-Src/t-Src with both measurements normalized to 1.0 for the control samples. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. The same membrane was also immunoblotted with antibodies against integrin-β1 (for surface biotinylation) or EEA-1 (for EE fractionation) to serve as loading controls, respectively. Signal detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence super signal kit (Pierce). Multiple exposures were analyzed to assure that the signals were within the linear range of the film. The signal density was determined using Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Data were tested for normality (all data passed) and then subjected to parametric analysis. When more than two groups were compared, one-way ANOVA was performed prior to comparison of individual groups, and the post-hoc t-tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni's correction. Statistical significance was reported at the p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 levels. SPSS software was used for all analysis. Values are given as mean ± S.E (18Wallenstein S. Zucker C.L. Fleiss J.L. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, the high salt diet significantly increased absolute urinary Na+ excretion compared with control rats. The high salt diet also had a small effect on systolic BP. The high salt diet reduced the Na/K-ATPase activity in RPT crude plasma membrane fractions and NHE3 activity in RPT BBMVs (Table 1). To assess the redistribution of the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit and NHE3 in RPT, the protein contents on cell surface (assayed by cell surface biotinylation) and in isolated EE fraction were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The high salt diet not only decreased RPT surface contents of both transporters (Fig. 1a), but also caused both transporters in RPTs to accumulate in the EE fraction (Fig. 1b). The inhibition of the Na/K-ATPase activity and NHE3 activity was well correlated with reduced protein content of the α1 subunit and NHE3 on the cell surface. Furthermore, the high salt diet stimulated c-Src phosphorylation in RPT whole cell lysates (Fig. 1c). RPT primary cultures isolated from control rats fed with low salt diet were treated with ouabain or vehicle. Ouabain treatment (10 μmol/liter for 1 h) accumulated the α1 subunit and NHE3 in the EE fractions, reduced the surface protein content of these two ion transporters (Fig. 2a), and caused an inhibition of both Na/K-ATPase activity (in μmol/mg protein/hour, control 58.9 ± 3.6 versus ouabain 48.1 ± 3.1, n = 4, p < 0.01 compared with control) and NHE3 activities by measuring H+-driven 22Na+ uptake (in relative value, control 100 ± 4.5 versus ouabain-treated 76.5 ± 6.8, n = 4, p < 0.01 compared with control). Moreover, ouabain (10 or 25 μmol/liter for 5 min) stimulated c-Src phosphorylation (Fig. 2b).TABLE 1The effect of an HS diet (4% NaCl for 7 days) on Sprague Dawley ratsUNa+VBPNa/K-ATPase activityNHE3 activitymmol/24 hmmHg%LS2.7 ± 0.4 (n = 10)102.6 ± 2.5 (n = 10)56.4 ± 4.2 (n = 4)100 ± 4.8 (n = 4)HS18.1 ± 1.7 (n = 10)**115.3 ± 3.2 (n = 10)**40.2 ± 6.8 (n = 4)**67.6 ± 10.5 (n = 4)** Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Ouabain activated RPT c-Src and stimulated redistribution of RPT Na/K-ATPase α1 and NHE3.

As briefly mentioned earlier, we used only a 2% high salt diet as the Dahl S (but not R) rats showed profound increases in blood pressure as well as very substantial decreases in food consumed as evidenced by the relative decrease in UNa+V compared with the R rats (Table 2). There were no significant differences among the groups in the plasma concentrations of Na+ and K+ at the end of the experiments. These and additional data are summarized in Table 2. In the isolated RPTs from Dahl R and S rats fed a low salt diet, there were no differences in the expression of Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit and NHE3 or Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 activities. High salt diet has no significant effect on total expression of Na/K-ATPase α1 and NHE3 in isolated RPTs from the R and S rats (data not shown). However, the high salt diet significantly decreased both Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 activities in the R but not the S rats (Fig. 3). In the isolated RPTs from the R rats, the high salt diet not only decreased the RPT surface content of both Na/K-ATPase α1 and NHE3 (Fig. 4a) but also caused the accumulation of both transporters in the EE fraction (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, the high salt diet did not cause redistribution of the α1 subunit and NHE3 in the S rat RPTs (Fig. 4, a and b). While the high salt diet caused the α1 subunit to also accumulate in the LE fractions in the R rats (relative to control 100 ± 3.5, high salt diet 246.5 ± 7.6, n = 3, p < 0.01), the NHE3 did not accumulate in the LE fraction (Fig. 4c). This suggests that the NHE3, which moves to the EE fraction remains available for recycling, but in any case does not accumulate in the LE fraction. In the RPTs isolated from the R but not the S rats, high salt diet stimulated activation of c-Src (Fig. 5a) and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5b). In the same immunoprecipitation studies shown in Fig. 5a, high salt diet also significantly enhanced association between c-Src and Na/K-ATPase α1 (relative to the low salt control diet 100 ± 3.7, high salt diet 184.6 ± 9.3, n = 3, p < 0.01) in the R rats, but not in the S rats. RPTs were isolated from age-matched male R and S rats (20 R rats and 20 S rats) fed with a low salt diet (0.3% NaCl), and cultured to reach confluence. As observed in salt-loading experiment with intact animals, ouabain treatment also caused differential regulations in the RPT primary culture derived from the R and S rats. Whereas ouabain demonstrated no regulatory effect in the RPTs derived from the S rats, ouabain had dramatic consequences in the RPTs derived from the R rats. Specifically, ouabain treatment (10 μmol/liter for 1 h) caused the accumulation of the α1 subunit and NHE3 in the EE fractions (Fig. 6a); reduced the surface protein content of these two ion transporters (Fig. 6b); and inhibited both the membrane Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 activities in RPT crude membrane fraction and BBMVs, respectively (Table 3). Moreover, ouabain treatment (1 and 10 μmol/liter for 5 min) stimulated phosphorylation of c-Src and ERK1/2 (Fig. 7, a and b). In the same immunoprecipitation studies shown in Fig. 7a, ouabain also enhanced the association between c-Src and Na/K-ATPase α1 (in values relative to control 100 ± 4.2, ouabain 1 μmol/liter 167.6 ± 8.2 and ouabain 10 μmol/liter 192.8 ± 6.3, n = 4, both p < 0.01 compared with control) in the R rats. No significant association between c-Src and Na/K-ATPase α1 was observed in the S rats in response to either dose of ouabain.TABLE 3The effect of ouabain on the Na/K-ATPase activity and NHE3 activity in RPT primary cultures derived from the R and S ratsStrainControlOuabain10 μmol/liter, 1hNa/K-ATPase activityR61.2 ± 3.6 (n = 4)46.8 ± 3.5** (n = 4)S60.8 ± 4.1 (n = 4)57.9 ± 4.5 (n = 4)NHE3 activity (%)R100 ± 5.2 (n = 4)71.2 ± 5.5** (n = 4)S100 ± 6.1 (n = 4)96.4 ± 6.5 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 7Ouabain activated c-Src and ERK1/2 and enhanced association between c-Src and the α1 subunit in RPTs of the R rats, but not the S rats.

Basis Dis. 2010; 1802: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A role for endogenous CTS in salt sensitive hypertension has also been suggested by a number of authors (10Blaustein M.P. Hamlyn J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Ritz E. Nephrology. 2010; 15: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Jaitovich A.

Dial Transplant. 2008; 23: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On this background, the Dahl R and S rats have been extensively studied for insight into the pathogenesis of salt sensitive hypertension. Fedorova et al. (5Fedorova O.V. Talan M.I. Agalakova N.I. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Fedorova O.V. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Circulation. 2000; 102: 3009-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have established that increases in circulating MBG are, in fact, greater during acute and chronic salt-loading in Dahl S as compared with R rats. In the current study, we observed that the outbred Sprague-Dawley rats developed redistribution of the Na/K-ATPase in RPTs in response to a shift to a high salt diet. As we have previously observed (7Periyasamy S.M. Liu J. Tanta F. Kabak B. Wakefield B. Malhotra D. Kennedy D.J. Nadoor A. Fedorova O.V. Gunning W. Xie Z. Bagrov A.Y. Shapiro J.I. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 1868-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), this redistribution of the Na/K-ATPase appears to depend on increases in the production of the CTS, MBG. In addition to what we had previously seen, we also noted what appeared to be a coordinated redistribution of the apical NHE3 into the EE but not LE fraction, a phenomenon, which we have documented to be a consequence of Na/K-ATPase-c-Src signaling in LLC-PK1 cells (15Cai H. Wu L. Qu W. Malhotra D. Xie Z. Shapiro J.I. Liu J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C555-C563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, works from the laboratory of McDonough using immunofluorescence have shown that a high salt diet causes the redistribution of NHE3 to a deeper portion of microvilli whereas this high salt diet causes the sodium-phosphate cotransporter to move completely into cells (30Yang L.E. Sandberg M.B. Can A.D. Pihakaski-Maunsbach K. McDonough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1003-F1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We believe that our data with the NHE3 are consistent with this report. We further demonstrated that CTS signaling also appeared to occur in a similar fashion in Dahl R but not S rats. Specifically, we saw that high salt diet induced redistribution of the Na/K-ATPase and NHE3 along with evidence for c-Src and ERK1/2 activation in RPTs isolated from the Dahl R but not S rats. Impaired CTS signaling in the RPTs of the S rats was further implicated by the failure of these RPTs isolated from the S rats on a low salt diet to show ouabain signaling in vitro, which was readily apparent in parallel studies performed in the RPTs isolated from the R rats. As the S rats developed profound hypertension when dietary Na+ is increased to 2% whereas the R rat demonstrated little change in BP with this dietary manipulation, these data implicated the CTS-Na/K-ATPase-c-Src signal cascade in the control of BP in these animals. Furthermore, since the S rats develop greater increases in the production of as well as circulating levels of CTS following increases in dietary Na+ (5Fedorova O.V. Talan M.I. Agalakova N.I. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1122-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Fedorova O.V. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Circulation. 2000; 102: 3009-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), diminished sensitivity of the signaling cascade to CTS would appear to be involved. However, as the α1 subunit sequence of the Na/K-ATPase does not differ between Dahl S and R rats (31Mokry M. Cuppen E. Hypertension. 2008; 51: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), one must implicate the environment of the signaling Na/K-ATPase and/or the interactions between the Na/K-ATPase and its signaling partners (32Pierre S.V. Xie Z. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 46: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We believe that these data are interesting for several reasons. First, they implicate CTS in the pathogenesis of salt sensitive hypertension by a renal mechanism, namely the failure of the Dahl S to demonstrate the normal response to CTS seen with the Dahl R and the outbred Sprague-Dawley rats. This may give pause to implementing the therapeutic strategy of antagonizing CTS-Na/K-ATPase signaling in vascular tissue which has been proposed by pioneering workers in this field (10Blaustein M.P. Hamlyn J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Yuan C. Manunta P. Chen S. Hamlyn J.M. Haddy F.J. Pamnani M.B. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S10-S12Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Second, these data suggest that CTS may induce increases in renal sodium excretion by multiple mechanisms. Specifically, these agents may increase vascular resistance as others have demonstrated (33Kashkin V.A. Zvartau E.E. Fedorova O.V. Bagrov Y.Y. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2008; 18: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34Bagrov A.Y. Fedorova O.V.

Hypertens. 2005; 23: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) while also working through the renal mechanism discussed above. Although other hormonal systems no doubt interact with both of these pathways, such as the opposite effect of atrial natriuretic peptides on MBG-induced regulation of Na/K-ATPase activity in renal medulla and aortic rings (36Fedorova O.V. Agalakova N.I. Morrell C.H. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it does appear that the vascular mechanism is much more intact in the Dahl S rats suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of CTS signaling might be different in these different tissues. Whether this is explained by Na/K-ATPase isoform differences, differences in specific CTS and/or mechanistic differences in the way that CTS signal in vascular as compared with renal tissues is still quite unclear. On this latter point, we might speculate that the classic ionic signal mechanism involving actual pump inhibition might dominate in vascular tissue as proposed by Blaustein and Hamlyn (10Blaustein M.P. Hamlyn J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) whereas the CTS-c-Src signaling might be more important in the RPTs. Of course, further work must be done to address this complex area. Last, these data might possibly provide the basis for developing a tool for clinical practice. If the sensitivity of the Na/K-ATPase-c-Src signaling pathway to CTS is something that is impaired either on a genetic or acquired basis, it might be possible to use this phenomenon to develop a biomarker for salt-sensitive hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2061362492,"Oxidative stress could be a key selective force shaping the expression of colored traits produced by the primary animal pigments in integuments: carotenoids and melanins. However, the impact of oxidative stress on melanic ornaments has only recently been explored, whereas its role in the expression of carotenoid-based traits is not fully understood. An interesting study case is that of those animal species simultaneously expressing both kinds of ornaments, such as the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). In this bird, individuals exposed to an exogenous source of free radicals (diquat) during their development produced larger eumelanin-based (black) plumage traits than controls. Here, we show that the same red-legged partridges exposed to diquat simultaneously developed paler carotenoid-based ornaments (red beak and eye rings), and carried lower circulating carotenoid levels as well as lower levels of some lipids involved in carotenoid transport in the bloodstream (i.e., cholesterol). Moreover, partridges treated with a hormone that stimulates eumelanin production (i.e., alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) also increased blood carotenoid levels, but this effect was not mirrored in the expression of carotenoid-based traits. The redness of carotenoid-based ornaments and the size of a conspicuous eumelanic trait (the black bib) were negatively correlated in control birds, suggesting a physiological trade-off during development. These findings contradict recent studies questioning the sensitivity of carotenoids to oxidative stress. Nonetheless, the impact of free radicals on plasma carotenoids seems to be partially mediated by changes in cholesterol metabolism, and not by direct carotenoid destruction/consumption. The results highlight the capacity of oxidative stress to create multiple phenotypes during development through differential effects on carotenoids and melanins, raising questions about evolutionary constraints involved in the production of multiple ornaments by the same organism."

By contrast, amylin fibrillogenesis has a sigmoidal dependence on heparin fragment length, with an enhancement observed for oligosaccharides longer than four monomers and a leveling off of effects beyond 12 monomers. The length dependence suggests that the negatively charged helical structure of heparin electrostatically complements the positively charged surface of the fibrillar amylin cross-β structure.

https://openalex.org/W2027474131,"Background Macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) is achieved through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and requires karyopherin-βs (KAP-βs), a family of soluble receptors, for recognition of embedded transport signals within cargo. We recently demonstrated, through proteomic analysis of trypanosomes, that NPC architecture is likely highly conserved across the Eukaryota, which in turn suggests conservation of the transport mechanisms. To determine if KAP-β diversity was similarly established early in eukaryotic evolution or if it was subsequently layered onto a conserved NPC, we chose to identify KAP-β sequences in a diverse range of eukaryotes and to investigate their evolutionary history. Results Thirty six predicted proteomes were scanned for candidate KAP-β family members. These resulting sequences were resolved into fifteen KAP-β subfamilies which, due to broad supergroup representation, were most likely represented in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Candidate members of each KAP-β subfamily were found in all eukaryotic supergroups, except XPO6, which is absent from Archaeplastida. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the likely evolutionary relationships between these different subfamilies. Many species contain more than one representative of each KAP-β subfamily; many duplications are apparently taxon-specific but others result from duplications occurring earlier in eukaryotic history. Conclusions At least fifteen KAP-β subfamilies were established early in eukaryote evolution and likely before the LECA. In addition we identified expansions at multiple stages within eukaryote evolution, including a multicellular plant-specific KAP-β, together with frequent secondary losses. Taken with evidence for early establishment of NPC architecture, these data demonstrate that multiple pathways for nucleocytoplasmic transport were established prior to the radiation of modern eukaryotes but that selective pressure continues to sculpt the KAP-β family."

We found a rapid market transition at the end of 2001 from a flexible state of low ICF into a stiff (nonflexible) state of high ICF that is prone to market systemic collapses. The stiff state is also marked by strong effect of the market index on the stock-stock correlations as well as bursts of high stock correlations reminiscence of epileptic brain activity. Conclusions/Significance The market dynamical states, stability and transition between economic states was studies using new quantitative measures. Doing so shed new light on the origin and nature of the current crisis. The new approach is likely to be applicable to other classes of complex systems from gene networks to the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2047637108,"Background Energetic and metabolic circuits that orchestrate cell differentiation are largely unknown. Adenylate kinase (AK) and associated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) constitute a major metabolic signaling axis, yet the role of this system in guiding differentiation and lineage specification remains undefined. Methods and Results Cardiac stem cell differentiation is the earliest event in organogenesis, and a suitable model of developmental bioenergetics. Molecular profiling of embryonic stem cells during cardiogenesis revealed here a distinct expression pattern of adenylate kinase and AMPK genes that encode the AK-AMP-AMPK metabolic surveillance axis. Cardiac differentiation upregulated cytosolic AK1 isoform, doubled AMP-generating adenylate kinase activity, and increased AMP/ATP ratio. At cell cycle initiation, AK1 translocated into the nucleus and associated with centromeres during energy-consuming metaphase. Concomitantly, the cardiac AMP-signal receptor AMPKα2 was upregulated and redistributed to the nuclear compartment as signaling-competent phosphorylated p-AMPKα(Thr172). The cardiogenic growth factor TGF-β promoted AK1 expression, while knockdown of AK1, AK2 and AK5 activities with siRNA or suppression by hyperglycemia disrupted cardiogenesis compromising mitochondrial and myofibrillar network formation and contractile performance. Induction of creatine kinase, the alternate phosphotransfer pathway, compensated for adenylate kinase-dependent energetic deficits. Conclusions Developmental deployment and upregulation of the adenylate kinase/AMPK tandem provides a nucleocytosolic energetic and metabolic signaling vector integral to execution of stem cell cardiac differentiation. Targeted redistribution of the adenylate kinase-AMPK circuit associated with cell cycle and asymmetric cell division uncovers a regulator for cardiogenesis and heart tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2117367533,"p21-activated kinase (PAK) 2, a member of the PAK family of serine/threonine protein kinases, plays an important role in physiological processes such as motility, survival, mitosis, and apoptosis. However, the role of PAK2 in resistance to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we report that PAK2 is highly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines and human breast invasive carcinoma tissue compared with a human non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line and adjacent normal breast tissue, respectively. Interestingly, we found that PAK2 can bind with caspase-7 and phosphorylate caspase-7 at the Ser-30, Thr-173, and Ser-239 sites. Functionally, the phosphorylation of caspase-7 decreases its activity, thereby inhibiting cellular apoptosis. Our data indicate that highly expressed PAK2 mediates chemotherapeutic resistance in human breast invasive ductal carcinoma by negatively regulating caspase-7 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2017513650,"The cell wall of mycobacteria consists of an outer membrane, analogous to that of gram-negative bacteria, attached to the peptidoglycan (PG) via a connecting polysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG). Although the primary structure of these components is fairly well deciphered, issues such as the coverage of the PG layer by covalently attached mycolates in the outer membrane and the spatial details of the mycolic acid attachment to the arabinan have remained unknown. It is also not understood how these components work together to lead to the classical acid-fast staining of mycobacteria. Because the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in established experimental animal infections are acid-fast negative, clearly cell wall changes are occurring. To address both the spatial properties of mycobacterial cell walls and to begin to study the differences between bacteria grown in animals and cultures, the cell walls of Mycobacterium leprae grown in armadillos was characterized and compared with that of M. tuberculosis grown in culture. Most fundamentally, it was determined that the cell wall of M. leprae contained significantly more mycolic acids attached to PG than that of in vitro grown M. tuberculosis (mycolate:PG ratios of 21:10 versus 16:10, respectively). In keeping with this difference, more arabinogalactan (AG) molecules, linking the mycolic acids to PG, were found. Differences in the structures of the AG were also found; the AG of M. leprae is smaller than that of M. tuberculosis, although the same basic structural motifs are retained."

https://openalex.org/W2038268878,"Metastasis represents one of the most clinically important transitions in neoplastic progression. The evolution of metastasis is a puzzle because a metastatic clone is at a disadvantage in competition for space and resources with non-metastatic clones in the primary tumor. Metastatic clones waste some of their reproductive potential on emigrating cells with little chance of establishing metastases. We suggest that resource heterogeneity within primary tumors selects for cell migration, and that cell emigration is a by-product of that selection.We developed an agent-based model to simulate the evolution of neoplastic cell migration. We simulated the essential dynamics of neoangiogenesis and blood vessel occlusion that lead to resource heterogeneity in neoplasms. We observed the probability and speed of cell migration that evolves with changes in parameters that control the degree of spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity. Across a broad range of realistic parameter values, increasing degrees of spatial and temporal heterogeneity select for the evolution of increased cell migration and emigration.We showed that variability in resources within a neoplasm (e.g. oxygen and nutrients provided by angiogenesis) is sufficient to select for cells with high motility. These cells are also more likely to emigrate from the tumor, which is the first step in metastasis and the key to the puzzle of metastasis. Thus, we have identified a novel potential solution to the puzzle of metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2051133423,"A novel feature for animal mitochondrial genomes has been recently established: i.e., the presence of additional, lineage-specific, mtDNA-encoded proteins with functional significance. This feature has been observed in freshwater mussels with doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA (DUI). The latter unique system of mtDNA transmission, which also exists in some marine mussels and marine clams, is characterized by one mt genome inherited from the female parent (F mtDNA) and one mt genome inherited from the male parent (M mtDNA). In freshwater mussels, the novel mtDNA-encoded proteins have been shown to be mt genome-specific (i.e., one novel protein for F genomes and one novel protein for M genomes). It has been hypothesized that these novel, F- and M-specific, mtDNA-encoded proteins (and/or other F- and/or M-specific mtDNA sequences) could be responsible for the different modes of mtDNA transmission in bivalves but this remains to be demonstrated.We investigated all complete (or nearly complete) female- and male-transmitted marine mussel mtDNAs previously sequenced for the presence of ORFs that could have functional importance in these bivalves. Our results confirm the presence of a novel F genome-specific mt ORF, of significant length (>100aa) and located in the control region, that most likely has functional significance in marine mussels. The identification of this ORF in five Mytilus species suggests that it has been maintained in the mytilid lineage (subfamily Mytilinae) for ∼13 million years. Furthermore, this ORF likely has a homologue in the F mt genome of Musculista senhousia, a DUI-containing mytilid species in the subfamily Crenellinae. We present evidence supporting the functionality of this F-specific ORF at the transcriptional, amino acid and nucleotide levels.Our results offer support for the hypothesis that ""novel F genome-specific mitochondrial genes"" are involved in key biological functions in bivalve species with DUI."
https://openalex.org/W1995691857,"The primate <i>SIGLEC12</i> gene encodes one of the CD33-related Siglec family of signaling molecules in immune cells. We had previously reported that this gene harbors a human-specific missense mutation of the codon for an Arg residue required for sialic acid recognition. Here we show that this R122C mutation of the Siglec-XII protein is fixed in the human population, <i>i.e</i>. it occurred prior to the origin of modern humans. Additional mutations have since completely inactivated the <i>SIGLEC12</i> gene in some but not all humans. The most common inactivating mutation with a global allele frequency of 58% is a single nucleotide frameshift that markedly shortens the open reading frame. Unlike other CD33-related Siglecs that are primarily found on immune cells, we found that Siglec-XII protein is expressed not only on some macrophages but also on various epithelial cell surfaces in humans and chimpanzees. We also found expression on certain human prostate epithelial carcinomas and carcinoma cell lines. This expression correlates with the presence of the nonframeshifted, intact <i>SIGLEC12</i> allele. Although <i>SIGLEC12</i> allele status did not predict prostate carcinoma incidence, restoration of expression in a prostate carcinoma cell line homozygous for the frameshift mutation induced altered regulation of several genes associated with carcinoma progression. These stably transfected Siglec-XII-expressing prostate cancer cells also showed enhanced growth in nude mice. Finally, monoclonal antibodies against the protein were internalized by Siglec-XII-expressing prostate carcinoma cells, allowing targeting of a toxin to such cells. Polymorphic expression of Siglec-XII in humans thus has implications for prostate cancer biology and therapeutics."

Significantly enhanced odor sensitivity in socially agreeable people, significantly enhanced trigeminal sensitivity in neurotic subjects, and a tendency for enhanced pain tolerance in highly conscientious participants was revealed. It is postulated that varied sensory processing may influence an individual's perception of the environment; particularly their perception of socially relevant or potentially dangerous stimuli and thus, varied with personality."
https://openalex.org/W2043465346,"The mechanism of PKAc-dependent NF-κB activation and subsequent translocation into the nucleus is not well defined. Previously, we showed that A kinase interacting protein 1 (AKIP1) was important for binding and retaining PKAc in the nucleus. Since then, other groups have demonstrated that AKIP1 binds the p65 subunit of NF-κB and regulates its transcriptional activity through the phosphorylation at Ser 276 by PKAc. However, little is known about the formation and activation of the PKAc/AKIP1/p65 complex and the rate at which it enters the nucleus. Initially, we found that the AKIP1 isoform (AKIP 1A) simultaneously binds PKAc and p65 in resting and serum starved cells. Using peptide arrays, we refined the region of AKIP 1A binding on PKAc and mapped the non-overlapping regions on AKIP 1A where PKAc and p65 bind. A peptide to the amino-terminus of PKAc (CAT 1-29) was generated to specifically disrupt the interaction between AKIP 1A and PKAc to study nuclear import of the complex. The rate of p65 nuclear translocation was monitored in the presence or absence of overexpressed AKIP 1A and/or (CAT 1-29). Enhanced nuclear translocation of p65 was observed in the presence of overexpressed AKIP1 and/or CAT 1-29 in cells stimulated with TNFα, and this correlated with decreased phosphorylation of serine 276. To determine whether PKAc phosphorylation of p65 in the cytosol regulated nuclear translocation, serine 276 was mutated to alanine or aspartic acid. Accelerated nuclear accumulation of p65 was observed in the alanine mutant, while the aspartic acid mutation displayed slowed nuclear translocation kinetics. In addition, enhanced nuclear translocation of p65 was observed when PKAc was knocked-down by siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that AKIP 1A acts to scaffold PKAc to NF-κB in the cytosol by protecting the phosphorylation site and thereby regulating the rate of nuclear translocation of p65."
https://openalex.org/W2004796041,"Interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) involves the transfer of a nucleus or cell from one species into the cytoplasm of an enucleated oocyte from another. Once activated, reconstructed oocytes can be cultured in vitro to blastocyst, the final stage of preimplantation development. However, they often arrest during the early stages of preimplantation development; fail to reprogramme the somatic nucleus; and eliminate the accompanying donor cell's mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in favour of the recipient oocyte's genetically more divergent population. This last point has consequences for the production of ATP by the electron transfer chain, which is encoded by nuclear and mtDNA. Using a murine-porcine interspecies model, we investigated the importance of nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility on successful development. Initially, we transferred murine fetal fibroblasts into enucleated porcine oocytes, which resulted in extremely low blastocyst rates (0.48%); and failure to replicate nuclear DNA and express Oct-4, the key marker of reprogramming. Using allele specific-PCR, we detected peak levels of murine mtDNA at 0.14±0.055% of total mtDNA at the 2-cell embryo stage and then at ever-decreasing levels to the blastocyst stage (<0.001%). Furthermore, these embryos had an overall mtDNA profile similar to porcine embryos. We then depleted porcine oocytes of their mtDNA using 10 µM 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and transferred murine somatic cells along with murine embryonic stem cell extract, which expressed key pluripotent genes associated with reprogramming and contained mitochondria, into these oocytes. Blastocyst rates increased significantly (3.38%) compared to embryos generated from non-supplemented oocytes (P<0.01). They also had significantly more murine mtDNA at the 2-cell stage than the non-supplemented embryos, which was maintained throughout early preimplantation development. At later stages, these embryos possessed 49.99±2.97% murine mtDNA. They also exhibited an mtDNA profile similar to murine preimplantation embryos. Overall, these data demonstrate that the addition of species compatible mtDNA and reprogramming factors improves developmental outcomes for iSCNT embryos."

To increase the rates, it is important to understand the motives and barriers for the acceptance of the vaccine. We conducted this study to determine potential predictors of the uptake of A (H1N1) influenza vaccine in a cohort of Japanese general population.By using self-administered questionnaires, this population-based longitudinal study was conducted from October 2009 to April 2010 among 428 adults aged 18-65 years randomly selected from each household residing in four wards and one city in Tokyo. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. Of total, 38.1% of participants received seasonal influenza vaccine during the preceding season, 57.0% had willingness to accept A (H1N1) influenza vaccine at baseline, and 12.1% had received A (H1N1) influenza vaccine by the time of follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounding variables, people who had been vaccinated were significantly more likely to be living with an underlying disease (p = 0.001), to perceive high susceptibility to influenza (p = 0.03), to have willingness to pay even if the vaccine costs ≥ US$44 (p = 0.04), to have received seasonal influenza vaccine during the preceding season (p<0.001), and to have willingness to accept A (H1N1) influenza vaccine at baseline (p<0.001) compared to those who had not been vaccinated.While studies have reported high rates of willingness to receive A (H1N1) influenza vaccine, these rates may not transpire in the actual practices. The uptake of the vaccine may be determined by several potential factors such as perceived susceptibility to influenza and sensitivity to vaccination cost in general population."

The cpr5 mutant was hypersensitive to ABA in the seed germination, cotyledon greening and root growth, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing CPR5 were insensitive. Genetic analysis demonstrated that CPR5 gene may be located downstream of the ABI1 in the ABA signaling pathway. However, the cpr5 mutant showed an ABA independent drought-resistant phenotype. It was also found that the cpr5 mutant was hypersensitive to NDGA and NDGA treatment aggravated the ABA-induced delay in the seed germination and cotyledon greening.

In addition, various ORC subunits appear to play a role in heterochromatin assembly, ribosomal biogenesis, centrosome and kinetochore function, sister chromatin cohesion, and neural dendritic branching (5Chesnokov I.N. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 256: 69-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Sasaki T. Gilbert D.M. Curr. Opin.

Collectively, these varied and seemingly contradictory observations suggest that ORC assembly is a dynamic rather than a static process. To account for these observations, we reasoned that assembly of vertebrate ORCs in vivo may occur through independent pathways to allow assembly of different complexes and to accommodate the various functions currently ascribed to individual subunits. Here we demonstrate that human Orc6 and Orc1 are transported into nuclei independently of the ORC(2–5) core complex. These components can then either be assembled into ORC(1–5), ORC(2–6), and ORC(1–6) complexes or function individually. Such a mechanism would allow the six ORC subunits to elicit the broad spectrum of activities suggested in the literature. The human cell lines HeLa (#CCL-2, American Type Culture Collection) and HeLa-RR and their culture conditions have been described (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These cells were synchronized as they entered S-phase by culturing them in the presence of 4 mm deoxy-Thd for 18 h, then in fresh medium for 12 h, and again with deoxy-Thd for 16 h. Cells were arrested in metaphase by culturing them in the presence of deoxy-Thd for 18 h and then releasing them into 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 8 h. HeLa-RR lines that constitutively expressed either wild-type or mutant Orc6 genes in the absence of continual selection of a genetic marker were constructed as previously described (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A full-length human Orc6 open reading frame was amplified from HeLa cell RNA using reverse transcriptase and PCR to produce a DNA copy that was then cloned into the XhoI/NotI site in pCI (Promega). The cloned human Orc6 sequence was identical to that given under accession number NM_014321 (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Orc6 deletions and amino acid substitutions were generated by PCR amplification. The sequence 198RKRKK202 was converted into AAAVA. The single valine created a PstI site that facilitated cloning. The site-directed mutagenesis kit from Promega was used to clone the −NLS, T195A, and T195E mutants into pCI. All of the primers used in these constructions are available upon request. Purification of FH-Orc6 proteins was carried out by a two-step affinity purification protocol, as described previously (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, FH-Orc6 protein was purified from TK100 extracts of HeLa-RR cells. TK100 was previously termed B100 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm PMSF, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). About 500 ng of FLAG-ORC (estimated by Coomassie Blue staining) was incubated with anti-HA resin, and the beads were then washed and eluted with HA peptide (Roche Applied Science) in TK100 buffer. The eluate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue stain or silver stain (SilverSnap kit, Pierce) to estimate the protein amount, and the amino sequence of the major bands in the stained gel was determined by nano-HPLC/mass spectroscopic analysis (32Zhou G. Li H. Gong Y. Zhao Y. Cheng J. Lee P. Zhao Y. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To purify ORC(1–6), HeLa-RR cells were lysed in GN50 (20 mm glycylglycine (pH 9.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm PMSF, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin). When FH-Orc6 was used as the affinity tag, ORC(1–6) was purified from the GN50 extract by the two-step affinity purification protocol (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), except that GN buffers were used. When FH-Orc1 was used as the affinity tag, the GN50-extracted HeLa-RR cell pellet was extracted further with GN300 (300 mm NaCl instead of 50 mm NaCl) to maximize recovery of Orc1 protein. To preserve to the greatest degree the existing ORC(1–6) complex, each step was performed at 4 °C: 15-min extraction, 15-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 1-h incubation of antibody with antigen, 6 washes each with 20 resin volumes GN50, and a 1-h elution of resin with either FLAG or HA peptide in GN50. Cytology was done as previously described (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), except that mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was diluted 1:1500 in PBS, and rabbit anti-Orc6 antibody was diluted at 1:1200 in PBS. Images were merged using either MetaVue software (Universal Imaging) or Adobe Photoshop. Western immunoblotting was done as described previously (9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were detected with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), goat anti-karyopherin-α1/6 (1:500, #sc6918, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-karyopherin-β (1:500, #sc1863, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-NPI-1 (1:250, #37-0800, Invitrogen). Mouse anti-NPI-1 is specific for the NPI-1 (nucleoprotein interactor-1, karyopherin-α1) protein. Goat anti-Kpna1/6 detects karyopherin-α1 and karyopherin-α6. Rabbit anti-Orc6 antibody was generated in our laboratory against the entire human Orc6 protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The antigen-antibody complex was detected with HRP-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) followed by Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce). Goat polyclonal anti-Lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Orc1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Orc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Orc3 (U. S. Biological), and anti-Orc4 (Abcam) were used at a dilution of 1:500 followed by HRP-conjugated rat anti-goat antibody (1:30,000; Pierce). Cells were cultured in the presence of radioactive phosphate and then extracted with TK100. FH-Orc6 was affinity-purified from these lysates using anti-FLAG resin, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 32P-labeled FH-Orc6 was visualized by autoradiography. Cells were transfected for 5 h with 100 μm siRNA targeted against the 3′-untranslated region of the human Orc6 mRNA (GACUUGACGGCUUUGGGAUtt) or control firefly luciferase GL2 (AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected again 24 h later, harvested 48 h after the second transfection, and then analyzed by immunoblotting and FACS. We reasoned that if the human Orc6 protein were transported into the nucleus independently of other ORC proteins, it would require its own nuclear localization signal (NLS). Therefore, to identify a functional NLS in Orc6, deletions were constructed throughout the entire length of the human Orc6 molecule (Fig. 1A). Orc6 proteins from different species were aligned to identify the non-conserved regions where end points for each deletion were less likely to interfere with functional domains. Each protein was tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG-hemagglutinin epitopes (FH) to facilitate its purification, and HeLa cell lines that constitutively expressed one of these proteins were constructed. Subsequent analysis revealed that each recombinant FH-Orc6 mutant was expressed at levels equivalent to that of FH-Orc6 wild-type protein (Fig. 1B). However, whereas deletions 6A, 6B, 6C, and 6E and wild-type Orc6 each localized to the nucleus of interphase cells, deletion 6D (residues 163–204) localized to the cytoplasm regardless of whether it was expressed transiently or constitutively or if it was expressed in monolayers or in suspension cultures of HeLa cells (Fig. 2; data not shown). Thus, only deletion 6D affected nuclear localization.FIGURE 2Orc6 contains a single nuclear localization signal. Wild-type FH-Orc6 (wt) and FH-Orc6 deletion mutants 6A, 6B, 6C, and 6E were localized to the nucleus (wt), as was endogenous Orc6 (not shown). Only deletion mutant 6D and the NLS substitution mutant (−NLS) were localized to the cytoplasm. Because the images of Orc6 mutant proteins that localized to the nucleus were indistinguishable from wild-type Orc6, only 6C is shown as an example. Cells were stained with Hoechst to visualize nuclear DNA and with anti-FLAG antibody to visualize FH-Orc6. Transiently expressed Orc6(T195A) was localized both in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. 90% of transiently expressed Orc6(T195E) cells were localized to the nucleus, and 10% was in the cytoplasm. However, constitutively expressed Orc6(T195A) and Orc6(T195E) were localized to the nucleus, as discussed in the text. Transient expression assays were carried out on HeLa cell monolayers. Constitutive expression of Orc6 and other proteins was engineered in HeLa-RR cells that proliferate in suspension.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the sequences of Orc6 proteins from seven different vertebrates revealed the presence of an NLS consensus sequence within deletion 6D consisting of KIGLQX11PPRKRKK (Fig. 1C). To determine whether or not this sequence was, in fact, the Orc6 NLS, the basic amino acid sequence RKRKK was replaced with the neutral amino acid sequence AAAVA to generate a NLS-defective mutant (Fig. 1C, FH-Orc6(-NLS)). Expression of FH-Orc6(-NLS) was equivalent to FHOrc6(wt) (Fig. 1B), and Orc6(-NLS), like Orc6(6D), localized to the cytoplasm in both transient and constitutive expression assays (Fig. 2). Therefore, HsOrc6 contains a single NLS within residues 180–202. Orc6 contains a single CDK-dependent consensus phosphorylation site ((S/T)PX(K/R)) at Thr-195 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may affect nuclear localization. Therefore, two mutants were constructed in which Thr-195 was changed either to alanine (T195A) to prevent phosphorylation at this site or to glutamate (T195E) to mimic phosphorylation at this site. Both mutants carried the FH epitopes at their N terminus, and both were expressed constitutively to levels comparable with wild-type FH-Orc6 (Fig. 1B). When Orc6(T195A) was expressed transiently in HeLa cells, the protein was distributed throughout both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2), whereas transiently expressed Orc6(T195E) was localized to the nucleus in 90% of the cells (Fig. 2) and distributed throughout both nucleus and cytoplasm in 10% of the cells (data not shown). To determine whether or not Orc6 is phosphorylated at Thr-195 in vivo, cells expressing either FH-Orc6, FH-Orc6(T195A), or FH-Orc6(T195E) were cultured in the presence of radioactive phosphate, and then FH-Orc6 was affinity-purified from cell lysates using anti-FLAG resin, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 32P-labeled FH-Orc6 was visualized by autoradiography. Only wild-type Orc6 was radiolabeled significantly, revealing that Orc6 was indeed phosphorylated in vivo primarily, if not exclusively, at Thr-195 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that CDK-dependent phosphorylation of HsOrc6 facilitates its localization to the nucleus. However, when Orc6(T195A) and Orc6(T195E) were expressed constitutively in HeLa cells, both proteins localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2). Therefore, as previously shown for the SV40 large tumor antigen (33Hübner S. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), phosphorylation at the NLS can expedite nuclear localization, but it is not essential for nuclear localization. The fact that cellular levels of Orc6(T195A) were severalfold greater during transient expression than during constitutive expression would amplify the facilitating effect of phosphorylation. Proteins that localize to the nucleus generally, if not always, associate with one of the karyopherin-α (Kpna) or karyopherin-β nuclear transport proteins (34Chook Y.M. Suel K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 35Conti E. Müller C.W. Stewart M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not HsOrc6 in its native environment is bound to a nuclear transport protein, FH-Orc6 was purified by double affinity chromatography from HeLa cells that expressed it constitutively. Previous applications of this strategy demonstrated that constitutively expressed FH-Orc1 and FH-Orc2 proteins modeled their endogenous counterparts (8Noguchi K. Vassilev A. Ghosh S. Yates J.L. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5372-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Radichev I. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Vassilev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23264-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). They are assembled into ORCs in the nuclei of G1-phase cells where they preferentially bind to DNA replication origins and stimulate DNA replication. Moreover, FH-Orc1, like endogenous Orc1, is selectively degraded during S-phase. Although all of the FH-Orc6 was localized within the nucleus of all interphase cells stained with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (see the examples in Fig. 2), most of the FH-Orc6 was solubilized when cells were lysed with TK100, a Tris-buffered nonionic detergent containing 100 mm KCl (Fig. 3A). The remaining FH-Orc6 could be extracted with TK300, the same concoction but with 300 mm KCl instead of 100 mm KCl. The soluble FH-Orc6 was bound to anti-FLAG resin and then recovered by eluting with FLAG peptide (Fig. 3B). HeLa cells that harbored the expression vector alone served as a negative control. To further eliminate proteins that were not associated specifically with FH-Orc6, the FLAG peptide-eluted proteins were purified a second time by binding them to anti-HA resin and then eluting with HA peptide. The resulting Orc6-associated proteins detected in asynchronous populations of cells could be enriched by synchronizing cells either in S-phase with excess thymidine or in metaphase with nocodazole or in G2/M by releasing cells from the thymidine block for 9 h (Fig. 3C). The major bands in the HA eluate from FH-Orc6-expressing cells that were absent from the eluate from control cells were then excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Nine peptides were identified from Kpna6 and -5 peptides from Kpna1, two proteins with extensive sequence homology (36Plant K.E. Everett D.M. Gordon Gibson G. Lyon J. Plant N.J. Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2006; 16: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This protein was clearly enriched in all three populations of synchronized cells. None of the Orc6-associated proteins was known to be involved in DNA replication. The existence of an Orc6-Kpna complex was confirmed by affinity purification. FH-Orc6 in a TK100 cell extract was eluted from anti-FLAG resin with FLAG peptide, and the eluate was subjected to Western immunoblotting using two different antibodies that recognize both Kpna1 and Kpna6. Both antibodies detected Kpna associated with Orc6 (Fig. 3D; data not shown). Moreover, Kpna in the purified FH-Orc6 fraction was enriched considerably relative to Kpna in the TK100 extract (Fig. 3D). In contrast to FH-Orc6(wt), Kpna was absent from affinity-purified FH-Orc6(-NLS) (Fig. 3D). This result reflected the fact that Kpna binds to stretches of basic amino acids within the NLS (37Kosugi S. Hasebe M. Matsumura N. Takashima H. Miyamoto-Sato E. Tomita M. Yanagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), the same residues that were changed to neutral amino acids in the −NLS mutant. To determine whether or not Kpna associated with native Orc6 as well as FH-Orc6, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against the intact Orc6 protein. This antiserum did not recognize any of the other ORC subunits, and it did not recognize Kpna (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of Orc6 from TK100 lysates using anti-Orc6 antibodies confirmed that Kpna interacted specifically with Orc6 (Fig. 3E); it did not depend either on the presence of FLAG or HA peptides or on overexpression of a recombinant Orc6 protein in HeLa cells. In contrast to Kpna, Kpnb was easily detected in TK100 lysates, but it did not co-purify with FH-Orc6 (Fig. 3F). This was consistent with the fact that Kpnb dissociates rapidly from protein-Kpna complexes immediately after they enter the nucleus (34Chook Y.M. Suel K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the Orc6 CDK phosphorylat"
https://openalex.org/W1974643328,"A genome wide association study (GWAS) typically results in a few highly significant ‘hits’ and a much larger set of suggestive signals (‘near-hits’). The latter group are expected to be a mixture of true and false associations. One promising strategy to help separate these is to use functional annotations for prioritisation of variants for follow-up. A key task is to determine which annotations might prove most valuable. We address this question by examining the functional annotations of previously published GWAS hits. We explore three annotation categories: non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), promoter SNPs and cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in open chromatin regions. We demonstrate that GWAS hit SNPs are enriched for these three functional categories, and that it would be appropriate to provide a higher weighting for such SNPs when performing Bayesian association analyses. For GWAS studies, our analyses suggest the use of a Bayes Factor of about 4 for cis eQTL SNPs within regions of open chromatin, 3 for nsSNPs and 2 for promoter SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2029004343,"It is generally accepted that mammalian oocytes are frequently suffering from chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I, which have severe consequences, including pregnancy loss, developmental disorders and mental retardation. In a search for physiologically more relevant model than rodent oocytes to study this phenomenon, we have employed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), combined with whole genome amplification (WGA), to study the frequency of aneuploidy in porcine oocytes, including rare cells obtained from aged animals. Using this method, we were able to analyze segregation pattern of each individual chromosome during meiosis I. In contrast to the previous reports where conventional methods, such as chromosome spreads or FISH, were used to estimate frequency of aneuploidy, our results presented here show, that the frequency of this phenomenon was overestimated in porcine oocytes. Surprisingly, despite the results from human and mouse showing an increase in the frequency of aneuploidy with advanced maternal age, our results obtained by the most accurate method currently available for scoring the aneuploidy in oocytes indicated no increase in the frequency of aneuploidy even in oocytes from animals, whose age was close to the life expectancy of the breed."
https://openalex.org/W2142582216,"Several conserved domains critical for E1E2 assembly and hepatitis C virus entry have been identified in E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. However, the role of less conserved domains involved in cross-talk between either glycoprotein must be defined to fully understand how E1E2 undergoes conformational changes during cell entry. To characterize such domains and to identify their functional partners, we analyzed a set of intergenotypic E1E2 heterodimers derived from E1 and E2 of different genotypes. The infectivity of virions indicated that Con1 E1 did not form functional heterodimers when associated with E2 from H77. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the reduced infectivity was not related to alteration of conformation and incorporation of Con1 E1/H77 E2 heterodimers but rather to cell entry defects. Thus, we generated chimeric E1E2 glycoproteins by exchanging different domains of each protein in order to restore functional heterodimers. We found that both the ectodomain and transmembrane domain of E1 influenced infectivity. Site-directed mutagenesis highlighted the role of amino acids 359, 373, and 375 in transmembrane domain in entry. In addition, we identified one domain involved in entry within the N-terminal part of E1, and we isolated a motif at position 219 that is critical for H77 function. Interestingly, using additional chimeric E1E2 complexes harboring substitutions in this motif, we found that the transmembrane domain of E1 acts as a partner of this motif. Therefore, we characterized domains of E1 and E2 that have co-evolved inside a given genotype to optimize their interactions and allow efficient entry.

Furthermore, data obtained with HCVpp can now also be confirmed with the developed cell culture system that allows efficient amplification of HCV (HCVcc) (8Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J.

The E1 (31 kDa) and E2 (70 kDa) proteins are glycosylated in their large N-terminal ectodomains and are anchored into the membrane by their C-terminal transmembrane domains. E1 and E2 form a heterodimer stabilized by noncovalent interactions that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This oligomer was thought for a long time to be the prebudding form of the functional complex (12Op De Beeck A. Cocquerel L. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2589-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which is present at the surface of HCV particles (13Op De Beeck A. Voisset C. Bartosch B. Ciczora Y.

Recent investigation of the E1E2 complex incorporated into HCVcc challenges this notion by proving the existence of large high molecular weight complexes stabilized by disulfide bridges (14Vieyres G.

HCV E2 is responsible for virion attachment to target cells and can bind different receptors including several capture molecules, the CD81 tetraspanin, and the scavenger receptor BI (for review, see Refs. 6Bartosch B.

Moreover, several antibodies directed against E1 are able to neutralize cell entry, presumably at a stage distinct from receptor binding (20Dreux M. Pietschmann T. Granier C. Voisset C.

The two transmembrane domains of the E1E2 heterodimer were shown to be important for different functions and interactions between the two glycoproteins. Studies of mutations occurring in conserved regions and analyses using cross-neutralizing antibodies have shown that these domains are involved in ER retention, heterodimerization of E1E2 on the surface of the viral particles, and even fusion between viral and cellular membranes (23Cocquerel L.

The aim of this study was to characterize interactions between E1 and E2 and the cross-talk between these domains for conformational changes during entry. We assume that such domains of E1 and E2 will have co-evolved inside a given genotype to optimize their interactions and allow efficient entry. In this report we identified non optimal intergenotypic heterodimers that we used to identify less conserved domains involved in E1E2 interactions. We focused on E1E2 intergenotypic heterodimers between H77 (gt1a) and Con1 (gt1b) strains, and we generated chimeras in E1 by substituting H77 for Con1 sequences and vice versa to restore optimal entry function. We discovered that both the ectodomain and transmembrane domain are involved in the cross-talk, taking part during the conformational changes required for entry. Interestingly we show that the N terminus of E1, more precisely the AIL motif, and the transmembrane of E1 H77 need to be homogenous, which is to say from the same strain, to achieve optimal entry. This interaction is crucial for the entry of H77/JFH1 HCVcc chimera and seems to be genotype-dependent, as these interactions are not crucial for Con1. Thus, the specific interactions between E1 and E2 vary between strains. Huh-7 (29Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J.

All chimeric E1E2 heterodimers have been constructed by PCR and/or digestion between genotype 1a strain H77 (31Yanagi M. Purcell R.H. Emerson S.U. Bukh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 8738-8743Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AF009606) and 1b strain Con1 (32Lohmann V. Körner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number AJ238799). All mutants were verified by sequencing. For infection assays and Western blots, HCVpp were produced as previously described (3Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) from 293T cells cotransfected with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) Gag-Pol packaging construct, an MLV-based transfer vector encoding the green fluorescent protein, and each of the E1E2 expression constructs. For Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays, the pseudoparticles were purified and concentrated from the cell culture medium by ultracentrifugation at 82,000 × g for 1 h 45 min at 4 °C through 1.5 ml of a 20% sucrose cushion. Viral pellets were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to concentrate the viral particles 100-fold. As a control for infection assays and co-immunoprecipitation assays, pseudoparticles devoid of viral glycoproteins were produced in parallel. Viral pellets were subjected to Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-HCV E1 antibody (IGH204) (Innogenetics), a mouse anti-HCV E2 antibody (H52) (33Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a goat anti-MLV-CA antibody (anti-p30; Viromed). Viral pellet samples were mixed with 6× loading buffer (375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, and 0.06% bromphenol blue), and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS. After protein transfer onto nitrocellulose filters, the blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (1 m, pH 7.4) with 5% milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 (34Bowen W.D. Walker J.M. de Costa B.R. Wu R. Tolentino P.J. Finn D. Rothman R.B. Rice K.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 32-40PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies (1:10,000-diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat; Dako) in Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20. Bound enzyme-labeled antibody was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate; Pierce). To perform immunoprecipitation assays, the pelleted virions were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100), and the medium containing HCVpp was precleared by overnight incubation with a 1:1 mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. After a centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatants were incubated with the conformation-dependent anti-E2 monoclonal antibody AR3A (35Law M. Maruyama T. Lewis J. Giang E.

Med. 2008; 14: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were precipitated using a 1:1 mixture of protein A- and protein G-Sepharose beads for 1h at 4 °C. The complexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot using anti-E1 (IGH204) and anti-E2 (H52) antibodies. Supernatants containing HCVpp were harvested 36 h after transfection and filtered through 0.45-μm-pore-size membranes. Huh-7 target cells (4 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates) were incubated with different dilutions of HCVpp harboring the chimeric glycoproteins for 4 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were removed, and cells were incubated in complete medium for 72 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached and analyzed by FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) for GFP expression. E1E2-transfected cells were lysed in pulldown lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Imidazole, 2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 1% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were incubated or not with a recombinant protein containing the large extracellular loop of human CD81 fused to a His6 tag (soluble CD81-LEL-His6) overnight at 4 °C. Then, with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose beads and the BioSprint 15 Work station of Qiagen, the lysates were washed with NPI-20-T buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8) and eluted with a NPI-250-T buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8). Eluted samples were incubated with non-denaturing buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot using anti-E1 (IGH204), anti-E2 (H52), and anti-CD81 (JS81, BD Biosciences) antibodies. 293T “donor” cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well seeded in six-well tissue culture dishes 24 h before transfection) were cotransfected using calcium phosphate reagent with 10 ng of E1E2 chimeric heterodimers and 20 ng of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) luciferase reporter plasmid (a kind gift of Françoise Bex, Institut de Recherches Microbiologiques Jean-Marie Wiame) (36Lamsoul I. Lodewick J. Lebrun S. Brasseur R. Burny A. Gaynor R.B. Bex F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10391-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As a negative control, cells were cotransfected with 10 ng of empty phCMV plasmid and 20 ng of the HIV-1-LTR-luciferase reporter plasmid. Twelve hours later, transfected cells were detached with Versene (0.53 mm EDTA; Invitrogen) and reseeded at the same concentration (105 cells/well) in 6-well plates. Huh-7-Tat indicator cells (4 × 105 cells/well), detached with EDTA and washed, were then added to the transfected cells. After 24 h of cocultivation, the cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 5 min in a pH 5 fusion buffer (130 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm MES, 5 mm HEPES), and then washed 3 times with medium. The luciferase activity was measured 24 h later using a luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To generate infectious HCV RNAs, pJFH-1=S1a-NS2–1a2a VPL, termed H77/JFH1, and mutant were linearized at the 3′ end by XbaI digestion and were treated with Mung Bean nuclease. Purified linearized DNAs were used as templates for in vitro transcription with the RiboMAXTM (Promega Corp.). In vitro transcribed RNA was used to electroporate Huh7.5 cells using Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad) in an L3 laboratory, according to European safety regulations, and cells were cultured under standard conditions. Supernatant infectivity titers were determined as focus-forming units (FFUs) per ml. Huh7.5 cells were infected with different dilutions of culture supernatants. 2 days post-infection, FFUs were visualized after NS5A immunostaining as described previously (37Tellinghuisen T.L. Foss K.L. Treadaway J. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000032Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). FFU calculations were based on counts of NS5A-positive cells. For the kinetic assays, producer cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 0.04. For virus spread, Huh7.5 producer cells were split and analyzed by FACS Canto II by NS5A immunostaining. HCV core protein was quantified using the Trak-C Core ELISA (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Neckargemünd, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To characterize the role of less conserved domains of the E1E2 heterodimer involved in cross-talk between either glycoprotein during their conformational changes in entry, we analyzed intergenotypic E1E2 complexes derived from E1 and E2 of different genotypes. The infectivity of HCVpp generated using E1 and E2 expressed in trans from individual plasmids indicated that H77 E1 (gt1a) forms functional heterodimers when associated with E2 derived from all genotypes tested from 1b, 2a, 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, Con1 E1 (gt1b) does not form functional heterodimers when associated with E2 from H77 (gt1a) or JFH1 (gt2a) strains. Our study was focused on combinations using H77 and Con1 strains because of the use of antibodies against E1 (IGH204) and E2 (H52), which recognized linear epitopes on both strains. For a more natural expression context in producer cells, we decided to compare the results of E1E2 intergenotypic heterodimer for H77 and Con1 expressed in cis. These conditions allowed the production of equal amounts of E1 and E2 in HCVpp producer cells. Moreover, the HCVpp titers were increased 10-fold, improving the sensitivity of the assay as has been previously described (3Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 38Sandrin V. Boulanger P. Penin F. Granier C. Cosset F.L. Bartosch B. J. Gen.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41624-41630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis on producer cells lysates did not indicate any difference in expression level (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, Western blot analysis on purified HCVpp indicated that the level of Con1 E1 incorporated onto HCVpp harboring intergenotypic (heterogeneous) complexes (chimera #2) was similar to the quantity of E1 incorporated onto infectious HCVpp harboring the wild type (homogenous) Con1 complex. Similarly, H77 E2 was incorporated onto HCVpp harboring intergenotypic (heterogeneous) complexes (chimera #2) in a similar quantity to the H77 E2 incorporated onto infectious HCVpp E1E2 wt (homogenous) H77 (Fig. 1B). As with the in trans system, the expression of Con1 E1/H77 E2 in cis (chimera #2) from a polyprotein precursor still led to the production of HCVpp with a decreased titer compared with the wt homogenous combination or the H77 E1/Con1 E2 (chimera #4) mirror combination (Fig. 1D). Correlated with the biochemical analysis, these results indicated that the reduced infectivity observed with the Con1 E1/H77 E2 heterodimer (chimera #2) was not related to alterations of expression and incorporation of E1E2 heterodimers but rather to a cell entry defect (Fig. 1, B and D). Furthermore, compared with the mean 2-log decrease in titer in trans, we obtained a 1-log decrease in cis. This difference may be linked to the fact that the folding of the heterodimer is not optimal when E1 and E2 are expressed in trans as the folding of E1 and E2 are dependent on each other. Therefore, we decided to make subsequent chimera constructions in cis. To further characterize the chimera Con1 E1/H77 E2, we wondered whether its non-optimal infectivity was linked to suboptimal recognition of the CD81 receptor. Using pulldown assays with soluble CD81-LEL harboring a His6 tag, Western blotting analyses indicated that an equal quantity of E1 and E2 was co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that CD81 binding was not impaired in the different constructions. As a control, the input of CD81 precipitated was similar in all cases and E1E2 was not detected without soluble CD81 (Fig. 1C). To determine which domains are involved in the reduction of infection of the intergenotypic Con1 E1/H77 E2 heterodimer (chimera #2), we constructed chimeric E1 by substituting either the ectodomain or transmembrane domain (tmd) of H77 and Con1 strains, respectively. Biochemical analysis indicated that the different chimeric heterodimers had no alterations of expression and incorporation of E1E2 heterodimers (Fig. 2A). To ensure that the glycoproteins incorporated onto the particles were well associated on a conformational heterodimer, we carried out immunoprecipitation of E1E2 heterodimers from purified HCVpp using the AR3A conformational anti-E2 antibody. Western blotting analyses of precipitated complexes indicated that the different constructions displayed well-folded and associated E1E2 heterodimers on particles in similar proportions compared with the wild type heterodimers (Fig. 2B). To investigate further, pulldown assays with soluble CD81-LEL indicated that an equal quantity of E1 and E2 were co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that CD81 binding was not impaired in the different constructions (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the entry properties of chimeric heterodimers are not linked to conformation or assembly problems on the particles. We next investigated the infectivity of the HCVpp harboring the different E1E2 chimeras generated (Fig. 2D). The titers of the different constructs indicated that the ectodomain was responsible for the loss of titer in the Con1 E1/H77 E2 combination (chimera #2). Indeed, compared with the titer of wild type H77, the introduction of the ectodomain led to a 2-log decrease (chimera #3). On the contrary, the substitution of the transmembrane of H77 E1 with the one of Con1 (chimera #1) did not modify the titer compared with the wild type H77. This may suggest that the tmd does not play a role in the function of intergenotypic heterodimer. However, when the titer of the Con1 E1/H77 E2 combination (chimera #2) was compared with the titer of the H77 harboring the sole ectodomain of Con1 E1 (chimera #3), there was a 1-log difference, which in this context did indicate a role for the tmd. Interestingly, when the mirror chimera was generated by introducing the sole ectodomain or tmd of H77 E1 into the wt Con1 E1E2, the conclusion was similar. Indeed, even though the H77 E1/Con1 E2 combination (chimera #4) is optimal for entry, the introduction of either the transmembrane domain (chimera #6) or the ectodomain (chimera #5) alone leads to a 6- and 10-fold reduction in titer, respectively, compared with HCVpp harboring Con1 wt complex. Therefore, depending on the strain origin of E2, the full-length ectodomain and tmd have different roles in heterodimer functionality. As the ectodomain and tmd are important for entry, we first decided to determine which amino acids in the transmembrane domains were responsible for the non-optimal functionality of chimeras #3 and #5 observed in Fig. 2. Based on sequence alignment analysis of the transmembrane domain of H77 and Con1, we found 4-amino acid differences at position 359, 362, 373, and 375 (Fig. 3A). To analyze their respective contribution, we first mutated each residue individually in the chimeric heterodimer Con1 harboring the ectodomain of H77 E1 (chimera #5) leading to the reintroduction of the H77 amino acid in the transmembrane domain. However, the single substitutions L359I, Y362F, I373V, or M375L did not increase the titer of chimera #5 to the level of the fully infectious chimera #4 (Fig. 3B). We then generated different combinations of double and triple substitutions. Infection assays using these HCVpp indicated that three amino acid mutations are necessary to restore titer; L359I, I373V, and M375L (Fig. 3B). The expression and incorporation on HCVpp of the different heterodimers were verified by Western blot and were seen to be at equivalent levels (data not shown). The fact that incorporation is not affected is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated that these amino acids were not implicated in heterodimerization (26Ciczora Y. Callens N. Penin F. Pécheur E.I. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2372-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As the transmembrane of Con1 seemed also to have a role in the functionality of chimeric heterodimers, we introduced the opposite substitution in the mirror chimeric heterodimer #3 (Fig. 3C). The H77 construct harboring the ectodomain of Con1 (chimera #3) was only weakly infectious, whereas the H77 E2 when associated with the Con1 E1 (chimera #2) was less affected (Fig. 3C), so we reintroduced Con1 amino acids into the H77 tmd of chimera #3. We obtained comparable results with heterodimers harboring the triple substitution I359L, V373I, and L375M, increasing the titer of chimera #3 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, regardless of the strain, the same three amino acids are important for infectivity of the HCVpp harboring chimeric heterodimers. We next wondered which region of the H77 E1 ectodomain is needed for heterodimer functionality. Based on the sequence alignment of H77 and Con1 E1, we established different boundaries for the construction of chimeras with the 123 (chimera #7) or 36 (chimera #8) N-terminal residues from Con1 in the H77 E1 (Fig. 3A). As for other chimeras, biochemical analysis indicated that expression, incorporation, conformation, and CD81 binding capacity were similar for each construction (Fig. 4, A–C).

We hypothesized that such pattern of regional pathology might be due to local differences in the dependence on complex I function. Using in situ hybridization we investigated the relative expression of 33 nuclear encoded complex I subunits in different brain regions of the mouse at E11.5, E17.5, P1, P11, P28 and adult (12 weeks). With respect to timing and relative intensity of complex I gene expression we found a highly variant pattern in different regions during development. High average expression levels were detected in periods of intense neurogenesis. In cerebellar Purkinje and in hippocampal CA1/CA3 pyramidal neurons we found a second even higher peak during the period of synaptogenesis and maturation. The extraordinary dependence of these structures on complex I gene expression during synaptogenesis is in accord with our recent findings that gamma oscillations – known to be associated with higher cognitive functions of the mammalian brain – strongly depend on the complex I activity. However, with the exception of the mesencephalon, we detected only average complex I expression levels in the striatum and basal ganglia, which does not explain the exquisite vulnerability of these structures in mitochondrial disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2018210702,"Finding new drug targets for pathogenic infections would be of great utility for humanity, as there is a large need to develop new drugs to fight infections due to the developing resistance and side effects of current treatments. Current drug targets for pathogen infections involve only a single protein. However, proteins rarely act in isolation, and the majority of biological processes occur via interactions with other proteins, so protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offer a realm of unexplored potential drug targets and are thought to be the next-generation of drug targets. Parasitic worms were chosen for this study because they have deleterious effects on human health, livestock, and plants, costing society billions of dollars annually and many sequenced genomes are available. In this study, we present a computational approach that utilizes whole genomes of 6 parasitic and 1 free-living worm species and 2 hosts. The species were placed in orthologous groups, then binned in species-specific orthologous groups. Proteins that are essential and conserved among species that span a phyla are of greatest value, as they provide foundations for developing broad-control strategies. Two PPI databases were used to find PPIs within the species specific bins. PPIs with unique helminth proteins and helminth proteins with unique features relative to the host, such as indels, were prioritized as drug targets. The PPIs were scored based on RNAi phenotype and homology to the PDB (Protein DataBank). EST data for the various life stages, GO annotation, and druggability were also taken into consideration. Several PPIs emerged from this study as potential drug targets. A few interactions were supported by co-localization of expression in M. incognita (plant parasite) and B. malayi (H. sapiens parasite), which have extremely different modes of parasitism. As more genomes of pathogens are sequenced and PPI databases expanded, this methodology will become increasingly applicable."
https://openalex.org/W2019183109,"Each segment of the influenza A virus (IAV) genome contains conserved sequences at the 5′- and 3′-terminal ends, which form the promoter region necessary for polymerase binding and initiation of RNA synthesis. Although several models of interaction have been proposed it remains unclear if these two short, partially complementary, and highly conserved sequences can form a stable RNA duplex at physiological temperatures. First, our time-resolved FRET analysis revealed that a 14-mer 3′-RNA and a 15-mer 5′-RNA associate in solution, even at 42 °C. We also found that a nonfunctional RNA promoter containing the 3′-G3U mutation, as well as a promoter containing the compensatory 3′-G3U/C8A mutations, was able to form a duplex as efficiently as wild type. Second, UV melting analysis demonstrated that the wild-type and mutant RNA duplexes have similar stabilities in solution. We also observed an increase in thermostability for a looped promoter structure. The absence of differences in the stability and binding kinetics between wild type and a nonfunctional sequence suggests that the IAV promoter can be functionally inactivated without losing the capability to form a stable RNA duplex. Finally, using uridine specific chemical probing combined with mass spectrometry, we confirmed that the 5′ and 3′ sequences form a duplex which protects both RNAs from chemical modification, consistent with the previously published panhandle structure. These data support that these short, conserved promoter sequences form a stable complex at physiological temperatures, and this complex likely is important for polymerase recognition and viral replication.

Influenza A virus (IAV) 2The abbreviations used are: IAVinfluenza A virusFRETFörster resonance energy transferCMCT1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate. belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and is the causative agent of both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. The IAV genome is composed of 8 segments of negative sense RNA and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. IAV RNA polymerase is a trimeric complex, composed of two basic subunits, PB1 and PB2, as well as an acidic subunit, PA. This enzyme carries out both transcription of viral mRNAs and replication, producing (+) complementary RNAs from the incoming (−) viral genomes (vRNA) and then new (−) vRNAs (1Ishihama A. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the IAV genome does not have a DNA stage, viral replication takes place in the host cell nucleus (2Herz C. Stavnezer E. Krug R. Gurney Jr., T. Cell. 1981; 26: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). During transcription, the virus uses host capped pre-mRNAs as primers for initiation of viral mRNA synthesis by binding the cap structure and cleaving a 10–13 nucleotide primer, which is then extended by the IAV polymerase complex (3Plotch S.J. Bouloy M. Ulmanen I. Krug R.M. Cell. 1981; 23: 847-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In contrast, replication of the genome occurs through a primer independent manner to generate a full length complement of the vRNA. Interestingly, though only the 3′-end of the genome serves as a template for initiation of RNA polymerization, both transcription and replication require the polymerase to be bound to both the 3′- and 5′-terminal ends of the vRNA segment, forming a looped structure. These terminal RNA sequences serve as a promoter for the initiation of RNA synthesis (4Fodor E. Pritlove D.C. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4092-4096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). influenza A virus Förster resonance energy transfer 1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate. Influenza genomes are known to be highly variable as viral strains accumulate mutations over time and can also reassort. This facilitates viral host switch and adaptation, resulting in novel, possibly pandemic IAV strains (5Kobasa D. Kawaoka Y. Curr. Mol. Med. 2005; 5: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Despite this genetic variability, the sequences of the IAV promoter are highly conserved between strains (6Hsu M.T. Parvin J.D. Gupta S. Krystal M. Palese P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8140-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Indeed, the conserved 13 and 12 nucleotide promoter sequences are found at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of every vRNA segment in virtually every strain of the virus. The only known exception is a single variation in the 3′-sequence, U4C. It is found on segments encoding the polymerase proteins and neuraminidase in a few strains, and may play a role in regulating protein expression (7Lee K.H. Seong B.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1923-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although this viral promoter, composed of the short 5′- and 3′-end regions, is necessary for the initiation of RNA synthesis, the structure and mechanism of IAV polymerase recognition remain unclear and rather controversial. An NMR structure supports a panhandle-like duplex of the IAV promoter RNA, though this structure was obtained at 4 °C using the two promoter sequences connected by a tetraloop (8Bae S.H. Cheong H.K. Lee J.H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This structure predicts base pairs between both the proximal and terminal ends of these sequences with a small internal loop. In contrast, other groups have evaluated the sequence and base pairing requirements for viral reporter gene expression from this promoter (9Kim H.J. Fodor E. Brownlee G.G. Seong B.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Leahy M.B. Dobbyn H.C. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7042-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Leahy M.B.

Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Flick R. Neumann G. Hoffmann E. Neumeier E. Hobom G. RNA. 1996; 2: 1046-1057PubMed Google Scholar). Their work suggests that the sequences form a corkscrew like structure when bound by the polymerase, with only a small Watson-Crick paired region and hairpin loops forming in both the 3′- and 5′-sequences. This corkscrew conformation would be unlikely to form in solution as the helices leading to the hairpin loops are short (two basepairs). It has been postulated that the polymerase first binds to the 5′-promoter region and then binds the 3′-promoter region (12Flick R. Hobom G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This model is supported by a study showing that purified ribonucleoprotein particles no longer form a looped structure once stripped of the polymerase complex (15Klumpp K. Ruigrok R.W. Baudin F. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This study however does not rule out more transient RNA interactions, which may have biological significance. It is also worth noting that the sequential model of interaction has been called into question by another study indicating that the polymerase is more active when the 5′- and 3′-promoter regions are added simultaneously rather than sequentially (14Cianci C. Tiley L. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3995-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the RNA may form a structure in the absence of protein that is sufficient for polymerase recognition and may play a role in regulating polymerase activity. The native, physiologic structure of the influenza promoter remains unclear. As noted above, formation of a panhandle-like duplex was observed when the promoter regions were linked by synthetic loop sequences considerably smaller than viral genomic segments (8Bae S.H. Cheong H.K. Lee J.H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Baudin F. Bach C. Cusack S. Ruigrok R.W. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This, along with low temperatures, could have facilitated the interaction of the promoter sequences. We therefore used multiple biophysical methodologies to investigate the interaction of the conserved short 5′- and 3′-promoter RNAs in solution, under more physiologic conditions. We also evaluated the impact of two different mutations in the 3′-sequence on the promoter duplex: (i) a 3′-G3U mutation that inactivates IAV promoter function in reporter gene assays and (ii) a compensatory mutation, C8A that restores wild-type levels of gene expression (12Flick R. Hobom G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. For time-resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (trFRET) experiments, the 5′-vRNA sequence was synthesized with a Cy3 label on the 5′-end. The 3′-vRNA sequences were synthesized with a Cy5 label on the 3′-end. The sequences used are shown in Figs. 1A and 2A. The sequences are shown and numbered starting from the terminal ends of the promoter such that the 5′-vRNA sequence is written 5′ to 3′ while the 3′-vRNA sequence is written 3′ to 5′. For optical melting, a looped RNA was also used that contained the 5′- and 3′-sequences connected by a UUCG tetraloop.FIGURE 2Mutations in the 3′-vRNA sequence do not prevent interaction of promoter RNAs. A, sequences and fluorophores used. B, sequences shown in A were mixed, and the Cy3 emission was recorded as shown in Fig. 1B. Four replicates of Cy3 emission were averaged and fit to a single exponential curve to determine the rate of interaction. Rates from three independent experiments were averaged and plotted versus temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fluorophore-labeled 5′-vRNA or 3′-vRNA was diluted to 200 nm in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.8 containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 150 mm KCl. This buffer was used for all subsequent experiments as well. All trFRET measurements were carried out using a SF2004 Stopped Flow Fluorimeter (Kintek Inc.). The two RNAs were loaded into independent syringe chambers. The RNAs were then pushed into a temperature controlled observation cell where the Cy3 donor fluorophore was excited with 545 nm light. The emission of Cy3 donor and Cy5 acceptor were detected with two photomultiplier tubes using 580 and 680 ± 10 nm bandpass filters, respectively. The emission of both fluorophores was measured at 1000 time points over 15 s. This was repeated at temperatures ranging from 20 to 45 °C. FRET was observed as a decrease in Cy3 emission and an increase in Cy5 emission. As a control for photobleaching, a 15-mer poly(rA) oligonucleotide labeled with Cy3 was used in place of the 5′-vRNA using the same conditions. Emission traces shown are an average of three replicates. To determine the rate of RNA interaction, the Cy3 emission intensity over time was fitted to a single exponential equation and the rate of decrease in Cy3 emission was taken as the rate of interaction of the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA. The rate was plotted versus temperature for all figures. This rate also corresponded to the rate of increase in the Cy5 acceptor though the magnitude of change was smaller. Three independent experiments were averaged to obtain rates. Only Cy3 emission was used for analysis. The 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA sequences used for FRET were synthesized for further experiments without the fluorophore label (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.). Melting experiments were carried out as described (17McDowell J.A. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14077-14089Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA were mixed at equal concentrations based on their A280 before being concentrated by a centrifugal vacuum. Samples were then resuspended in the previously described buffer. Melting was also measured for each sequence individually as well as a looped promoter similar to that used for the NMR structure (8Bae S.H. Cheong H.K. Lee J.H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Optical melting measurements were done at 280 nm with a heating rate of 1 °C/min from 0 to 90 °C on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer and repeated using decreasing concentrations of RNA. Because of the use of magnesium in the buffer, which leads to hydrolysis at high temperatures, new samples were used for each melt. Data were analyzed, and thermodynamic parameters were derived using MeltWin 3.5 (17McDowell J.A. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14077-14089Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Secondary structures shown in Fig. 4 were predicted by free energy minimization using RNAstructure v5.2 (18Reuter J.S. Mathews D.H. BMC. Bioinformatics. 2010; 11: 129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The structures predicted to be more stable at 37 °C are shown. 1-Cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 200 picomoles of each RNA were diluted in 18 μl of buffer. The RNA was annealed by heating at 65 °C for 2 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. 2 μl of 250 mm CMCT were added to the annealed RNA. Although CMCT preferentially reacts with unpaired uridines, it can also modify uridines at the end of helices as well as unpaired guanosines with higher concentrations and longer incubation times (19Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To ensure modification of only unpaired uridines the RNA was incubated with 25 mm CMCT for 15 min. The reaction was then stopped with the addition of 10 μl of 5 m sodium acetate and 150 μl of 100% ethanol. The RNA was precipitated at −80 °C for at least 2 h then pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. This precipitation step was repeated three times to remove remaining salt from the RNA. The RNA was resuspended in 3 μl of RNase-free water before MALDI-TOF MS analysis. 1 μl of a matrix solution containing 20 mm 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (MS grade), 50 mm diammonium citrate (ultra pure MS grade), and 25% acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was mixed with 1 μl of RNA on a steel target plate (Bruker) and allowed to dry completely. MS measurements were done with a Bruker Autoflex III Smartbeam. Singly charged RNA oligonucleotides were detected with the negative ion polarity mode. Three RNA standards (a 5-mer, 12-mer, and 20-mer) were used for calibration. Analysis was carried out using FlexAnalysis software (Bruker). First, we tested if the conserved terminal ends of the viral RNA genome can interact independently in solution without IAV RNA polymerase or other factors using a trFRET based system. As shown in Fig. 1A, a 15-mer RNA encoding the 5′-end IAV sequence (5′-vRNA) was conjugated at its 3′-end to Cy3, which serves as a donor fluorophore, and a 14-mer RNA encoding the 3′-end viral sequence (3′-vRNA) was conjugated to the Cy5 acceptor fluorophore at its 5′-end. This trFRET system allowed for detection of the initial association of the two independent RNAs by monitoring the emission of both Cy3 and Cy5 on a millisecond time scale. The two labeled RNAs were mixed at temperatures ranging from 20° to 45 °C. RNA duplex formation was monitored by the decrease in emission intensity of the Cy3 donor and the increase in emission intensity of the Cy5 acceptor over time. As shown by Cy3 emission in Fig. 1B, FRET was detected up to 42 °C, indicating that the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA physically interact in solution. Above 42 °C, no significant change in donor fluorescence over time was observed, indicating that the RNAs are no longer interacting at these higher temperatures. As a control for photobleaching and the effect of temperature on emission, a Cy3-labeled 15-mer poly(rA) was mixed with the Cy5-labeled 3′-vRNA. As shown in Fig. 1C, this control experiment showed no decrease in donor emission upon mixing and similar decreases in donor emission at time 0 due to increased temperature. This control experiment confirms that the decrease in Cy3 emission shown in Fig. 1B is due to the molecular interaction between the two IAV promoter RNAs, and more importantly, that the interaction can occur at physiological temperatures without other viral and cellular factors. Next, we investigated the effects of two previously characterized promoter mutations on duplex formation, 3′-G3U and 3′-G3U/C8A (Fig. 2A). It was previously shown that the 3′-G3U mutation inactivated IAV promoter function whereas the combined 3′-G3U/C8A mutations, which restored a proposed base pair in the corkscrew model, showed wild-type levels of reporter gene expression (12Flick R. Hobom G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our trFRET analysis revealed that both 3′-G3U and 3′-G3U/C8A mutant RNAs were able to form a duplex with the 5′-vRNA at temperatures up to 42 °C, as observed for the wild-type sequences (data not shown). To examine whether these 3′-vRNA mutations affect the kinetics of promoter duplex formation, the rates of change in donor emission were analyzed for both wild type and mutant promoters. As shown in Fig. 2B, the two mutated 3′-vRNA sequences formed a duplex slightly faster than the wild-type sequence. Overall, this demonstrates that the 3′-G3U sequence efficiently forms a duplex structure and that the lack of promoter activity is not due to the failure of the RNAs to associate. One possible reason for the lack of promoter activity associated with the 3′-G3U promoter is that it forms a thermodynamically less stable duplex than the wild type sequence. To determine the thermodynamic parameters of the promoter RNA duplex, optical melting measurements were performed. This technique measures the UV absorbance of RNA as a function of temperature to calculate the free energy change (ΔG°), entropy (ΔS°), and enthalpy (ΔH°), as well as the melting temperature (Tm) for structure formation (20Schroeder S.J. Turner D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 468: 371-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, the stability of the conserved wild-type 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA duplex was determined. A representative melting curve of a single RNA concentration is shown in Fig. 3A. Nine concentrations were used to derive a van't Hoff plot of the concentration dependence of melting temperature (Fig. 3B). By averaging the results of the curve fits and fitting the van't Hoff plot, two sets of thermodynamic parameters can be derived. The entropy (ΔS°) and enthalpy (ΔH°) values are used to calculate the free energy change (ΔG°). Importantly, as shown in Table 1, these methods yielded ΔH° values for the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA, which agree within 15% indicating that there is likely a transition from a single structured state to an unstructured state. This confirms that the viral promoter RNAs interact at biologically relevant temperatures with a Tm of 42.2 °C (at 1 × 10−4 m total oligonucleotide concentration). We also confirmed the relevance of our system by using a looped RNA harboring both 5′- and 3′-promoter sequences, which is similar to that used in the published NMR structure (8Bae S.H. Cheong H.K. Lee J.H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Indeed, the addition of a tetraloop to our promoter sequences resulted in the apparent Tm increasing to 49.4 °C. This added stabilization is expected and further confirms that the panhandle structure is stable at physiological temperatures. However, further thermodynamic characterization of this hairpin could not be performed, as this structure does not melt cooperatively. The stem region close to the loop likely melts at a higher temperatures than the less stable terminal stem. This leads to more complex melting curves that cannot be fit by the currently available software (20Schroeder S.J. Turner D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 468: 371-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of UV melting dataSequenceTM−1 vs log(CT/a)aa is 1 for self-complementary and 4 for non-self-complementary.Average of curve fits−ΔG°37−ΔH°37−ΔS°TMbCalculated for an RNA concentration of 1.0 × 10−4 m.−ΔG°37−ΔH°37−ΔS°TMbCalculated for an RNA concentration of 1.0 × 10−4 m.kcal/molkcal/moleu°Ckcal/molkcal/moleu°C5′-vRNA/3′-vRNA7.88 ± 0.1181. ± 5.8235.9 ± 18.742.27.77 ± 0.2470.8 ± 10.1203.1 ± 32.042.55′-vRNA/3′-G3U8.75 ± 0.1364.8 ± 4.2180.5 ± 13.148.08.65 ± 0.3463.8 ± 10.3177.8 ± 32.247.75′-vRNA/3′-G3U,C8A8.70 ± 0.1078.3 ± 4.6224.5 ± 14.645.98.72 ± 0.2685.2 ± 11.4246.6 ± 36.045.25′-vRNANDcNo secondary structures were detected.NDcNo secondary structures were detected.3′-vRNA8.05 ± 0.1388.12 ± 5.39258.3 ± 17.0246.67.34 ± 0.3751.3 ± 7.9241.7 ± 25.6047.4a a is 1 for self-complementary and 4 for non-self-complementary.b Calculated for an RNA concentration of 1.0 × 10−4 m.c No secondary structures were detected. Open table in a new tab This thermodynamic analysis was also used to compare the stability of duplexes formed by the mutated promoter sequences as well as to determine whether the 5′-vRNA or 3′-vRNA sequences form any self-complementary structure. The thermodynamic parameters obtained are summarized in Table 1. Both 3′-G3U and 3′-G3U/C8A promoters yielded structures with a slightly higher Tm and more favorable ΔG° than the wild-type promoter, supporting that these mutant promoters do not form less stable duplexes than the wild-type promoter. This is consistent with the trFRET data indicating that both mutant 3′-vRNAs form a duplex with the 5′-vRNA more efficiently than the wild-type RNA (Fig. 2). It is not clear at this point if this increased stability is significant enough to have an impact on polymerase binding or initiation of transcription. Interestingly, the 5′-vRNA formed no detectable self-complementary structure while the 3′-vRNA formed a structure with a Tm of 45.6 °C and a ΔG° of −8.05 kcal/mol at 37 °C, though the lack of agreement between the average of the curve fits and the van't Hoff plot suggests that more than one structure is forming. However, given the good agreement of the thermodynamic data for the combination of the 3′-vRNA and 5′-vRNA suggests that any alternative 3′-vRNA structures are likely only a small proportion of the structured RNA when both the sequences are present. We employed secondary structure prediction software to model the self-structure formation of the 3′-vRNA sequence. This analysis yielded two possible structures. The first is a hairpin loop with base pairing between nucleotides 2 and 9 as well as nucleotides 3 and 8 (Fig. 4A). This hairpin loop could also form a dimer with the palindromic CCGG stretch (Fig. 4B). These alternative structures may explain the slower rate of association for the wild-type RNA at low temperatures observed in Fig. 2B. These 3′-vRNA self-structures may also be destabilized by the G3U and G3U/C8A 3′ sequences, which could explain the slightly higher Tm observed for these sequences when compared with the wild-type sequence (Table 1). In summary, the data presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the 3′-G3U and G3U/C8A mutations do not decrease, and possibly increase, the stability of the promoter duplex. We next investigated if the predicted structures of the IAV promoter discussed above form in solution under our experimental conditions. For this we employed a chemical probing method combined with MALDI-TOF MS. In this analysis, CMCT chemically modifies unpaired uridines resulting in modified RNAs with a higher mass than the unmodified RNAs. These molecular weight (M.W.) shifts can be detected by MS analysis (21Turner K.B. Yi-Brunozzi H.Y. Brinson R.G. Marino J.P. Fabris D. Le Grice S.F. RNA. 2009; 15: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As expected from the sequence (Fig. 1A), CMCT should be able to modify the 5′-vRNA sequence in solution, as UV melting experiments (Table 1) indicated it is not structured. Although UV melting revealed structure in the 3′-vRNA sequence, both predicted secondary structures (Fig. 4, A and B) have several unpaired uridines that would be accessible to modification. This was confirmed using 25 mm CMCT incubated with either the 5′-vRNA or 3′-vRNA at 37 °C for 15 min. CMCT modifications were then detected with MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 5A, the spectrum of unmodified 3′-vRNA showed a peak at M.W. 4,375 (see “*”), with several slightly higher molecular weight peaks due to salt binding. When incubated with CMCT, a peak appeared at M.W. 4,627 (“**”). This corresponds to a single CMCT modification leading to a 252 Da increase in mass, again together with several higher M.W. peaks due to salt binding. A similar labeling pattern was observed for the 5′-vRNA alone (Fig. 5B) with a peak at M.W. 4,843 and several salt-bound peaks. When incubated with CMCT peaks were observed corresponding to an increase in mass due to modification (see “**” in inset). This confirms that under these conditions unpaired uridines in both the 3′-vRNA and 5′-vRNA are modified by CMCT. The predicted panhandle duplex (Fig. 4C) has no unpaired uridines and thus we predicted that the CMCT modification observed with the individual RNAs seen in Fig. 5, A and B should not be detected if this duplex is forming in the solution. This would also confirm that the corkscrew conformation (Fig. 4D) is not present in solution. When 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA were annealed (Fig. 5C, left panel) both 5′-vRNA specific and 3′-vRNA specific MS peaks, identical to those observed for the unmodified individual RNAs (left panels of Fig. 5, A and B), were observed. However, when the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA duplex was incubated with CMCT, the distinct higher M.W. peaks corresponding to a modified uridine (see “**” in right panels of Fig. 5, A and B), were no longer detected (Fig. 5C, right panel). Thus, this chemical probing analysis suggests that the IAV promoter RNAs form a panhandle-like duplex in solution which protects the uridines in both strands from CMCT modification. While morbidity and mortality due to influenza continue to have a large impact on public health, the molecular mechanisms underlying many steps of influenza A virus replication are not well understood. Although only the 3′-end of the viral genome segment is necessary as a template for RNA synthesis, the polymerase complex is not active without being bound to both the 5′- and 3′-terminal ends of the vRNA. Indeed, these terminal sequences are highly conserved among IAV strains and essential for viral replication (4Fodor E. Pritlove D.C. Brownlee G.G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4092-4096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remained unclear if the promoter RNAs are able to form a duplex without stabilization by cellular or viral factors at physiologic temperatures. Indeed, data from the trFRET analysis (Fig. 1) and UV melting (Fig. 3) clearly suggest that the 5′-vRNA and 3′-vRNA can form a duplex in solution at temperatures at which viral replication occurs. We also confirmed that the looped RNA used in the NMR study is structured at physiological temperatures. These data, along with the chemical probing data (Fig. 5), suggest that the panhandle duplex structure, which was observed at 4 °C by the NMR analysis (8Bae S.H. Cheong H.K. Lee J.H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), is likely present at higher, more biologically relevant temperatures, and thus may play a role in initiation of RNA synthesis and/or polymerase binding during viral assembly. This information is valuable for any further studies using these sequences including evaluating the impact of the 3′ mutations on polymerase binding. The sequence and base pairing requirements for a functional promoter have been studied using mutagenesis (12Flick R. Hobom G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Flick R. Neumann G. Hoffmann E. Neumeier E. Hobom G. RNA. 1996; 2: 1046-1057PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, it is not clear which step(s) of IAV RNA synthesis the characterized mutations impede. A single base change in the 3′ sequence (G3U) drastically reduced promoter activity in a reporter gene assay, but this does not appear to be due to the inability of this sequence to form an RNA duplex in this study. Indeed, both the nonfunctional G3U and functional G3U/C8A 3′ sequences interacted with the 5′-vRNA sequence with similar rates (Fig. 2B) and did not show decreased stability (Table 1). One possible explanation is that there is a difference in the way the nonfunctional sequence is bound by the polymerase complex. The previous studies using a reporter gene assay found that there was not a strict sequence requirement for the promoter, but rather that base pairing was necessary to form the corkscrew structure. This fits with a sequential model of the RNA interacting with the polymerase complex (12Flick R. Hobom G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2565-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, given this lack of sequence requirement, it is surprising that this region is highly conserved. Possibly, this region may need to form two stable structures during the course of viral replication. A panhandle-like duplex may form between the terminal ends of newly synthesized genome segments. This structure may then be bound by the polymerase complex, facilitating the transition to the corkscrew formation of the RNA. This transition also leaves the 3′-end unpaired, allowing for the re-initiation of the next round of RNA synthesis. It has also been shown that the functional activities of the viral polymerase are differentially activated when it binds to the promoter sequences sequentially versus when it can bind the promoter sequence simultaneously (14Cianci C. Tiley L. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3995-3999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of an RNA duplex in solution could therefore be important for regulating the different activities of the polymerase (such as capped mRNA binding and endonuclease activity), but this may be missed when using a reporter gene assay. Previous work used crosslinking of the promoter RNA to the polymerase to estimate binding affinity (22González S. Ortin J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 631-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the possibility of a conformational change between two RNA structures, it seems likely that a mutation such as the 3′-G3U, which still forms a duplex, may not affect the initial binding of the polymerase complex. It could, however, affect the stability of the corkscrew conformation of the promoter, possibly leading to a failure to initiate RNA synthesis. In addition, the promoter sequences of IAV gene segments are only partially complementary and a fully double-stranded promoter is not functional and will not be bound by the polymerase (23Tiley L.S. Hagen M. Matthews J.T. Krystal M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5108-5116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This supports the idea that a less stable duplex may facilitate the transition between these two RNA promoter structures (Fig. 4, C and D) during the initiation of RNA synthesis. Finally, while the biophysical data presented in this study support the formation of a panhandle-like structure in solution at physiological temperatures, much work is needed to mechanistically understand what factors influence the regulation of viral mRNA production versus genome replication, as well as assembly of the viral polymerase and RNA segments for packaging."
https://openalex.org/W2084268410,"Analysis of chromosomal rearrangements within primary tumors has been influential in the identification of novel oncogenes. Identification of the ""driver"" gene(s) within cancer-derived amplicons is, however, hampered by the fact that most amplicons contain many gene products. Amplification of 1q21-1q23 is strongly associated with liposarcomas and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization narrowed down the likely candidate oncogenes to two: the activating transcription factor 6 (atf6) and the dual specificity phosphatase 12 (dusp12). While atf6 is an established transcriptional regulator of the unfolded protein response, the potential role of dusp12 in cancer remains uncharacterized.To evaluate the oncogenic potential of dusp12, we established stable cell lines that ectopically over-express dusp12 in isolation and determined whether this cell line acquired properties frequently associated with transformed cells. Here, we demonstrate that cells over-expressing dusp12 display increased cell motility and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, over-expression of dusp12 promoted increased expression of the c-met proto-oncogene and the collagen and laminin receptor intergrin alpha 1 (itga1) which is implicated in metastasis.Collectively, these results suggest that dusp12 is oncologically relevant and exposes a potential association between dusp12 and established oncogenes that could be therapeutically targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2148696932,"Prion diseases are infectious neurodegenerative disorders associated with the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc), which appears to be the sole component of the infectious agent (termed prion). To produce disease, prions have to be absorbed into the body and reach sufficient quantities in the brain. Very little is known about the biological mechanisms controlling the initial fate of prions. Here, we studied the systemic pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of PrPSc in vivo. After an intravenous injection of highly purified radiolabeled or native unlabeled PrPSc, the protein was eliminated rapidly from the serum (half-life of 3.24 h), mostly through tissue uptake. The quantity of intact PrPSc reaching the brain was ~0.2% of the injected dose per gram of brain tissue (ID/g). The highest levels were found in liver (~20% ID/g), spleen (~13% ID/g), and kidney (~7.4% ID/g). Cell surface PrPC does not appear to play a role in PrPSc pharmacokinetics, since the infectious protein distributed similarly in wild-type and PrP-null mice. To measure tissue uptake kinetics and biodistribution accurately, vascular space in tissues was measured with radioactively labeled albumin coinjected with radioactively labeled PrPSc. Our results provide a fundamental pharmacokinetic characterization of PrPSc in vivo, which may be relevant to estimate tissue risks and mechanisms of prion neuroinvasion and to identify novel therapeutic strategies.—Urayama, A., Morales, R., Niehoff, M.

https://openalex.org/W1992213404,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) exploits a number of host cellular factors for successful survival and propagation. The viral protein Nef plays an important role in HIV-1 pathogenesis by interacting with various cellular proteins. In the present work, we identified Cyclin K (CycK) as a novel Nef-interacting protein, and for the first time, we showed that CycK inhibits HIV-1 gene expression and replication in a Nef-dependent manner. The positive elongation factor b complex comprising cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and Cyclin T1 is a critical cellular complex required for viral gene expression and replication. Enhanced expression of CycK in the presence of Nef induced CycK-CDK9 binding, which prevented CDK9-Cyclin T1 complex formation and nuclear translocation of CDK9, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven gene expression. Furthermore, this effect of CycK was not observed with Nef-deleted virus, indicating the importance of Nef in this phenomenon. Finally, silencing of CycK in HIV-1-infected cells resulted in increased translocation of CDK9 into the nucleus, leading to increased viral gene expression and replication. These data also suggest that endogenous CycK might act as an inhibitory factor for HIV-1 gene expression and replication in T-cells. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that CycK utilizes HIV-1 Nef protein to displace CycT1 from the positive elongation factor b complex, resulting in inhibition of HIV-1 gene expression and replication."
https://openalex.org/W2131393691,"Our aim was to elucidate the physical background of internal friction of enzyme reactions by investigating the temperature dependence of internal viscosity. By rapid transient kinetic methods, we directly measured the rate constant of trypsin 4 activation, which is an interdomain conformational rearrangement, as a function of temperature and solvent viscosity. We found that the apparent internal viscosity shows an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, which can be characterized by the activation energy of internal friction. Glycine and alanine mutations were introduced at a single position of the hinge of the interdomain region to evaluate how the flexibility of the hinge affects internal friction. We found that the apparent activation energies of the conformational change and the internal friction are interconvertible parameters depending on the protein flexibility. The more flexible a protein was, the greater proportion of the total activation energy of the reaction was observed as the apparent activation energy of internal friction. Based on the coupling of the internal and external movements of the protein during its conformational change, we constructed a model that quantitatively relates activation energy, internal friction, and protein flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2159265890,"The quantification of the relationships between walking and health requires that walking is measured accurately. We correlated different measures of step accumulation to body size, overall physical activity level, and glucose regulation.Participants were 25 men and 25 women American Indians without diabetes (Age: 20-34 years) in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. We assessed steps/day during 7 days of free living, simultaneously with three different monitors (Accusplit-AX120, MTI-ActiGraph, and Dynastream-AMP). We assessed total physical activity during free-living with doubly labeled water combined with resting metabolic rate measured by expired gas indirect calorimetry. Glucose tolerance was determined during an oral glucose tolerance test.Based on observed counts in the laboratory, the AMP was the most accurate device, followed by the MTI and the AX120, respectively. The estimated energy cost of 1000 steps per day was lower in the AX120 than the MTI or AMP. The correlation between AX120-assessed steps/day and waist circumference was significantly higher than the correlation between AMP steps and waist circumference. The difference in steps per day between the AX120 and both the AMP and the MTI were significantly related to waist circumference.Between-monitor differences in step counts influence the observed relationship between walking and obesity-related traits."
https://openalex.org/W1974393054,"Elongation factor RbbA is required for ATP-dependent deacyl-tRNA release presumably after each peptide bond formation; however, there is no information about the cellular role. Proteomic analysis in Escherichia coli revealed that RbbA reciprocally co-purified with a conserved inner membrane protein of unknown function, YhjD. Both proteins are also physically associated with the 30S ribosome and with members of the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery. Genome-wide genetic screens of rbbA and yhjD deletion mutants revealed aggravating genetic interactions with mutants deficient in the electron transport chain. Cells lacking both rbbA and yhjD exhibited reduced cell division, respiration and global protein synthesis as well as increased sensitivity to antibiotics targeting the ETC and the accuracy of protein synthesis. Our results suggest that RbbA appears to function together with YhjD as part of a regulatory network that impacts bacterial oxidative phosphorylation and translation efficiency."

Here, we show that SDF1's antirepellent effect can be blocked in embryonic chick dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) by expression of peptides or proteins inhibiting either Gα(i), Gα(q), or Gβγ. SDF1 antirepellent activity is also blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PLC, a common effector protein for Gα(q). We also show that SDF1 antirepellent activity can be mimicked by overexpression of constitutively active Gα(i), Gα(q), or Gα(s). These results suggest a model in which multiple G protein components cooperate to produce the cAMP levels required for SDF1 antirepellent activity."
https://openalex.org/W2051140826,"Experience-dependent functional plasticity is a hallmark of the primary visual system, but it is not known if analogous mechanisms govern development of the circadian visual system. Here we investigated molecular, anatomical, and behavioral consequences of complete monocular light deprivation during extended intervals of postnatal development in Syrian hamsters. Hamsters were raised in constant darkness and opaque contact lenses were applied shortly after eye opening and prior to the introduction of a light-dark cycle. In adulthood, previously-occluded eyes were challenged with visual stimuli. Whereas image-formation and motion-detection were markedly impaired by monocular occlusion, neither entrainment to a light-dark cycle, nor phase-resetting responses to shifts in the light-dark cycle were affected by prior monocular deprivation. Cholera toxin-b subunit fluorescent tract-tracing revealed that in monocularly-deprived hamsters the density of fibers projecting from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was comparable regardless of whether such fibers originated from occluded or exposed eyes. In addition, long-term monocular deprivation did not attenuate light-induced c-Fos expression in the SCN. Thus, in contrast to the thalamocortical projections of the primary visual system, retinohypothalamic projections terminating in the SCN develop into normal adult patterns and mediate circadian responses to light largely independent of light experience during development. The data identify a categorical difference in the requirement for light input during postnatal development between circadian and non-circadian visual systems."
https://openalex.org/W1988140427,"Background One of the key pathological features of AD is the formation of insoluble amyloid plaques. The major constituent of these extracellular plaques is the beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ), although Aβ is also found to accumulate intraneuronally in AD. Due to the slowly progressive nature of the disease, it is likely that neurons are exposed to sublethal concentrations of both intracellular and extracellular Aβ for extended periods of time. Results In this study, we report that daily exposure to a sublethal concentration of Aβ1-40 (1 µM) for six days induces substantial apoptosis of cortical neurons cultured from Tg2576 mice (which express substantial but sublethal levels of intracellular Aβ). Notably, untreated Tg2576 neurons of similar age did not display any signs of apoptosis, indicating that the level of intracellular Aβ present in these neurons was not the cause of toxicity. Furthermore, wildtype neurons did not become apoptotic under the same chronic Aβ1-40 treatment. We found that this apoptosis was linked to Tg2576 neurons being unable to maintain K+ homeostasis following Aβ treatment. Furthermore, blocking K+ efflux protected Tg2576 neurons from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Interestingly, chronic exposure to 1 µM Aβ1-40 caused the generation of axonal swellings in Tg2576 neurons that contained dense concentrations of hyperphosphorylated tau. These were not observed in wildtype neurons under the same treatment conditions. Conclusions Our data suggest that when neurons are chronically exposed to sublethal levels of both intra- and extra-cellular Aβ, this causes a K+-dependent neurodegeneration that has pathological characteristics similar to AD."
https://openalex.org/W2112058764,"Language comprehension is a complex task that involves a wide network of brain regions. We used topological measures to qualify and quantify the functional connectivity of the networks used under various comprehension conditions. To that aim we developed a technique to represent functional networks based on EEG recordings, taking advantage of their excellent time resolution in order to capture the fast processes that occur during language comprehension. Networks were created by searching for a specific causal relation between areas, the negative feedback loop, which is ubiquitous in many systems. This method is a simple way to construct directed graphs using event-related activity, which can then be analyzed topologically. Brain activity was recorded while subjects read expressions of various types and indicated whether they found them meaningful. Slightly different functional networks were obtained for event-related activity evoked by each expression type. The differences reflect the special contribution of specific regions in each condition and the balance of hemispheric activity involved in comprehending different types of expressions and are consistent with the literature in the field. Our results indicate that representing event-related brain activity as a network using a simple temporal relation, such as the negative feedback loop, to indicate directional connectivity is a viable option for investigation which also derives new information about aspects not reflected in the classical methods for investigating brain activity."
