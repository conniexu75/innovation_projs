https://openalex.org/W2538646054,"Linkage of longitudinal administrative data for mothers and babies supports research and service evaluation in several populations around the world. We established a linked mother-baby cohort using pseudonymised, population-level data for England.Retrospective linkage study using electronic hospital records of mothers and babies admitted to NHS hospitals in England, captured in Hospital Episode Statistics between April 2001 and March 2013.Of 672,955 baby records in 2012/13, 280,470 (42%) linked deterministically to a maternal record using hospital, GP practice, maternal age, birthweight, gestation, birth order and sex. A further 380,164 (56%) records linked using probabilistic methods incorporating additional variables that could differ between mother/baby records (admission dates, ethnicity, 3/4-character postcode district) or that include missing values (delivery variables). The false-match rate was estimated at 0.15% using synthetic data. Data quality improved over time: for 2001/02, 91% of baby records were linked (holding the estimated false-match rate at 0.15%). The linked cohort was representative of national distributions of gender, gestation, birth weight and maternal age, and captured approximately 97% of births in England.Probabilistic linkage of maternal and baby healthcare characteristics offers an efficient way to enrich maternity data, improve data quality, and create longitudinal cohorts for research and service evaluation. This approach could be extended to linkage of other datasets that have non-disclosive characteristics in common."
https://openalex.org/W2536109951,"Introduction The number of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the long-term management of HIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is continuing to increase, along with the prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). The need to provide large volumes of HIV patients with ART has led to significant adaptations in how medication is delivered, but access to NCD care remains limited in many contexts. Medication Adherence Clubs (MACs) were established in Kibera, Kenya to address the large numbers of patients requiring chronic HIV and/or NCD care. Stable NCD and HIV patients can now collect their chronic medication every three months through a club, rather than through individual clinic appointments. Methodology We conducted a qualitative research study to assess patient and health-care worker perceptions and experiences of MACs in the urban informal settlement of Kibera, Kenya. A total of 106 patients (with HIV and/or other NCDs) and health-care workers were purposively sampled and included in the study. Ten focus groups and 19 in-depth interviews were conducted and 15 sessions of participant observation were carried out at the clinic where the MACs took place. Thematic data analysis was conducted using NVivo software, and coding focussed on people’s experiences of MACs, the challenges they faced and their perceptions about models of care for chronic conditions. Results MACs were considered acceptable to patients and health-care workers because they saved time, prevented unnecessary queues in the clinic and provided people with health education and group support whilst they collected their medication. Some patients and health-care workers felt that MACs reduced stigma for HIV positive patients by treating HIV as any other chronic condition. Staff and patients reported challenges recruiting patients into MACs, including patients not fully understanding the eligibility criteria for the clubs. There were also some practical challenges during the implementation of the clubs, but MACs have shown that it is possible to learn from ART provision and enable stable HIV and NCD patients to collect chronic medication together in a group. Conclusions Extending models of care previously only offered to HIV-positive cohorts to NCD patients can help to de-stigmatise HIV, allow for the efficient clinical management of co-morbidities and enable patients to benefit from peer support. Through MACs, we have demonstrated that an integrated approach to providing medication for chronic diseases including HIV can be implemented in resource-poor settings and could thus be rolled out in other similar contexts."

The source of the fertilizer (mineral or organic) had significant effect in the nutritional status of the organic and conventionally managed mandarins. Nutrient uptake, vegetative growth, carbohydrate synthesis and soil characteristics were analyzed. Results showed that plants fertilized with animal based liquid fertilizers exhibited higher total biomass with a more profuse development of new developing organs (leaves and fibrous roots). Liquid organic fertilization resulted in an increased uptake of macro and micronutrients compared to mineral fertilized trees. Moreover, organic fertilization positively affected the carbohydrate content (fructose, glucose and sucrose) mainly in summer flush leaves. Liquid organic fertilization also resulted in an increase of soil organic matter content. Animal-based fertilizer, due to intrinsic composition, increased total tree biomass and carbohydrate leaves content, and led to lower soil nitrate concentration and higher P and Mg exchangeable in soil extract compared to vegetal-based fertilizer. Therefore, liquid organic fertilizers could be used as an alternative to traditional mineral fertilization in drip irrigated citrus trees."

These tumors should be ideal for T-cell based therapies, yet it is not clear why prognostically-infaust tumors have a high HLA expression. We set out to determine whether the level of HLA molecules in UM is associated with other genetic factors, HLA transcriptional regulators, or microenvironmental factors.28 enucleated UM were used to study HLA class I and II expression, and several regulators of HLA by immunohistochemistry, PCR microarray, qPCR and chromosome SNP-array. Fresh tumor samples of eight primary UM and four metastases were compared to their corresponding xenograft in SCID mice, using a PCR microarray and SNP array.Increased expression levels of HLA class I and II showed no dosage effect of chromosome 6p, but, as expected, were associated with monosomy of chromosome 3. Increased HLA class I and II protein levels were positively associated with their gene expression and with raised levels of the peptide-loading gene TAP1, and HLA transcriptional regulators IRF1, IRF8, CIITA, and NLRC5, revealing a higher transcriptional activity in prognostically-bad tumors. Implantation of fresh human tumor samples into SCID mice led to a loss of infiltrating leukocytes, and to a decreased expression of HLA class I and II genes, and their regulators.Our data provides evidence for a proper functioning HLA regulatory system in UM, offering a target for T-cell based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2535169565,"Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) makes up 5–20% of the phospholipids of Escherichia coli and is essential for growth in wild-type cells. PG is synthesized from the dephosphorylation of its immediate precursor, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) whose synthase in E. coli is PgsA. Using genetic, biochemical, and highly sensitive mass spectrometric approaches, we identified an alternative mechanism for PG synthesis in E. coli that is PgsA independent. The reaction of synthesis involves the conversion of phosphatidylethanolamine and glycerol into PG and is catalyzed by ClsB, a phospholipase D-type cardiolipin synthase. This enzymatic reaction is demonstrated herein both in vivo and in vitro as well as by using the purified ClsB protein. When the growth medium was supplemented with glycerol, the expression of E. coli ClsB significantly increased PG and cardiolipin levels, with the growth deficiency of pgsA null strain also being complemented under such conditions. Identification of this alternative mechanism for PG synthesis not only expands our knowledge of bacterial anionic phospholipid biosynthesis, but also sheds light on the biochemical functions of the cls gene redundancy in E. coli and other bacteria. Finally, the PGP-independent PG synthesis in E. coli may also have important implications for the understanding of PG biosynthesis in eukaryotes that remains incomplete.

https://openalex.org/W2538028846,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of natural Pomegranate juice supplementation on performance and acute and delayed responses of muscle soreness and biomarkers of muscle damage after a weightlifting training session.Nine elite weightlifters (21±0.5 years) performed two Olympic-Weightlifting-sessions after either placebo (PLA) or natural pomegranate juice (POMj) supplementations. Heart rate, blood pressure and blood samples (hematological parameters, muscle damage and C-reactive protein (CRP)) were collected at rest, 3min and 48h after each session. Weightlifting performance, RPE, and DOMS were also assessed after each training session.T-test showed higher performance (+8.30%) and lower RPE values (-4.37%) using POMj supplementation (p<0.05) in comparison with PLA. For the DOMS values, a significant improvement (13.4%) was shown only for the knee extensors (p<0.01) using the POMj. Compared to PLA condition, POMj attenuated the acute (i.e., 3min) increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP), HR, CK and LDH (p<0.05; -4.46%, -1.81%, -8.75%, -1.64%, respectively) and blunted the significant increase of ASAT, PAL and CRP (p>0.05). Additionally, during the 48h following the training session, POMj improved the recovery kinetic of SBP (p<0.01, 7.97%), CK (p<0.001, 11.34%), LDH (p<0.05, 7.30%) and ASAT (p<0.05, 6.77%). Indeed, the present study showed that 48h of recovery associated to natural POMj supplementation was sufficient to reach the resting values of the selected muscle damage markers after intensive training session.Natural POMj seems to ameliorate the capacity to adhere to an intensive training program. Therefore, elite weightlifters are advised to use natural POMj during intensive training program and competition to accelerate muscle recovery.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02697903."
https://openalex.org/W2535836947,"A search of archival X-ray data for 70 nearby galaxies yielded two flaring sources in globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf companions of parent elliptical galaxies. A search of archival X-ray data for 70 nearby galaxies has yielded two flaring sources in globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf companions of parent elliptical galaxies. One source flared once, and the other five times. When not flaring, these sources appear to be normal accreting neutron-star or black-hole X-ray binaries. Unlike magnetars and other bodies that produce repetitive flares of similar luminosity, they are located in old stellar populations. A flaring X-ray source was found near the galaxy NGC 4697 (ref. 1). Two brief flares were seen, separated by four years. During each flare, the flux increased by a factor of 90 on a timescale of about one minute. There is no associated optical source at the position of the flares1, but if the source was at the distance of NGC 4697, then the luminosities of the flares were greater than 1039 erg per second. Here we report the results of a search of archival X-ray data for 70 nearby galaxies looking for similar flares. We found two ultraluminous flaring sources in globular clusters or ultracompact dwarf companions of parent elliptical galaxies. One source flared once to a peak luminosity of 9 × 1040 erg per second; the other flared five times to 1040 erg per second. The rise times of all of the flares were less than one minute, and the flares then decayed over about an hour. When not flaring, the sources appear to be normal accreting neutron-star or black-hole X-ray binaries, but they are located in old stellar populations, unlike the magnetars, anomalous X-ray pulsars or soft γ repeaters that have repetitive flares of similar luminosities."
https://openalex.org/W2536326322,"Current theories of numerical cognition posit that uniquely human symbolic number abilities connect to an early developing cognitive system for representing approximate numerical magnitudes, the approximate number system (ANS). In support of this proposal, recent laboratory-based training experiments with U.S. children show enhanced performance on symbolic addition after brief practice comparing or adding arrays of dots without counting: tasks that engage the ANS. Here we explore the nature and generality of this effect through two brief training experiments. In Experiment 1, elementary school children in Pakistan practiced either a non-symbolic numerical addition task or a line-length addition task with no numerical content, and then were tested on symbolic addition. After training, children in the numerical training group completed the symbolic addition test faster than children in the line length training group, suggesting a causal role of brief, non-symbolic numerical training on exact, symbolic addition. These findings replicate and extend the core findings of a recent U.S. laboratory-based study to non-Western children tested in a school setting, attesting to the robustness and generalizability of the observed training effects. Experiment 2 tested whether ANS training would also enhance the consistency of performance on a symbolic number line task. Over several analyses of the data there was some evidence that approximate number training enhanced symbolic number line placements relative to control conditions. Together, the findings suggest that engagement of the ANS through brief training procedures enhances children's immediate attention to number and engagement with symbolic number tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2533359449,"Introduction The generation of Rho-0 cells requires the use of an immortalization process, or tumor cell selection, followed by culture in the presence of ethidium bromide (EtBr), incurring the drawbacks its use entails. The purpose of this work was to generate Rho-0 cells using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with reagents having the ability to remove mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) more safely than by using EtBr. Methodology Two immortalized hMSC lines (3a6 and KP) were used; 143B.TK-Rho-0 cells were used as reference control. For generation of Rho-0 hMSCs, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with each tested reagent. Total DNA was isolated and mtDNA content was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phenotypic characterization and gene expression assays were performed to determine whether 3a6 Rho-0 hMSCs maintain the same stem properties as untreated 3a6 hMSCs. To evaluate whether 3a6 Rho-0 hMSCs had a phenotype similar to that of 143B.TK-Rho-0 cells, in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptotic levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) were measured by flow cytometry and mitochondrial respiration was evaluated using a SeaHorse XFp Extracellular Flux Analyzer. The differentiation capacity of 3a6 and 3a6 Rho-0 hMSCs was evaluated using real-time PCR, comparing the relative expression of genes involved in osteogenesis, adipogenesis and chondrogenesis. Results The results showed the capacity of the 3a6 cell line to deplete its mtDNA and to survive in culture with uridine. Of all tested drugs, Stavudine (dt4) was the most effective in producing 3a6-Rho cells. The data indicate that hMSC Rho-0 cells continue to express the characteristic MSC cell surface receptor pattern. Phenotypic characterization showed that 3a6 Rho-0 cells resembled 143B.TK-Rho-0 cells, indicating that hMSC Rho-0 cells are Rho-0 cells. While the adipogenic capability was higher in 3a6 Rho-0 cells than in 3a6 cells, the osteogenic and chondrogenic capacities were lower. Conclusion Among the drugs and conditions tested, the use of d4t was the best option for producing Rho-0 cells from hMSCs. Rho-0 cells are useful for studying the role of mitochondria in hMSC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2532409530,"While there has been a rapid global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy programs over the past decade, there are limited data on long-term outcomes from large cohorts in resource-constrained settings. Our objective in this evaluation was to measure multiple outcomes during first-line antiretroviral therapy in a large treatment program in Nigeria.We conducted a retrospective multi-site program evaluation of adult patients (age ≥15 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy between June 2004 and February 2012 in Nigeria. The baseline characteristics of patients were described and longitudinal analyses using primary endpoints of immunologic recovery, virologic rebound, treatment failure and long-term adherence patterns were conducted.Of 70,002 patients, 65.2% were female and median age was 35 (IQR: 29-41) years; 54.7% were started on a zidovudine-containing and 40% on a tenofovir-containing first-line regimen. Median CD4+ cell counts for the cohort started at 149 cells/mm3 (IQR: 78-220) and increased over duration of ART. Of the 70,002 patients, 1.8% were reported as having died, 30.1% were lost to follow-up, and 0.1% withdrew from treatment. Overall, of those patients retained and with viral load data, 85.4% achieved viral suppression, with 69.3% achieving suppression by month 6. Of 30,792 patients evaluated for virologic failure, 24.4% met criteria for failure and of 45,130 evaluated for immunologic failure, 34.0% met criteria for immunologic failure, with immunologic criteria poorly predicting virologic failure. In adjusted analyses, older age, ART regimen, lower CD4+ cell count, higher viral load, and inadequate adherence were all predictors of virologic failure. Predictors of immunologic failure differed slightly, with age no longer predictive, but female sex as protective; additionally, higher baseline CD4+ cell count was also predictive of failure. Evaluation of long-term adherence patterns revealed that the majority of patients retained through 84 months maintained ≥95% adherence.While improved access to HIV care and treatment remains a challenge in Nigeria, our study shows that a high quality of care was achieved as evidenced by strong long-term clinical, immunologic and virologic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2533006727,"Introduction Inverse dynamics joint kinetics are often used to infer contributions from underlying groups of muscle-tendon units (MTUs). However, such interpretations are confounded by multiarticular (multi-joint) musculature, which can cause inverse dynamics to over- or under-estimate net MTU power. Misestimation of MTU power could lead to incorrect scientific conclusions, or to empirical estimates that misguide musculoskeletal simulations, assistive device designs, or clinical interventions. The objective of this study was to investigate the degree to which ankle joint power overestimates net plantarflexor MTU power during the Push-off phase of walking, due to the behavior of the flexor digitorum and hallucis longus (FDHL)–multiarticular MTUs crossing the ankle and metatarsophalangeal (toe) joints. Methods We performed a gait analysis study on six healthy participants, recording ground reaction forces, kinematics, and electromyography (EMG). Empirical data were input into an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model to estimate ankle power. This model enabled us to parse contributions from mono- and multi-articular MTUs, and required only one scaling and one time delay factor for each subject and speed, which were solved for based on empirical data. Net plantarflexing MTU power was computed by the model and quantitatively compared to inverse dynamics ankle power. Results The EMG-driven model was able to reproduce inverse dynamics ankle power across a range of gait speeds (R2 ≥ 0.97), while also providing MTU-specific power estimates. We found that FDHL dynamics caused ankle power to slightly overestimate net plantarflexor MTU power, but only by ~2–7%. Conclusions During Push-off, FDHL MTU dynamics do not substantially confound the inference of net plantarflexor MTU power from inverse dynamics ankle power. However, other methodological limitations may cause inverse dynamics to overestimate net MTU power; for instance, due to rigid-body foot assumptions. Moving forward, the EMG-driven modeling approach presented could be applied to understand other tasks or larger multiarticular MTUs."
https://openalex.org/W2536626477,In the present study we have investigated whether Caveolin-1 expression in non-malignant and malignant prostate tissue is a potential prognostic marker for outcome in prostate cancer patients managed by watchful waiting. Caveolin-1 was measured in prostate tissues obtained through transurethral resection of the prostate from 395 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. The majority of the patients (n = 298) were followed by watchful waiting after diagnosis. Tissue microarrays constructed from malignant and non-malignant prostate tissue were stained with an antibody against Caveolin-1. The staining pattern was scored and related to clinicopathologic parameters and outcome. Microdissection and qRT-PCR analysis of Cav-1 was done of the prostate stroma from non-malignant tissue and stroma from Gleason 3 and 4 tumors. Cav-1 RNA expression was highest in non-malignant tissue and decreased during cancer progression. High expression of Caveolin-1 in tumor stroma was associated with significantly longer cancer specific survival in prostate cancer patients. This association remained significant when Gleason score and local tumor stage were combined with Caveolin-1 in a Cox regression model. High stromal Caveolin-1 immunoreactivity in prostate tumors is associated with a favourable prognosis in prostate cancer patients managed by watchful waiting. Caveolin-1 could possibly become a useful prognostic marker for prostate cancer patients that are potential candidates for active surveillance.
https://openalex.org/W2534662364,"Recent studies have shown that intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is prevalent in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), based on DNA sequencing and chromosome aberration analysis of multiple regions from the same tumor. VHL mutations were found to be universal throughout individual tumors when it occurred (ubiquitous), while the mutations in other tumor suppressor genes tended to be detected only in parts of the tumors (subclonal). ITH has been studied mostly by DNA sequencing in limited numbers of samples, either by whole genome sequencing or by targeted sequencing. It is not known whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used as a tool to study ITH. To address this question, we examined the protein expression of PBRM1, and PBRM1-related proteins such as ARID1A, SETD2, BRG1, and BRM. Altogether, 160 ccRCC (40 per stage) were used to generate a tissue microarray (TMA), with four foci from each tumor included. Loss of expression was defined as 0–5% of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining in an individual focus. We found that 49/160 (31%), 81/160 (51%), 23/160 (14%), 24/160 (15%), and 61/160 (38%) of ccRCC showed loss of expression of PBRM1, ARID1A, SETD2, BRG1, and BRM, respectively, and that IHC could successfully detect a high prevalence of ITH. Phylogenetic trees were constructed that reflected the ITH. Striking co-losses among proteins were also observed. For instance, ARID1A loss almost always accompanied PBRM1 loss, whereas BRM loss accompanied loss of BRG1, PBRM1 or ARID1A. SETD2 loss frequently occurred with loss of one or more of the other four proteins. Finally, in order to learn the impact of combined losses, we compared the tumor growth after cells acquired losses of ARID1A, PBRM1, or both in a xenograft model. The results suggest that ARID1A loss has a greater tumor-promoting effect than PBRM1 loss, indicating that xenograft analysis is a useful tool to investigate how these losses impact on tumor behavior, either alone or in combination."
https://openalex.org/W2536452052,"Cucumber is an economically important vegetable crop worldwide. Powdery mildew (PM) is one of the most severe diseases that can affect cucumber crops. There have been several research efforts to isolate PM resistance genes for breeding PM-resistant cucumber. In the present study, we used a chromosome segment substitution line, SSL508-28, which carried PM resistance genes from the donor parent, JIN5-508, through twelve generations of backcrossing with a PM-susceptible inbred line, D8. We performed whole-genome resequencing of SSL508-28 and D8 to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertions and deletions (indels). When compared against the reference genome of the inbred cucumber line 9930, a total of 468,616 SNPs and 67,259 indels were identified in SSL508-28, and 537,352 SNPs and 91,698 indels were identified in D8. Of these, 3,014 non-synonymous SNPs and 226 frameshift indels in SSL508-28, and 3,104 non-synonymous SNPs and 251 frameshift indels in D8, were identified. Bioinformatics analysis of these variations revealed a total of 15,682 SNPs and 6,262 indels between SSL508-28 and D8, among which 120 non-synonymous SNPs and 30 frameshift indels in 94 genes were detected between SSL508-28 and D8. Finally, out of these 94 genes, five resistance genes with nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeat domains were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. This revealed an upregulation of two transcripts, Csa2M435460.1 and Csa5M579560.1, in SSL508-28. Furthermore, the results of qRT-PCR analysis of these two genes in ten PM resistant and ten PM susceptible cucumber lines showed that when exposed to PM, Csa2M435460.1 and Csa5M579560.1 exhibited a higher expression level of resistant lines than susceptible lines. This indicates that Csa2M435460.1 and Csa5M579560.1 are candidate genes for PM resistance in cucumber. In addition, the non-synonymous SNPs in Csa2M435460.1 and Csa5M579560.1, identified in SSL508-28 and D8, might be the key to high PM-resistance in SSL508-28."
https://openalex.org/W2533068043,"Altered levels of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies (AGA) circulating in human blood plasma are found in different pathologies including cancer. Here the levels of AGA directed against 22 negatively charged (sialylated and sulfated) glycans were assessed in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC, n = 22) patients and benign controls (n = 31) using our previously developed suspension glycan array (SGA). Specifically, the ability of AGA to differentiate between controls and HGSOC, the most common and aggressive type of ovarian cancer with a poor outcome was determined. Results were compared to CA125, the commonly used ovarian cancer biomarker. AGA to seven glycans that significantly (P<0.05) differentiated between HGSOC and control were identified: AGA to top candidates SiaTn and 6-OSulfo-TF (both IgM) differentiated comparably to CA125. The area under the curve (AUC) of a panel of AGA to 5 glycans (SiaTn, 6-OSulfo-TF, 6-OSulfo-LN, SiaLea, and GM2) (0.878) was comparable to CA125 (0.864), but it markedly increased (0.985) when combined with CA125. AGA to SiaTn and 6-OSulfo-TF were also valuable predictors for HGSOC when CA125 values appeared inconclusive, i.e. were below a certain threshold. AGA-glycan binding was in some cases isotype-dependent and sensitive to glycosidic linkage switch (α2-6 vs. α2-3), to sialylation, and to sulfation of the glycans. In conclusion, plasma-derived AGA to sialylated and sulfated glycans including SiaTn and 6-OSulfo-TF detected by SGA present a valuable alternative to CA125 for differentiating controls from HGSOC patients and for predicting the likelihood of HGSOC, and may be potential HGSOC tumor markers."
https://openalex.org/W2533431371,"Although the differentiation of oncogenically transformed basal progenitor cells is one of the key steps in prostate tumorigenesis, the mechanisms mediating this cellular process are still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that an expanded p63+ and CK5+ basal/progenitor cell population, induced by the concomitant activation of oncogenic Kras(G12D) and androgen receptor (AR) signaling, underwent cell differentiation in vivo. The differentiation process led to suppression of p63-expressing cells with a decreased number of CK5+ basal cells but an increase of CK8+ luminal tumorigenic cells and revealed a hierarchal lineage pattern consisting of p63+/CK5+ progenitor, CK5+/CK8+ transitional progenitor, and CK8+ differentiated luminal cells. Further analysis of the phenotype showed that Kras-AR axis-induced tumorigenesis was mediated by Gli transcription factors. Combined blocking of the activators of this family of proteins (Gli1 and Gli2) inhibited the proliferation of p63+ and CK5+ basal/progenitor cells and development of tumors. Finally, we identified that Gli1 and Gli2 exhibited different functions in the regulation of p63 expression or proliferation of p63+ cells in Kras-AR driven tumors. Gli2, but not Gli1, transcriptionally regulated the expression levels of p63 and prostate sphere formation. Our study provides evidence of a novel mechanism mediating pathological dysregulation of basal/progenitor cells through the differential activation of the Gli transcription factors. Also, these findings define Gli proteins as new downstream mediators of the Kras-AR axis in prostate carcinogenesis and open a potential therapeutic avenue of targeting prostate cancer progression by inhibiting Gli signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2533970612,"Objective Renal conservation (retention) of fluid might affect the outcome of hospital care and can be indicated by increased urinary concentrations of metabolic waste products. We obtained a reference material for further studies by exploring the prevalence of fluid retention in a healthy population. Methods Spot urine sampling was performed in 300 healthy hospital workers. A previously validated algorithm summarized the urine-specific gravity, osmolality, creatinine, and color to a fluid retention index (FRI), where 4.0 is the cut-off for fluid retention consistent with dehydration. In 50 of the volunteers, we also studied the relationships between FRI, plasma osmolality, and water-retaining hormones. Results The cut-off for fluid retention (FRI ≥ 4.0) was reached by 38% of the population. No correlation was found between the FRI and the time of the day of urine sample collection, and the FRI was only marginally correlated with the time period spent without fluid intake. Volunteers with fluid retention were younger, generally men, and more often had albuminuria (88% vs. 34%, P < 0.001). Plasma osmolality and plasma sodium were somewhat higher in those with a high FRI (mean 294.8 vs. 293.4 mosmol/kg and 140.3 vs. 139.9 mmol/l). Plasma vasopressin was consistently below the limit of detection, and the plasma cortisol, aldosterone, and renin concentrations were similar in subjects with a high or low FRI. The very highest FRI values (≥ 5.0, N = 61) were always accompanied by albuminuria. Conclusion Fluid retention consistent with moderate dehydration is common in healthy staff working in a Swedish hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2536013912,"Similar to eukaryotic mRNA, the positive-strand coronavirus genome of ~30 kilobases is 5'-capped and 3'-polyadenylated. It has been demonstrated that the length of the coronaviral poly(A) tail is not static but regulated during infection; however, little is known regarding the factors involved in coronaviral polyadenylation and its regulation. Here, we show that during infection, the level of coronavirus poly(A) tail lengthening depends on the initial length upon infection and that the minimum length to initiate lengthening may lie between 5 and 9 nucleotides. By mutagenesis analysis, it was found that (i) the hexamer AGUAAA and poly(A) tail are two important elements responsible for synthesis of the coronavirus poly(A) tail and may function in concert to accomplish polyadenylation and (ii) the function of the hexamer AGUAAA in coronaviral polyadenylation is position dependent. Based on these findings, we propose a process for how the coronaviral poly(A) tail is synthesized and undergoes variation.

Here, analysis of the bacterial composition of the Drosophila gut by next-generation sequencing revealed that gut microbiota comprising one dominant genus of Acetobacter in non-TG-RNAi flies was shifted to that comprising two dominant genera of Acetobacter and Providencia in TG-RNAi flies. Four bacterial strains, including Acetobacter persici SK1 and Acetobacter indonesiensis SK2, Lactobacillus pentosus SK3, and Providencia rettgeri SK4, were isolated from the midgut of TG-RNAi flies. SK1 exhibited the highest resistance to the IMD-AMPs Cecropin A1 and Diptericin among the isolated bacteria. In contrast, SK4 exhibited considerably lower resistance against Cecropin A1, whereas SK4 exhibited high resistance to hypochlorous acid. The resistance of strains SK1–4 against IMD-AMPs in in vitro assays could not explain the shift of the microbiota in the gut of TG-RNAi flies. The lifespan was reduced in gnotobiotic flies that ingested both SK4 and SK1, concomitant with the production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in the midgut, whereas the survival rate was not altered in gnotobiotic flies that mono-ingested either SK4 or SK1. Interestingly, significant amounts of reactive oxygen species were detected in the midgut of gnotobiotic flies that ingested SK4 and SK2, concomitant with no significant apoptosis in the midgut. In gnotobiotic flies that co-ingested SK4 and SK1, an additional unknown factor(s) may be required to cause midgut apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2536736867,"Purpose The emergence of electronic prescribing devices with clinical decision support systems (CDSS) is able to significantly improve management pharmacological treatments. We developed a web application available on smartphones in order to help clinicians monitor prescription and further propose CDSS. Method A web application (www.MEmind.net) was developed to assess patients and collect data regarding gender, age, diagnosis and treatment. We analyzed antipsychotic prescriptions in 4345 patients attended in five Psychiatric Community Mental Health Centers from June 2014 to October 2014. The web-application reported average daily dose prescribed for antipsychotics, prescribed daily dose (PDD), and the PDD to defined daily dose (DDD) ratio. Results The MEmind web-application reported that antipsychotics were used in 1116 patients out of the total sample, mostly in 486 (44%) patients with schizophrenia related disorders but also in other diagnoses. Second generation antipsychotics (quetiapine, aripiprazole and long-acting paliperidone) were preferably employed. Low doses were more frequently used than high doses. Long acting paliperidone and ziprasidone however, were the only two antipsychotics used at excessive dosing. Antipsychotic polypharmacy was used in 287 (26%) patients with classic depot drugs, clotiapine, amisulpride and clozapine. Conclusions In this study we describe the first step of the development of a web application that is able to make polypharmacy, high dose usage and off label usage of antipsychotics visible to clinicians. Current development of the MEmind web application may help to improve prescription security via momentary feedback of prescription and clinical decision support system."

The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship of CKD and DM with the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).We enrolled 261 patients with AAA (AAA+) and age-and-sex matched 261 patients without AAA (AAA-) at two hospitals between 2008 and 2014, and examined the association between the risk factors and the presence of AAA. Furthermore, in order to investigate the prevalence of AAA in each group, we enrolled 1126 patients with CKD and 400 patients with DM.The presence of CKD in patients with AAA+ was significantly higher than that in patients with AAA- (AAA+; 65%, AAA-; 52%, P = 0.004). The presence of DM in patients with AAA+ was significantly lower than that in patients with AAA- (AAA+; 17%, AAA-; 35%, P < 0.001). A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension, ischemic heart disease and CKD were independent determinants, whereas, DM was a negatively independent determinant, for the presence of AAA. The prevalence of AAA in patients with CKD 65 years old and above was 5.1%, whereas, that in patients with DM 65 years old and above was only 0.6%.CKD is a positively associated with the presence of AAA. In contrast, DM is a negatively associated with the presence of AAA in Japanese population."
https://openalex.org/W2533390481,"In the central nervous system (CNS), activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κβ) is associated with both neuronal survival and increased vulnerability to apoptosis. The mechanisms underlying these dichotomous effects are attributed to the composition of NF-κΒ dimers. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), β-amyloid (Aβ) and other aggregates upregulate activation of p65:p50 dimers in CNS cells and enhance transactivation of pathological mediators that cause neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Hence selective targeting of activated p65 is an attractive therapeutic strategy for AD. Here we report the design, structural and functional characterization of peptide analogs of a p65 interacting protein, the glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (GILZ). By virtue of binding the transactivation domain of p65 exposed after release from the inhibitory IκΒ proteins in activated cells, the GILZ analogs can act as highly selective inhibitors of activated p65 with minimal potential for off-target effects."

We translated the Burden Assessment Scale (BAS) and conducted a study investigating factor structure, psychometric quality and predictive validity. We used confirmative factor analyses (CFA, maximum-likelihood method) to examine the dimensionality of the German BAS in a sample of 215 relatives (72% women; M = 32 years, SD = 14, range: 18 to 77; 39% employed) of mentally ill persons (50% (ex-)partner or (best) friend; M = 32 years, SD = 13, range 8 to 64; main complaints were depression and/or anxiety). Cronbach's α determined the internal consistency. We examined predictive validity using regression analyses including the BAS and validated scales of social systems functioning (Experience In Social Systems Questionnaire, EXIS.pers, EXIS.org) and psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI). Variables that might have influenced the dependent variables (e.g. age, gender, education, employment and civil status) were controlled by their introduction in the first step, and the BAS in the second step of the regression analyses. A model with four correlated factors (Disrupted Activities, Personal Distress, Time Perspective, Guilt) showed the best fit. With respect to the number of items included, the internal consistency was very good. The modified German BAS predicted relatives' social systems functioning and psychopathology. The economical design makes the 19-item BAS promising for practice-oriented research, and for studies under time constraints. Strength, limitations and future directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2536637190,"Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are pathogenic basidiomycetous yeasts and the commonest cause of fungal infection of the central nervous system. Cryptococci are typically haploid but several inter-species, inter-varietal and intra-varietal hybrids have been reported. It has a bipolar mating system with sexual reproduction occurring normally between two individuals with opposite mating types, α and a. This study set out to characterize hybrid isolates within the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex: seven unisexual mating intra-varietal VNI/VNII (αAAα) and six novel inter-varietal VNII/VNIV (aADα). The URA5-RFLP pattern for VNII/VNIV (aADα) differs from the VNIII (αADa) hybrids. Analysis of the allelic patterns of selected genes for AD hybrids showed 79% or more heterozygosis for the studied loci except for CBS132 (VNIII), which showed 50% of heterozygosity. MALDI-TOF MS was applied to hybrids belonging to different sero/mating type allelic patterns. All hybrid isolates were identified as belonging to the same hybrid group with identification scores ranging between 2.101 to 2.634. All hybrids were virulent when tested in the Galleria mellonella (wax moth) model, except for VNII/VNIV (aADα) hybrids. VNI/VGII hybrids were the most virulent hybrids. Hybrids recovered from larvae manifested a significant increase in capsule and total cell size and produced a low proportion (5-10%) of giant cells compared with the haploid control strains. All strains expressed the major virulence factors-capsule, melanin and phospholipase B-and grew well at 37°C. The minimal inhibitory concentration of nine drugs was measured by micro-broth dilution and compared with published data on haploid strains. MICs were similar amongst hybrids and haploid parental strains. This is the first study reporting natural same sex αAAα intra-varietal VNI/VNII hybrids and aADα inter-varietal VNII/VNIV hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2537285346,"Pseudostellaria heterophylla (Miq.) Pax is a mild tonic herb widely cultivated in the Southern part of China. The tuberous roots of P. heterophylla accumulate high levels of secondary metabolism products of medicinal value such as saponins, flavonoids, and isoquinoline alkaloids. Despite numerous studies on the pharmacological importance and purification of these compounds in P. heterophylla, their biosynthesis is not well understood. In the present study, we used Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform to sequence the RNA from flowers, leaves, stem, root cortex and xylem tissues of P. heterophylla. We obtained 616,413,316 clean reads that we assembled into 127, 334 unique sequences with an N50 length of 951 bp. Among these unigenes, 53,184 unigenes (41.76%) were annotated in a public database and 39, 795 unigenes were assigned to 356 KEGG pathways; 23,714 unigenes (8.82%) had high homology with the genes from Beta vulgaris. We discovered 32, 095 DEGs in different tissues and performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The most enriched KEGG pathway of secondary metabolism showed up-regulated expression in tuberous roots as compared with the ground parts of P. heterophylla. Moreover, we identified 72 candidate genes involved in triterpenoids saponins biosynthesis in P. heterophylla. The expression profiles of 11 candidate unigenes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Our study established a global transcriptome database of P. heterophylla for gene identification and regulation. We also identified the candidate unigenes involved in triterpenoids saponins biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2554514232,"The proper establishment of epithelial polarity allows cells to sense and respond to signals that arise from the microenvironment in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. Atypical PKCs (aPKCs) are implicated as key regulators of epithelial polarity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the negative regulation of aPKCs remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), a novel family of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases, plays an important role in regulating epithelial polarity by controlling the phosphorylation of both aPKC isoforms. Altered expression of PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 disrupted polarization of Caco2 cells grown in 3D cell cultures as indicated by the formation of aberrant multi-lumen structures. Overexpression of PHLPP resulted in a decrease in aPKC phosphorylation at both the activation loop and the turn motif sites; conversely, knockdown of PHLPP increased aPKC phosphorylation. Moreover, in vitro dephosphorylation experiments revealed that both aPKC isoforms were substrates of PHLPP. Interestingly, knockdown of PKCζ, but not PKCι, led to similar disruption of the polarized lumen structure, suggesting that PKCζ likely controls the polarization process of Caco2 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of PHLPP altered the apical membrane localization of aPKCs and reduced the formation of aPKC-Par3 complex.

Increasing evidence has suggested that disruption of polarity promotes the malignant progression of cancer cells. It has been well documented that epithelial cells (including those in the gastrointestinal tract) become polarized during the differentiation process (1.Wodarz A. Näthke I. Cell polarity in development and cancer.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The polarization process is characterized by the formation of specialized junctions between neighboring cells and subsequent separation of two plasma membrane domains: the apical surface facing the external medium and the basolateral surface connected to adjacent cells and extracellular matrix (2.Assémat E. Bazellières E. Pallesi-Pocachard E. Le Bivic A. Massey-Harroche D. Polarity complex proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The apical and basolateral membranes are segregated by two highly organized junctions, the tight and adherens junctions, assembled at the site of mammalian cell-cell contacts (3.Kemler R.

Differing from conventional and novel PKCs, aPKCs are insensitive to diacylglycerol- and Ca2+-mediated activation due to the lack of functional C1 and C2 domains (10.Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S.

Regulation of the ABC kinases by phosphorylation: protein kinase C as a paradigm.Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Specifically, aPKCs are phosphorylated at two conserved phosphorylation sites, namely the activation loop (A-loop) and the turn motif (TM) (10.Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S.

In addition, the N-terminal pseudosubstrate domain of aPKCs plays an important role in controlling the kinase activity (10.Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S.

Interestingly, the hydrophobic motif site, which is basally phosphorylated in the conventional and novel PKCs, is replaced with a phospho-mimetic residue in aPKCs (10.Suzuki A. Akimoto K. Ohno S.

In this study, we report the identification of both aPKC isozymes, including PKCζ and PKCι, as novel substrates of PHLPP. The results from our study reveal that PHLPP plays an important role in regulating apical-basolateral polarity by dephosphorylating PKCζ in Caco2 cells. In our effort to investigate the role of PHLPP in controlling cancer cell growth in three dimensions, we discovered that knockdown of PHLPP in Caco2 cells resulted in abnormal lumen formation (Fig. 1). As Caco2 cells grow in 3D matrix, cells localized in the outer layer keep proliferating, whereas the inner part of the cell clusters gradually undergoes apoptosis due to the lack of contact with the matrix. The morphogenesis process of these cells involves the formation of one lumen structure with defined apical-basolateral polarity (27.Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Morphogenesis and oncogenesis of MCF-10A mammary epithelial acini grown in three-dimensional basement membrane cultures.Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (28.Jaffe A.B. Kaji N. Durgan J. Hall A. Cdc42 controls spindle orientation to position the apical surface during epithelial morphogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the majority of Caco2 sh-Con cells formed a cyst-like structure with a single hollow lumen after growing in a mixture of Matrigel and collagen I for 14 days (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the aberrant lumen structures, including irregular and multi-lumen formation and filled lumens, were observed in PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 1A). The size of cysts formed by PHLPP knockdown cells was significantly larger than that of the control cells (Fig. 1B). The decreased PHLPP expression in the knockdown cells was confirmed using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1C). In addition, the cysts grown in 3D cell cultures were fixed and stained with the Ki67 antibody to label the proliferating cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, although Ki67-positive cells were found only in the cell layer that formed the lumen structure in sh-Con cells, they were detected at the center of the cysts formed by PHLPP knockdown cells, indicating that increased cell proliferation and disruption of the morphogenesis process (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, Caco2 cells grown in 3D cell cultures were stained with phalloidin and ZO-1 to evaluate whether the cells are polarized within the lumen structure. The Caco2 sh-Con cysts showed a spherical architecture, and the cells surrounding the lumen were polarized with F-actin and ZO-1 both concentrated at the apical side of the lumen, indicating a well defined apical-basolateral polarity (Fig. 2A). In marked contrast, PHLPP depletion altered the cyst-like structure by inducing the formation of multiple lumens (Fig. 2A). The polarity was lost in those lumen structures as F-actin was localized to both the apical and basolateral membranes and the cells inside the lumen showed non-polarized membrane distribution of ZO-1 (Fig. 2A). Quantitative analysis revealed that the percentage of cysts with one lumen was significantly reduced in all PHLPP knockdown Caco2 cells when compared with sh-Con cells (Fig. 2B). We next determined the effect of PHLPP overexpression in Caco2 cells grown in 3D cell cultures. Consistent with the role of PHLPP in negatively regulating cell proliferation (17.Liu J. Weiss H.L.

Loss of PHLPP expression in colon cancer: role in proliferation and tumorigenesis.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), overexpression of either PHLPP isoform significantly reduced the size of cysts (Fig. 3, A and B). Overexpression of PHLPP was confirmed using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3C). Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of either PHLPP isoform resulted in aberrant polarization in Caco2 cells similar to that observed in PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 3D). The percentage of cysts with one lumen was decreased in PHLPP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3E). Collectively, these findings suggested that PHLPP plays an important role in regulating epithelial polarity and altered expression of either PHLPP isoform disrupts the morphogenesis process. Because aPKCs are known regulators of cell polarity, we next investigated whether the PHLPP-induced polarity defect is mediated through aPKCs. To this end, we determined whether aPKCs are substrates of PHLPP. Silencing either PHLPP isoform resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of both the A-loop and TM sites in PKCι and PKCζ in both SW480 and Caco2 colon cancer cells (Fig. 4). Because the phospho-specific antibodies against the A-loop and the TM site of aPKCs recognize both phosphorylated PKCι and phosphorylated PKCζ, each aPKC isoform was first immunoprecipitated from the cells using isoform-specific antibodies and then analyzed for changes in phosphorylation. Interestingly, knockdown of either PHLPP isoform had similar effects on promoting the phosphorylation at both phosphorylation sites in PKCι and PKCζ, and knockdown of both PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 isoforms did not induce further increase in phosphorylation, suggesting that loss of one PHLPP isoform is sufficient to enhance the phosphorylation of aPKCs (Fig. 4, B and D). We have previously generated PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 knock-out mice (22.Liu J. Stevens P.D. Li X. Schmidt M.D. Gao T.

Acta. 2015; 1852: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether phosphorylation of aPKCs is elevated in PHLPP knock-out MEF cells. As shown in our previous study, PKCζ is the predominant aPKC expressed in MEF cells, whereas PKCι/λ is not detected at the protein level (12.Li X. Gao T. mTORC2 phosphorylates protein kinase Cζ to regulate its stability and activity.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Knock-out of either PHLPP isoform resulted in an increase in phosphorylation at both the A-loop and TM sites in PKCζ (Fig. 5A). As a control, the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif of AKT, a known substrate of PHLPP, was elevated in PHLPP knock-out MEF cells as well (Fig. 5A). In addition, we examined the phosphorylation status of aPKCs in colon tissues of PHLPP knock-out mice. Consistently, the phosphorylation of PKCι and PKCζ at both the A-loop and TM sites was increased in the colon of PHLPP knock-out mice (Fig. 5, B and C). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of either PHLPP isoform decreased the phosphorylation of endogenous PKCι and PKCζ at both sites in SW480 and Caco2 cells (Fig. 6A). To further determine whether PHLPP dephosphorylates aPKCs directly, we performed in vitro dephosphorylation experiments using purified PP2C domains of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2. PKCι and PKCζ overexpressed in 293T cells were immunoprecipitated and used as substrates in the dephosphorylation reactions. Our results showed that PHLPP was able to dephosphorylate both the A-loop and TM sites in PKCι and PKCζ in vitro (Fig. 6B). In addition, PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of aPKCs occurred rapidly, and no significant differences in the time course and extent of dephosphorylation at both sites of aPKCs were observed (Fig. 6, C and D). Because the phosphorylation of aPKCs is sensitive to PI3K activation (14.Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Regulation of protein kinase C ζ by PI 3-kinase and PDK-1.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined whether knockdown of PHLPP prevents dephosphorylation of aPKCs upon inhibition of PI3K. Indeed, treating cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induced rapid dephosphorylation of both PKCι and PKCζ at the A-loop and TM sites in sh-Con Caco2 cells; however, this dephosphorylation of aPKCs was largely inhibited in PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 6E). To further examine the specificity of PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of aPKCs, we conducted in vitro dephosphorylation experiments to compare PHLPP-dependent dephosphorylation of PKCζ with Akt dephosphorylation. Interestingly, both Akt and PKCζ were readily dephosphorylated by the PP2C domains of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6F), suggesting that PHLPP functions similarly as a phosphatase toward both Akt and aPKC in vitro. Taken together, our results demonstrated that PHLPP is a key regulator mediating aPKC dephosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Atypical PKCs are known to localize to the apical side of polarized epithelial cells, and this specialized localization is required to maintain the cell polarity (7.Durgan J. Kaji N. Jin D. Hall A.

Chem. 2011; 286: 12461-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30.Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Sasaki K. Mizuno K. Sawada H. Yonemura S. Ohno S. Interaction between PAR-3 and the aPKC-PAR-6 complex is indispensable for apical domain development of epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As we found that silencing PHLPP resulted in the disruption of cell polarity and increased phosphorylation of aPKCs, we next tested whether loss of PHLPP alters aPKC localization in Caco2 cells. The control and PHLPP knockdown cells grown in 3D cell cultures were stained with the PKCζ antibody. The results showed that the localization of PKCζ was restricted to the apical side of the single lumen structure in the sh-Con cells (Fig. 7A). However, PKCζ was also found to localize to the internal membrane in the multi-lumen structure and the membrane of individual cells inside the lumen in PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 7A). Similar changes in membrane localization were observed for PKCι in PHLPP knockdown cells as well (data not shown). Furthermore, the localization of aPKCs was analyzed in confluent Caco2 cells grown on glass coverslips. The confluent monolayer Caco2 cells are known to polarize on 2D surfaces as well. Confocal images of cells stained with PKCζ or PKCι antibodies showed membrane localization of both aPKC isoforms (Fig. 7, B and C). Interestingly, both PKCζ and PKCι were predominately localized to the apical surface above the adherens junction as marked by E-cadherin staining in the control cells (Fig. 7D); however, both aPKC isoforms moved away from the apical membrane and became mislocalized to the cell-cell junction with significant co-localization with E-cadherin in PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 7D). To determine the mechanism by which PHLPP loss disrupts aPKC membrane localization, we examined the formation of aPKC-Par3 complex. It has been shown previously that Par3 is phosphorylated by aPKC and this phosphorylation reduces the interaction between aPKC and Par3 (31.Nagai-Tamai Y. Mizuno K. Hirose T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Regulated protein-protein interaction between aPKC and PAR-3 plays an essential role in the polarization of epithelial cells.Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 32.McCaffrey L.M. Macara I.G. Signaling pathways in cell polarity.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a009654Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with increased aPKC phosphorylation in PHLPP knockdown cells, the amount of Par3 that co-immunoprecipitated with PKCι and PKCζ was largely reduced (Fig. 8A). The PHLPP loss-mediated increase in phosphorylation of aPKCs and Akt was confirmed in cell lysates of control and PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 8B). Taken together, these results suggested that PHLPP-mediated dephosphorylation of aPKC may alter the subcellular localization of aPKC by modulating the formation of aPKC-Par3 complex in polarized cells. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of aPKCs disrupts the proper establishment of polarity in Caco2 cells grown in 3D culture (7.Durgan J. Kaji N. Jin D. Hall A.

Because both PKCζ and PKCι have been implicated in apical-basolateral polarity regulation (7.Durgan J. Kaji N. Jin D. Hall A.

Stable PKCζ and PKCι knockdown Caco2 cells were generated using two different lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 9A). Control and PKC knockdown Caco2 cells were then cultured in 3D matrix and allowed to grow for 14 days. Consistent with the pro-proliferative function of aPKCs, knockdown of either PKCζ or PKCι reduced the size of cyst-like structures formed in three dimensions (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, although knocking down PKCζ significantly decreased the percentage of cysts with one lumen, silencing PKCι had little effect on the morphogenesis of Caco2 cells in three dimensions (Fig. 9, C and D). Knockdown of both aPKCs had a similar effect on disrupting the polarization process of Caco2 cells as silencing PKCζ alone (Fig. 9D). These data indicated that PKCζ is likely the downstream effector of PHLPP in maintaining apical-basal polarity in Caco2 cells. To further determine the specificity of PHLPP substrates on regulating cell polarity, control and PHLPP knockdown cells grown in three dimensions were treated with inhibitors of Akt or PKCζ (Fig. 10A). Treating cells with either Akt or PKCζ inhibitor (Akt-VIII and myristoylated pseudosubstrate of PKCζ, respectively) significantly decreased the size of cysts formed by both control and PHLPP knockdown cells (Fig. 10B). In addition, the PKCζ inhibitor resulted in a significant disruption of lumen structure similar to that observed in PKCζ knockdown cells, whereas the Akt inhibitor had little effect (Fig. 10C). However, inhibition of either Akt or PKCζ was unable to rescue the polarity defect caused by PHLPP loss (Fig. 10C). Collectively, our results indicated that elevated Akt and aPKC activity likely both contribute to increased cell proliferation seen in PHLPP knockdown cells grown in three dimensions. However, inhibition of Akt activity does not affect cell polarity. Atypical PKCs are major regulators of the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity (6.Chen J. Zhang M.

https://openalex.org/W2532237117,"Background Infection due to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is endemic in most cattle-producing countries throughout the world. The key elements of a BVDV control programme are biosecurity, elimination of persistently infected animals and surveillance. Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) is a notifiable disease in Belgium and an official eradication programme started from January 2015, based on testing ear notches sampled during the official identification and registration of calves at birth. An antigen-capture ELISA test based on the detection of BVDV Erns protein is used. Ear notch sample may also be used to characterize the genotype of the calf when appropriate elution/dilution buffer is added. Both BVDV antigen-ELISA analysis and animal traceability could be performed. Methodology With regards to the reference protocol used in the preparation of ear notch samples, alternative procedures were tested in terms of BVDV analytic sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, as well as quality and purity of animal DNA. Principal Findings/Significance The Allflex DNA Buffer D showed promising results in BVDV diagnosis and genome analyses, opening new perspectives for the livestock industry by the exploitation of the animal genome. Due to the high number of cattle involved in the Belgian official BVDV eradication programme based on ear notch tags sample, a large database on both BVDV status of newborn calves and cattle genome could be created for subsequent different uses (e.g. traceability, determination of parentage, genetic signatures throughout the genome associated with particular traits) evolving through a more integrated animal health."

The fluorescent behavior of these dyes is strongly depends on temperature, pH, ionic strength and pressure. It is crucial to understand the response of these dyes to pressure when applying calcium imaging technologies in the field of high pressure bioscience. Therefore, we use an optically accessible pressure vessel to pressurize physiological Ca2+-buffered solutions at different fixed concentrations of free Ca2+ (1 nM to 25.6 μM) and a specified dye concentration (12 μM) to pressures of 200 MPa, and record dye fluorescence intensity. Our results show that Fluo-4 fluorescence intensity is reduced by 31% per 100 MPa, the intensity of Fura Red is reduced by 10% per 100 MPa. The mean reaction volume for the dissociation of calcium from the dye molecules [Formula: see text] is determined to -17.8 ml mol-1 for Fluo-4 and -21.3 ml mol-1 for Fura Red. Additionally, a model is presented that is used to correct for pressure-dependent changes in pH and binding affinity of Ca2+ to EGTA, as well as to determine the influence of these changes on dye fluorescence."
https://openalex.org/W2539204658,"Background Concurrent sexual partnerships (partnerships that overlap in time) may contribute to higher rates of HIV transmission in African Americans. Attitudes toward a behavior constitute an important component of most models of health-related behavior and behavioral change. We have developed a scale, employing realistic vignettes that appear to reliably measure attitudes about concurrency in young African American adults. Methods Vignette-based items to assess attitudes about concurrency were developed following focus groups and cognitive testing of items adapted from existing scales assessing psychosocial constructs surrounding related sexual behaviors. The new items were included in a telephone survey of African American adults (18–34 years old) in Eastern North Carolina immediately before and after a radio campaign designed to discourage concurrency. We performed an exploratory factor analysis on each sample (pre- and post-campaign) to cross-validate results. We retained factors with a primary loading of ≥0.50 and no secondary loading >0.30. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha was used to evaluate internal reliability. Associations in the predicted direction between the mean responses to items on the final factor and known correlates of concurrency validated the scale. Results Factor analysis in a random pre-campaign subsample yielded a one-factor 6-item scale with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.79). As expected, the attitude factor was positively associated with participation in concurrent partnerships, whether assessed by self-report (r = 0.298, p<0.0001) or deduced from dates of recent sexual partnerships (r = 0.298, p<0.0001). The factor was also positively associated with alcohol (r = 0.216, p<0.0001) and drug use (r = 0.225, p<0.0001) and negatively associated with increasing age (r = -0.088, p- = 0.02) and female gender (r = -0.232, p<0.0001). Factor analyses repeated in the second random pre-campaign subsample and post-campaign sample confirmed these results. Conclusion A vignette-based scale may be an effective measure of key attitudes related to concurrency and potentially a useful tool to evaluate interventions addressing this network pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2534245967,"Unconscious processes are often assumed immune from attention influence. Recent behavioral studies suggest however that the processing of subliminal information can be influenced by temporal attention. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, we used a stringent masking paradigm together with fMRI to investigate how temporal attention modulates the processing of unseen (masked) faces. Participants performed a gender decision task on a visible neutral target face, preceded by a masked prime face that could vary in gender (same or different than target) and emotion expression (neutral or fearful). We manipulated temporal attention by instructing participants to expect targets to appear either early or late during the stimulus sequence. Orienting temporal attention to subliminal primes influenced response priming by masked faces, even when gender was incongruent. In addition, gender-congruent primes facilitated responses regardless of attention while gender-incongruent primes reduced accuracy when attended. Emotion produced no differential effects. At the neural level, incongruent and temporally unexpected primes increased brain response in regions of the fronto-parietal attention network, reflecting greater recruitment of executive control and reorienting processes. Congruent and expected primes produced higher activations in fusiform cortex, presumably reflecting facilitation of perceptual processing. These results indicate that temporal attention can influence subliminal processing of face features, and thus facilitate information integration according to task-relevance regardless of conscious awareness. They also suggest that task-congruent information between prime and target may facilitate response priming even when temporal attention is not selectively oriented to the prime onset time."

https://openalex.org/W2534532919,"The problem of controlling stationarity involves an important aspect of forecasting, in which a time series is analyzed in terms of levels or differences. In the literature, non-parametric stationary tests, such as the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) tests, have been shown to be very important; however, they are affected by problems with the reliability of lag and sample size selection. To date, no theoretical criterion has been proposed for the lag-length selection for tests of the null hypothesis of stationarity. Their use should be avoided, even for the purpose of so-called 'confirmation'. The aim of this study is to introduce a new method that measures the distance by obtaining each numerical series from its own time-reversed series. This distance is based on a novel stationary ergodic process, in which the stationary series has reversible symmetric features, and is calculated using the Dynamic Time-warping (DTW) algorithm in a self-correlation procedure. Furthermore, to establish a stronger statistical foundation for this method, the F-test is used as a statistical control and is a suggestion for future statistical research on resolving the problem of a sample of limited size being introduced. Finally, as described in the theoretical and experimental documentation, this distance indicates the degree of non-stationarity of the times series."
https://openalex.org/W2535808966,"Feeding adaptation, social behaviour, and interspecific interactions related to sexual dimorphism and allometric growth are particularly challenging to be investigated in the high sexual monomorphic Delphinidae. We used geometric morphometrics to extensively explore sexual dimorphism and ontogenetic allometry of different projections of the skull and the mandible of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus. Two-dimensional landmarks were recorded on the dorsal, ventral, lateral, and occipital views of the skull, and on the lateral view of the left and the right mandible of 104 specimens from the Mediterranean and the North Seas, differing environmental condition and degree of interspecific associations. Landmark configurations were transformed, standardized and superimposed through a Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Size and shape differences between adult males and females were respectively evaluated through ANOVA on centroid size, Procrustes ANOVA on Procrustes distances, and MANOVA on Procrustes coordinates. Ontogenetic allometry was investigated by multivariate regression of shape coordinates on centroid size in the largest homogenous sample from the North Sea. Results evidenced sexual dimorphic asymmetric traits only detected in the adults of the North Sea bottlenose dolphins living in monospecific associations, with females bearing a marked incision of the cavity hosting the left tympanic bulla. These differences were related to a more refined echolocalization system that likely enhances the exploitation of local resources by philopatric females. Distinct shape in immature versus mature stages and asymmetric changes in postnatal allometry of dorsal and occipital traits, suggest that differences between males and females are established early during growth. Allometric growth trajectories differed between males and females for the ventral view of the skull. Allometric trajectories differed among projections of skull and mandible, and were related to dietary shifts experienced by subadults and adults."

Here we use newly developed phyloinformatic methods of sequence analysis to conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the evolutionary and biogeographic history in unprecedented detail and breadth. Considering evolutionary rate and molecular-clock hypothesis in context, we reconstructed the spatiotemporal spread of HCV in the whole territory of its circulation using a combination of Bayesian MCMC methods utilizing all sequences available in GenBank.

https://openalex.org/W2533858015,"A satisfactorily fitted socket interacts dynamically with the stump in order to support body weight, transmit load effectively, enhance dynamic stability, and enable the control and stabilization of the residual limb. The internal dynamics occurring within a socket is important in determining optimal fit. Many measurement and imaging techniques, such as X-rays, have been utilized to investigate the movement of the residual femur within the stump during gait. However, due to associated health risks and costs, none of the current techniques have been extended to clinical prosthetics. The use of B-mode ultrasound has been suggested as a safe and cheap alternative, and has been utilized in previous studies to monitor the motion of the femur. However, the need to create a duplicate socket and time-consuming analysis of the images were obstacles to the system being applied clinically. This study aims to gauge the effectiveness of a non-image based ultrasound system. Here, we determined errors expected from the measurements. Accuracy errors of 2.9 mm to 8.4 mm and reproducibility measurements within a standard deviation of 3.9 mm are reported. We also estimated errors up to 14.4 mm in in-vivo measurements. We think there is potential in developing this technique, and we hope to reduce some technical difficulties such that it can, one day, be easily incorporated into prosthetic fitting."

https://openalex.org/W2533163183,"A plaid is a combination of two gratings whose orientations are orthogonal to each other with the same or similar contrasts. We used plaid patterns as stimuli to investigate the mechanisms underlying the detection of a plaid to understand how the visual system combines information from orientation-selective channels. We used a masking paradigm in which an observer was required to detect a target (either a spiral or a plaid) superimposed on a pedestal. We measured the target threshold versus pedestal contrast (TvC) functions at 7 pedestal contrasts for various target-pedestal combinations with a temporal 2AFC paradigm and a staircase procedure. All TvC functions, except the one with an orthogonal spiral pedestal, showed a dipper shape, although the position of the dip and the slope varied across conditions. The result can be explained by a multiple-mechanism divisive inhibition model, which contains several orientation-selective mechanisms. The response of each mechanism is the excitation of a linear filter divided by a broadband inhibitory input. The threshold is determined by a nonlinear combination of the responses of those mechanisms. Alternative models with mechanism(s) specific for plaid did not provide a better description of the data. Thus, a plaid pattern is mediated by a combination of orientation-selective mechanisms. An early plaid-specific mechanism is not necessary for plaid detection."
