https://openalex.org/W2028433016,"How the genomic landscape of a tumor shapes and is shaped by anti-tumor immunity has not been systematically explored. Using large-scale genomic data sets of solid tissue tumor biopsies, we quantified the cytolytic activity of the local immune infiltrate and identified associated properties across 18 tumor types. The number of predicted MHC Class I-associated neoantigens was correlated with cytolytic activity and was lower than expected in colorectal and other tumors, suggesting immune-mediated elimination. We identified recurrently mutated genes that showed positive association with cytolytic activity, including beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), HLA-A, -B and -C and Caspase 8 (CASP8), highlighting loss of antigen presentation and blockade of extrinsic apoptosis as key strategies of resistance to cytolytic activity. Genetic amplifications were also associated with high cytolytic activity, including immunosuppressive factors such as PDL1/2 and ALOX12B/15B. Our genetic findings thus provide evidence for immunoediting in tumors and uncover mechanisms of tumor-intrinsic resistance to cytolytic activity."

Leslie et al. hypothesized that general attitudes about the discipline would reflect the representation of women in those fields (see the Perspective by Penner). Surveys revealed that some fields are believed to require attributes such as brilliance and genius, whereas other fields are believed to require more empathy or hard work. In fields where people thought that raw talent was required, academic departments had lower percentages of women. Science , this issue p. 262 ; see also p. 234"
https://openalex.org/W2084158898,"Inflammasomes are involved in diverse inflammatory diseases, so the activation of inflammasomes needs to be tightly controlled to prevent excessive inflammation. However, the endogenous regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation are still unclear. Here, we report that the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation via dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1). DRD1 signaling negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome via a second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which binds to NLRP3 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation via the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH7. Importantly, in vivo data show that DA and DRD1 signaling prevent NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammation, including neurotoxin-induced neuroinflammation, LPS-induced systemic inflammation, and monosodium urate crystal (MSU)-induced peritoneal inflammation. Taken together, our results reveal an endogenous mechanism of inflammasome regulation and suggest DRD1 as a potential target for the treatment of NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases."

Theoreticians have predicted a different kind of surface state in related three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals, which do not have an energy gap in the band structure of the bulk. Xu et al. used photoemission spectroscopy to map out the band structure of the material Na 3 Bi and detected the predicted surface state. Their results may lead to further insights into the physics of topological matter. Science , this issue p. 294"
https://openalex.org/W2043234667,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial defects in neurons are implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we find that a key consequence of ROS and neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction is the accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) in glia. In Drosophila, ROS triggers c-Jun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK) and Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP) activity in neurons leading to LD accumulation in glia prior to or at the onset of neurodegeneration. The accumulated lipids are peroxidated in the presence of ROS. Reducing LD accumulation in glia and lipid peroxidation via targeted lipase overexpression and/or lowering ROS significantly delays the onset of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, a similar pathway leads to glial LD accumulation in Ndufs4 mutant mice with neuronal mitochondrial defects, suggesting that LD accumulation following mitochondrial dysfunction is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, and represents an early, transient indicator and promoter of neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W1972228155,"How are skeletal tissues derived from skeletal stem cells? Here, we map bone, cartilage, and stromal development from a population of highly pure, postnatal skeletal stem cells (mouse skeletal stem cells, mSSCs) to their downstream progenitors of bone, cartilage, and stromal tissue. We then investigated the transcriptome of the stem/progenitor cells for unique gene-expression patterns that would indicate potential regulators of mSSC lineage commitment. We demonstrate that mSSC niche factors can be potent inducers of osteogenesis, and several specific combinations of recombinant mSSC niche factors can activate mSSC genetic programs in situ, even in nonskeletal tissues, resulting in de novo formation of cartilage or bone and bone marrow stroma. Inducing mSSC formation with soluble factors and subsequently regulating the mSSC niche to specify its differentiation toward bone, cartilage, or stromal cells could represent a paradigm shift in the therapeutic regeneration of skeletal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2003509125,"The stem cells that maintain and repair the postnatal skeleton remain undefined. One model suggests that perisinusoidal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, marrow stromal cells, and adipocytes, although the existence of these cells has not been proven through fate-mapping experiments. We demonstrate here that expression of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist gremlin 1 defines a population of osteochondroreticular (OCR) stem cells in the bone marrow. OCR stem cells self-renew and generate osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and reticular marrow stromal cells, but not adipocytes. OCR stem cells are concentrated within the metaphysis of long bones not in the perisinusoidal space and are needed for bone development, bone remodeling, and fracture repair. Grem1 expression also identifies intestinal reticular stem cells (iRSCs) that are cells of origin for the periepithelial intestinal mesenchymal sheath. Grem1 expression identifies distinct connective tissue stem cells in both the bone (OCR stem cells) and the intestine (iRSCs)."
https://openalex.org/W2050128145,"Cancer's alternative means to an end To stay alive and proliferating, tumor cells must maintain their telomeres: the DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes. The majority accomplish this by activating the enzyme telomerase. However, certain tumor types favor a different mechanism called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which involves DNA recombination. Flynn et al. delineated the molecular events that occur at the telomeres of ALT-proficient tumor cells by studying the function of a protein that is altered by mutation in these tumors. The analysis revealed a specific protein kinase that is essential for ALT, which could in principle be targeted to halt tumor growth. Science , this issue p. 273"
https://openalex.org/W2078409165,"The primary task of white adipose tissue (WAT) is the storage of lipids. However, ""beige"" adipocytes also exist in WAT. Beige adipocytes burn fat and dissipate the energy as heat, but their abundance is diminished in obesity. Stimulating beige adipocyte development, or WAT browning, increases energy expenditure and holds potential for combating metabolic disease and obesity. Here, we report that insulin and leptin act together on hypothalamic neurons to promote WAT browning and weight loss. Deletion of the phosphatases PTP1B and TCPTP enhanced insulin and leptin signaling in proopiomelanocortin neurons and prevented diet-induced obesity by increasing WAT browning and energy expenditure. The coinfusion of insulin plus leptin into the CNS or the activation of proopiomelanocortin neurons also increased WAT browning and decreased adiposity. Our findings identify a homeostatic mechanism for coordinating the status of energy stores, as relayed by insulin and leptin, with the central control of WAT browning."
https://openalex.org/W2171944569,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can reconstitute and sustain the entire blood system. We generated a highly specific transgenic reporter of HSPCs in zebrafish. This allowed us to perform high-resolution live imaging on endogenous HSPCs not currently possible in mammalian bone marrow. Using this system, we have uncovered distinct interactions between single HSPCs and their niche. When an HSPC arrives in the perivascular niche, a group of endothelial cells remodel to form a surrounding pocket. This structure appears conserved in mouse fetal liver. Correlative light and electron microscopy revealed that endothelial cells surround a single HSPC attached to a single mesenchymal stromal cell. Live imaging showed that mesenchymal stromal cells anchor HSPCs and orient their divisions. A chemical genetic screen found that the compound lycorine promotes HSPC-niche interactions during development and ultimately expands the stem cell pool into adulthood. Our studies provide evidence for dynamic niche interactions upon stem cell colonization. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2075925391,"Axonal death disrupts functional connectivity of neural circuits and is a critical feature of many neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological axon degeneration often occurs independently of known programmed death pathways, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using traumatic injury as a model, we systematically investigate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families and delineate a MAPK cascade that represents the early degenerative response to axonal injury. The adaptor protein Sarm1 is required for activation of this MAPK cascade, and this Sarm1-MAPK pathway disrupts axonal energy homeostasis, leading to ATP depletion before physical breakdown of damaged axons. The protective cytoNmnat1/Wld(s) protein inhibits activation of this MAPK cascade. Further, MKK4, a key component in the Sarm1-MAPK pathway, is antagonized by AKT signaling, which modulates the degenerative response by limiting activation of downstream JNK signaling. Our results reveal a regulatory mechanism that integrates distinct signals to instruct pathological axon degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2052858451,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is upregulated in numerous human cancers. Inhibition of EGFR signaling induces autophagy in tumor cells. Here, we report an unanticipated role for the inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. Inactive EGFR interacts with the oncoprotein LAPTM4B that is required for the endosomal accumulation of EGFR upon serum starvation. Inactive EGFR and LAPTM4B stabilize each other at endosomes and recruit the exocyst subcomplex containing Sec5. We show that inactive EGFR, LAPTM4B, and the Sec5 subcomplex are required for basal and starvation-induced autophagy. LAPTM4B and Sec5 promote EGFR association with the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, which in turn disassociates Beclin 1 from Rubicon to initiate autophagy. Thus, the oncoprotein LAPTM4B facilitates the role of inactive EGFR in autophagy initiation. This pathway is positioned to control tumor metabolism and promote tumor cell survival upon serum deprivation or metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1978848618,"In cuprate high-temperature superconductors, an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating state can be destabilized toward unconventional superconductivity by either hole- or electron-doping. In addition to these two electronic phases there is now a copious amount of evidence that supports the presence of a charge ordering (CO) instability competing with superconductivity inside the pseudogap state of the hole-doped (p-type) cuprates, but so far there has been no evidence of a similar CO in their electron-doped (n-type) counterparts. Here we report resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) measurements which demonstrate the presence of charge ordering in the n-type cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4 near optimal doping. Remarkably we find that the CO in Nd2-xCexCuO4 occurs with similar periodicity, and along the same direction, as the CO in p-type cuprates. However, in contrast to the latter, the CO onset in Nd2-xCexCuO4 is higher than the pseudogap temperature, and is actually in the same temperature range where antiferromagnetic fluctuations are first detected -- thereby showing that CO and antiferromagnetic fluctuations are likely coupled in n-type cuprates. Overall our discovery uncovers a missing piece of the cuprate phase diagram and opens a parallel path to the study of CO and its relationship to other phenomena, such as antiferromagnetism (AF) and high-temperature superconductivity."

Zobel et al. used x-ray scattering to study solvent ordering for a variety of metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles in a variety of polar solvents (alcohols) and a nonpolar solvent (n-hexane). They observed layers of enhanced ordering near the nanoparticle surface relative to the bulk solvent. These trends were largely independent of surface chemistry, such as changing the surface groups from hydroxyls to carboxylates. Science , this issue p. 292"

Bishop et al. remotely monitored birds' heart rates, movement, and body temperature during migration. The geese “hug” the landforms, taking advantage of drafting and wind patterns. This unexpected strategy conserves energy, even though it means the geese repeatedly lose, and must then regain, altitude. Science , this issue p. 250"

Applying this method to fossil assemblages from Patagonia, they show how vegetation structure changed over the Cenozoic era (49 to 11 million years ago). These changes map onto the known climate changes over this period and can also be used to track how the evolution of herbivorous mammals responded to vegetation structure.

https://openalex.org/W2097379047,"The universally conserved GTPase elongation factor G (EF-G) catalyzes the translocation of tRNA and mRNA on the ribosome after peptide bond formation. Despite numerous studies suggesting that EF-G undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements during translocation, high-resolution structures exist for essentially only one conformation of EF-G in complex with the ribosome. Here, we report four atomic-resolution crystal structures of EF-G bound to the ribosome programmed in the pre- and posttranslocational states and to the ribosome trapped by the antibiotic dityromycin. We observe a previously unseen conformation of EF-G in the pretranslocation complex, which is independently captured by dityromycin on the ribosome. Our structures provide insights into the conformational space that EF-G samples on the ribosome and reveal that tRNA translocation on the ribosome is facilitated by a structural transition of EF-G from a compact to an elongated conformation, which can be prevented by the antibiotic dityromycin."

Semiconductor double quantum dots (DQDs) serve as a gain medium and are placed inside of a high quality factor microwave cavity. We verify maser action by comparing the statistics of the emitted microwave field above and below the maser threshold."

O-GlcNAc transferase is responsible for O-GlcNAc addition to serine and threonine (Ser/Thr) residues and OGA for its removal. Although the Oga gene (MGEA5) is a documented human diabetes susceptibility locus, its role in maintaining insulin-glucose homeostasis is unclear. Here, we report a conditional disruption of the Oga gene in the mouse. The resulting homozygous Oga null (KO) animals lack OGA enzymatic activity and exhibit elevated levels of the O-GlcNAc modification. The Oga KO animals showed nearly complete perinatal lethality associated with low circulating glucose and low liver glycogen stores. Defective insulin-responsive GSK3β phosphorylation was observed in both heterozygous (HET) and KO Oga animals. Although Oga HET animals were viable, they exhibited alterations in both transcription and metabolism. Transcriptome analysis using mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed deregulation in the transcripts of both HET and KO animals specifically in genes associated with metabolism and growth. Additionally, metabolic profiling showed increased fat accumulation in HET and KO animals compared with WT, which was increased by a high fat diet. Reduced insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and hyperleptinemia were also observed in HET and KO female mice. Notably, the respiratory exchange ratio of the HET animals was higher than that observed in WT animals, indicating the preferential utilization of glucose as an energy source.

https://openalex.org/W2030663973,"Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an inherited degenerative disease that affects the internal endothelial cell monolayer of the cornea and can result in corneal edema and vision loss in severe cases. FECD affects ∼5% of middle-aged Caucasians in the United States and accounts for >14,000 corneal transplantations annually. Among the several genes and loci associated with FECD, the strongest association is with an intronic (CTG·CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene, which is found in the majority of affected patients. Corneal endothelial cells from FECD patients harbor a poly(CUG)n RNA that can be visualized as RNA foci containing this condensed RNA and associated proteins. Similar to myotonic dystrophy type 1, the poly(CUG)n RNA co-localizes with and sequesters the mRNA-splicing factor MBNL1, leading to missplicing of essential MBNL1-regulated mRNAs. Such foci and missplicing are not observed in similar cells from FECD patients who lack the repeat expansion. RNA-Seq splicing data from the corneal endothelia of FECD patients and controls reveal hundreds of differential alternative splicing events. These include events previously characterized in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as splicing changes in genes related to proposed mechanisms of FECD pathogenesis. We report the first instance of RNA toxicity and missplicing in a common non-neurological/neuromuscular disease associated with a repeat expansion. The FECD patient population with this (CTG·CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion exceeds that of the combined number of patients in all other microsatellite expansion disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1987710524,"In the past decade, the increasing amount of nanoparticles (NP) and nanomaterials used in multiple applications led the scientific community to investigate the potential toxicity of NP. Many studies highlighted the cytotoxic effects of various NP, including titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and silver nanoparticles (AgNP). In a few studies, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was found to be associated with NP cytotoxicity leading to apoptosis in different cell types. In this study, we report for the first time that silver nanoparticles of 15 nm (AgNP15), depending on the concentration, induced different signature ER stress markers in human THP-1 monocytes leading to a rapid ER stress response with degradation of the ATF-6 sensor. Also, AgNP15 induced pyroptosis and activation of the NLRP-3 inflammasome as demonstrated by the processing and increased activity of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain) pyroptosome formation. Transfection of THP-1 cells with siRNA targeting NLRP-3 decreased the AgNP15-induced IL-1β production. The absence of caspase-4 expression resulted in a significant reduction of pro-IL-1β. However, caspase-1 activity was significantly higher in caspase-4-deficient cells when compared with WT cells. Inhibition of AgNP15-induced ATF-6 degradation with Site-2 protease inhibitors completely blocked the effect of AgNP15 on pyroptosis and secretion of IL-1β, indicating that ATF-6 is crucial for the induction of this type of cell death. We conclude that AgNP15 induce degradation of the ER stress sensor ATF-6, leading to activation of the NLRP-3 inflammasome regulated by caspase-4 in human monocytes."

Studies in mice showed that PDE3A, not PDE3B, is the subfamily responsible for these inotropic effects and that murine PDE3A1 associates with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 (SERCA2), phospholamban (PLB), and AKAP18 in a multiprotein signalosome in human sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that PDE3A co-localizes in Z-bands of human cardiac myocytes with desmin, SERCA2, PLB, and AKAP18. In human SR fractions, cAMP increased PLB phosphorylation and SERCA2 activity; this was potentiated by PDE3 inhibition but not by PDE4 inhibition. During gel filtration chromatography of solubilized SR membranes, PDE3 activity was recovered in distinct high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) peaks. HMW peaks contained PDE3A1 and PDE3A2, whereas LMW peaks contained PDE3A1, PDE3A2, and PDE3A3. Western blotting showed that endogenous HMW PDE3A1 was the principal PKA-phosphorylated isoform. Phosphorylation of endogenous PDE3A by rPKAc increased cAMP-hydrolytic activity, correlated with shift of PDE3A from LMW to HMW peaks, and increased co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA2, cav3, PKA regulatory subunit (PKARII), PP2A, and AKAP18 with PDE3A. In experiments with recombinant proteins, phosphorylation of recombinant human PDE3A isoforms by recombinant PKA catalytic subunit increased co-immunoprecipitation with rSERCA2 and rat rAKAP18 (recombinant AKAP18).

MiR-199a-5p is highly expressed in the smooth muscle layer of the bladder, and we altered its levels in bladder smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to validate the pathway analysis. Inhibition of miR-199a-5p with antimiR increased SMC proliferation, reduced cell size, and up-regulated miR-199a-5p targets, including WNT2.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are quickly gaining recognition for their role in many biological processes and disease states (8Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15901) Google Scholar). MiRNAs are endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms upon sequence-specific binding to their mRNA targets. MiRNAs are important modulators of gene expression, and dysregulation of their synthesis contributes to many human diseases (9Lu M. Zhang Q. Deng M. Miao J. Guo Y. Gao W. Cui Q. An analysis of human microRNA and disease associations.PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 10Wilmott J.S. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Scolyer R.A. The emerging important role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.Pathology. 2011; 43: 657-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The first miRNA profiling in BPS has identified several miRNAs regulating the expression of signaling and adhesion molecules (2Sanchez Freire V. Burkhard F.C. Kessler T.M. Kuhn A. Draeger A. Monastyrskaya K. MicroRNAs may mediate the down-regulation of neurokinin-1 receptor in chronic bladder pain syndrome.Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 288-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that are relevant for the disease pathogenesis. The comparative analysis of the miRNA expression profiles in BPS, bladder cancer, and several inflammatory disorders showed that seven of 31 miRNAs altered in BPS had the same regulatory pattern in inflammatory bowel disease (11Gheinani A.H. Burkhard F.C. Monastyrskaya K. Deciphering microRNA code in pain and inflammation: lessons from bladder pain syndrome.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3773-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which shares many features with BPS (12Pekow J.R. Kwon J.H. MicroRNAs in inflammatory bowel disease.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2012; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of miRNAs in the bladder smooth muscle was investigated using an induced smooth muscle-specific Dicer knock-out, which caused a significant reduction of miRNA levels, including miR-145, miR-143, miR-22, miR-125b-5p, and miR-27a, leading to a disturbed micturition pattern in vivo (13Sadegh M.K. Ekman M. Rippe C. Uvelius B. Swärd K. Albinsson S. Deletion of Dicer in smooth muscle affects voiding pattern and reduces detrusor contractility and neuroeffector transmission.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e35882Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a similar study, the loss of Dicer exacerbated cyclophosphamide-induced bladder overactivity in mice (14Zhang S. Lv J.W. Yang P. Yu Q. Pang J. Wang Z. Guo H. Liu S. Hu J. Li J. Leng J. Huang Y.

Pathol. 2012; 181: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MiR-29 is down-regulated in obstructed bladders, leading to increased ECM accumulation and fibrosis (15Ekman M. Bhattachariya A. Dahan D. Uvelius B. Albinsson S. Swärd K. Mir-29 repression in bladder outlet obstruction contributes to matrix remodeling and altered stiffness.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e82308Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Connexin 43 (GJA1), a major gap junction protein in bladder smooth muscle involved in regulation of contractility, has been shown to be repressed by the myocardin-responsive muscle-specific miR-1 with implications for postnatal bladder development and overactivity (16Imamura M. Sugino Y. Long X. Slivano O.J. Nishikawa N. Yoshimura N. Miano J.M. Myocardin and microRNA-1 modulate bladder activity through connexin 43 expression during post-natal development.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified miR-199a-5p as an important regulator of intercellular junctions (17Monastyrskaya K. Sánchez-Freire V. Hashemi Gheinani A. Klumpp D.J. Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. Burkhard F.C. miR-199a-5p regulates urothelial permeability and may play a role in bladder pain syndrome.Am. J. Pathol. 2013; 182: 431-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Upon overexpression in urothelial cells, it impairs correct tight junction formation and leads to increased permeability. MiR-199a-5p directly targets mRNAs encoding LIN7C, ARHGAP12, PALS1, RND1, and PVRL1 and attenuates their expression levels to a similar extent. The multiplicity of miR-199a-5p targets involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and tight and adherens junction formation prompted us to carry out a comprehensive analysis of its effects on the transcriptome of transfected TEU-2 cells. Here, using next generation mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by GeneGo MetaCore pathway analysis, we identified the major signaling pathways regulated by this miRNA, including WNT signaling, cytoskeletal, and cell cycle pathways. Our previous laser microdissection studies have shown that miR-199a-5p was predominantly expressed in bladder smooth muscle (17Monastyrskaya K. Sánchez-Freire V. Hashemi Gheinani A. Klumpp D.J. Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. Burkhard F.C. miR-199a-5p regulates urothelial permeability and may play a role in bladder pain syndrome.Am. J. Pathol. 2013; 182: 431-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We sought to elucidate its function in the bladder smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and investigated the effects of the alteration of its levels with antimiR- and miR-overexpressing lentiviral vectors on the smooth muscle morphology. We report that miR-199a-5p is a crucial regulator of the WNT signaling pathway in both TEU-2 and bladder SMCs, and it affects the proliferative and differentiation processes in the bladder smooth muscle. Monoclonal antibodies against smooth muscle (SM) α-actin (1A4) (A 2547), SM myosin heavy chain (M7786), and caldesmon (C21) (C0297) were from Sigma.

Pre-miR miRNA precursors for miR-199a-5p and a validated Cy3-labeled negative control were from Ambion (Applied Biosystems). The reverse transfections were done in 12-well plates with and without inserts (BD Biosciences, Falcon) using siPORT NeoFX Transfection Agent (Applied Biosystems). The transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24, 48, or 72 h before mRNA isolation. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine (Biochrom), 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% FCS (Gibco, Life Technologies). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and assayed for luciferase activity 24 h post-transfection. Primary cultures of the human bladder SMCs were established following the papain-collagenase protocol as described previously (20Earley S. Heppner T.J. Nelson M.T. Brayden J.E. TRPV4 forms a novel Ca2+ signaling complex with ryanodine receptors and BKCa channels.Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% FCS. Cell passages between 1 and 6 were used. All the cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C at 85% humidity and 5% CO2. Cell proliferation and metabolic activity were assessed using Alamar Blue reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was isolated using the miRVana miRNA isolation kit (Ambion) as described previously (2Sanchez Freire V. Burkhard F.C. Kessler T.M. Kuhn A. Draeger A. Monastyrskaya K.

Structural differences between the bladder dome and trigone revealed by mRNA expression analysis of cold-cut biopsies.BJU Int. 2011; 108: E126-E135Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription reactions were carried out using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamer primers. The exon junction-spanning primers for SYBR Green quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) were designed by using PrimerBLAST software. Melting temperature, self-complementarity, and 3′ stability of primers were checked by Primer3Plus software, and primers were synthesized by Microsynth (Switzerland). TaqMan assays were from Applied Biosystems. Assay numbers and SYBR primer pairs used for QPCR are listed in supplemental file List of primers and assays.xlsx. Quantification of mature miR-199a-5p and endogenous control miRNA RNU48 was performed using TaqMan assays 000498 and 001006 with supplied assay-specific RT primers (Applied Biosystems). QPCR was carried out in triplicates using the 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The Ct values obtained after QPCR were normalized to the 18 S rRNA when performing TaqMan QPCR and to the 28 S rRNA when performing SYBR Green QPCR. Ct values of miR-199a-5p TaqMan assay were normalized to RNU48. The end products of all PCRs were analyzed on a 4% low melting point agarose gel to validate the fragment size. A pmirGLO vector (Promega) containing the miR-199a-5p target sequence GAA CAG GTA GTC TGA ACA CTG GG was used as a positive control as described previously (17Monastyrskaya K. Sánchez-Freire V. Hashemi Gheinani A. Klumpp D.J. Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A. Burkhard F.C. miR-199a-5p regulates urothelial permeability and may play a role in bladder pain syndrome.Am. J. Pathol. 2013; 182: 431-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To detect luciferase activity, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega) was used, and the activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase expressed from the pmirGLO vector. Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Image analysis to estimate the protein content of the individual bands following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed using ImageJ software. Bladder SMCs transduced with lentiviruses were grown on poly-l-lysine- and laminin-coated glass coverslips. For phalloidin staining, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with the Cy3- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin. Inserts were mounted in PBS-gelvatol and examined under an Axiovert 200 M microscope with laser scanning module LSM 510 META (Zeiss). Live cell imaging was performed as described (22Monastyrskaya K. Babiychuk E.B. Hostettler A. Wood P. Grewal T. Draeger A. Plasma membrane-associated annexin A6 reduces Ca2+ entry by stabilizing the cortical actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17227-17242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were observed under an Axiovert 200 M microscope with laser scanning module LSM 510 META using a ×20 or a ×40 oil immersion lens. Cell size (μm2) was evaluated on captured images using Zeiss LSM software. Total RNA was isolated from bladder SM cells, and cDNA was produced by reverse transcription with random hexamer primers as described above. Coding sequence of WNT2 was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-AT AAA GCTAGC ATG AAC GCC CCT CTC GGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATA AA GGATCC TGT AGC GGT TGT CCA GTC AG-3′. Cloning NheI and BamHI sites are underlined. PCR fragments were inserted into pCDH-EF1-T2A-copGFP vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) to produce pCDH-WNT2 lentiviral vector. Lentiviral vectors overexpressing non-targeting scrambled miRNA, miR-199a-5p, and antimiR-199a-5p were as described previously (27Alexander M.S. Kawahara G. Motohashi N. Casar J.C. Eisenberg I.

MicroRNA-199a is induced in dystrophic muscle and affects WNT signaling, cell proliferation, and myogenic differentiation.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 1194-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lentiviruses expressing shRNA clones for WNT2 and a scrambled shRNA control, tagged with pmCherry, were from OmicsLinkTM shRNA Expression Clones, GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD) (catalog number HSH018529-1-LVRU6MP). The WNT2 target sequences of the shRNA clones were as follows: clone 1, TCC TGT GAT CCA AAG AAGA; clone 2, GGC TGC AGT GAT AAC ATTG; clone 3, TGT GGC CTT TAT CTC AACG; and clone 4, CCT GGA GAA GAA TGG CTTT. HEK293FT cells (System Biosciences) were plated at 50% confluence on 10-cm dishes and transfected with 12.5 μg of each of the pCDH-based lentiviral vectors, 7.5 μg of packaging pPAX2, and 4 μg of pMD2.G plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Supernatants collected 24 and 48 h after transfection were centrifuged at 4000 × g, filtered through a 0.45-μm-pore size cellulose acetate filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and mixed with PEG-it Virus Concentration Solution (System Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. Viruses were precipitated at 1500 × g at 4 °C the next day and resuspended in PBS. The number of transducing infectious units of each stock was determined by infection of 293T cells followed by assessing the percentage of GFP-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Subconfluent cultures of the primary bladder SMCs were transduced with recombinant lentiviral particles using 5 × 106 transducing infectious units/1 × 106 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Typically, 70–95% cells were fluorescent reporter-positive 72 h post-transduction. Transduced cells were propagated and used in assays as described above. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined with a Qubit® (1.0) fluorometer (Life Technologies) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Only those samples with a 260/280 nm ratio between 1.8 and 2.1 and a 28 S/18 S ratio within 1.5–2 were further processed. The TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.) was used in the succeeding steps. Briefly, total RNA samples (100–1000 ng) were poly(A)-enriched and then reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA samples were fragmented, end-repaired, and polyadenylated before ligation of TruSeq adapters containing the index for multiplexing. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters on both ends were selectively enriched with PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were validated using a Qubit (1.0) fluorometer and the Caliper LabChip® GX (Caliper Life Sciences, Inc.). The product is a smear with an average fragment size of ∼260 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nm in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20. The TruSeq PE Cluster kit v3-cBot-HS or TruSeq SR Cluster kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, Inc.) was used for cluster generation using 10 pm pooled normalized libraries on the cBot. Sequencing were performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 paired end at 2 × 101 bp or single end 100 bp using the TruSeq SBS kit v3-HS (Illumina, Inc.). Isoform expression was quantified using RSEM v1.1.15 (23Li B. Dewey C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12: 323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10907) Google Scholar). As a reference, we used the gene definitions from the University of California Santa Cruz for genome build hg19. RSEM was run with default parameters. Differential expression was computed with the Bioconductor package DESeq 1.4.1 (24Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K.

Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All hierarchical clusterings and the associated heat maps related to sequencing data were generated with the function heatmap2 in the R package gplots. For heat map visualization, the log expression values were used, and the values were normalized per gene by subtracting the mean. Transcripts with adjusted p value, false discovery rate q <0.05, and -fold change >1.5 were considered differentially expressed. Differentially expressed transcripts were then subjected to GeneGo MetaCore from Thomson Reuters (version 6.19, build 65960) to identify enrichment of pathways and processes using hypergeometric distributions to determine the most enriched gene sets with MetaCore variation of the Fisher’s exact test and adjusting for multiple sample testing false discovery rate q <0.05. Differentially affected pathways were defined based on standard deviation of the −log(p value), and then the resulting table of ontology was sorted in decreasing order of those standard deviation values. Statistically significant differences were determined with a two-tailed Student's t test preceded by a Levene's test with α set to 0.05 for genes with a normal distribution. The results of cell assays were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test or a two-tailed Student's t test preceded by a Levene's test. All studies were carried out with the SPSS program (version 20.0). All hierarchical clusterings and the associated heat maps related to QPCR data were generated with the function heatmap2 in the R package gplots. Unless otherwise stated, for heat map visualization, the -fold change values were used, the values were normalized per gene, and calculation of distance for clustering was done based on city block distance (Manhattan distance) and the average linkage method. Our recent study identified miR-199a-5p as an important regulator of intercellular junctions by targeting mRNAs encoding LIN7C, ARHGAP12, PALS1, RND1, and PVRL1 (17Monastyrskaya K. Sánchez-Freire V.

Pathol. 2013; 182: 431-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taking into account the multiplicity of miR-199a-5p-regulated target transcripts, we performed a comprehensive RNA-seq expression profiling of the differentiated TEU-2 cells transfected with miR-199a-5p precursor or scrambled non-targeting miRNA control. Total RNA sequencing resulted in 546 (paired end) million raw reads with an average of 91 million raw sequencing reads ranging from 68 to 106 million reads per sample. Approximately ∼65% of the total reads were recorded with at least one reported alignment with reference genome hg19. Of these reads, an average of 43.7% corresponded to transcripts, 38.3% corresponded to mRNA exons, 5.5% corresponded to mRNA introns, 2.4% corresponded to mRNA promoter 2 kb, and 4.0% corresponded to mRNA downstream 2 kb (supplemental file Read count information.xlsx). About 30% of the mapped reads spanned two junctions, and 60% of the mapped reads spanned only one junction. The data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession number ERP006812. Transcriptomes from differentiated TEU-2 cells transfected with miR-199a-5p were compared with those of the controls transfected with non-targeting miRNA to identify the effects of miR-199a-5p on gene expression. We observed differential expression of 1646 genes (3540 RefSeq ID) with 590 genes up-regulated and 1056 genes down-regulated in the miR-199a-5p-transfected TEU-2 cells (see supplemental file mRNA-seq reads.xlsx) (p value <0.05, false discovery rate <0.05, -fold change >1.5). A heat map of those 1646 significant differentially expressed genes is shown in Fig. 1A. Hierarchical cluster and heat map analyses consistently grouped the samples into two clusters: Cluster I, miR-199a-5p-transfected TEU-2 cells; Cluster II, non-targeting miR-Cy3-transfected controls. The genes with q value <0.4, which were considered for further study, are listed in supplemental file Selected genes for QPCR.xlsx. These included the miR-199a-5p target genes identified previously (17Monastyrskaya K. Sánchez-Freire V. Hashemi Gheinani A. Klumpp D.J. Babiychuk E.B. Draeger A.

https://openalex.org/W2082732836,"The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of several brain diseases, but its physiological functions remain unclear. We report that kynurenic acid, a metabolite in this pathway, functions as a regulator of food-dependent behavioral plasticity in C. elegans. The experience of fasting in C. elegans alters a variety of behaviors, including feeding rate, when food is encountered post-fast. Levels of neurally produced kynurenic acid are depleted by fasting, leading to activation of NMDA-receptor-expressing interneurons and initiation of a neuropeptide-y-like signaling axis that promotes elevated feeding through enhanced serotonin release when animals re-encounter food. Upon refeeding, kynurenic acid levels are eventually replenished, ending the elevated feeding period. Because tryptophan is an essential amino acid, these findings suggest that a physiological role of kynurenic acid is in directly linking metabolism to activity of NMDA and serotonergic circuits, which regulate a broad range of behaviors and physiologies."
https://openalex.org/W2140006840,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome primarily characterised by chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain. In the aetiology of this syndrome a crucial role is played by complex interactions among biological, genetic, psychological, and socio-cultural factors. Recently, researchers have started to explore emotional functioning in FM, with their attention focused on alexithymia, a personality construct that affects the regulation of a person's own emotions. On the other hand, the detection and experience of emotional signals from other people have only been sparsely investigated in FM syndrome and no studies have investigated the ability to represent other people's mental states (i.e. Theory of Mind, ToM) in these patients. Here we present the first study investigating a large set of social-cognitive abilities, and the possible relationships between these abilities and the performance on executive-function tasks, in a homogenous sample of patients with FM.Forty women with FM and forty-one healthy women matched for education and age were involved in the study. Social cognition was assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. Measures of executive function were used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of patients with FM. Relationships between social-cognitive abilities and demographic, clinical and psychological variables were also investigated.Patients with FM have impairments both in the regulation of their own affect and in the recognition of other's emotions, as well as in representing other people's mental states. No significant correlations were found between social cognition tasks and the subcomponents of the executive function that were analysed.The results show the presence of several impairments in social cognition skills in patients with FM, which are largely independent of both executive function deficits and symptoms of psychological distress. The impairments reported highlight the importance of adequately assessing ToM and emotional functioning in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2064890121,"Muscle inflammation is often associated with its expansion. Bladder smooth muscle inflammation-induced cell death is accompanied by hyperplasia and hypertrophy as the primary cause for poor bladder function. In mice, DNA damage initiated by chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide activated caspase 1 through the formation of the NLRP3 complex resulting in detrusor hyperplasia. A cyclophosphamide metabolite, acrolein, caused global DNA methylation and accumulation of DNA damage in a mouse model of bladder inflammation and in cultured bladder muscle cells. In correlation, global DNA methylation and NLRP3 expression was up-regulated in human chronic bladder inflammatory tissues. The epigenetic silencing of DNA damage repair gene, Ogg1, could be reversed by the use of demethylating agents. In mice, demethylating agents reversed cyclophosphamide-induced bladder inflammation and detrusor expansion. The transgenic knock-out of Ogg1 in as few as 10% of the detrusor cells tripled the proliferation of the remaining wild type counterparts in an in vitro co-culture titration experiment. Antagonizing IL-1β with Anakinra, a rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic, prevented detrusor proliferation in conditioned media experiments as well as in a mouse model of bladder inflammation. Radiation treatment validated the role of DNA damage in the NLRP3-associated caspase 1-mediated IL-1β secretory phenotype. A protein array analysis identified IGF1 to be downstream of IL-1β signaling. IL-1β-induced detrusor proliferation and hypertrophy could be reversed with the use of Anakinra as well as an IGF1 neutralizing antibody. IL-1β antagonists in current clinical practice can exploit the revealed mechanism for DNA damage-mediated muscular expansion. Muscle inflammation is often associated with its expansion. Bladder smooth muscle inflammation-induced cell death is accompanied by hyperplasia and hypertrophy as the primary cause for poor bladder function. In mice, DNA damage initiated by chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide activated caspase 1 through the formation of the NLRP3 complex resulting in detrusor hyperplasia. A cyclophosphamide metabolite, acrolein, caused global DNA methylation and accumulation of DNA damage in a mouse model of bladder inflammation and in cultured bladder muscle cells. In correlation, global DNA methylation and NLRP3 expression was up-regulated in human chronic bladder inflammatory tissues. The epigenetic silencing of DNA damage repair gene, Ogg1, could be reversed by the use of demethylating agents. In mice, demethylating agents reversed cyclophosphamide-induced bladder inflammation and detrusor expansion. The transgenic knock-out of Ogg1 in as few as 10% of the detrusor cells tripled the proliferation of the remaining wild type counterparts in an in vitro co-culture titration experiment. Antagonizing IL-1β with Anakinra, a rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic, prevented detrusor proliferation in conditioned media experiments as well as in a mouse model of bladder inflammation. Radiation treatment validated the role of DNA damage in the NLRP3-associated caspase 1-mediated IL-1β secretory phenotype.

To investigate the effects of acute MPP+ exposure on neuronal DA homeostasis, we measured stimulation-dependent DA release and non-exocytotic DA efflux from mouse striatal slices and extracellular, intracellular, and cytosolic DA (DAcyt) levels in cultured mouse ventral midbrain neurons. In acute striatal slices, MPP+ exposure gradually decreased stimulation-dependent DA release, followed by massive DA efflux that was dependent on MPP+ concentration, temperature, and DA uptake transporter activity. Similarly, in mouse midbrain neuronal cultures, MPP+ depleted vesicular DA storage accompanied by an elevation of cytosolic and extracellular DA levels. In neuronal cell bodies, increased DAcyt was not due to transmitter leakage from synaptic vesicles but rather to competitive MPP+-dependent inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity. Accordingly, monoamine oxidase blockers pargyline and l-deprenyl had no effect on DAcyt levels in MPP+-treated cells and produced only a moderate effect on the survival of dopaminergic neurons treated with the toxin. In contrast, depletion of intracellular DA by blocking neurotransmitter synthesis resulted in ∼30% reduction of MPP+-mediated toxicity, whereas overexpression of VMAT2 completely rescued dopaminergic neurons. These results demonstrate the utility of comprehensive analysis of DA metabolism using various electrochemical methods and reveal the complexity of the effects of MPP+ on neuronal DA homeostasis and neurotoxicity."

In recent years, it has been recognized that autophagy is essential for prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease (PD) and Huntington disease (HD).

Using a cellular model of PD, CNP suppressed protein aggregation and protected cells from cell death caused by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a neurotoxin, by inducing autophagy.

Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a cellular response that leads to the bulk, nonspecific degradation of cytosolic components, including organelles. Autophagy is initiated by the formation of a small membrane particle, called the autophagosomes, mediated by signaling cascades, including autophagy-related genes and microtubule-association 1 light chain 3 (LC3) 2The abbreviations used are: LC3microtubule-association 1 light chain 3ARL6ip1ADP ribosylation factor-like 6-interacting protein 1CNPconophyllineHDHuntington diseaseMPP+1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniummTORmammalian target of rapamycinNGFnerve growth factorPDParkinson diseasepolyQpolyglutamineMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastMPTP1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.

The completed autophagosome is targeted to the lysosome, and subsequently, the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosomal membrane. Then the inner membrane of the autophagosome and cytoplasmic components are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Autophagy is induced under several conditions, including nutrient starvation, and is mainly negatively regulated by the serine/threonine protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR inhibits the activity of the ULK1 complex, which is essential for autophagosome biogenesis (2.Jung C.H.

Rubinsztein D.C. Control of autophagy as a therapy for neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2012; 8: 108-117Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The hallmarks of these neurodegenerative disorders are the presence of intracellular aggregate-prone proteins in the brain. Although the pathogenic role of these aggregates remains controversial, the amount of aggregated protein is positively correlated with neuronal toxicity (7.Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Loss of autophagy in the central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice.Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). In addition, the symptoms of the disease are often alleviated by the elimination of aggregates from neurons (8.Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy and reduces toxicity of polyglutamine expansions in fly and mouse models of Huntington disease.Nat.

In this study, we searched for novel small molecule autophagy inducers and successfully found that conophylline (CNP) showed such an activity. CNP is a vinca alkaloid first isolated from the tropical plant Tavertaemontana divaricate (9.Kam T.S. Loh K.Y. Wei C.

The cells were then washed with PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL Cell Imaging System; Life Technologies). The number of EGFP-LC3 vesicles was counted, and the number of vesicles per cell was calculated in HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3. At least 50 cells were counted from four different fields selected at random. PC12D cells were treated with chemicals for 24 h at 37 °C and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, the cells were immunostained with anti-α-synuclein antibody (BD Biosciences) for 1 h and incubated with anti-mouse IgG tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and were incubated with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) for 10 min to stain the nuclei. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS FL Cell Imaging System). To detect aggresomes, the ProteoStat aggresome detection kit (Enzo BioChem. Inc., New York, NY) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The number of aggresomes was counted and the number of aggresomes per cell was calculated in PC12D cells stained with ProteoStat aggresome detection kit or anti-α-synuclein antibody. At least 50 cells were counted from four different fields selected at random. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described with slight modifications (16.Sasazawa Y. Kanagaki S. Tashiro E. Nogawa T. Muroi M. Kondoh Y. Osada H. Imoto M. Xanthohumol impairs autophagosome maturation through direct inhibition of valosin-containing protein.ACS Chem.

Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1.5% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the cell lysates with 6× sample buffer (350 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 0.012% bromphenol blue, 6% SDS, and 30% 2-mercaptoethanol) were subsequently boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare UK Ltd, Buckinghamshire, England), and probed with specific antibodies. This was followed by detection using the ECL Western blotting detection system (EMD Millipore Co., Billerica, MA) and LAS-4000 mini (GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-LC3B (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-p62 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA), anti-p70S6K (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-phospho-p70S6K Thr389 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-phospho-S6 Ser235/236 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), anti-Arl6ip1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-Atg7 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) antibodies. Transfection of HeLa cells with human ARL6ip1 siRNA was performed by using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of PC12D cells with rat Atg7 siRNA was performed by using the Neon transfection system (Life Technologies) at 1600 V with a 20-ms pulse according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of siRNAs were as follows: human ARL6ip1 #1, sense 5′-GUACUAUCUGGAUACUAAAdTdT-3′; human ARL6ip1 #2, sense 5′-GGACUAAACCAACAUGGAAdTdT-3′; rat Atg7, sense 5′-GCAUCAUCUUUGAAGUGAAdTdT-3′; and Luciferase (used as a control siRNA), sense 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′. Transfection of HeLa cells or Atg7−/− or Atg7+/+ MEFs with htt72Q-AcGFP was performed by using Lipofectamine LTX reagents (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 h after transfection, cells were treated with CNP for 24 h. Then cells were fixed and observed under a fluorescence microscope. For quantification of aggresome formation, we have calculated the percentage of cells that have at least one htt72Q-AcGFP aggregate to AcGFP-positive cells. At least 80 cells were counted from 10 different fields selected at random. For immunoblotting, densitometry analysis was done by using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) from three independent experiments, and the control condition was set to 100%. The values that we obtained were expressed as the means ± S.D. and compared using Student's t test. In the figures, significant p values are shown as * for p < 0.05 and ** for p < 0.01. To identify small molecules that could protect neuronal cells, we screened for autophagy inducers from an in-house chemical library, and we found that CNP, a vinca alkaloid, induces autophagy (Fig. 1A). We first examined the levels of LC3-II, a promising autophagosomal marker. LC3-I is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which can associate with the autophagosome membrane and is an essential protein for autophagosome formation (15.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, treatment with 100 ng/ml CNP significantly increased the expression levels of LC3-II (Fig. 1B). Autophagosome formation induced with CNP was also confirmed by using HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3, in which autophagosomes can be observed as EGFP-positive dots (13.Saiki S. Sasazawa Y. Imamichi Y. Kawajiri S. Fujimaki T. Tanida I. Kobayashi H. Sato F. Sato S. Ishikawa K. Imoto M. Hattori N. Caffeine induces apoptosis by enhancement of autophagy via PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K inhibition.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In CNP (100 ng/ml)-treated cells, EGFP-positive dots were clearly observed (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the dots formed by CNP treatment is the result of phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation with LC3, we constructed the vector that encodes EGFP-LC3-G120A that is defective in phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation. As shown in Fig. 1D, 100 ng/ml CNP did not form GFP-positive dots in HeLa/EGFP-LC3-G120A, indicating that CNP increased the phosphatidylethanolamine conjugation in HeLa/EGFP-LC3 cells. These data indicate that CNP increases the number of autophagosomes. Moreover, CNP also up-regulated the expression levels of LC3-II in neuronal cell lines: NGF-differentiated PC12D and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1, E and F). LC3-II up-regulation is attributed to the increase in autophagosome formation or impairment of autophagosome maturation. To investigate whether CNP promotes autophagosome formation, we assessed the expression level of p62, a protein that is selectively degraded by autophagy (17.Ichimura Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. Selective turnover of p62/A170/SQSTM1 by autophagy.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, treatment with 100 ng/ml CNP significantly decreased the expression levels of p62, which was blocked by treatment with bafilomycin A1 (BMA), an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion (18.Yamamoto A. Tagawa Y. Yoshimori T. Moriyama Y. Masaki R. Tashiro Y. Bafilomycin A1 prevents maturation of autophagic vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes in rat hepatoma cell line, H-4-II-E cells.Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In addition, co-treatment with CNP and bafilomycin A1 increased the LC3-II expression level compared with their single treatment (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in PC12D cells (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that CNP increases autophagy flux. A recent study identified ARL6ip1 as a direct binding protein of CNP (19.Suzuki E. Ogura H. Kato K. Takei I. Kabe Y. Handa H. Umezawa K. Preparation of conophylline affinity nano-beads and identification of a target protein.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction of CNP with ARL6ip1 is necessary for CNP-induced autophagy, we used RNA interference to down-regulate the protein expression of ARL6ip1. When ARL6ip1 was knocked down by its specific siRNAs, LC3-II expression levels were not altered. Moreover, CNP induced autophagy in ARL6ip1 knocked down cells, as well as control cells (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that CNP induces autophagy independently of ARL6ip1. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying CNP-induced autophagy, we examined whether CNP affects a known pathway that is negatively regulated by the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR. mTOR kinase activity can be evaluated by the detection of phosphorylation states of the mTOR downstream effectors, such as ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) and ribosomal S6 protein (S6) at Thr389 and Ser235/236, respectively. Although rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, suppressed the phosphorylation of p70S6K and S6, CNP had no such effects in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in PC12D cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that CNP does not interfere mTOR signaling. To confirm whether CNP acts in an mTOR-independent manner, we detected autophagosome formation using HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-LC3, when cells were co-treated with CNP and a sufficient dose (10 nm) of rapamycin to inhibit mTOR activity. Treatment with CNP and rapamycin had an additive effect on the increase of EGFP-LC3 puncta, compared with their single treatment (Fig. 3C), indicating that CNP and rapamycin induce autophagy through an independent mechanism. These data indicate that CNP regulates autophagy through an mTOR-independent signaling pathway. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, is the toxic metabolic product of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (20.Langston J.W. Irwin I. Langston E.B. Forno L.S. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+): identification of a metabolite of MPTP, a toxin selective to the substantia nigra.Neurosci. Lett. 1984; 48: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). MPTP is converted to MPP+ by monoamine oxidase-B in astrocytes, and MPP+ is selectively taken up by dopaminergic neurons. As in animals, MPTP treatment produces clinical, biochemical, and neuropathological changes similar to those found in idiopathic PD (21.Kowall N.W. Hantraye P. Brouillet E. Beal M.F. McKee A.C. Ferrante R.J. MPTP induces α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of baboons.Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); thus, MPP+ is widely used as a cellular model of PD. MPP+ treatments induced iron signal, and it is responsible for intracellular oxidant generation, α-synuclein expression and aggregation, proteasomal dysfunction, and apoptosis (22.Kalivendi S.V. Cunningham S. Kotamraju S. Joseph J. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. α-Synuclein up-regulation and aggregation during MPP+-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells: intermediacy of transferrin receptor iron and hydrogen peroxide.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15240-15247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23.Cheng Y.F. Zhu G.Q. Wang M. Cheng H. Zhou A. Wang N. Fang N. Wang X.C. Xiao X.Q. Chen Z.W. Li Q.L. Involvement of ubiquitin proteasome system in protective mechanisms of Puerarin to MPP+-elicited apoptosis.Neurosci. Res. 2009; 63: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of CNP on protein aggregation caused by MPP+ treatment, assessed by using ProteoStat aggresome dye, which is a red fluorescent molecular rotor dye, to specifically detect denatured protein within aggresomes and aggresome-like inclusion bodies. In PC12D cells, treatment with MPP+ induced protein aggregation detected by ProteoStat aggresome dye, whereas CNP markedly decreased the number of aggresomes (Fig. 4A). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis showed that CNP also suppressed the aggregation of α-synuclein, which is a major component of aggresomes in PD (Fig. 4B). To investigate whether CNP can degrade the aggresomes, CNP was added after aggresomes were synthesized by MPP+ treatment for 24 h. As a result, CNP degraded aggresomes remarkably by 12 h of treatment, suggesting that CNP suppressed aggresome formation by promotion of its degradation (Fig. 4C). Next, we examined the effect of CNP on cell death induced by MPP+. Our results showed that the decrease in cell viability caused by MPP+ was significantly restored by treatment with CNP (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that CNP inhibited MPP+-induced protein aggregation and cell death. To investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of CNP is dependent on autophagy, we used RNA interference to down-regulate the expression levels of Atg7, an essential protein for autophagosome formation (24.Tanida I. Mizushima N. Kiyooka M. Ohsumi M. Ueno T. Ohsumi Y. Kominami E. Apg7p/Cvt2p: a novel protein-activating enzyme essential for autophagy.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Transfection with Atg7 siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Atg7 protein levels and subsequent LC3-II down-regulation in PC12D compared with control experiments with luciferase siRNA sequence (Fig. 5A). Cell viability was then assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay after treatment with CNP and/or MPP+ in siRNA-transfected PC12D cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, decreased expression of Atg7 with its specific siRNA canceled the cytoprotective effect of CNP, whereas control siRNA did not. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that CNP failed to eliminate the aggregate proteins formed by MPP+ in Atg7 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). Rapamycin used as a positive control showed similar effect with CNP. These data indicate that CNP enhances autophagy upstream of Atg5/7-dependent autophagosome formation, leading to elimination of aggregates, which allows for escape from cell death induced by MPP+. Next, we examined the effect of CNP on a cellular model of HD. HD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) in the N terminus of huntingtin protein. Mutant huntingtin is cleaved to form N-terminal fragments comprising the first 100–150 residues with expanded polyQ repeats, and the fragments will aggregate and cause toxicity (25.Rubinsztein D.C. Lessons from animal models of Huntington's disease.Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 202-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, HD pathogenesis is frequently modeled with exon 1 fragment containing expanded polyQ repeats that cause aggregation and toxicity in cell models and in vivo models (25.Rubinsztein D.C.

As expected, transfection with the vector encoding AcGFP-tagged huntingtin exon 1 with 72 polyQ repeats (htt72Q-AcGFP) resulted in the aggregation of htt72Q-AcGFP. CNP significantly reduced htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates (Fig. 6A). Because CNP regulates autophagy through an mTOR-independent signaling pathway, we examined whether CNP and rapamycin have additive effects on reducing htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates by autophagy. As shown in Fig. 6B, single treatment with rapamycin at a sufficient dose to inhibit mTOR activity also reduced the number of htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates. Moreover, co-treatment with CNP and rapamycin significantly reduced the number of htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates compared with their single treatment. Next, we decided to examine whether this effect of CNP is also dependent on autophagy by using autophagy-deficient MEFs lacking the Atg7 gene (Atg7−/− MEFs) and matched wild-type MEFs (Atg7+/+ MEFs), in which we confirmed that 100 ng/ml CNP induced autophagy (Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 6D, there are a larger number of htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates in untreated Atg7−/− MEFs compared with in untreated Atg7+/+ MEFs, because mutant htt is a substrate of autophagy. Moreover, the aggregation of htt72Q-AcGFP was eliminated by treatment with CNP in Atg7+/+ MEFs, whereas in Atg7−/− MEFs, CNP failed to clear the htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates. These data strongly indicate that CNP also eliminates mutant huntingtin aggregates by enhancement of mTOR-independent autophagy. Previous reports showed that mutant htt protein is degraded through both autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system (27.Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Aggregate-prone proteins with polyglutamine and polyalanine expansions are degraded by autophagy.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 28.Hyrskyluoto A. Bruelle C. Lundh S.H. Do H.T. Kivinen J. Rappou E. Reijonen S. Waltimo T. Petersén Å. Lindholm D. Korhonen L. Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 reduces cellular aggregates and protects against mutant huntingtin-induced cell degeneration: involvement of the proteasome and ER stress-activated kinase IRE1α.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: 5928-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We examined whether CNP removed htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates through ubiquitin-proteasome system using MG132, a well known proteasome inhibitor. Fig. 6E shows that the addition of MG132 further increased the number of cells with htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates; however, CNP reduced these by ∼20% in both the absence and the presence of MG132. This suggests that CNP reduces htt72Q-AcGFP aggregates mainly through autophagy. The induction of the autophagy has been thought to be an attractive therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders, including PD and HD. In this study, we found CNP to be an autophagy inducer. Treatment with CNP increased the expression level of LC3-II and decreased the levels of p62, an autophagic substrate (Figs. 1B and 2A). Furthermore, CNP had no effect on mTOR signaling, detected by the phosphorylation state of its substrates (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, we showed that co-treatment with CNP and rapamycin had an additive effect on the induction of autophagy (Fig. 3C), indicating that CNP acts in an mTOR-independent manner. Moreover, siRNA experiments showed that ARL6ip1, a direct binding protein of CNP (19.Suzuki E. Ogura H. Kato K. Takei I. Kabe Y. Handa H. Umezawa K. Preparation of conophylline affinity nano-beads and identification of a target protein.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2009; 17: 6188-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), is not involved in the autophagy induction of CNP (Fig. 2C). Some pathways that are involved in mTOR-independent autophagy have been identified, including the cAMP-Epac-PLC-ϵ-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway and the Ca2+-calpain-G-stimulatory protein α pathway (29.Fleming A. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Rubinsztein D.C. Chemical modulators of autophagy as biological probes and potential therapeutics.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Additional studies are needed to determine whether CNP induces autophagy through known mTOR-independent pathways or through a new pathway. To further know how CNP increased the levels of LC3-II, we have examined the effect of CNP on LC3 mRNA level in HeLa cells. 12 h of treatment with CNP significantly increased the levels of LC3 mRNA (data not shown). Also, the up-regulation of both LC3-I and LC3-II protein level was suppressed by the co-treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor in HeLa cells (data not shown), indicating that CNP increases LC3 at the mRNA level. Some reports showed that the mRNA expression of LC3 increases during amino acid starvation, a well known autophagic condition, indicating that the induction of autophagy is accompanied by increases in LC3 synthesis (30.Nara A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. SKD1 AAA ATPase-dependent endosomal transport is involved in autolysosome formation.Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Some compounds that induce mTOR-independent autophagy have been reported to show beneficial effects in neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD and HD. Sarkar et al. (31.Sarkar S. Perlstein E.O. Imarisio S. Pineau S. Cordenier A. Maglathlin R.L. Webster J.A. Lewis T.A. O'Kane C.J. Schreiber S.L. Rubinsztein D.C. Small molecules enhance autophagy and reduce toxicity in Huntington's disease models.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) showed that three compounds induce mTOR-independent autophagy and contribute to protect neuronal cells in vivo and in cellular models of PD and HD. The disaccharide trehalose is another potent mTOR-independent autophagy enhancer. Trehalose has been shown to induce autophagy and enhance clearance of aggregate-prone proteins in a cellular model of HD (4.Sarkar S. Davies J.E. Huang Z. Tunnacliffe A. Rubinsztein D.C. Trehalose, a novel mTOR-independent autophagy enhancer, accelerates the clearance of mutant huntingtin and alpha-synuclein.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5641-5652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ channel antagonists, KATP+ channel openers and Gi signaling activators also induce mTOR-independent autophagy (5.Williams A. Sarkar S. Cuddon P. Ttofi E.K. Saiki S. Siddiqi F.H. Jahreiss L. Fleming A. Pask D. Goldsmith P. O'Kane C.J. Floto R.A. Rubinsztein D.C. Novel targets for Huntington's disease in an mTOR-independent autophagy pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). These compounds are also reported to eliminate mutant huntingtin aggregates in cultured cells and in vivo (5.Williams A. Sarkar S. Cuddon P. Ttofi E.K. Saiki S. Siddiqi F.H. Jahreiss L. Fleming A. Pask D. Goldsmith P. O'Kane C.J. Floto R.A. Rubinsztein D.C. Novel targets for Huntington's disease in an mTOR-independent autophagy pathway.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). CNP also eliminates mutant huntingtin aggregates in a cellular model of HD (Fig. 6) and MPP+-induced protein aggregation and cell death in a cellular model of PD (Fig. 5) by inducing autophagy. In a cellular model of PD, transfection with Atg7 siRNA for 96 h did not induce cell death, even though autophagy acts cytoprotectively. We assumed that although activation of autophagy is cytoprotective when cells were damaged by aggresomes, the defect of the basal level of autophagy for a short time has no effect on the cell viability in cultured cell consistent with a previous report (32.Xilouri M. Vogiatzi T. Vekrellis K. Park D. Stefanis L. Abberant α-synuclein confers toxicity to neurons in part through inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Moreover, time course analysis showed that 12 h of treatment with CNP increased LC3-II level, and this effect did not continue until 48 h (data not shown) in HeLa cells. As shown Fig. 4C, CNP could degrade aggresomes by 12 h of treatment, suggesting that CNP suppressed aggresome formation and subsequent cell death by the clearance of aggresomes at an early time point. CNP acts at a much lower concentration than compounds that are reported to enhance mTOR-independent autophagy. Moreover, a compound that induces autophagy in an mTOR-independent mechanism is thought to be attractive, because the combination of an mTOR-dependent autophagy inducer and mTOR-independent inducer could potentially result in additive benefits compared with their single treatment and could reduce the required dose of each treatment, which might reduce the possibility of any side effect (6.Harris H. Rubinsztein D.C. Control of autophagy as a therapy for neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2012; 8: 108-117Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). CNP was shown to be orally active and comparatively stable in the blood (30.Nara A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. SKD1 AAA ATPase-dependent endosomal transport is involved in autolysosome formation.Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The neuroprotective effect of CNP by oral administration in animal models of PD and HD will be investigated in future studies. CNP has been reported to induce the differentiation of insulin-producing precursor cells lowering blood glucose (12.Ogata T. Li L. Yamada S. Yamamoto Y. Tanaka Y. Takei I. Umezawa K. Kojima I. Promotion of beta-cell differentiation by conophylline in fetal and neonatal rat pancreas.Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2596-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30.Nara A. Mizushima N. Yamamoto A.

Antidiabetic effect of orally administered conophylline-containing plant extract on streptozotocin-treated and Goto-Kakizaki rats.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2009; 63: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, its molecular mechanism of action has not yet been well investigated. Our findings that show CNP to be an mTOR-independent autophagy inducer also help us to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CNP exhibits various pharmacological activities that have been reported previously. In conclusion, we found a new mTOR-independent autophagy inducer, CNP, that protects cells in cellular models of neurodegenerative diseases. Our results suggest the potential use of CNP as a new agent for neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and HD. We thank Prof. M.

Thus, ITK and RLK inhibitors have therapeutic potential in a number of human autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant diseases. Here we describe a novel ITK/RLK inhibitor, PRN694, which covalently binds to cysteine residues 442 of ITK and 350 of RLK and blocks kinase activity. Molecular modeling was utilized to design molecules that interact with cysteine while binding to the ATP binding site in the kinase domain. PRN694 exhibits extended target residence time on ITK and RLK and is highly selective for a subset of the TEC kinase family. In vitro cellular assays confirm that PRN694 prevents T-cell receptor- and Fc receptor-induced cellular and molecular activation, inhibits T-cell receptor-induced T-cell proliferation, and blocks proinflammatory cytokine release as well as activation of Th17 cells. Ex vivo assays demonstrate inhibitory activity against T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia cells, and in vivo assays demonstrate durable pharmacodynamic effects on ITK, which reduces an oxazolone-induced delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. These data indicate that PRN694 is a highly selective and potent covalent inhibitor of ITK and RLK, and its extended target residence time enables durable attenuation of effector cells in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2024389973,"Human hepatoma (HCC) has been reported to be strongly resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study the function of oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 8 (ORP8) in human hepatoma cells apoptosis was assessed. We found that ORP8 is down-regulated, whereas miR-143, which controls ORP8 expression, is up-regulated in clinical HCC tissues as compared with liver tissue from healthy subjects. ORP8 overexpression triggered apoptosis in primary HCC cells and cell lines, which coincided with a relocation of cytoplasmic Fas to the cell plasma membrane and FasL up-regulation. Co-culture of HepG2 cells or primary HCC cells with Jurkat T-cells or T-cells, respectively, provided further evidence that ORP8 increases HCC cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. ORP8-induced Fas translocation is p53-dependent, and FasL was induced upon ORP8 overexpression via the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Moreover, ORP8 overexpression and miR-143 inhibition markedly inhibited tumor growth in a HepG2 cell xenograft model. These results indicate that ORP8 induces HCC cell apoptosis through the Fas/FasL pathway. The role of ORP8 in Fas translocation to the plasma membrane and its down-regulation by miR-143 offer a putative mechanistic explanation for HCC resistance to apoptosis. ORP8 may be a potential target for HCC therapy."

GLUT4 function is impaired in obesity and type 2 diabetes leading to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and neuropathy. To better understand the regulation of GLUT4 function, a targeted siRNA screen was performed and led to the discovery that ZFP407 regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. The decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake due to ZFP407 deficiency was attributed to a reduction in GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels. The decrease in GLUT4 was due to both decreased transcription of Glut4 mRNA and decreased efficiency of Glut4 pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, ZFP407 coordinately regulated this decrease in transcription with an increase in the stability of Glut4 mRNA, resulting in opposing effects on steady-state Glut4 mRNA levels. More broadly, transcriptome analysis revealed that ZFP407 regulates many peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ target genes beyond Glut4. ZFP407 was required for the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone to increase Glut4 expression, but was not sufficient to increase expression of a PPARγ target gene reporter construct. However, ZFP407 and PPARγ co-overexpression synergistically activated a PPARγ reporter construct beyond the level of PPARγ alone.

The two rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis are ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), whereas the rate-limiting enzyme of catabolism is spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT). A recent review has highlighted the mitogenic role of PAs in the stromal and immune cells in health and disease (5.Ghesquière B. Wong B.W. Kuchnio A. Carmeliet P.

C-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc transcriptional regulators are deregulated in many human cancers (10.Dang C.V. Le A. Gao P. MYC-induced cancer cell energy metabolism and therapeutic opportunities.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 6479-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The c-myc oncogene is closely involved in PA metabolism. It has been described to transactivate ODC (11.Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. The ornithine decarboxylase gene is a transcriptional target of c-Myc.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), SAMDC (12.Li Z. Van Calcar S. Qu C. Cavenee W.K. Zhang M.Q. Ren B.

Furthermore, Myc is able to induce the expression of eIF5A2, a translation initiation factor showing a unique Spm-dependent post-translational modification (14.Fernandez P.C. Frank S.R. Wang L.

It has been suggested that the promotion of high levels of polyamines and production of active eIF5A2 could explain the oncogenic activity of Myc in certain cell and tissue types (15.Gerner E.W. Cancer chemoprevention locks onto a new polyamine metabolic target.Cancer Prev. Res. (Phila.). 2010; 3: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, c-myc transcription is stimulated by PAs (16.Celano P. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr, R.A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8922-8927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a positive feedback system. Amplified n-myc has been detected in several neuroendocrine tumors, like neuroblastoma (17.Brodeur G.M. Seeger R.C. Schwab M. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Amplification of N-myc in untreated human neuroblastomas correlates with advanced disease stage.Science. 1984; 224: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma (ORPHA635) is the most frequent pediatric extracranial solid tumor, and it accounts for 10–15% of oncologic deaths in children (18.Maris J.M. Recent advances in neuroblastoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2010; 362: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been known for a long time that N-Myc directly potentiates ODC expression (19.Lutz W. Stöhr M. Schürmann J. Wenzel A. Löhr A. Schwab M. Conditional expression of N-myc in human neuroblastoma cells increases expression of α-prothymosin and ornithine decarboxylase and accelerates progression into S-phase early after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells.Oncogene. 1996; 13: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar) and that ODC levels positively correlate with neuroblastoma malignancy stage and indicate a poor prognosis of neuroblastoma even without N-Myc amplification (20.Geerts D.

Thus, the overexpression of N-Myc potentiates neuroblastoma cell proliferation through several mechanisms (22.Sun Y. Liu P.Y. Scarlett C.J. Malyukova A. Liu B. Marshall G.M. MacKenzie K.L. Biankin A.V. Liu T. Histone deacetylase 5 blocks neuroblastoma cell differentiation by interacting with N-Myc.Oncogene. 2014; 33: 2987-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including the promotion of PA synthesis. Fig. 1B depicts the positive feedback loop established between PA metabolism and Myc oncoprotein levels. Macromolecular synthesis is essential for cell growth and division. Therefore, rapidly proliferating tumor cells experience a metabolic reprogramming that includes high glycolysis and dependence on glutamine (23.Schulze A. Harris A.L. How cancer metabolism is tuned for proliferation and vulnerable to disruption.Nature. 2012; 491: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). N-Myc seems to be relevant for aerobic glycolysis in N-Myc-overexpressing tumors (24.Qing G. Skuli N. Mayes P.A. Pawel B. Martinez D. Maris J.M. Simon M.C. Combinatorial regulation of neuroblastoma tumor progression by N-Myc and hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1α.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 10351-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Current literature suggests that tumor remodeling might involve the coordination of all of the modules necessary for proliferation, including the metabolism of common energy fuels and other molecules relevant for cell cycle progression, such as PAs. As depicted in Fig. 1B, we hypothesize that PA metabolism could be linked to glycolysis through their mutual dependence on Myc functioning. Consequently, here we report for the first time an earlier unknown connection between glucose and PA metabolisms mediated by N-Myc, using neuroblastoma cell lines as model systems. Several metabolic features in these cells have been studied, and it has been shown that glycolysis inhibition with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) is able to reduce the polyamine content in neuroblastoma cells as an early effect before cell death can be detected. This work represents an integrative advance in the knowledge about the metabolic reprogramming in neuroblastoma as a model of N-Myc-expressing malignancy. Cell lines were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Kelly cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and IMR-32 and SK-N-SH cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM. Incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells between passages 8 and 23 (Kelly and SK-N-SH) or 68 and 80 (IMR-32) were used for experiments. Except as otherwise specified, cells were treated for 24 h with 3 mm 2-DG or 20 μm BPTES freshly diluted in cell culture medium/DMSO and sterilized by filtration. SK-N-SH cells were transfected with empty pcMV6XL4 vector or pcMV6XL4 containing human n-myc cDNA. Plasmids were purchased from OriGene Technologies. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a DNA/reagent ratio of 1:2. Cells were incubated in the presence of the transfection mix for 24 h, and then the medium was replaced, and 2-DG was added to the corresponding samples for another 24 h. After incubation with 2-DG, cell pellets were harvested and kept at −80 °C until analysis. Transfections were checked by Western blot against N-Myc. Cell suspensions of 80,000 cells/ml were plated in 24-well plates with a final volume of 500 μl/well. After 24 h, control cells (time 0) were collected and counted, and 3 mm 2-DG was added to the corresponding wells. For the next 5 days, cells from four wells were detached with trypsin daily and counted using a Beckman Coulter Counter device, diluting cells at 1:20 with Isoton®. 5 × 106 cells/ml were stained with propidium iodide as described previously (25.Dasso M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Harford J.B. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Short Protocols in Cell Biology. 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2004Google Scholar). Then 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed with a MoFlo flow cytometer. The resulting data were analyzed with the free software WinMDI. Fresh culture media and culture media incubated with cells for 24 h were deproteinized with 10% (v/v) HClO4 (media/HClO4, 1:1), and neutralized with 20% (w/v) KOH. Deproteinized samples were immediately analyzed or kept at −20 °C until used. Glucose content in deproteinized culture media was determined by the glucose oxidase-peroxidase method (26.Kunst A. Dreager B. Ziegenhorn J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 178-185Google Scholar) with modifications; a colorimetric reaction was performed with 0.2 mg/ml 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, absorbance was measured at 725 nm. Lactate measurements in culture media were performed based on the method described elsewhere (27.Noll F. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Vol. IV, Metabolites 1: Carbohydrates. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 582-588Google Scholar). Glutamine concentration in cell culture media was determined with the l-glutamine/ammonia (Rapid) kit (Megazyme) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, absorbances were determined with a Cary WinUV spectrophotometer (Varian); data were acquired with WinUV software. ATP/ADP ratios were determined with the ADP/ATP ratio assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h. 3 mm 2-DG was added to the corresponding wells, and the assay was performed after an incubation of 24 h. Measurements were performed in triplicate, and three independent replicates were assayed. Intracellular levels of Put, Spd, and Spm were simultaneously determined by fluorometry using a separation by HPLC after acid extraction from cell pellets. 1,8-diaminooctane was used as an internal standard added to the cell extract before derivatization with dansyl chloride, based on the method described previously (28.Fajardo I. Urdiales J.L. Paz J.C. Chavarría T. Sánchez-Jiménez F. Medina M.A. Histamine prevents polyamine accumulation in mouse C57.1 mast cell cultures.Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 768-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). PA values were normalized to total protein contents estimated by a Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell pellets of 2 × 106 cells were lysated with 100 μl of 1× denaturing loading buffer with added protease inhibitor (Roche Complete Mini) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4 and 30 mm NaF). Samples were heated, sonicated, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and afterward blocked with 10% (w/v) semiskimmed dried milk. Blocked membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, washed, and later incubated with the peroxidase-linked secondary anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and finally incubated with the Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system (Thermo Scientific). Image captions were taken with the ChemiDocTM XRS+ System (Bio-Rad), and densitometry analyses were made with Image LabTM software. Anti-GAPDH rabbit monoclonal antibody and anti-protein kinase B (AKT), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473), anti-GSK3β, anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9), and anti-N-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-phospho-Myc (Thr-58) rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Abcam. ECL anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody was from GE Healthcare. For the calculation of the phosphorylation ratios, the following formula was used (29.Zhong D. Xiong L. Liu T. Liu X. Liu X. Chen J. Sun S.Y. Khuri F.R. Zong Y. Zhou Q. Zhou W. The glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose activates multiple prosurvival pathways through IGF1R.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23225-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation ratio=(phosphotreatment/totaltreatment)(phosphocontrol/totalcontrol)(Eq. 1) Cell pellets of 20 × 106 cells were lysed with 800 μl of standard lysis buffer. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was determined in the supernatants by measuring the release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]ornithine based on the method described previously (30.Urdiales J.L. Matés J.M. Núñez de Castro I. Sánchez-Jiménez F.M. Chlorpheniramine inhibits the ornithine decarboxylase induction of Ehrlich carcinoma growing in vivo.FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured with a Microbeta scintillation counter. Protein quantification was performed in supernatants. Oroboros Oxygraph 2K high resolution respirometer and DatLab software were used for analyzing total cell respiration and respiratory rates. 106 to 2 × 106 cells were introduced in each chamber, and, after signal stabilization, 1 μl of 4 mg/ml oligomycin in ethanol was added per chamber for F0-ATP synthase inhibition. Then a titration with 10 mm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone uncoupler in ethanol was performed until the value of maximum oxygen consumption capacity was reached. 1 μl/chamber 0.2 mm rotenone and 5 mm antimycin A in ethanol was added for non-electron transport chain-related oxygen consumption measurement. Data were used for calculating the following respiratory flux control ratios, as described earlier (31.Gnaiger E. Gnaiger E. Mitochondrial Pathways and Respiratory Control: An Introduction to OXPHOS Analysis. 3rd Ed. OROBOROS MiPNet Publications, Innsbruck2012: 44-50Google Scholar). R/E represents routine oxygen consumption/uncoupled oxygen consumption. It indicates the percentage of electron transport capacity utilized in routine respiration in intact cells. The R/E control ratio is an expression of how close routine respiration operates to electron transport chain (ETC) capacity. L/E is the “leak” (remaining oxygen consumption after F0-ATP synthase inhibition)/uncoupled oxygen consumption. It represents the percentage of the electron transport capacity that is related to non-phosphorylating respiration (proton leak). The L/E ratio is an index of uncoupling or decoupling at constant ETC capacity. L/E increases with uncoupling from a theoretical minimum of 0.0 for a fully coupled system to 1.0 for a fully uncoupled system. netR/E represents the leak-corrected routine oxygen consumption/uncoupled oxygen consumption. It shows the percentage of the total (uncoupled) electron transport capacity functionally activated for oxidative phosphorylation. Cell pellets were frozen with liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C until used. Total mRNA was isolated from 5 × 106 cells with the GenElute mammalian total RNA purification kit plus on-column DNase I digestion set (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA was kept at −20 °C until used. Semiquantitative real-time PCRs were run in triplicate with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems) in an Eco Ilumina device. All experiments included three independent replicates, each one assayed in triplicate. The thermal profile was the following: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 20 s, Tm for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s for 40 cycles; 95 °C for 15 s; 55 °C for 20 s; 95 °C for 15 s. Efficiencies were calculated with LinReg software. To determine the relative expression ratios of each gene, the gene expression's Ct difference method (32.Schefe J.H. Lehmann K.E. Buschmann I.R. Unger T. Funke-Kaiser H. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR data analysis: current concepts and the novel “gene expression's CT difference” formula.J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) was used, with β-actin as the reference gene. Genomic contamination was examined by quantitative PCR of RNA samples. Negative control included all reagents except for cDNA.

Statistical significance is represented as follows: *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001. Three human neuroblastoma cell lines were used: n-myc-amplified Kelly and IMR-32 cells and n-myc non-amplified SK-N-SH cells (33.Medina M.A. del Castillo-Olivares A. Schweigerer L. Plasma membrane redox activity correlates with N-myc expression in neuroblastoma cells.FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). N-Myc protein levels were compared in the three cell lines by Western blot, showing that the protein amount is related to the previously described gene amplification: the N-Myc/GAPDH ratio was 7.4 ± 1.8 in Kelly cells, 0.12 ± 0.003 in IMR-32 cells, and undetectable in SK-N-SH cells. Several metabolic features were characterized in order to gain some understanding of the metabolic reprogramming of these cells. Glucose and glutamine consumption and lactate production were determined in Kelly, IMR-32, and SK-N-SH culture media after 24 h of incubation. The N-Myc-amplified cell lines showed significantly higher glucose (Fig. 2A) and glutamine (Fig. 2C) consumption rates after 24 h than SK-N-SH cells, whereas lactate production was quite similar in the three cell lines (Fig. 2B). The sum of glucose and glutamine consumed and not used for lactate production is around 60% of the total quantity in Kelly cells, 56% in IMR-32 cells, and only around 37% in SK-N-SH cells. No difference was observed in O2 consumption between Kelly and SK-N-SH cells (N-Myc-non-amplified), whereas IMR-32 cells had a lower O2 consumption than the other cell lines (Fig. 2D). When comparing respiratory flux control ratios, L/E is lower in the SK-N-SH cells than in the other ones, showing that in SK-N-SH cells, ETC capacity is less related to non-phosphorylating respiration (mainly proton leak) than in the case of Kelly and IMR-32 cells (Fig. 2E). In contrast, IMR-32 cells exhibited higher netR/E values than Kelly and SK-N-SH cells, indicating that they devote a greater percentage of their ETC capacity to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) than the other cell lines. PA contents were compared in the three cell lines (Fig. 3A). In general, Kelly cells had higher PA levels than the other ones, especially in the case of Put and Spd in Kelly versus SK-N-SH cells. In the three cell lines, individual PA contents showed the same tendency: [Put] < [Spd] < [Spm]. When comparing the total amount of PAs in the three cell lines, Kelly cells have 28 ± 3 pmol/μg protein, IMR-32 cells have 22 ± 1 pmol/μg protein, and SK-N-SH cells have 20 ± 1 pmol/μg protein. The mRNA levels of the three rate-limiting enzymes of PA metabolism were compared in the two cell lines with greater differences of N-Myc content (Kelly and SK-N-SH) (Fig. 3, B–D), in all of the cases showing higher content in Kelly cells. Because increased glycolysis plays an essential role in tumor cell proliferation (34.DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. The biology of cancer: metabolic reprogramming fuels cell growth and proliferation.Cell. Metab. 2008; 7: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the effects of glycolysis inhibition in human neuroblastoma cell lines. We used the well characterized competitive and allosteric hexokinase inhibitor 2-DG (35.Kurtoglu M. Gao N. Shang J. Maher J.C. Lehrman M.A. Wangpaichitr M. Savaraj N. Lane A.N. Lampidis T.J. Under normoxia, 2-deoxy-d-glucose elicits cell death in select tumor types not by inhibition of glycolysis but by interfering with N-linked glycosylation.Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2007; 6: 3049-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). First, the effects of glycolysis inhibition with 3 mm 2-DG for 24 h on lactate production and glutamine consumption were analyzed. As expected, lactate production was reduced by 2-DG treatment, more markedly in Kelly than in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 4D). Glutamine consumption increased in 2-DG-treated Kelly cells after 24 h, whereas no statistically significant effect was observed on SK-N-SH cells under the same conditions (Fig. 4E). 2-DG treatment had the general effect of reducing O2 consumption after F0-ATP-synthase inhibition (Leak) with oligomycin in the three cell lines (Fig. 4, F–H). The treatment also reduced maximum O2 consumption capacity (ETS) in Kelly and SK-N-SH cells, but in IMR-32 cells, the effect was not statistically significant. No effects on basal (Routine) O2 consumption and in residual (Rox) O2 consumption were observed in any of the cell lines. Regarding the respiratory flux control ratios (Fig. 4, I–K), treatment with 2-DG affected Kelly, IMR-32, and SK-N-SH in a very similar manner, increasing R/E and netR/E ratios, indicating that the treatment enhanced the use of the ETC and the OXPHOS, respectively. In contrast, 2-DG differentially affected the L/E ratio in the three cell lines. It caused a slight drop of L/E in Kelly cells and a more significant reduction in IMR-32 and, to a minor extent, in SK-N-SH cells. This overall reduction of the L/E ratio indicates a minor proton leak when cells are treated with 2-DG. When we measured PA content in 2-DG-treated cells, we observed an effect not described previously; the treatment was able to lower the levels of all PAs in Kelly cells, and it reduced the levels of Put and Spd in IMR-32 cells, whereas only Put levels were lowered in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 5, A–C). Cell growth curves were determined for untreated and 3 mm 2-DG-treated Kelly and SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The treatment affected the proliferation of Kelly cells as early as 24 h after 2-DG addition, whereas SK-N-SH cells were not significantly affected until 3 days after the beginning of the treatment. We also analyzed the cell cycle of Kelly cells by flow cytometry after 24 and 48 h of treatment (Fig. 4C). We observed an accumulation of cells in G1 phase, with a concomitant reduction of cells in S/G2/M after 24 h, which was more prominent after 48 h. An increase of dead cells (sub-G1) was detected after 48 h. No changes were observed in cell cycle distribution of 3 mm 2-DG-treated SK-N-SH cells with respect to controls after 24 h (data not shown)."
https://openalex.org/W2130936597,"Hepatic insulin resistance is associated with increased collagen. Integrin α1β1 is a collagen-binding receptor expressed on hepatocytes. Here, we show that expression of the α1 subunit is increased in hepatocytes isolated from high fat (HF)-fed mice. To determine whether the integrin α1 subunit protects against impairments in hepatic glucose metabolism, we analyzed glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HF-fed integrin α1-null (itga1−/−) and wild-type (itga1+/+) littermates. Using the insulin clamp, we found that insulin-stimulated hepatic glucose production was suppressed by ∼50% in HF-fed itga1+/+ mice. In contrast, it was not suppressed in HF-fed itga1−/− mice, indicating severe hepatic insulin resistance. This was associated with decreased hepatic insulin signaling in HF-fed itga1−/− mice. Interestingly, hepatic triglyceride and diglyceride contents were normalized to chow-fed levels in HF-fed itga1−/− mice. This indicates that hepatic steatosis is dissociated from insulin resistance in HF-fed itga1−/− mice. The decrease in hepatic lipid accumulation in HF-fed itga1−/− mice was associated with altered free fatty acid metabolism. These studies establish a role for integrin signaling in facilitating hepatic insulin action while promoting lipid accumulation in mice challenged with a HF diet."

https://openalex.org/W2005176718,"As the most frequently prescribed anticoagulant, warfarin has large inter-individual variability in dosage. Genetic polymorphisms could largely explain the differences in dosage requirement. rs9923231 (VKORC1), rs7294 (VKORC1), rs1057910 (CYP2C9), rs2108622 (CYP4F2), and rs699664 (GGCX) involved in the warfarin action mechanism and the circulatory vitamin K were selected to investigate their polymorphism characteristics and their effects on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of warfarin in Chinese population.220 patients with cardiac valve replacement were recruited. International normalized ratio and plasma warfarin concentrations were determined. The five genetic polymorphisms were genotyping by pyro-sequencing. The relationships of maintenance dose, plasma warfarin concentration and INR were assessed among groups categorized by genotypes.rs9923231 and rs7294 in VKORC1 had the analogous genotype frequencies (D': 0.969). 158 of 220 recruited individuals had the target INR (1.5-2.5). Patients with AA of rs9923231 and CC of rs7294 required a significantly lower maintenance dose and plasma concentration than those with AG and TC, respectively. The mean weekly maintenance dose was also significantly lower in CYP2C9 rs1057910 mutated heterozygote than in patients with the wild homozygote. Eliminating the influence from environment factors (age, body weight and gender), rs9923231 and rs1057910 could explain about 32.0% of the variability in warfarin maintenance dose; rs7294 could explain 26.7% of the variability in plasma concentration. For patients with allele G of rs9923231 and allele T of rs7294, higher plasma concentration was needed to achieve the similar goal INR.A better understanding of the genetic variants in individuals can be the foundation of warfarin dosing algorithm and facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese."
https://openalex.org/W2052960706,"A naturally occurring R9C mutation of phospholamban (PLB) triggers cardiomyopathy and premature death by altering regulation of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA). The goal of this study was to investigate the acute physiological consequences of the R9C-PLB mutation on cardiomyocyte calcium kinetics and contractility. We measured the physiological consequences of R9C-PLB mutation on calcium transients and sarcomere shortening in adult cardiomyocytes. In contrast to studies of chronic R9C-PLB expression in transgenic mice, we found that acute expression of R9C-PLB exerts a positively inotropic and lusitropic effect in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, R9C-PLB exhibited blunted sensitivity to frequency potentiation and β-adrenergic stimulation, two major physiological mechanisms for the regulation of cardiac performance. To identify the molecular mechanism of R9C pathology, we quantified the effect of R9C on PLB oligomerization and PLB-SERCA binding. FRET measurements in live cells revealed that R9C-PLB exhibited an increased propensity for oligomerization, and this was further increased by oxidative stress. The R9C also decreased PLB binding to SERCA and altered the structure of the PLB-SERCA regulatory complex. The structural change after oxidative modification of R9C-PLB was similar to that observed after PLB phosphorylation. We conclude that R9C mutation of PLB decreases SERCA inhibition by decreasing the amount of the regulatory complex and altering its conformation. This has an acute inotropic/lusitropic effect but yields negative consequences of impaired frequency potentiation and blunted β-adrenergic responsiveness. We envision a self-reinforcing mechanism beginning with phosphomimetic R9C-PLB oxidation and loss of SERCA inhibition, leading to impaired calcium regulation and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2087889644,"The enzyme ScHxk2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a dual-function hexokinase that besides its catalytic role in glycolysis is involved in the transcriptional regulation of glucose-repressible genes. Relief from glucose repression is accompanied by the phosphorylation of the nuclear fraction of ScHxk2 at serine 15 and the translocation of the phosphoenzyme into the cytosol. Different studies suggest different serine/threonine protein kinases, Ymr291w/Tda1 or Snf1, to accomplish ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation. The current paper provides evidence that Ymr291w/Tda1 is essential for that modification, whereas protein kinases Ydr477w/Snf1, Ynl307c/Mck1, Yfr014c/Cmk1, and Ykl126w/Ypk1, which are co-purified during Ymr291w/Tda1 tandem affinity purification, as well as protein kinase PKA and PKB homolog Sch9 are dispensable. Taking into account the detection of a significantly higher amount of the Ymr291w/Tda1 protein in cells grown in low-glucose media as compared with a high-glucose environment, Ymr291w/Tda1 is likely to contribute to glucose signaling in S. cerevisiae on the level of ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation in a situation of limited external glucose availability. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid residue serine 15 in yeast hexokinases and its phosphorylation is illustrated by the finding that YMR291W/TDA1 of S. cerevisiae and the homologous KLLA0A09713 gene of Kluyveromyces lactis allow for cross-complementation of the respective protein kinase single-gene deletion strains.

The current paper provides evidence that Ymr291w/Tda1 is essential for that modification, whereas protein kinases Ydr477w/Snf1, Ynl307c/Mck1, Yfr014c/Cmk1, and Ykl126w/Ypk1, which are co-purified during Ymr291w/Tda1 tandem affinity purification, as well as protein kinase PKA and PKB homolog Sch9 are dispensable. Taking into account the detection of a significantly higher amount of the Ymr291w/Tda1 protein in cells grown in low-glucose media as compared with a high-glucose environment, Ymr291w/Tda1 is likely to contribute to glucose signaling in S. cerevisiae on the level of ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation in a situation of limited external glucose availability. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid residue serine 15 in yeast hexokinases and its phosphorylation is illustrated by the finding that YMR291W/TDA1 of S. cerevisiae and the homologous KLLA0A09713 gene of Kluyveromyces lactis allow for cross-complementation of the respective protein kinase single-gene deletion strains. The adaptation of metabolism to changing nutrient availability is based on complex sensing and signaling mechanisms. In the case of the Crabtree-positive yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the regulatory phenomenon of glucose repression allows the preferential uptake and utilization of glucose, which is trapped inside the cell and activated for metabolism via phosphorylation (1.Conrad M. Schothorst J. Kankipati H.N. Van Zeebroeck G. Rubio-Texeira M. Thevelein J.M. Nutrient sensing and signaling in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 254-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The genome of S. cerevisiae encodes three enzymes that are capable of catalyzing glucose phosphorylation: the differentially regulated hexokinases ScHxk1 3The abbreviations used are: ScHxk1Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexokinase isoenzyme 11NM-PP14-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(1′-naphthylmethyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidineAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoridehrCNEhigh resolution clear native electrophoresisKlHxk1Kluyveromyces lactis hexokinase isoenzyme 1TAPtandem affinity purification. and ScHxk2 and the glucokinase ScGlk1 (2.Lazarus N.R.

A glucokinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2423-2431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ScHxk2 is the predominating hexose kinase when glucose is abundantly available (4.Herrero P. Galíndez J. Ruiz N. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. Transcriptional regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HXK1, HXK2 and GLK1 genes.Yeast. 1995; 11: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This enzyme belongs to a class of dual-function hexokinases, which in addition to their contribution to the uptake and initiation of metabolism of glucose, fructose, and mannose, are involved in glucose-dependent signal transduction (5.Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Glucose-sensing mechanisms in eukaryotic cells.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Dual-function hexokinases are capable of translocating from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to mediate glucose repression of transcription in yeast (6.Moreno F. Herrero P. The hexokinase 2-dependent glucose signal transduction pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 83-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plants (7.Granot D. David-Schwartz R. Kelly G. Hexose kinases and their role in sugar-sensing and plant development.Front. Plant Sci. 2013; 4: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or to participate in mechanisms finally leading to glucose homeostasis in higher organisms (8.Agius L. Glucokinase and molecular aspects of liver glycogen metabolism.Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Studies on glucose signaling in S. cerevisiae revealed that repression by glucose of Mig1-regulated genes specifically requires the concurrent translocation of ScHxk2 into the nucleus and the recruitment of the Mig1-interacting corepressor complex Cyc8(Ssn6)-Tup1 (9.Gancedo J.M. The early steps of glucose signalling in yeast.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 673-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

The hexokinases of S. cerevisiae are phosphoenzymes in vivo (10.Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Phosphorylation of yeast hexokinases.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the case of ScHxk2, the phosphorylation was found to be carbon-source dependent, being more extensive during growth on carbon sources such as galactose, raffinose, and ethanol, whereas high external glucose promoted the dephosphorylation of the phosphohexokinase (11.Randez-Gil F. Sanz P. Entian K.D. Prieto J.A. Carbon source-dependent phosphorylation of hexokinase PII and its role in the glucose-signaling response in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two phosphorylation sites were identified: the in vivo phosphorylation site serine 15 (12.Kriegel T.M. Rush J. Vojtek A.B. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. In vivo phosphorylation site of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is considered in the current paper, and the autophosphorylation-inactivation site serine 158 (13.Heidrich K. Otto A. Behlke J. Rush J. Wenzel K.W. Kriegel T. Autophosphorylation-inactivation site of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which remains unregarded here. ScHxk2 forms a monomer-homodimer equilibrium (14.Behlke J. Heidrich K. Naumann M. Müller E.C. Otto A. Reuter R. Kriegel T. Hexokinase 2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: regulation of oligomeric structure by in vivo phosphorylation at serine-14.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11989-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and serine 15 is likely to be part of the intersubunit interface, explaining monomer formation as a consequence of serine 15 phosphorylation (15.Kettner K. Kuettner E.B. Otto A. Lilie H. Golbik R.P. Sträter N. Kriegel T.M. In vivo phosphorylation and in vitro autophosphorylation-inactivation of Kluyveromyces lactis hexokinase KlHxk1.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 435: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Keeping in mind that serine 15 is also part of the nuclear localization signal Lys7-Met16 of ScHxk2 (16.Herrero P. Martínez-Campa C. Moreno F. The hexokinase 2 protein participates in regulatory DNA-protein complexes necessary for glucose repression of the SUC2 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation is likely to play a key role in ScHxk2-dependent glucose signaling. Indeed, the interaction of ScHxk2 with the karyopherins Kap60/Kap95 and Xpo1 (Crm1) is influenced by the phosphorylation state of serine 15 (and thereby indirectly by the availability of glucose) (17.Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. Nuclear export of the yeast hexokinase 2 protein requires the Xpo1 (Crm1)-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20548-20555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18.Peláez R. Fernández-García P. Herrero P. Moreno F. Nuclear import of the yeast hexokinase 2 protein requires α/β-importin-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 3518-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The regulatory significance of ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation is further supported by the finding that the interaction of ScHxk2 and ScMig1 is mediated through the N-terminal Lys7-Met16 decapeptide of the hexokinase and serine residue 311 of the transcriptional repressor (19.Ahuatzi D. Herrero P. de la Cera T. Moreno F. The glucose-regulated nuclear localization of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Mig1-dependent.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14440-14446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 20.Ahuatzi D. Riera A. Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. Hxk2 regulates the phosphorylation state of Mig1 and therefore its nucleocytoplasmic distribution.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4485-4493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Independent evidence for a physiological role of ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation came from enzymatic studies indicating that this modification affects substrate affinity and inhibition by ATP of the enzyme (21.Golbik R. Naumann M. Otto A. Müller E. Behlke J. Reuter R. Hübner G. Kriegel T.M. Regulation of phosphotransferase activity of hexokinase 2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by modification at serine-14.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1083-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The discovery that phosphorylation at serine 15 is key to the regulation of ScHxk2 function initiated the search for the respective enzyme(s). Although Glc7/Reg1 was identified as the responsible phosphoprotein phosphatase (11.Randez-Gil F. Sanz P. Entian K.D. Prieto J.A. Carbon source-dependent phosphorylation of hexokinase PII and its role in the glucose-signaling response in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the identity of the ScHxk2-S15 kinase is still a matter of debate. Serine 15 is part of a protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation sequence (22.Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation of Enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and, indeed, the catalytic subunit Tpk1 of PKA is capable in vitro of phosphorylating that residue (12.Kriegel T.M. Rush J. Vojtek A.B. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. In vivo phosphorylation site of hexokinase 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is no experimental evidence, however, that PKA is required for serine 15 phosphorylation in vivo (10.Vojtek A.B. Fraenkel D.G. Phosphorylation of yeast hexokinases.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, reports on the role of protein kinase Snf1 in ScHxk2-S15 phosphorylation are contradictory (11.Randez-Gil F. Sanz P. Entian K.D. Prieto J.A. Carbon source-dependent phosphorylation of hexokinase PII and its role in the glucose-signaling response in yeast.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23.Fernández-García P. Peláez R. Herrero P. Moreno F. Phosphorylation of yeast hexokinase 2 regulates its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 42151-42164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By contrast, a recent analysis of protein kinase single-gene deletion strains of S. cerevisiae indicated that the absence of the protein kinase Ymr291w/Tda1 (subsequently referred to as Ymr291w) is accompanied by a total loss of ScHxk2 in vivo phosphorylation (24.Kettner K. Krause U. Mosler S. Bodenstein C. Kriegel T.M. Rödel G. Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene YMR291W/TDA1 mediates the in vivo phosphorylation of hexokinase isoenzyme 2 at serine-15.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To further explore the molecular basis of ScHxk2 phosphorylation, Ymr291w was enriched by tandem affinity purification and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation analysis. In addition, four protein kinases that co-purified with Ymr291w as well as protein kinases PKA, Sch9, and Snf1, which are all involved in glucose-responsive pathways in yeast (25.Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Schneper L. Slonim N. Broach J.R. Glucose regulates transcription in yeast through a network of signaling pathways.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 245Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), are considered in the present study. Finally, the evolutionary conservation of metabolic regulation on the level of Ymr291w-dependent hexokinase phosphorylation is illustrated by the results of cross-complementation studies performed in S. cerevisiae and K. lactis. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was used for DNA amplification. The S. cerevisiae wild type strains W303 (accession number 20000A) and BY4741 (Y00000) and single-gene deletion strains BY4741Δymr291w (Y00878), BY4742Δsnf1 (Y14311), BY4741Δynl307c (Y01137), BY4741Δyfr014c (Y05693), and BY4741Δykl126w (Y04976) were obtained from Euroscarf (Germany). PKA mutant strain Y3175 (MATα; ura3–1; trp1–1; leu2–3,112; his3–11,15; ade2–1; can1–100; tpk1(M164G) GAL; tpk2::KAN; tpk3::TRP1) is described in Ref. 26.Stephan J.S. Yeh Y.-Y. Ramachandran V.

S. cerevisiae was cultivated in YP (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone) or minimal medium (0.69% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids), the latter medium supplemented with tryptophan (20 mg/liter). The initial glucose concentration was 0.05% (w/v) or 0.1% (w/v) in low-glucose media and 2% (w/v) in the high-glucose medium. The 0.05% low-glucose medium was supplemented with 3% (v/v) glycerol. K. lactis was propagated in YNB medium (0.69% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, pH 5.5, supplemented with adenine, uracil, and amino acids according to Ref. 28.Sherman F. Fink G.R.

All cell cultures including those subjected to nephelometric growth analysis were agitated at 200 rpm and 37 °C (E. coli) or 30 °C (yeast).

Correct integration was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The growth of yeast strains W303 and Y3175 was monitored in a NEPHELOstar Galaxy laser-based microplate nephelometer (BMG LABTECH, Germany) equipped with 96-well Cellstar® suspension culture plates (Greiner BioOne, Germany) by the detection of particulate matter via forward light scattering. The cells were grown to stationary phase in 5 ml of minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose, washed twice with and resuspended in minimal medium without carbon source to adjust an optical density (600 nm, 1 cm) of 2. This suspension was used to inoculate minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose and different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 μm) of the cell-permeable protein kinase inhibitor 1NM-PP1. Typically, 5 μl of the cell suspension and 200 μl of the medium were applied per well. Evaporation and condensation was avoided by sealing the plates with gas-permeable Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Carl Roth, Germany). Yeast cells were grown stepwise in YP or minimal medium with 2% (w/v) glucose in pre-cultures of 5 ml for 16 h followed by cultivation in 25 ml for 4 h. The cells were washed twice using medium without carbon source, resuspended in 25 ml of YP or minimal medium supplemented with the indicated carbon source at an initial optical density (600 nm, 1 cm) of 1, cultivated for another 2 h, and harvested at an optical density (600 nm, 1 cm) of ∼2 by centrifugation (3,500 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). The cells were washed with ice-cold distilled water, resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer A (50 mm imidazole, 5 mm aminocaproic acid, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, supplemented with 1 × EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm AEBSF and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II + III (1:100)) and subjected to glass bead disruption. For this purpose, 200 mg of glass beads (0.5 mm diameter; BioSpec Products) were added, and the cells vigorously shaken 5 times for 1 min at 25 Hz in a Mixer Mill MM 200 (Retsch, Germany).

https://openalex.org/W2163965493,"Objective Metabolic derangements, including insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia, are a major complication of major trauma (e.g., burn injury) and affect the prognosis of burn patients. Protein farnesylation, a posttranslational lipid modification of cysteine residues, has been emerging as a potential component of inflammatory response in sepsis. However, farnesylation has not yet been studied in major trauma. To study a role of farnesylation in burn-induced metabolic aberration, we examined the effects of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor, FTI-277, on burn-induced insulin resistance and metabolic alterations in mouse skeletal muscle. Methods A full thickness burn (30% total body surface area) was produced under anesthesia in male C57BL/6 mice at 8 weeks of age. After the mice were treated with FTI-277 (5 mg/kg/day, IP) or vehicle for 3 days, muscle insulin signaling, metabolic alterations and inflammatory gene expression were evaluated. Results Burn increased FTase expression and farnesylated proteins in mouse muscle compared with sham-burn at 3 days after burn. Simultaneously, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, Akt and GSK-3β was decreased. Protein expression of PTP-1B (a negative regulator of IR-IRS-1 signaling), PTEN (a negative regulator of Akt-mediated signaling), protein degradation and lactate release by muscle, and plasma lactate levels were increased by burn. Burn-induced impaired insulin signaling and metabolic dysfunction were associated with increased inflammatory gene expression. These burn-induced alterations were reversed or ameliorated by FTI-277. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that burn increased FTase expression and protein farnesylation along with insulin resistance, metabolic alterations and inflammatory response in mouse skeletal muscle, all of which were prevented by FTI-277 treatment. These results indicate that increased protein farnesylation plays a pivotal role in burn-induced metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory response. Our study identifies FTase as a novel potential molecular target to reverse or ameliorate metabolic derangements in burn patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030629415,"Background Many methods have been used to assess mitochondrial function. Technetium-99m sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI), a lipophilic cation, is rapidly incorporated into myocardial cells by diffusion and mainly localizes to the mitochondria. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether measurement of 99mTc-MIBI signals in animal models could be used as a tool to quantify mitochondrial membrane potential at the organ level. Methods and Results We analyzed 99mTc-MIBI signals in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat hearts perfused with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler known to reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential. 99mTc-MIBI signals could be used to detect changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential with sensitivity comparable to that obtained by two-photon laser microscopy with the cationic probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE). We also measured 99mTc-MIBI signals in the hearts of SD rats administered CCCP (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle. 99mTc-MIBI signals decreased in rat hearts administered CCCP, and the ATP content, as measured by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, decreased simultaneously. Next, we administered 99mTc-MIBI to Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt diet, which leads to hypertension and heart failure. The 99mTc-MIBI signal per heart tissue weight was inversely correlated with heart weight, cardiac function, and the expression of atrial natriuretic factor, a marker of heart failure, and positively correlated with the accumulation of labeled fatty acid analog. The 99mTc-MIBI signal per liver tissue weight was lower than that per heart tissue weight. Conclusion Measurement of 99mTc-MIBI signals can be an effective tool for semiquantitative investigation of cardiac mitochondrial membrane potential in the SD rat model by using a chemical to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential. The 99mTc-MIBI signal per heart tissue weight was inversely correlated with the severity of heart failure in the Dahl rat model."
https://openalex.org/W2060955900,"The ATP synthase of many archaea has the conserved sodium ion binding motif in its rotor subunit, implying that these A1AO-ATP synthases use Na+ as coupling ion. However, this has never been experimentally verified with a purified system. To experimentally address the nature of the coupling ion, we have purified the A1AO-ATP synthase from T. onnurineus. It contains nine subunits that are functionally coupled. The enzyme hydrolyzed ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, and ITP with nearly identical activities of around 40 units/mg of protein and was active over a wide pH range with maximal activity at pH 7. Noteworthy was the temperature profile. ATP hydrolysis was maximal at 80 °C and still retained an activity of 2.5 units/mg of protein at 45 °C. The high activity of the enzyme at 45 °C opened, for the first time, a way to directly measure ion transport in an A1AO-ATP synthase. Therefore, the enzyme was reconstituted into liposomes generated from Escherichia coli lipids. These proteoliposomes were still active at 45 °C and coupled ATP hydrolysis to primary and electrogenic Na+ transport. This is the first proof of Na+ transport by an A1AO-ATP synthase and these findings are discussed in light of the distribution of the sodium ion binding motif in archaea and the role of Na+ in the bioenergetics of archaea."

These regulators have homologous transmembrane regions, yet they differ in their cytoplasmic and luminal domains. Although the sequences of PLN and SLN are practically invariant among mammals, they vary in fish. Zebrafish (zf) appear to harbor multiple PLN isoforms, one of which contains 18 sequence variations and a unique luminal extension. Characterization of this isoform (zfPLN) revealed that SERCA inhibition and reversal by phosphorylation were comparable with human PLN. To understand the sequence variations in zfPLN, chimeras were created by transferring the N terminus, linker, and C terminus of zfPLN onto human PLN. A chimera containing the N-terminal domain resulted in a mild loss of function, whereas a chimera containing the linker domain resulted in a gain of function. This latter effect was due to changes in basic residues in the linker region of PLN. Removing the unique luminal domain of zfPLN (53SFHGM) resulted in loss of function, whereas adding this domain to human PLN had a minimal effect on SERCA inhibition. We conclude that the luminal extension contributes to SERCA inhibition but only in the context of zfPLN. Although this domain is distinct from the SLN luminal tail, zfPLN appears to use a hybrid PLN-SLN inhibitory mechanism.

Following the release of calcium from the SR during muscle contraction, the reuptake of calcium into the SR lumen determines the rate of relaxation as well as the amount of calcium available for subsequent contractions. Reuptake involves the active transport of calcium into the SR, which is accomplished by an ATP-dependent calcium pump (SERCA). In cardiac and smooth muscle, SERCA is regulated by phospholamban (PLN), a 52-amino acid integral membrane protein (1Kirchberber M.A. Tada M. Katz A.M.

The interaction between SERCA and PLN is controlled by the β-adrenergic pathway, where the phosphorylation of PLN by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) reverses SERCA inhibition and modulates the overall SR calcium load (3Katz A.M.

The cytoplasmic domain makes a small contribution to SERCA inhibition, yet it has two phosphorylation sites (Ser16 and Thr17) that play a critical role in the regulation of PLN inhibitory function. Indeed, several hereditary mutations in this domain are associated with early-onset, lethal heart failure in humans (17Haghighi K. Kolokathis F. Gramolini A.O. Waggoner J.R. Pater L. Lynch R.A.

The linker domain of PLN can also interact with SERCA, although residues such as Lys27, Gln29, and Asn30 appear to modulate the physical interaction with SERCA rather than making a direct contribution to inhibition (20Kimura Y.

Finally, the transmembrane domain of PLN encodes most of its inhibitory properties, which manifest as a decrease in the apparent calcium affinity of SERCA (21Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G.

The PLN transmembrane domain is highly hydrophobic and contains residues that are either critical for inhibitory function (e.g. Leu31 and Asn34) or involved in self-association to form a pentamer (leucine-isoleucine zipper) (23Simmerman H.K.

Comparatively, SLN has a short cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–7), a transmembrane domain homologous to that of PLN (residues 8–26), and a short, unique luminal domain (residues 27–31). Like PLN, the cytoplasmic domain of SLN is involved in regulating the interaction with SERCA (25Gramolini A.O. Trivieri M.G. Oudit G.Y. Kislinger T. Li W. Patel M.M. Emili A. Kranias E.G. Backx P.H.

However, unlike PLN, much of the inhibitory activity of SLN relies on its unique luminal domain rather than its transmembrane domain alone (8Gorski P.A. Glaves J.P. Vangheluwe P. Young H.S. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8456-8467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of its role in the heart, most structural and functional studies of PLN have concentrated on its mammalian forms. Nevertheless, PLN is found in many nonmammalian vertebrates, including birds, amphibians, and fish (27Will H. Küttner I. Vetter R. Will-Shahab L. Kemsies C. Early presence of phospholamban in developing a chick heart.FEBS Lett. 1983; 155: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Will H. Küttner I. Kemsies C. Vetter R. Schubert E. Comparative analysis of phospholamban phosphorylation in crude membranes of vertebrate hearts.Experientia. 1985; 41: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous expression emphasizes the importance of PLN as a regulator of calcium transport in cardiac muscle of many organisms. There is a remarkable degree of sequence homology between the mammalian forms of PLN with mainly as few as one or two amino acid substitutions between them all. In birds and fish, however, PLN shows much greater divergence. For example, chicken and zebrafish PLN are 83 and 68% identical to human PLN, respectively. Indeed, sequences have been reported for three zebrafish PLN isoforms (Fig. 1), and compared with human PLN, isoform 2b (referred to as zfPLN herein) contains 13 sequence variations and five additional residues at the C terminus. Most of the residue differences between human and zfPLN cluster in three distinct regions, suggesting that these more complex sequence changes could alter PLN function. The most intriguing variation in zfPLN is the addition of a C-terminal tail (residues 53–57). Unlike other PLN proteins, zfPLN has an additional five amino acids that extend into the SR lumen (Fig. 1). It is important to note that the C-terminal sequence of PLN in all mammals and birds is perfectly conserved (Met50-Leu-Leu52). In zfPLN, this sequence is modified to the longer and more polar Leu50-Leu-Ile-Ser-Phe-His-Gly-Met57, with the last five residues being reminiscent of the luminal Arg27-Ser-Tyr-Gln-Tyr31 sequence of SLN. So far, it is not known whether zfPLN can regulate SERCA and whether this regulation resembles that of human PLN or SLN. Given the high sequence diversity between zebrafish and human PLN, as well as the presence of a unique zfPLN luminal extension, we characterized the ability of zfPLN to regulate SERCA. We found that zebrafish and human PLN have comparable effects on SERCA activity and that both can be reversed by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of PLN. Human PLN chimeras containing regions of the zfPLN sequence resulted in altered SERCA inhibition. Thus, despite similar function, the zebrafish sequence variations are context-dependent and not synonymous with human PLN. Further study of the unique luminal domain of zfPLN indicated that it contributes to SERCA inhibition; however, this domain is not functional when transferred to human PLN, and it cannot be replaced with the SLN luminal tail. We conclude that the luminal extension of zfPLN is a distinct structural element and that zfPLN has characteristics reminiscent of both PLN and SLN. Human and zebrafish (Danio rerio; isoforms 2b) PLN variants were expressed and purified as described previously (29Douglas J.L. Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S.

The coupled enzyme assay reagents were of the highest purity available (Sigma). All co-reconstituted peptide constructs were compared with a negative control (SERCA reconstituted in the absence of PLN) and a matched positive control (SERCA co-reconstituted in the presence of either wild-type human PLN or zebrafish PLN isoform 2b). A minimum of three independent reconstitutions and activity assays were performed for each peptide, and the calcium-dependent ATPase activity was measured over a range of calcium concentrations (0.1 to 10 μm) for each assay.

The KCa (calcium concentration at half-maximal activity), the Vmax (maximal activity), and the nH (Hill coefficient) values were calculated based on nonlinear least squares fitting of the activity data to the Hill equation using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Errors were calculated as the standard error of the mean for a minimum of three independent measurements. Comparison of KCa, Vmax, and nH parameters was carried out using analysis of variance (between subjects, one-way analysis of variance) followed by the Holm-Sidak test for pairwise comparisons (SigmaPlot).

In optimizing the fit for SERCA in the presence of regulatory peptides, all reaction steps were initially allowed to vary. In this initial fit, rate constants that did not change more than the average error (in the kinetic simulations) were held at the starting model value. Each of the remaining rate constants were systematically varied to test whether they improved the fit to the experimental data (based on the sum of squared residuals). Rate constants that did not improve the fit to the experimental data were held at the starting model value. For the final fit, the remaining rate constants (typically 2–4 rate constants) were allowed to vary to minimize the discrepancy between the experimental data and the kinetic model. The starting points for the kinetic simulations included global fits previously reported for the following: (i) SERCA alone (38Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D.

https://openalex.org/W1997671767,"The FCGR3 locus encoding the low affinity activating receptor FcγRIII, plays a vital role in immunity triggered by cellular effector and regulatory functions. Copy number of the genes FCGR3A and FCGR3B has previously been reported to affect susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions. However, such genetic association studies often yield inconsistent results; hence require assays that are robust with low error rate. We investigated the accuracy and efficiency in estimating FCGR3 CNV by comparing Sequenom MassARRAY and paralogue ratio test-restriction enzyme digest variant ratio (PRT-REDVR). In addition, since many genetic association studies of FCGR3B CNV were carried out using real-time quantitative PCR, we have also included the evaluation of that method's performance in estimating the multi-allelic CNV of FCGR3B. The qPCR assay exhibited a considerably broader distribution of signal intensity, potentially introducing error in estimation of copy number and higher false positive rates. Both Sequenom and PRT-REDVR showed lesser systematic bias, but Sequenom skewed towards copy number normal (CN = 2). The discrepancy between Sequenom and PRT-REDVR might be attributed either to batch effects noise in individual measurements. Our study suggests that PRT-REDVR is more robust and accurate in genotyping the CNV of FCGR3, but highlights the needs of multiple independent assays for extensive validation when performing a genetic association study with multi-allelic CNVs."
https://openalex.org/W2034240335,"Background Heredity and environmental exposures may contribute to a predisposition to allergic rhinitis (AR). Autoimmunity may also involve into this pathologic process. FCRL3 (Fc receptor-like 3 gene), a novel immunoregulatory gene, has recently been reported to play a role in autoimmune diseases. Objective This study was performed to evaluate the potential association of FCRL3 polymorphisms with AR in a Chinese Han population. Methods Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms of FCRL3, rs945635, rs3761959, rs7522061, rs10489678 and rs7528684 were genotyped in 540 AR patients and 600 healthy controls using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls using the χ2 test. The online software platform SHEsis was used to analyze their haplotypes. Results This study identified three strong risk SNPs rs7528684, rs10489678, rs7522061 and one weak risk SNP rs945635 of FCRL3 in Chinese Han AR patients. For rs7528684, a significantly increased prevalence of the AA genotype and A allele in AR patients was recorded. The frequency of the GG genotype and G allele of rs10489678 was markedly higher in AR patients than those in controls. For rs7522061, a higher frequency of the TT genotype, and a lower frequency of the CT genotype were found in AR patients. Concerning rs945635, a lower frequency of the CC genotype, and a higher frequency of G allele were observed in AR patients. According to the analysis of the three strong positive SNPs, the haplotype of AGT increased significantly in AR cases (AR = 38.8%, Controls = 24.3%, P = 8.29×10-14, OR [95% CI] 1.978 [1.652~2.368]). Conclusions This study found a significant association between the SNPs in FCRL3 gene and AR in Chinese Han patients. The results suggest these gene polymorphisms might be the autoimmunity risk for AR."
https://openalex.org/W2068047364,"Epidemiological studies implicate dietary soy isoflavones as breast cancer preventives, especially due to their anti-estrogenic properties. However, soy isoflavones may also have a role in promoting breast cancer, which has yet to be clarified. We previously reported that equol, a metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein, may advance breast cancer potential via up-regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI). In estrogen receptor negative (ER−) metastatic breast cancer cells, equol induced elevated levels of eIF4G, which were associated with increased cell viability and the selective translation of mRNAs that use non-canonical means of initiation, including internal ribosome entry site (IRES), ribosome shunting, and eIF4G enhancers. These mRNAs typically code for oncogenic, survival, and cell stress molecules. Among those mRNAs translationally increased by equol was the oncogene and eIF4G enhancer, c-Myc. Here we report that siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Myc abrogates the increase in cancer cell viability and mammosphere formation by equol, and results in a significant down-regulation of eIF4GI (the major eIF4G isoform), as well as reduces levels of some, but not all, proteins encoded by mRNAs that are translationally stimulated by equol treatment. Knockdown of eIF4GI also markedly reduces an equol-mediated increase in IRES-dependent mRNA translation and the expression of specific oncogenic proteins. However, eIF4GI knockdown did not reciprocally affect c-Myc levels or cell viability. This study therefore implicates c-Myc as a potential regulator of the cancer-promoting effects of equol via up-regulation of eIF4GI and selective initiation of translation on mRNAs that utilize non-canonical initiation, including certain oncogenes.

Individual and combined soy isoflavones exert differential effects on metastatic cancer progression.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2010; 27: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings support our recent in vitro studies, which demonstrated that equol is the active metabolite of daidzein and increases breast cancer cell malignancy, primarily via up-regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4GI and its translation of mRNA-encoding oncogenic proteins (28.de la Parra C. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez-Montemayor M. Dharmawardhane S. The soy isoflavone equol may increase cancer malignancy via upregulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor eIF4G.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41640-41650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Translational control has received increased attention in recent years due to its emerging significance in cancer development and progression (29.Silvera D. Formenti S.C. Schneider R.J. Translational control in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Translation initiation is typically the rate-limiting step and therefore, a primary site for regulation. Accordingly, the levels of two eukaryotic initiation factors that are members of the cap-initiation eIF4F complex, consisting of eIF4E (Cap-binding protein) and eIF4G (initiation complex molecular scaffold), are frequently elevated in human cancers, and have been associated with poor prognosis and outcome (29.Silvera D.

Chem. 2012; 4: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Overexpression of eIF4GI is critical for the modes of translation initiation in eukaryotic cells that bypass or have a reduced requirement for eIF4E, including IRES-dependent mechanisms that allow the 40 S ribosome to be directly recruited to the mRNA (32.Sonenberg N.

Translational control in cellular and developmental processes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is thought that under the physiological stress conditions that exist in large tumors (i.e. growth arrest, amino acid starvation, hypoxia), cancer cells rely on non-canonical, eIF4E-deficient, IRES-dependent translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding pro-growth, pro-angiogenic and pro-survival proteins, such as, BCL2, Bcl -Xl, c-Myc, p120 catenin, and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) A, among others (29.Silvera D.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In our recent study using MDA-MB 435 ER− metastatic breast cancer cells treated with equol, we showed that the transcription factor c-Myc was also elevated in addition to up-regulated levels of eIF4GI and the increased translation of IRES-containing mRNAs that control cell survival and cell proliferation (28.de la Parra C. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez-Montemayor M. Dharmawardhane S. The soy isoflavone equol may increase cancer malignancy via upregulation of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor eIF4G.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41640-41650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This result is relevant because c-Myc is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and plays an important role in multiple signaling pathways including cell growth, cell proliferation, metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, microRNA regulation, cell death, and cell survival (37.Dang C.V. MYC on the path to cancer.Cell. 2012; 149: 22-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar, 38.van Riggelen J. Yetil A. Felsher D.W.

Myc's broad reach.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). With the objective of determining whether the equol-mediated up-regulation of eIF4G promotes preferential synthesis of c-Myc, which has an IRES element (40.Stoneley M. Paulin F.E. Le Quesne J.P. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. C-Myc 5′ untranslated region contains an internal ribosome entry segment.Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), or whether c-Myc up-regulation by equol leads to eIF4GI transcription, as shown in (41.Lin C.J. Cencic R. Mills J.R. Robert F. Pelletier J. c-Myc and eIF4F are components of a feedforward loop that links transcription and translation.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5326-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of silencing eIF4GI or c-Myc in equol-treated metastatic breast cancer cells. Here, we show that reducing eIF4GI levels results in a marked reduction in IRES-dependent mRNA translation, decreased polysomal association of those mRNAs, and corresponding oncogenic protein levels of specific IRES-containing mRNAs. The increase in cell viability and mammosphere formation (an indicator of tumorigenic potential (42.Shaw F.L. Harrison H. Spence K. Ablett M.P. Simões B.M. Farnie G. Clarke R.B.

Taken together, these data implicate c-Myc, and the consequent increase in eIF4GI followed by selective translation of oncogene mRNAs, in the pro-transforming effects of equol on breast cancer progression. Metastatic variant of MDA-MB-435 (ER−) (gift of Dr. Danny Welch, The University of Kansas Cancer Center) and Hs578t (ER-) metastatic human breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCCC), Manassas, VA) were maintained in complete culture medium: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Houston, TX) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells (ATCCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, EGF, hydrocortisone, cholera toxin, and insulin, as described previously (44.Montalvo-Ortiz B.L.

Chem. 2012; 287: 13228-13238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cell lines were authenticated and found to be mycoplasma free. Quiescent mammary epithelial cells or metastatic cancer cells were treated with 0 (vehicle, 0.1% DMSO) or 25 μm of (R,S) Equol (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) in DMEM and 5% FBS medium for 24 h. Cells were lysed and Western blotted, as described in Ref. 27.Martínez-Montemayor M.M. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez J. De La Mota-Peynado A. Cubano L.A. Dharmawardhane S. Individual and combined soy isoflavones exert differential effects on metastatic cancer progression.Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2010; 27: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Primary antibodies to eIF4E, eIF4GI, c-Myc, p120 catenin, Bcl-Xl, Cyclin-D1, GAPDH, JunB, and β-actin proteins (Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The integrated density of positive bands was quantified using Image J software, as described in Ref. 27.Martínez-Montemayor M.M. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez J. De La Mota-Peynado A. Cubano L.A. Dharmawardhane S. Individual and combined soy isoflavones exert differential effects on metastatic cancer progression.Clin. Exp.

Cell viability was determined by the CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, quiescent 1 × 105 MDA-MB-435 cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate and treated for 24 h with vehicle or 25 μm equol. Following equilibration, 15 μl/well of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) reagent was added, and the plates incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Stop solution (100 μl) was added to each well, and the plates incubated to facilitate solubilization of newly formed formazan salts. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described (28.de la Parra C. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez-Montemayor M. Dharmawardhane S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 41640-41650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was detected using NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). RNA (0.5 μg) was used to synthesize cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). RT-PCR primers were as follows. MYC: forward, 5′-TTCTCAGAGGCTTGGCGGGAAA-3′, reverse, 5′-TGCCTCTCGCTGGAATTACTACA-3′. B- 2-microglobulin (B2M): forward, 5′-GGCTATCCAGCGTACTCCAAA-3′, reverse, 5′-CGGCAGGCATACTCATCTTTTT-3′. GAPDH: forward, 5′-TTGCCATCAATGACCCCTTCA-3′, reverse, 5′-CGCCCCACTTGATTTTGGA-3′.

CTNND1: forward, 5′-TCCAGCAAACGATACAGTGG-3′, reverse, 5′-GAACCACCTCTGGCTGAAAT-3′. Real-time reactions were performed using iQ-SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad). The amplification reaction was performed for 40 cycles (10 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C). B2M mRNA was used as an internal control. The fold change was determined by the 2 ΔΔCT method as described (27.Martínez-Montemayor M.M. Otero-Franqui E. Martinez J. De La Mota-Peynado A. Cubano L.A. Dharmawardhane S.

Cells were pre-treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem), washed twice in PBS with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, pelleted, and resuspended in 700 μl of polysome isolation buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 30 mm MgCl2). After 5 min of incubation, 250 μl of detergent buffer (1.2% Triton, 0.2 m sucrose in polysome isolation buffer) was added, and cells were lysed. Clarified lysates were layered onto 10–50% sucrose gradients (Sigma-Aldrich) and sedimented at 36,000 rpm for 2 h in a SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 4 °C. Gradients were collected as 15 × 750 μl fractions, by pumping 60% sucrose into the bottom of the gradient and collecting from the top using an ISCO fraction collector while simultaneously monitoring absorbance at 254 nm. RNA was isolated by extraction with phenol/chloroform. Fractions 4–12, representing polysomes, were pooled and classified as light polysome fractions (2–3 ribosomes) and heavy polysome fractions (≥ 4 ribosomes). RNA preparations from each fraction were subjected to qRT-PCR for c-MYC, CTNND1 (p120-catenin), CCND1 (cyclin D1), eIF4G, GAPDH, and B2M, as described above. eIF4GI knockdown using shRNA adenovirus (Ad) vectors were conducted as described (36.Silvera D.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 and Hs578t cells were infected with Ad vectors twice over 4 days with non-silencing (NS control) or eIF4GI-silencing (Ad) shRNA vectors at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100, then treated with vehicle or 25 μm equol for 24 h. Control or c-Myc siRNAs (Santa Cruz, CA) were transfected into MDA-MB-435 and Hs578t cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by treatment with vehicle or equol for 24 h. MDA-MB-435 cells with non-silencing control or eIF4GI siRNA were transfected with a bicistronic reporter or control plasmid containing the luciferase constructs without an IRES, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as per the manufacturer's directions.

https://openalex.org/W1982348425,"Relative to their scarcity, large, deep lakes support a large proportion of the world's freshwater species. This biodiversity is threatened by human development and is in need of conservation. Direct comparison of biodiversity is the basis of biological monitoring for conservation but is difficult to conduct between large, insular ecosystems. The objective of our study was to conduct such a comparison of benthic biodiversity between three of the world's largest lakes: Lake Tahoe, USA; Lake Hövsgöl, Mongolia; and Crater Lake, USA. We examined biodiversity of common benthic organism, the non-biting midges (Chironomidae) and determined lake trophic status using chironomid-based lake typology, tested whether community structure was similar between the three lakes despite geographic distance; and tested whether chironomid diversity would show significant variation within and between lakes. Typology analysis indicated that Lake Hövsgöl was ultra-oligotrophic, Crater Lake was oligotrophic, and Lake Tahoe was borderline oligotrophic/mesotrophic. These results were similar to traditional pelagic measures of lake trophic status for Lake Hövsgöl and Crater Lake but differed for Lake Tahoe, which has been designated as ultra-oligotrophic by traditional pelagic measures such as transparency found in the literature. Analysis of similarity showed that Lake Tahoe and Lake Hövsgöl chironomid communities were more similar to each other than either was to Crater Lake communities. Diversity varied between the three lakes and spatially within each lake. This research shows that chironomid communities from these large lakes were sensitive to trophic conditions. Chironomid communities were similar between the deep environments of Lake Hövsgöl and Lake Tahoe, indicating that chironomid communities from these lakes may be useful in comparing trophic state changes in large lakes. Spatial variation in Lake Tahoe's diversity is indicative of differential response of chironomid communities to nutrient enrichment which may be an indication of changes in trophic state within and across habitats."
