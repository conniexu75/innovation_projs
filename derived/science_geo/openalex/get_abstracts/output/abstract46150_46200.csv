https://openalex.org/W2080101450,"The anopheline mosquito is the target in most malaria control programs, primarily through the use of residual insecticides. A mosquito was studied that is refractory to most species of malaria through a genetically controlled mechanism. A strain of Anopheles gambiae, which was selected for complete refractoriness to the simian malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi, also has varying degrees of refractoriness to most other malaria species examined, including the human parasites P. falciparum, P. ovale, and P. vivax for which this mosquito is the principal African vector. Furthermore, the refractoriness extends to other subhuman primate malarias, to rodent malaria, and to avian malaria. Refractoriness is manifested by encapsulation of the malaria ookinete after it completes its passage through the mosquito midgut, approximately 16 to 24 hours after ingestion of an infective blood meal. Fully encapsulated ookinetes show no abnormalities in parasite organelles, suggesting that refractoriness is due to an enhanced ability of the host to recognize the living parasite rather than to a passive encapsulation of a dead or dying parasite. Production of fully refractory and fully susceptible mosquito strains was achieved through a short series of selective breeding steps. This result indicates a relatively simple genetic basis for refractoriness. In addition to the value these strains may serve in general studies of insect immune mechanisms, this finding encourages consideration of genetic manipulation of natural vector populations as a malaria control strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2044804894,"We have devised a genetic selection for mutant yeast cells that fail to properly deliver the vacuolar glycoprotein CPY to the lysosome-like vacuole. This has allowed us to identify mutations in eight VPL complementation groups that result in aberrant secretion of up to approximately 90% of the immunoreactive CPY. Other soluble vacuolar proteins are also affected by each vpl mutation, demonstrating that a sorting system for multiple vacuolar proteins exists in yeast. Mislocalized CPY apparently traverses late stages of the secretory pathway, since a vesicle-accumulating sec1 mutation prevents secretion of this protein. Despite the presence of abnormal membrane-enclosed organelles in some of the vpl mutants, maturation and secretion of invertase are not substantially perturbed. Thus vpl mutations define a new class of genes that encode products required for sorting of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins from secretory proteins during their transit through the yeast secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2093695208,"Calmodulin was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on its characteristic properties. Like other calmodulins, the yeast protein is small, heat-stable, acidic, retained by hydrophobic matrices in a Ca2+-dependent manner, exhibits a pronounced Ca2+-induced shift in electrophoretic mobility, and binds 45Ca2+. Using synthetic oligonucleotide probes designed from the sequences of two tryptic peptides derived from the purified protein, the gene encoding yeast calmodulin was isolated. The gene (designated CMD1) is a unique, single-copy locus, contains no introns, and resides on chromosome II. The amino acid sequence of yeast calmodulin shares 60% identity with other calmodulins. Disruption or deletion of the yeast calmodulin gene results in a recessive-lethal mutation; thus, calmodulin is essential for the growth of yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971539282,"Cortisol production requires the activity of only 17 alpha-hydroxylase, whereas the formation of sex steroids requires both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities. Studies in reconstituted enzyme systems have suggested that a single steroid hydroxylase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 (P-450(17) alpha), catalyzes both activities. By expression of bovine adrenocortical P-450(17 alpha) in COS 1 (transformed monkey kidney) cells, which normally contain no detectable P-450(17) alpha, it has now been established in situ that a single polypeptide chain does catalyze both the 17 alpha-hydroxylase and the 17,20-lyase reactions. This heterologous system supports 17 alpha-hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone with equal efficiency, but catalyzes about five times as much 17,20-lyase activity when 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone is the substrate than when 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is the substrate. For these activities to be observed in COS 1 cells, newly synthesized apocytochrome P-450(17) alpha must bind heme and insert into the endoplasmic reticulum such that endogenous cytochrome P-450 reductase can support hydroxylation. Thus, COS 1 cells are a useful system for expression and study of various forms of cytochrome P-450."

https://openalex.org/W2000215876,"We use a new gel electrophoretic analysis to map the thermodynamically defined DNA binding domain of Escherichia coli CAP protein in the lac promoter. Strong binding interactions span a 28-30 bp duplex DNA region, substantially larger than that found for typical repressors. Sequence changes outside the central 28 bp of the binding site are found to affect the electrophoretically observed extent of bending. We also report a study of the DNA bending induced at a symmetrized CAP binding site, compared with the wild-type site; binding and bending are stronger at the upstream than at the downstream half of the wild-type site. Bends of the estimated 90 degrees - 180 degrees magnitude could play a vital regulatory role by producing tertiary structure in a local DNA domain, and by storing elastic energy for subsequent use in transcription or replication."
https://openalex.org/W2022119180,"The protein product of oncogene c-myc is believed to be important in regulation of the cell cycle. However, its direct role in DNA synthesis has not been explored. Experiments presented here show that the addition of affinity-purified antibodies against the human c-myc protein to nuclei isolated from several types of human cells reversibly inhibited DNA synthesis and DNA polymerase activity of these nuclei. This suggests that c-myc encodes a protein that is functionally involved in DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2005173649,"We have identified a gene (SUPH) of S. cerevisiae that is required for both RAS function and mating by cells of a mating type. supH is allelic to ste16, a gene required for the production of the mating pheromone a-factor. Both RAS and a-factor coding sequences terminate with the potential acyltransferase recognition sequence Cys-A-A-X, where A is an aliphatic amino acid. Mutations in SUPH-STE16 prevent the membrane localization and maturation of RAS protein, as well as the fatty acid acylation of it and other membrane proteins. We propose the designation RAM (RAS protein and a-factor maturation function) for SUPH and STE16. RAM may encode an enzyme responsible for the modification and membrane localization of proteins with this C-terminal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2069988633,"We explored the hypothesis that discrepancies in the literature concerning the nature of myosin expression in cultured smooth muscle cells are due to the appearance of a new form of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in vitro. Previously, we used a very porous sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis system to detect two MHCs in intact smooth muscles (SM1 and SM2) which differ by less than 2% in molecular weight (Rovner, A. S., Thompson, M. M., and Murphy, R. A. (1986) Am. J. Physiol. 250, C861-C870). Myosin-containing homogenates of rat aorta cells in primary culture were electrophoresed on this gel system, and Western blots were performed using smooth muscle-specific and nonmuscle-specific myosin antibodies. Subconfluent, rapidly proliferating cultures contained a form of heavy chain not found in rat aorta cells in vivo (NM) with electrophoretic mobility and antigenicity identical to the single unique heavy chain seen in nonmuscle cells. Moreover, these cultures expressed almost none of the smooth muscle heavy chains. In contrast, postconfluent growth-arrested cultures expressed increased levels of the two smooth muscle heavy chains, along with large amounts of NM. Analysis of cultures pulsed with [35S] methionine indicated that subconfluent cells were synthesizing almost exclusively NM, whereas postconfluent cells synthesized SM1 and SM2 as well as larger amounts of NM. Similar patterns of MHC content and synthesis were found in subconfluent and postconfluent passaged cells. These results show that cultured vascular smooth muscle cells undergo differential expression of smooth muscle- and nonmuscle-specific MHC forms with changes in their growth state, which appear to parallel changes in expression of the smooth muscle and nonmuscle forms of actin (Owens, G. K., Loeb, A., Gordon, D., and Thompson, M. M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 343-352). The reappearance of the smooth muscle MHCs in postconfluent cells suggests that density-related growth arrest promotes cytodifferentiation, but the continued expression of the nonmuscle MHC form in these smooth muscle cells indicates that other factors are required to induce the fully differentiated state while in culture."
https://openalex.org/W1551150032,"Filamentous phage assembly in vivo shows an absolute requirement for thioredoxin and a partial requirement for thioredoxin reductase. Mutants in which one or both of the active site cysteine residues of thioredoxin were changed to alanine or serine were constructed and shown to support filamentous phage assembly. Some of the mutants were almost as effective as wild-type thioredoxin, while others supported phage assembly only when high levels of the mutant protein were present in the infected cell. The mutant proteins were all inactive in an assay which couples oxidation of NADPH to reduction of 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) via thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin. These active site mutants make phage assembly completely independent of thioredoxin reductase, which suggests that the phage needs, and the active site mutants provide, the proteins in the reduced conformation. Other mutants were isolated on the basis of their failure to support filamentous phage growth. These specified mutant thioredoxin proteins with varying levels of redox activity in vivo and in vitro. The locations of these mutations suggest that the surface of thioredoxin thought to interact with thioredoxin reductase also interacts with the filamentous phage assembly machinery. An in vivo assay for thioredoxin redox function, based on the ability of cells to utilize methionine sulfoxide, was developed. Met- cells containing mutant thioredoxins that are inactive in vitro do not form colonies on plates containing methionine sulfoxide as the sole methionine source."
https://openalex.org/W1989947994,"The effects of bombesin and insulin, separately and in combination, have been studied in Swiss mouse 3T3 cells. Bombesin caused a rapid transfer of 3H from the lipid inositol pool of prelabeled cells into inositol phosphates. Label in inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) and in Ins1,4,5P3 and Ins1,3,4P3 rose within 10 sec of stimulation and that in Ins1,4P2, another InsP2 and InsP1, more slowly. Insulin, which had little effect on its own, increased the turnover of inositol lipids due to acute bombesin stimulation and also enhanced the DNA synthesis evoked by prolonged bombesin treatment. The results suggest that bombesin acting as a growth factor, uses inositol lipids as part of its transduction mechanism and that insulin acts synergistically to enhance both inositol phosphate formation and DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1517440098,"Using the reconstitution conditions developed recently (Radian, R., and Kanner, B. I. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11859-11865) we have now purified the sodium- and chloride-coupled gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter from rat brain to apparent homogeneity. A partially purified transporter preparation was passed over wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 6MB and non-bound proteins were washed away. The transport activity, as expressed upon reconstitution of the protein into liposomes, was eluted by a solution containing Triton X-100 and N-acetylglucosamine. The specific transport activity was increased almost 400-fold over that of the crude extract. Taking into account an approximately 2.5-fold inactivation during the lectin column chromatography, the actual purification is about 1000-fold. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the active fractions revealed one band of 80 kDa and small amounts of a band which ran at an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa. The ratio between the two could be experimentally changed such as, for instance, by lyophilization. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against the 80-kDa band which also cross-reacted with the 160-kDa band, indicating that the latter apparently represents a dimer form of the first. Using Protein A-Sepharose Cl-4B and the antibody against the 80-kDa band, we were able to quantitatively immunoprecipitate the potential gamma-aminobutyric acid transport activity from a crude transporter preparation. The pure transporter preparation exhibited the same features of the transporter in synaptic plasma membrane vesicles, namely dependence on sodium and chloride, electrogeneity, affinity, and efflux and exchange properties. We conclude that the 80-kDa band represents the gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter."

https://openalex.org/W1587695639,"DNA polymerase activity in Escherichia coli cells infected with bacteriophage T7 resides in a protein complex consisting of the T7 gene 5 protein and E. coli thioredoxin in a 1 to 1 stoichiometry. We have analyzed nine mutant thioredoxins, both in vivo and in vitro, for their ability to interact with the T7 gene 5 protein and stimulate the DNA polymerase and exonuclease activities inherent in gene 5 protein. The efficiency of plating of T7 on E. coli thioredoxin mutants depends strongly on the copy number of the respective mutant thioredoxin allele. Plating efficiencies at a constant copy number correlate well with the affinity of the purified mutant proteins for T7 gene 5 protein. The observed dissociation constant, Kobs, is increased between 5 and several hundredfold at 42 degrees C compared to wild-type thioredoxin. The maximum polymerase activity of the reconstituted gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex at saturating concentrations of mutant thioredoxins, however, is reduced by less than 20%. Consequently, none of the mutant thioredoxins acts as a competitive inhibitor of wild-type thioredoxin. The active-site disulfide of thioredoxin is not essential for the activities of the gene 5 protein-thioredoxin complex. Both cysteines can be replaced without significantly affecting the maximum polymerase or exonuclease activities. Substitution or alkylation of either cysteine, however, reduces the affinity for gene 5 protein drastically, indicating that the active site is part of the thioredoxin surface involved in the protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1563369929,"cDNA clones encoding a mouse cysteine proteinase were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from mRNA derived from the macrophage-like cell line J774. The DNA sequence predicts a protein that is closely related to, but distinct from, the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin H. Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with the known protein sequences for seven other cysteine proteinases suggests that the cloned DNA encodes a 334-residue protein containing both a 17-amino acid pre-region and a 96-amino acid pro-region. Consistent with this prediction, antiserum raised to a recombinant fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli immunoprecipitated multiple forms of the cysteine proteinase in mouse peritoneal macrophages and fibroblasts. In pulse-chase experiments, a 36-kDa precursor, presumedly the pro-form, was converted intracellularly into a 28-kDa protein and subsequently into a 21-kDa protein. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy results suggested that the cysteine proteinase was localized to lysosomes. Western blot analysis detected significantly more of the proteinase in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages than in resident peritoneal macrophages. Northern blot analysis revealed that several cell lines failed to express mouse cysteine proteinase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1995891070,"The yeast rna mutations (rna2–rna11) are a set of temperature-sensitive mutations that result in the accumulation of intron-containing mRNA precursors at the restrictive temperature. We have used the yeast in vitro splicing system to investigate the role of products of the RNA genes in mRNA splicing. We have tested the heat lability of the in vitro mRNA splicing reaction in extracts isolated from mutant and wild-type cells. Extracts isolated from seven of the nine rna mutants demonstrated heat lability in this assay, while most wild-type extracts were stable under the conditions utilized. We have also demonstrated that heat inactivation usually results in the specific loss of an exchangeable component by showing that most combinations of heat-inactivated extracts from different mutants complement one another. In three cases (rna2, rna5, and rna11), the linkage of the in vitro defect to the rna mutations was ascertained by a combination of reversion, tetrad, and in vitro complementation analyses. Furthermore, each heat-inactivated extract was capable of complementation by at least one fraction of the wild-type splicing system. Thus many of the RNA genes are likely to code for products directly involved in and essential for mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1522561094,"The interaction of three proteinases (seryl, cysteinyl, and metallo-) from Staphylococcus aureus with human plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor has been investigated. As expected, none of the enzymes was inactivated by this protein, each, instead causing the conversion of the native inhibitor into an inactive form of decreased molecular weight. Amino-terminal sequence analysis indicated that inhibitor inactivation had occurred by peptide bond cleavage near the reactive center of this protein. When the inhibitor was modified by this treatment, it became resistant to both pH and temperature denaturation and, in contrast to the intact denatured protein, did not undergo further proteolytic degradation. This process of inactivation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by pathogenic proteinases could result in a deregulation of its target enzyme, neutrophil elastase, and, therefore, may be important in the consumption of some plasma proteins by this enzyme during septicemia."
https://openalex.org/W1598644859,"A sensitive and specific guanine nucleotide regulatory process has recently been shown to rapidly mediate a substantial release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum within the N1E-115 neuronal cell line (Gill, D. L., Ueda, T., Chueh, S. H., and Noel, M. W. (1986) Nature 320, 461-464). The relationship between this mechanism and Ca2+ efflux mediated by the intracellular regulator inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) has been investigated. Using saponin-permeabilized N1E-115 cells, studies reveal a number of distinctions between the activation of Ca2+ release mediated by GTP and IP3. Thus, the GTP-mediated Ca2+ release process is specifically activated by polyethylene glycol which increases both GTP sensitivity and the extent of GTP-activated Ca2+ release; in contrast, IP3-dependent Ca2+ release is unaffected by polyethylene glycol. The non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate, which completely inhibits GTP-mediated Ca2+ release, does not alter release mediated by IP3. Decreasing the release temperature from 37 to 4 degrees C decreases IP3-activated Ca2+ release by only 20%, whereas the action of GTP on Ca2+ release is abolished at 4 degrees C. Activation of Ca2+ release by IP3 is completely inhibited by increasing free Ca2+ from 0.1 to 10 microM, whereas the fraction of GTP-dependent Ca2+ release (approximately 50% of ionophore-releasable Ca2+) remains unaltered with increasing free Ca2+. These distinctions between IP3- and GTP-mediated Ca2+ release indicate that the two effectors function via distinct mechanisms to activate Ca2+ release; however, they do not preclude the possibility that coupling between the two mechanisms can occur or that a common Ca2+-translocating pathway activated by both effectors exists."
https://openalex.org/W1995830988,"In meiosis I of most organisms, homologous chromosomes pair, recombine, and then segregate to opposite poles of the cell. Crossing-over is normally necessary to ensure the proper segregation of the homologs. Recently developed techniques have made it possible to study meiosis with highly defined artificial chromosomes. These techniques were used to demonstrate the existence of a system capable of segregating pairs of nonrecombined artificial chromosomes, regardless of the extent of their sequence homology. This system may contribute to the high fidelity of meiosis by mediating the segregation of pairs of natural chromosomes that have failed to recombine."
https://openalex.org/W1548054391,"We have developed a quantitative assay to measure the rate of processing of precursor LamB into mature protein and have used this assay to characterize 10 previously isolated and 3 new lamB signal sequence mutants. The data suggest that the LamB signal sequence serves a complex function. Our assay has revealed five types of signal sequence defect: 1) a strong kinetic defect resulting from alteration of the secondary structure in the putative alpha-helical region in the hydrophobic core, 2) a strong, or 3) a weak kinetic defect due to placement of a charged residue in the hydrophobic core, 4) decreased synthesis of LamB, and 5) both a decrease in synthesis and a strong kinetic defect. The effect of an extragenic suppressor, prlA4 on the rate of processing pLamB containing signal sequence mutations was also examined and compared to the rates in wild-type strains. It was found that prlA4 increases the rate of processing in some, but not all, mutants having a kinetic defect while having no effect on the decreased synthesis seen in mutants of types 4 and 5."
https://openalex.org/W1598930222,"The OmpR protein is a positive regulator involved in osmoregulatory expression of the ompF and ompC genes, which respectively code for major outer membrane proteins OmpF and OmpC of Escherichia coli. The OmpR protein has been purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain harboring an ompR gene-carrying plasmid. Throughout the purification the OmpR protein behaved as a single entity. The molecular weight determined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, the total amino acid composition, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein were essentially the same as those deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the ompR gene. Molecular weight determination and cross-linking study on the native protein revealed that the purified protein exists as a monomer. The purified OmpR protein was specifically bound to the promoter regions of the ompC and ompF genes. Experiments with a series of upstream deletions of the ompC and ompF promoters revealed that the region upstream from the -35 region was indispensable for OmpR binding to both the ompC and the ompF promoters. Although it has been proposed that depending on the medium osmolarity the OmpR protein may exist in two alternative structures, which respectively regulate functioning of the ompC and the ompF promoters, the purified OmpR protein appeared to be homogeneous and interacted with both promoters to the same extent."
https://openalex.org/W1482338057,"Germination and growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in the presence of 59Fe2+ or 35SO4(2-) allows heavy incorporation of both isotopes into the thylakoid membranes and into isolated photosystem I particles. Analysis of 59Fe-labeled preparations by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under mild conditions demonstrates that a minimum of four iron atoms/P700 is carried on P700-chlorophyll a-protein 1. When isolated from 35S-labeled preparations, P700-chlorophyll a-protein 1 binds zero valence 35S, which is converted into acid-labile [35S]sulfide by dithiothreitol reduction. Isolated photosystem I particles contain 14 acid-labile sulfide atoms and 10 iron atoms for each molecule of P700 and are composed of polypeptides of 110, 18, 15, 10, and 8 kDa of which the 10-kDa component is loosely bound. Under the electrophoretic conditions used, none of the low molecular weight polypeptides could be shown to be specifically associated with iron or acid-labile sulfide. Carboxymethylation of cysteine residues shows a high cysteine content in the 8-kDa polypeptide and an intermediate content in the 110- and 18-kDa polypeptides, whereas the 15-kDa polypeptide is devoid of sulfur amino acids. The experiments with the 59Fe-labeled thylakoids reveal other labeled polypeptides not associated with photosystem I, namely cytochrome f and possibly cytochromes b6 and b559."

(1983) Cell 33, 967-977). Transferrin receptor-containing vesicles have a major protein component present in a 1:1 ratio with the receptor that migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels as two polypeptides of Mr = 71,000 and 72,000. The Mr = 71,000/72,000 doublet is indistinguishable from the clathrin-uncoating ATPase/heat shock protein based on cross-reaction with affinity-purified antibody against the uncoating protein, by comparison of peptide maps of the Mr = 72,000 and 71,000 polypeptides and the uncoating protein, and by selective binding of these polypeptides to ATP-agarose. This finding suggests a possible activity of proteins related to the uncoating/heat shock protein family in the disposal of aged membrane proteins by a pathway independent of lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1602835412,"Mechanisms involved in the multihormonal regulation of fatty acid synthase have been investigated by comparing levels of its mRNA with rates of enzyme synthesis in chick embryo hepatocytes in culture. Triiodothyronine or insulin caused about a 2.5-fold increase in the relative rate of synthesis of fatty acid synthase. Together, these hormones were synergistic, stimulating enzyme synthesis by nearly 40-fold (Fischer, P.W.F., and Goodridge, A.G. (1978) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 190, 332-344). Addition of triiodothyronine stimulated increases in mRNA levels comparable to increases in enzyme synthesis whether insulin was present or not. Thus, triiodothyronine regulates fatty acid synthase primarily by controlling the amount of its mRNA. Addition of insulin, in the presence of triiodothyronine, stimulated enzyme synthesis by 14-fold and mRNA levels by only 2-fold. In the absence of triiodothyronine, insulin had no effect on mRNA levels. Thus, insulin has a major effect on the translation of fatty acid synthase mRNA. After the addition of triiodothyronine, fatty acid synthase mRNA accumulated with sigmoidal kinetics, approaching a new steady state about 48 h after the addition of hormone. Puromycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the effect of triiodothyronine. We suggest that the abundances of both fatty acid synthase and malic enzyme mRNAs are regulated by a common triiodothyronine-induced peptide intermediate which has a relatively long half-life. Glucagon caused an 80% decrease in the synthesis of fatty acid synthase (Fischer, P.W.F., and Goodridge, A.G. (1978) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 190, 332-344) and a 60% decrease in the level of fatty acid synthase mRNA. Thus, glucagon regulates fatty acid synthase by controlling the concentration of its mRNA. The synthesis of malic enzyme also was inhibited by glucagon at a pretranslational step, but the inhibition was almost complete. Thus, despite coordinated regulation of the concentrations of these enzymes during starvation and refeeding, individual hormones sometimes regulate synthesis of the two enzymes at the same step and to about the same degree and sometimes at different steps or to very different degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1597629304,"Three proteins catalyze RNA-primed DNA synthesis on the lagging strand side of the replication fork of bacteriophage T7. Oligoribonucleotides are synthesized by T7 gene 4 protein, which also provides helicase activity. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by gene 5 protein of the phage, and processivity of DNA synthesis is conferred by Escherichia coli thioredoxin, a protein that is tightly associated with gene 5 protein. T7 DNA polymerase and gene 4 protein associate to form a complex that can be isolated by filtration through a molecular sieve. The complex is stable in 50 mM NaCl but is dissociated by 100 mM NaCl, a salt concentration that does not inhibit RNA-primed DNA synthesis. T7 DNA polymerase forms a stable complex with single-stranded M13 DNA at 50 mM NaCl as measured by gel filtration, and this complex requires 200 mM NaCl for dissociation, a salt concentration that inhibits RNA-primed DNA synthesis. Gene 4 protein alone does not bind to single-stranded DNA. In the presence of MgCl2 and dTTP or beta, gamma-methylene dTTP, a gene 4 protein-M13 DNA complex that is stable at 200 mM NaCl is formed. The affinity of DNA polymerase for both gene 4 protein and single-stranded DNA leads to the formation of a gene 4 protein-DNA polymerase-M13 DNA complex even in the absence of nucleoside triphosphates. However, the binding of each protein to DNA plays an important role in mediating the interaction of the proteins with each other. High concentrations of single-stranded DNA inhibit RNA-primed DNA synthesis by diluting the amount of proteins bound to each template and reducing the frequency of protein-protein interactions. Preincubation of gene 4 protein, DNA polymerase, and M13 DNA in the presence of dTTP forms protein-DNA complexes that most efficiently catalyze RNA-primed DNA synthesis in the presence of excess single-stranded competitor DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1535484784,"The properties of a soluble endoprotease from rat liver were studied. The enzyme was purified in a latent form. It sedimented as a single component with a sedimentation coefficient (S(0)20,w) of 19.8 S. Measurement by quasi-elastic light scattering gave a diffusion coefficient (D(0)20,w) of 2.5 X 10(-7) cm2 X s-1 and an effective hydrodynamic radius of 85 A. The enzyme had an unusually high molecular weight, estimated as 743,000 by sedimentation equilibrium and 722,000 by sedimentation velocity and diffusion measurements and as 760,000 by a recently developed low-angle laser light scattering method. Judging from electron microscopic observation and the calculated frictional and axial ratios, the enzyme molecule is disc-shaped. Analysis of the far-ultraviolet circular dichroic spectrum showed that the enzyme contains 50% alpha-helical, 25% beta-sheet, and 15% unordered structures with 10% beta-turns. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is 5.0. These properties indicate that the purified enzyme is a homogeneous molecule. In addition, the enzyme is a simple protein since it contains no measurable amounts of nucleic acid carbohydrate or lipid."
https://openalex.org/W1593830682,"We have isolated and characterized a new yeast mutation in the glucosylation steps of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, alg8-1. Cells carrying the alg8-1 mutation accumulate Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-lipid both in vivo and in vitro. We present evidence showing that the alg8-1 mutation blocks addition of the second alpha 1,3-linked glucose. alg8-1 cells transfer Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 to protein instead of the wild type oligosaccharide, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Pulse-chase studies indicate that the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 transferred is processed more slowly than the wild type oligosaccharide. The yeast mutation gls1-1 lacks glucosidase I activity (Esmon, B., Esmon, P.C., and Schekman, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 10322-10327), the enzyme responsible for removing the alpha 1,2-linked glucose residues from protein-linked oligosaccharides. We demonstrate that gls1-1 cells contain glucosidase II activity (which removes alpha 1,3-linked glucose residues) and have constructed the alg8-1 gls1-1 haploid double mutant. The Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was trimmed normally in these cells, demonstrating that the alg8-1 oligosaccharide contained an alpha 1,3-linked glucose residue. A novel Glc2 compound was probably produced by the action of the biosynthetic enzyme that normally adds the alpha 1,2-linked glucose to lipid-linked Glc2Man9GlcNAc2. This enzyme may be able to slowly add alpha 1,2-linked glucose residue to protein-bound Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. The relevance of these findings to similar observations in other systems where glucose residues are added to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and the possible significance of the reduced rate of oligosaccharide trimming in the alg mutants are discussed."

The primary translation product of human apolipoprotein A-II mRNA contains an 18-amino acid signal peptide, a 5-amino acid propeptide, and the mature 77-amino acid plasma protein sequence. Its propeptide was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis of a cloned cDNA. The effects of this mutation on cotranslational translocation and proteolytic processing were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsomal membrane processing system. Deletion of the propeptide did not affect cotranslational translocation. However, without its propeptide, signal peptidase cleavage was redirected to a different site located between the 2nd and 3rd residues of the mature protein. Since the primary structure of the signal peptide was not altered in the mutant, these results suggest that sequences located downstream from the signal peptidase cleavage site (e.g. in propeptides) may modulate, or participate in defining, the correct site of cotranslational proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1569044635,"To investigate dipeptide assimilation by the liver, a series of interrelated experiments were performed in rats. Partial hepatectomy prolonged the plasma half-life (min) of Gly-Ala (3.42 +/- 0.22 versus 4.90 +/- 0.35, p less than 0.05) but had no significant effect on plasma half-life of Gly-Leu, Gly-Pro, or Gly-Sar. We then investigated the rate of disappearance (mumol X (g liver X h)-1) of the above four dipeptides (initial concentration = 1 mM) from the medium during isolated liver perfusion. The order of dipeptide disappearance was: Gly-Leu (8.75 +/- 0.65) greater than Gly-Ala (3.36 +/- 0.46) greater than Gly-Pro (1.29 +/- 0.54) greater than Gly-Sar (0.35 +/- 0.12). This order of dipeptide disappearance corresponded exactly to the order of the rates of glycine accumulation in the medium during liver perfusion with the four dipeptides. Addition of glucagon had no effect on the disappearance rate of Gly-Ala from the medium, but reduced accumulation rates of glycine (3.39 +/- 0.30 versus 1.42 +/- 30, p less than 0.01) and alanine (4.42 +/- 0.66 versus 1.35 +/- 0.39, p less than 0.01). Finally, we found that hydrolysis by the liver plasma membranes and/or perfusion medium accounted for disappearance of dipeptides. In conclusion, the liver does not appear to have a transport system for dipeptides, but assimilates dipeptides by extracellular hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is achieved by enzymes either located on the plasma membranes or released from the cytosol. The amino acid residues released as the result of dipeptide hydrolysis are then taken up by the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1488256406,"The actions of a variety of polypeptide growth factors on isolated cells are thought to be initiated by stimulation of Na+-H+ exchange across the plasma membranes of the cells resulting in intracellular alkalinization. To determine whether insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) exert actions through such a mechanism, we incubated suspensions of canine renal proximal tubular segments with insulin or IGF I or with multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA)/IGF II. Changes in intracellular pH were detected by measurements of the distribution of [14C]5,5-dimethoxazolidine-2,4-dione. Incubation of segments with 10(-9) M MSA under conditions such that extracellular [Na+] greater than intracellular [Na+] effected intracellular alkalinization detectable within 1-2 min. Alkalinization was not observed under conditions where this gradient was not present. Alkalinization was not prevented by inclusion of 1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid or 1 mM ouabain in incubations, but was inhibited by amiloride. Incubation of proximal tubular segments with as little as 10(-11) M MSA effected intracellular alkalinization. Incubation with as much as 10(-6) M insulin or IGF I did not. Our findings are consistent with an action of MSA/IGF II to stimulate Na+-H+ exchange across the plasma membrane of the renal proximal tubular cell. It is possible that the stimulation represents a mechanism by which actions of IGF II are initiated in growth factor-sensitive cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554141820,"The role of the redox potential in insulin secretion by beta cells stimulated with high glucose was investigated using an in vitro pancreas perfusion system. To assess glycolytic flux the sum of fructose-1,6-P2 + triose-P was determined in pure beta cells microdissected from lyophilized sections of the isolated perfused pancreas quick frozen during the early insulin secretory response. L-Glycerol 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were measured as indicators of the free cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio and NADH and NADPH were also measured. Fructose-1,6-P2 + triose-P was increased in beta cells simultaneously with the onset of insulin secretion indicating an increase in glucose metabolism had occurred. The ratio of [dihydroxyacetone phosphate]/[L-glycerol 3-phosphate] increased simultaneously with the onset of insulin secretion. NADH content increased only after initiation of insulin secretion and NADPH levels remained unchanged during the early secretory response to high glucose. These data contradict the hypothesis that insulin secretion is triggered by a more reduced cytosolic redox state and instead indicate that insulin secretion is initiated by other metabolic coupling factor(s) generated in beta cells stimulated by high glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1556339856,"ABC excision nuclease of Escherichia coli is a DNA repair enzyme that recognizes major helical distortions caused by bulky base adducts and incises on both sides of the adduct, thus removing the modified nucleotides in the form of a 12-13-base long oligomer. We tested the enzyme with substrates that contained unusual helical structures caused by single-base mismatches or one, three, or four extrahelical bases (loops). We find that the enzyme does not cut DNAs containing helical perturbations caused by these structures. However, when the mismatched or extrahelical bases are modified with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide, a reagent specific for unpaired G and T residues, the enzyme incises at the modified nucleotides in the regular manner. In addition, we find that when mismatches and loops are located near pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts they do not inhibit incision at the photoproducts by the excinuclease but sometimes affect the incision pattern. Our results indicate that ABC excinuclease may be a useful enzymatic reagent to probe the structural changes caused by mismatches and deletions in DNA and provide additional information on the requirements for incision by this repair enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1497758287,"Programmed 30 S subunits expose only one binding site, to which the different classes of tRNA (deacylated tRNAPhe, Phe-tRNAPhe, and N-acetylphenylalanyl (AcPhe)-tRNAPhe) bind with about the same affinity. Elongation factor Tu within the ternary complex does not contribute to the binding of Phe-tRNA. Binding of acylated or deacylated tRNA to 30 S depends on the cognate codon; nonprogrammed 30 S subunits do not bind tRNA to any significant extent. The existence of only one binding site/30 S subunit (and not, for example, two sites in 50% of the subunits) could be shown with Phe-tRNAPhe as well as deacylated tRNAPhe pursuing different strategies. Upon 50 S association the 30 S-bound tRNA appears in the P site (except the ternary complex which is found at the A site). Inhibition experiments with tetracycline demonstrated that the 30 S inhibition pattern is identical to that of the P site but differs from that of the A site of 70 S ribosomes. In contrast to 30 S subunits the 50 S subunit exclusively binds up to 0.2 and 0.4 molecules of deacylated tRNAPhe/50 S subunit in the absence and presence of poly(U), respectively, but neither Phe-tRNA nor AcPhe-tRNA. Noncognate poly(A) did not stimulate the binding indicating codon-anticodon interaction at the 50 S site. The exclusive binding of deacylated tRNA and its dependence on the presence of cognate mRNA is reminiscent of the characteristics of the E site on 70 S ribosomes. 30 and 50 S subunits in one test tube expose one binding site more than the sum of binding capacities of the individual subunits. The results suggest that the small subunit contains the prospective P site and the large subunit the prospective E site, thus implying that the A site is generated upon 30 S-50 S association."
https://openalex.org/W1563424302,"Gene 4 protein and DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 catalyze RNA-primed DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA templates. T7 DNA polymerase exhibits an affinity for both gene 4 protein and single-stranded DNA, and gene 4 protein binds stably to single-stranded DNA in the presence of dTTP (Nakai, H. and Richardson, C. C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 15208-15216). Gene 4 protein-T7 DNA polymerase-template complexes may be formed in both the presence and absence of nucleoside 5'-triphosphates. The protein-template complexes may be isolated free of unbound proteins and nucleotides by gel filtration and will catalyze RNA-primed DNA synthesis in the presence of ATP, CTP, and the four deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates. RNA-primed DNA synthesis may be dissected into separate reactions for primer synthesis and DNA synthesis. Upon incubation of gene 4 protein with single-stranded DNA, ATP, and CTP, a primer-template complex is formed; it is likely that gene 4 protein mediates stable binding of the oligonucleotide to the template. The complex, purified free of unbound proteins and nucleotides, supports DNA synthesis upon addition of DNA polymerase and deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates. Association of primers with the template is increased by the presence of dTTP or DNA polymerase during primer synthesis. DNA synthesis supported by primer-template complexes initiates predominantly at gene 4 recognition sequences, indicating that primers are bound to the template at these sites."
https://openalex.org/W1482103323,"Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are sensitive to reagents that modify sulfhydryl groups. We report here the significance of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-mediated inactivation of Escherichia coli glycyl-tRNA synthetase, and alpha 2 beta 2 enzyme. We confirmed earlier observations that NEM abolishes synthetase-catalyzed aminoacylation with pseudo-first order kinetics and provided a second method of proof that the site of inactivation is located in the beta-subunit. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the glyS gene, each beta-subunit cysteine codon (positions 98, 395, and 450) was replaced, individually, by an alanine codon. The three resulting mutant proteins are each active in vivo, and their in vitro aminoacylation activities are comparable to that of the native enzyme. A mutant incorporating all three amino acid substitutions is also active in vivo and in vitro. These results establish conclusively that a beta-subunit cysteine thiol is not required for the catalysis of aminoacylation. The Cys98----Ala and Cys450----Ala mutants are inactivated by NEM with the same kinetics as the wild-type protein. However, the Cys395----Ala mutant is refractory to NEM. This suggests that NEM inactivation of the native enzyme is due to alkylation of Cys395. Aware that inactivation may result from steric effects, we constructed a mutant with a bulkier amino acid residue at position 395 (Cys395----Gln). The aminoacylation activity of this protein is less than 10% of that of the wild-type enzyme. The glutamine substitution affects only the tRNA-dependent step of the reaction--the rate of glycyl adenylate synthesis is not lowered. In these features, the mutant resembles the NEM-inactivated protein. We propose that the NEM sensitivity of glycyl-tRNA synthetase, and possibly of other synthetases, arises from steric or conformational effects of the alkylated cysteine side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1667905420,"Abstract The radiolabeled, photoreactive azido-ubiquinone derivative (azido-Q), 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyl-[3H]octyl)- 1,4-benzoquinone, was used to investigate the active site of ubiquinol oxidase activity of the cytochrome d complex, a two-subunit terminal oxidase of Escherichia coli. The azido-Q, when reduced by dithioerythritol, was shown to support enzymatic oxygen consumption by the cytochrome d complex that was 8% of the rate observed with ubiquinol-1. This observation provided the rationale behind further studies of the possible photoinactivation and labeling of the active site by this azido-Q. Ten min of photolysis of the purified cytochrome d complex in the presence of the azido-Q resulted in a 60% loss of the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity. Uptake of the radiolabeled azido-Q by the cytochrome d complex was correlated to the photoinactivation of the ubiquinol-1 oxidase activity. Both increased linearly during the first 4 min of photolysis and reached 90% of the maximum within 10 min. Photolysis times longer than 10 min resulted in no increase in the maximum of 2 mol of azido-Q incorporated per mol of enzyme. The rate of azido-Q uptake by subunit I, but not subunit II, correlated well with the rate of loss of ubiquinol oxidase activity. Use of ubiquinol-0, which is not oxidized by the enzyme, to competitively inhibit radiolabeling of nonspecific binding sites, resulted in a significant decrease (42%) of azido-Q labeling of subunit II while it did not affect the labeling of subunit I. After photolysis for 4 min, the ratio of radiolabeled azido-Q in subunits I to II of the complex was 4.3 to 1.0. These observations support the conclusion that the ubiquinol substrate binding site is located on subunit I of the cytochrome d complex."
https://openalex.org/W1539121429,"We have studied the sensitivity of sulfhydryl groups of a highly purified p21 protein of the v-rasH oncogene to a thiol-specific reagent, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Approximately 70% of GTP binding and autokinase activities of p21 were inactivated by NEM, and excessive amounts of GTP or GDP protected p21 activities. Thiol titration revealed the presence of one fast reactive cysteine residue, the susceptibility of which is modulated by GTP binding. A total of 4 and 6 residues, respectively, became titratable upon denaturation and reduction, suggesting the presence of a disulfide bond. This GTP-modulated sulfhydryl group was identified as Cys-80 in the following tryptic peptide sequence: NH2-Thr-Gly-Glu-Gly-Phe-Leu-Cys-Val-Phe-Ala-Ile-Asn-Asn-Thr-Lys-COOH. This is based on the comparative tryptic peptide mapping of [14C]NEM-modified p21 in the presence and absence of GTP. The GTP-modulated peptide co-chromatographed with a synthetic peptide of the predicted sequence. Amino acid analysis of the purified [14C]NEM-modified peptide from tryptic digests of p21 also confirmed its identity. This region of p21 shares an extensive sequence homology with various G-proteins and appears to be in the vicinity of the GTP-binding domain of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1517773943,"We have previously described experimental conditions where basal methylglucose transport in adipocytes exhibited an apparent Km of approximately 35 mM. Under those conditions insulin stimulated transport predominantly by decreasing the transport Km (Whitesell, R. R., and Abumrad, N. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2894-2899). Our findings were in contrast with earlier reports that the Km of basal glucose transport was low (3-5 mM) and similar to that of transport in insulin-treated cells. In this study we have investigated the effect of different experimental conditions on the kinetics of basal glucose transport in adipocytes. When transport was assayed at 37 degrees C, cell agitation for 10 min prior to the transport assay decreased the basal Km from 35 to 12 mM. Deprivation of metabolic substrate produced a further reduction down to 2 mM. Refeeding starved cells with 1 mM glucose returned the Km back up to 12 mM in agitated cells and to 40 mM in stabilized cells. The effects of agitation to lower and of glucose to raise the basal Km were prevented by preincubating cells with dinitrophenol. Cell agitation or substrate lack did not alter the Vmax of basal transport and were without effect on both Km and Vmax in insulin-treated cells. The temperature dependencies of the kinetics of basal and stimulated transport were studied. A decrease in the assay temperature from 37 to 23 degrees C caused both basal Km and Vmax to drop proportionately from 25 to 5 mM, and 13 to 3.6 nmol/(microliter X min), respectively. In insulin-stimulated cells, only the Vmax was decreased (Km went from 3.5 to 3 mM, Vmax from 45 to 17 nmol/(microliter X min]. The results support the concept that experimental conditions can produce large changes in the Km of basal glucose transporters. Furthermore they explain why, under certain assay conditions (with temperatures around 23 degrees C or with deprivation of metabolic substrate), the effect of insulin on transport Km is not observed. Our data also suggest that basal transport characteristics do not persist in insulin-treated cells. We would propose that one of the actions of insulin (in addition to raising Vmax) is to change the characteristics of basal transporters by overriding metabolic factors which keep the Km high. Alternatively, insulin could cause the disappearance of basal transporters as new and different ones are recruited from intracellular stores."
https://openalex.org/W1531216350,"Protein-protein cross-linking was used to examine the spatial arrangement of proteins within the 40 S ribosomal subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Purified ribosomal subunits were treated with either 2-iminothiolane or dimethyl 3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate under conditions such that the ribosomal particle was intact and that formation of 40 S subunit dimers was minimized. Proteins were extracted from the treated subunits and fractionated on Sephadex G-150 or by acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cross-linked proteins in these fractions were analyzed by two-dimensional diagonal sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Constituent members of cross-linked pairs were radiolabeled with 125I and identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and comparison with nonradioactive ribosomal protein markers. Forty-two pairs involving 25 of the 32 40 S subunit proteins were identified. Many proteins were detected in several cross-linked dimers. These proteins with multiple cross-links form foci for the construction of a schematic model of the spatial arrangement of proteins within the 40 S subunit."

Our results provide evidence that these two proteins are involved in assembly but may not be required once the 30 S subunit has been properly assembled."
https://openalex.org/W1482698103,"Insulin binding to two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with well-defined defects in their glycosylation pathway has been characterized and compared to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) binding in the same cell lines. Insulin competition curves indicate that B4-2-1 cells, which transfer co-translationally to proteins an endoglycosidase H insensitive, truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharide, bind insulin with higher than normal affinity. Lec 1 cells, which fail to process oligosaccharide side chains to complex types, bind with a reduced affinity. The potencies of chicken and guinea pig insulins are appropriate for an insulin receptor in the control (WTB) and both mutant cell lines, whereas rat IGF-II is 3 times more potent than expected in the Lec 1 cells and human IGF-I is less potent than anticipated. Insulin bound to Lec 1 cells dissociates more quickly upon dilution than does insulin bound to either WTB or B4-2-1 cells. The Lec 1 insulin receptor is insensitive to pH change, whereas the other lines show the usual optimum of 8. 125I-IGF-I binds well to all three cell lines and is equally pH-sensitive in all three. Serum from a patient with circulating autoantibodies to the insulin receptor competes for insulin but not IGF-I binding, whereas alpha IR3, a monoclonal antibody directed toward the human IGF-I receptor inhibits IGF-I but not insulin binding. Cross-linking of either 125I-insulin or 125I-IGF-I reveals a typical alpha-subunit in the WTB and B4-2-1 cells but a band with faster mobility in the Lec 1 cells. Insulin (10(-8) M) stimulates autophosphorylation of a beta-subunit in all three lines, but again the Lec 1 subunit demonstrates an anomalous mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data demonstrate the differential effect of glycosylation on two closely related receptor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1537083608,"This paper presents evidence that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in lung secretions is not effective as an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like enzymes. First, lung secretion samples inhibited more cathepsin G on a one-to-one molar basis than could be accounted for by the alpha 1-antichymotrypsin present. Second, the major cathepsin G inhibitory capacity of sputum was in gel filtration fractions that corresponded to a low molecular weight (10,000-15,000) and contained immunoreactive antileucoprotease. Third, although alpha 1-antichymotrypsin purified from plasma was almost fully active against cathepsin G, that purified from lung lavage retained less than 15% of its inhibitory function. Immunoblotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in plasma and lung secretions are of similar molecular size and no enzyme-alpha 1-antichymotrypsin complexes could be detected in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. However, in contrast to the alpha 1-antichymotrypsin purified from plasma, the lavage protein gave a broad elution profile following anion-exchange chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1563743793,"Escherichia coli strain 5C15 contains a mutation in the cca gene that decreases AMP incorporation by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase while leaving CMP incorporation unaffected. Earlier studies of the purified mutant enzyme suggested that the mutation was localized to the AMP-incorporating site. In order to analyze this mutation in more detail, the cca gene from strain 5C15 was cloned into plasmid pUC8. Analysis of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity in extracts of a strain transformed with this plasmid demonstrated an elevated level of CMP incorporation, but low AMP incorporation, as expected from the properties of the original mutant. Sequence analysis of the mutant cca gene revealed only a single G to A point mutation leading to a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at position 70 of the peptide chain. The amino acid change was localized to one of two Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly sequences present in the protein. This sequence has been identified previously near the nucleotide-binding domain of various proteins, but it has not been noted in enzymes that incorporate nucleotide residues. However, other sequences often associated with ATP-binding domains are not found in tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The implications of these findings for our understanding of nucleotide-binding domains are discussed."

An inducible pyridoxine 5'-dehydrogenase (oxidase) (EC 1.1.99.9) that catalyzes conversion of pyridoxine to isopyridoxal, Pyridoxine + X----isopyridoxal + XH2, the first step in utilization of pyridoxine as a growth substrate by this organism, was purified about 520-fold to homogeneity. The enzyme (Mr = 112,000) is a dimer of probably identical subunits and requires FAD (KD(app) = 0.24 microM) as coenzyme. It oxidizes only pyridoxine (Km = 0.18 mM) and a few related compounds (4-deoxypyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal) that contain a free 5-CH2OH group and utilizes oxygen (Km = 0.28 mM), 2,6-dichloroindophenol, or quinones, but not NAD+ or NADP+, as hydrogen acceptors (X in reaction above). With pyridoxine and oxygen as substrates, the enzyme has a broad pH optimum (from pH 7.0 to 8.3), a Vmax of 11.9 mumol X min-1 X mg-1, and a turnover number of 22 s-1 at 25 degrees C. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. Except for its substrate specificity, these properties do not differ greatly from those of other flavin-dependent oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W1599386520,"Two NAD+-dependent, highly specific pyridine-5-aldehyde dehydrogenases, 5-formyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4-carboxylic-acid (Compound 1) dehydrogenase and isopyridoxal dehydrogenase, were purified to homogeneity from Pseudomonas MA-1 and Arthrobacter Cr-7, respectively. Both enzymes are induced in response to growth of the organisms on pyridoxine and catalyze steps in the degradation of this compound by these organisms. Compound 1 dehydrogenase (Mr = 65,000) contains two subunits of equal size with methionine as the NH2-terminal amino acid and acts optimally at pH 7.8-8.5. It catalyzes with equal facility (turnover number = 400-670 s-1 molecule-1) both the oxidation of Compound 1 (Km = 65 microM) by NAD+ (Km = 25 microM) to 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylic acid and the reduction of Compound 1 by NADH (Km = 20 microM) to 4-pyridoxic acid and appears to act as a true dismutase. The possible advantage to the organism of its ability to act as a dismutase is discussed briefly. No oxidation of 4-pyridoxic acid by this enzyme was observed. Isopyridoxal dehydrogenase (Mr = 242,000) contains four subunits of equal size, again with methionine at the NH2 terminus. At its optimal pH of 8.0-8.6, it catalyzes the oxidation of isopyridoxal (Km = 40 microM, turnover number = 10 s-1 molecule-1) by NAD+ (Km = 40 microM) to a mixture of 5-pyridoxic acid and 5-pyridoxolactone, which are produced in constant ratio throughout the course of the reaction. Formation of the two products, although unusual, is readily understandable in terms of the structure of isopyridoxal in solution or the structure of a possible acyl-enzyme intermediate in the oxidative reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2062824685,"When an enzyme-containing complex from yeast was incubated in a buffered solution at room temperature, the valyl-transfer RNA synthetase activity and total protein oscillated synchronously between two physical states.

The two forms of the complex were separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation of one of them in samples withdrawn from the incubated solution every 30 seconds. Glutathione and dithiothreitol in high concentrations (50 mM) enhance formation of the 50% saturated ammonium sulfate-soluble form. Oxidized glutathione, diphosphopyridine nucleotide, triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and a mercurial thiol binding agent in moderate concentrations (0.1 to 1.0 mM) shift the distribution toward the precipitable form. It is suggested that the two forms represent functional and nonfunctional complex-bound enzymes which are interconverted in response to oxidoreductive signals."
https://openalex.org/W1537453899,"The ternary complex consisting of a 65-kDa peptide originating from the proteoglycan core protein and a 43-kDa link protein bound to hyaluronic acid was purified from a clostripain digest of the rat chondrosarcoma aggregating proteoglycan and 14C-carbamylated with potassium [14C]cyanate. At a pH of 8.0, 14C-carbamylation of the alpha-NH2 groups in the N-terminal amino acids was favored over carbamylation of epsilon-NH2 groups in the lysinyl residues for both the 65- and 43-kDa species. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps revealed a single major, distinctly different, fluorographic spot for each. These tryptic peptides had approximate masses of 4.5 kDa (from the 65-kDa species) and 3.0 kDa (from the 43-kDa species) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and each contained greater than 60% of the total radioactivity associated with its original polypeptide. Primary amino acid sequencing of the 65-kDa species gave a defined sequence for the first 4 N-terminal residues, whereas sequencing through the first 4 residues of a fully carbamylated species gave no dabsylated derivative for the first residue but identical residues in position 2-4 as for the noncarbamylated species and loss of radioactive derivative. Digests of 14C-carbamylated ternary complex with alpha-chymotrypsin resulted in a limit 14C-carbamylated 55-kDa species which contained greater than 85% of the radiolabel originally in the 65-kDa peptide. Similarly, trypsin generated two radiolabeled species, 60 and 58 kDa. These limit digest peptides (55, 60, 58 kDa) all contained the 4.5-kDa N-terminal tryptic peptide. Thus peptides removed from the 65-kDa peptide digestion with either alpha-chymotrypsin or trypsin were on the carboxyl end of the molecule."
