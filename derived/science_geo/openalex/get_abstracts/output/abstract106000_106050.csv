https://openalex.org/W2136827845,"The cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) has been implicated in the activation of protein synthesis required for long-term facilitation, a cellular model of memory in Aplysia. Our studies with fear conditioning and with the water maze show that mice with a targeted disruption of the alpha and delta isoforms of CREB are profoundly deficient in long-term memory. In contrast, short-term memory, lasting between 30 and 60 min, is normal. Consistent with models claiming a role for long-term potentiation (LTP) in memory, LTP in hippocampal slices from CREB mutants decayed to baseline 90 min after tetanic stimulation. However, paired-pulse facilitation and posttetanic potentiation are normal. These results implicate CREB-dependent transcription in mammalian long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2076782084,"Consolidated memory after olfactory learning in Drosophila consists of two components, a cycloheximide-sensitive, long-term memory (LTM) and a cycloheximide-insensitive, anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). Using an inducible transgene that expresses a dominant negative member of the fly CREB family, LTM was specifically and completely blocked only after induction, while ARM and learning were unaffected. These results suggest that LTM formation requires de novo gene expression probably mediated by CREB family genes."
https://openalex.org/W2048365283,"The Ikaros gene encodes a family of early hematopoietic- and lymphocyte-restricted transcription factors. Mice homozygous for a germline mutation in the Ikaros DNA-binding domain lack not only T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells but also their earliest defined progenitors. In contrast, the erythroid and myeloid lineages were intact in these mutant mice. We propose that Ikaros promotes differentiation of pluripotential hematopoietic stem cell(s) into the lymphocyte pathways. In the absence of a functional Ikaros gene, these stem cells are exclusively diverted into the erythroid and myeloid lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2023796149,"Behavioral and pharmacological experiments in many animal species have suggested that memory is consolidated from an initial, disruptable form into a long-lasting, stable form within a few hours after training. We combined these traditional approaches with genetic analyses in Drosophila to show that consolidated memory of conditioned (learned) odor avoidance 1 day after extended training consisted of two genetically distinct, functionally independent memory components: anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) and long-term memory (LTM). ARM decayed away within 4 days, was resistant to hypothermic disruption, was insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CXM), and was disrupted by the radish single-gene mutation. LTM showed no appreciable decay over 7 days, was sensitive to CXM, and was not disrupted by the radish mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2002652075,"A null mutation was generated in the mouse RXR alpha gene by targeted disruption. Growth deficiency occurred in heterozygote mice. Null mutants died in utero and displayed myocardial and ocular malformations. These malformations belong to the fetal vitamin A deficiency syndrome, supporting the idea that RXR alpha is involved in retinoid signaling in vivo. A phenotypic synergy was observed when the RXR alpha mutation was introduced into RAR alpha or RAR gamma mutant backgrounds: RXR alpha null mutants and RXR alpha +/-/RAR gamma-/- double mutants displayed similar ocular defects, which became more severe in RXR alpha-/-/RAR gamma+/- and RXR alpha-/-/RAR gamma-/- mutants. Furthermore, RXR alpha/RAR double mutants exhibited several malformations not seen in single mutants. This functional convergence strongly suggests that RXR alpha/RAR heterodimers mediate retinoid signaling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1981283223,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) binds several cellular proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that RB bound specifically to the protein BRG1. BRG1 shares extensive sequence similarity to Drosophila brahma, an activator of homeotic gene expression, and the yeast transcriptional activator SNF2/SW12. BRG1 contains an RB-binding motif found in viral oncoproteins and bound to the A/B pocket and the hypophosphorylated form of RB. BRG1 did not bind RB in viral oncoprotein-transformed cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggested BRG1 associates with the RB family in vivo. In the human carcinoma cell line SW13, BRG1 exhibited tumor suppressor activity by inducing formation of flat, growth-arrested cells. This activity depended on the ability of BRG1 to cooperate and complex with RB, as both an RB-nonbinding mutant of BRG1 and the sequestration of RB by adenovirus E1A protein abolished flat cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W2008792865,"Memory storage has a short-term phase that depends on preexisting proteins and a long-term phase that requires new protein and RNA synthesis. Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is thought to contribute to memory storage. Consistent with this idea, a cellular representation of these phases has been demonstrated in NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. By contrast, little is known about the NMDA receptor-independent LTP of the mossy fiber pathway. We find that mossy fiber LTP also has phases. Only late phase is blocked by protein and RNA synthesis inhibitors, but both phases are blocked by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and both are stimulated by forskolin and Sp-cAMPS. During early phase, paired-pulse facilitation is occluded. This occlusion decays with the onset of late phase, consistent with its using a different mechanism. Thus, although Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber pathways use very different mechanisms for early phase, both use a cAMP-mediated mechanism for late phase."
https://openalex.org/W2061587634,"Irradiation of HeLa cells with short-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC) induces the modification and activation of the preexisting transcription factors c-Fos-c-Jun (AP-1) and TCF/EIk-1, as well as the protein synthesis independent transcriptional activation of the c-fos and c-jun genes. This response to UVC is mediated via obligatory cytoplasmic signal transduction, involving Ras and Raf, Src, and MAP kinases. The UVC response is inhibited by prior down-modulation of growth factor receptor signaling upon growth factor prestimulation, by suramin (an inhibitor of receptor activation) or by expression of a dominant negative epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor mutant. These data suggest the involvement of several growth factor receptors in the UVC response. Indeed, UVC induces the suramin-inhibitable immediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2009558707,"We showed previously that coactivators mediating stimulation by different activators were associated with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) in distinct TFIID complexes. We have characterized a human TBP-associated factor (TAF), hTAFII30, associated with a subset of TFIID complexes. hTAFII30 interacts with the AF-2-containing region E of the human estrogen receptor (ER), but not with ER AF-1 or VP16. An antibody against hTAFII30 inhibited transcriptional stimulation by the ER AF-2 without affecting basal or VP16-activated transcription and allowed the separation of TFIID complex(es) containing hTAFII30 from complexes mediating the activity of VP16. These results directly demonstrate the existence of functionally distinct TFIID populations that share common TAFIIs but differ in specific TAFIIs."
https://openalex.org/W1998671864,"We previously reported that transcriptional regulators can bind selected TAF subunits of the TFIID complex. However, the specificity and function of individual TAFs in mediating transcriptional activation remained unknown. Here we report the in vitro assembly and transcriptional properties of TBP-TAF complexes reconstituted from the nine recombinant subunits of Drosophila TFIID. A minimal complex containing TBP and TAFII250 directs basal but not activator-responsive transcription. By contrast, reconstituted holo-TFIID supports activation by an assortment of activators. The activator NTF-1, which binds TAFII150, stimulates transcription with a complex containing only TBP, TAFII250, and TAFII150, whereas Sp1 binds and additionally requires TAFII110 for activation. Interestingly, TAFII150 enhances Sp1 activation even though this subunit does not bind directly to Sp1. These results establish that specific subcomplexes of TFIID can mediate activation by different classes of activators and suggest that TAFs perform multiple functions during activation."
https://openalex.org/W1557678369,"The responses of lymphocytes to six CC chemokines--MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES--were studied using cloned human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. All CC chemokines tested induced migration of both types of lymphocytes, whereas two CXC chemokines used as controls, IL-8 and IP-10, were inactive. The monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3) showed a typically bimodal concentration dependence, and were considerably more effective than MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, or RANTES. All CC chemokines also induced a rapid and transient rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ in either type of T cell. The rise was prevented by Bordetella pertussis toxin treatment, indicating that G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in signaling. It was most pronounced with MCP-1 and MCP-3, which is in agreement with the efficacy of these chemokines as chemoattractants. The responses to MCP-2, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES were weaker, and no changes were obtained on stimulation with IL-8 or IP-10. Freshly isolated human blood lymphocytes were also tested, but neither migration nor Ca2+ changes were observed. Low numbers of high-affinity receptors for MCP-1 were found on CD4+ and CD8+ cells ( < 900 per cell, Kd < 1 nM), and desensitization experiments showed that MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-3 share receptors. Owing to their superior effectiveness on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the monocyte chemotactic proteins could play a major role in the recruitment of activated T lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2071818252,"We isolated two S. pombe genes, scd1 and scd2, that are required for normal morphology and mating. scd1 and scd2 are homologous to CDC24 and BEM1, respectively, of S. cerevisiae. Epistasis analyses indicate that scd2 and ras1 converge upon scd1, which, in turn, interacts with cdc42sp, a RHO-like GTPase. Studies with the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that scd2 forms complexes with both scd1 and cdc42sp. Furthermore, biochemical studies indicate that the interaction between scd1 and scd2 is direct. The yeast two-hybrid data further suggest that scd1, scd2, cdc42sp, and ras1, in its GTP-bound state, act cooperatively to form a protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1505147288,"Affinities of long chain fatty acids (FA) for fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) have been measured by monitoring the concentrations of the unbound or free fatty acids (FFA) in equilibrium with the FABPs using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB. This probe allows the measurement of the concentration of FFA in equilibrium with FABPs, without physical separation of any of the reactants. Equilibrium characteristics were measured at 37 degrees C for palmitate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, and arachidonate binding to six FABPs from intestine, heart, adipose, and liver from different species. Equilibrium constants for each FA were found to be extremely sensitive to the tissue origin of the FABP but largely independent of species differences. The measured values of the dissociation constants (Kd) ranged from about 2 to 1000 nM, depending upon the tissue origin of the FABP and the FA. Binding constants for some FABPs varied considerably with different FA, as much as 80-fold in the case of the intestinal FABP. In contrast, Kd values for adipocyte FABPs exhibited less than 4-fold variation with FA type and are generally larger (lower affinities) than for the other FABPs. For all FABPs, Kd values for fatty acids with the same chain length were considerably lower for saturated as compared to polyunsaturated FA. This characteristic likely reflects the lower aqueous solubilities of the saturated fatty acids. In contrast to the other FABPs, rat liver FABP was found to have two FA-binding sites/monomer. Each of these two sites had similar high affinities for the saturated FA, while for the unsaturated FA the two sites exhibited affinities that differ by more than 7-fold. This study disagrees with earlier investigations in finding that equilibrium binding of FA to FABPs is a sensitive function of FA type and FABP tissue origin and that FA-FABP dissociation constants are submicromolar. These results provide a framework with which to understand better the biological function of FABPs and the FA-FABP interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2018274938,"Activation of the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway elicits the induction of genes via activators binding to cAMP-responsive elements (CREs). Nuclear factor CRE modulator (CREM) is activated by PKA-mediated phosphorylation on a serine at position 117. We show that Ser-117 is also phosphorylated by the mitogenactivated p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) in vitro. Activation of cellular p70S6K by serum factors enhances Ser-117 phosphorylation and CREM transactivation. Coexpression of p70S6K significantly increases transactivation by a GAL4-CREM fusion. The macrolide rapamycin, a potent and specific inhibitor of p70S6K in vivo, completely blocks CREM activation induced by serum and by p70S6K. Thus, CREM constitutes a target for mitogenic signaling through p70S6K and may acts as a nuclear effector in which transduction pathways may converge and cross-talk."
https://openalex.org/W1547782179,"A carboxylic acid residue is conserved at the cytoplasmic border of the third transmembrane segment among nearly all G protein-coupled receptors. In the visual receptor rhodopsin, replacement of the conserved Glu134 by a neutral glutamine results in enhanced transducin activation. Here we show that a key event in forming the active state of rhodopsin is proton uptake by Glu134 in the metarhodopsin II (MII) photoproduct. Site-directed mutants E134D and E134Q were studied by flash photolysis, where formation rates of their photoproducts and rates of pH change could be monitored simultaneously. Both mutants showed normal MII formation rates. However, E134D displayed a slowed rate of proton uptake and E134Q displayed a loss of light-induced uptake of two protons from the aqueous phase. Thus, Glu134 mediates light-dependent proton uptake by MII. We propose that receptor activation requires a light-induced conformational change that allows protonation of Glu134 and subsequent protonation of a second group. The strong conservation of Glu134 in G protein-coupled receptors implies a general requirement for a proton acceptor group at this position to allow light- or ligand-dependent receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W2149631006,"We have characterized easily shocked (eas), a Drosophila ""band-sensitive"" paralytic mutant. Electrophysiological recordings from flight muscles in the giant fiber pathway of adult eas flies reveal that induction of paralysis with electrical stimulation results in a brief seizure, followed by a failure of the muscles to respond to giant fiber stimulation. Molecular cloning, germline transformation, and biochemical experiments show that eas mutants are defective in the gene for ethanolamine kinase, which is required for a pathway of phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis. Assays of phospholipid composition reveal that total phosphatidylethanolamine is decreased in eas mutants. The data suggest that eas bang sensitivity is due to an excitability defect caused by altered membrane phospholipid composition."
https://openalex.org/W2159403435,"X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an inherited human immunodeficiency disease, characterized by an arrest in B-cell development, which results in a dramatic decrease in immunoglobulin production. The gene product defective in XLA has been identified as a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, named Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). The dramatic XLA phenotype indicates a critical role for Btk in the regulation of B-cell development. However, neither external stimuli leading to Btk activation nor any of its in vivo substrates have thus far been identified, and the mechanism of disease induction remains unexplained. We report here that stimulation of the B-cell antigen receptor (membrane immunoglobulin) on mature B-cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk in vivo, accompanied by an increase in its kinase activity in vitro. These results place Btk in the B-cell receptor signal transduction pathway, which is known to be essential in driving B-cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1522400918,"We have used the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain to screen two phage-displayed random peptide libraries, each containing 2 x 10(8) unique members, and have identified a series of high affinity peptide ligands. The peptides possess similar proline-rich regions, which yield a consensus Src SH3-binding motif of RPLPPLP. We have confirmed this motif by screening a phage-displayed peptide library biased for SH3 ligands and identifying the same consensus sequence. Binding studies using synthetic peptides suggest that the RPLPPLP motif is important for SH3 binding and confers specificity for the Src SH3 domain, and that residues which flank the motif may also contribute to binding. Peptides that contain the RPLPPLP motif compete Src, but not Abl or phospholipase C gamma, SH3 interactions with SH3-binding proteins from cell lysates (IC50 = 1-5 microM). Furthermore, RPLPPLP-related peptides are able to accelerate progesterone-induced maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. A similar acceleration has been observed in oocytes treated with activated, but not normal, Xenopus Src, suggesting the possibility that the peptides are able to antagonize the negative regulation of Src activity by Src SH3 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1490624051,"We report a novel approach for specific in vivo inactivation of the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase and suppression of ErbB-2-induced transformation. Genes encoding single chain antibodies that specifically bind to the extracellular domain of human ErbB-2 were constructed and expressed intracellularly in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts transformed by activated ErbB-2. The single chain antibodies are derived from monoclonal antibodies FRP5 and FWP51 (Harwerth, I.M., Wels, W., Marte, B. M., and Hynes, N. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 15160-15167) and are composed of heavy and light chain variable domains connected by a flexible peptide linker. The antibodies were provided with: 1) an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence to target their synthesis to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and 2) a C-terminal retention signal to prevent secretion. When expressed in ErbB-2-transformed cells, the single chain antibodies bound to the receptor and prevented its transit through the endoplasmic reticulum. This resulted in the functional inactivation of the receptor and reversion of the transformed phenotype. This is the first demonstration of a targeted and stable inactivation of a cellular oncoprotein via intracellular antibody expression. The use of such a strategy represents a simple and powerful approach to study the in vivo function of receptors and other cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1491028479,"A phage display library was constructed in the filamentous bacteriophage fuse5. The library was made by inserting a degenerate oligonucleotide which encodes 15 variable amino acids into the NH2-terminal region of the phage gene III protein. This library, containing over 10(7) different phage, was screened with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the Src homology 3 (Src SH3) domain and a protein kinase A phosphorylation site (GST/PKA/Src SH3). A family of proline-rich sequences was isolated following four cycles of enrichment and amplification. Phage containing these sequences were shown to specifically bind to the GST/PKA/Src SH3 protein but not to GST/PKA only. A comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence of the different phage clones revealed a consensus sequence, RPLPXXP, which conforms to a Src SH3 domain binding motif identified independently during an affinity screen of a lambda-lox mouse embryo cDNA library using a 32P-labeled Src SH3 protein fragment as the probe (Y. Ivashchenko, manuscript in preparation). Peptides based upon the 7-amino acid SH3 binding domain core motif displayed strong binding to both the Src and to the Fyn SH3 domains, but failed to bind to the SH3 domain of p21 Ras-GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP) and other proteins. We anticipate that further screening of the phage display library will be a useful tool for the rapid identification of additional SH3 domain binding sequences and will also help to establish the essential core motifs that define the specificity of interactions among the diverse proteins containing SH3 domains and those containing SH3 binding motifs."
https://openalex.org/W1497910723,"Oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) elicit in cultured lymphoblastoid cell lines a delayed and sustained calcium rise followed by a progressive of DNA fragmentation, endogenous proteolysis, and morphological features of necrosis and apoptosis. All these events were blocked by chelating the calcium of the culture medium by EGTA, thus suggesting that the two types of cell death induced by oxidized LDL (necrosis and apoptosis) were subsequent to the rise in calcium. The protease inhibitors leupeptin and antipain were able to block (at least in part) the endogenous proteolysis and the necrotic process, but exhibited no effect on apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. At the opposite, aurintricarboxylic acid and spermine (inhibitors of DNA degradation by endonucleases) inhibit DNA fragmentation and morphological apoptosis, but not endogenous proteolysis and necrosis. These data suggest that cell death induced by oxidized LDL occurs through two calcium-dependent processes triggering 1) on one hand, proteolysis and subsequently necrosis characterized by the loss of cell membrane integrity; and 2) on the other hand, internucleosomal DNA cleavage and subsequently morphological apoptosis. The RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors, actinomycin D and cycloheximide, were completely ineffective in preventing endogenous proteolysis, DNA fragmentation, necrosis, and apoptosis induced by oxidized LDL. The subclassification of the type of apoptosis elicited by oxidized LDL is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1481643702,"Evi-1 is a gene, encoding a zinc finger protein, associated with a common viral integration site in murine leukemias. It is suggested that Evi-1 plays important roles in embryogenesis and transformation of myeloid cells. To elucidate mechanisms by which Evi-1 induces such biological effects, we analyzed the relationship between Evi-1 and AP-1 which could regulate cellular proliferation and differentiation. When Evi-1 was expressed, transactivation through a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-responsive element was observed in NIH3T3 and P19 cells. Evi-1-transfected P19 cells showed some differentiated phenotypes and increased expression of endogenous c-Jun and c-Fos. These results indicate that Evi-1 raises AP-1 activity. Evi-1 caused stimulation of the c-fos promoter transactivation, which seems to be a main mechanism of AP-1 activation, through at least two portions of the promoter. Evi-1 has the first zinc finger domain at the N terminus and the second zinc finger domain near the C-terminus. We constructed deletion mutants of Evi-1 and investigated the functions of these domains. It was shown that the second zinc finger domain is essential for the activation of AP-1 and transactivation of the c-fos promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1659923393,"In the accompanying paper (Zaidi, S. H. E., Denman, R., and Malter, J. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24000-24006) we demonstrate that in tumor and normal cells, multiple cytosolic proteins interact with a 29-base sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA. These data suggested that APP gene expression may be modulated by regulated APP mRNA decay. We have investigated this prediction by measuring the decay rates of APP mRNA in resting and mitogen-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and H4 and K562 tumor cell lines. In resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells, APP mRNA decayed with a half-life of 4 h. Under these conditions, the activity of APP mRNA-binding proteins was not detectable. After activation, binding protein activities were induced, and APP mRNA decay was blocked with a half-life of > 12 h. In log phase neuronal or lymphoid tumor cell lines, binding activity was constitutively present and APP mRNA displayed a half-life of > 12 h. Protein synthesis inhibition by cycloheximide had no effect on APP mRNA decay in normal or tumor cells. Transfected wild type or mutant APP mRNAs that lacked the 29-base region were stable (t1/2 > 10 h) in K562 tumor cells. Therefore, we conclude that the 29-base region functions in cis to destabilize APP mRNA in resting, normal cells. Upon activation APP mRNA-binding proteins are induced, interact with the 29-base region, and likely participate in stabilization of the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2018887997,"The expression of the D. melanogaster transcription factor Jun in the eye imaginal disc correlates temporally and spatially with the determination of neuronal photoreceptor fate. Expression of dominant negative forms of Jun in photoreceptor precursor cells results in dose-dependent loss of photoreceptors in the adult fly. Conversely, localized overexpression of Jun in the eye imaginal disc can induce the differentiation of additional photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, the transformation of nonneuronal cone cells into R7 neurons elicited by constitutively active forms of sevenless, Ras1, Raf, and MAP kinase is relieved in the presence of Jun mutants. These results demonstrate a requirement of Jun downstream of the sevenless/ras signaling pathway for neuronal development in the Drosophila eye."
https://openalex.org/W1481413807,"A series of analogs of omega-conotoxin GVIA, a peptide neurotoxin having 27 amino acid residues with three disulfide bridges, were synthesized by replacing each amino acid residue except for Cys and Hyp with Ala. CD spectra were virtually identical between native and all of the analogs, indicating the overall conformations were not changed by the substitutions. The inhibitory effects of these analogs on 125I-omega-conotoxin GVIA binding to chick brain synaptic plasma membranes showed that replacement of Tyr13 with Ala drastically lowered the affinity of the toxin to the N-type Ca2+ channel. Substitution of Tyr13 with Phe also showed reduction of the affinity, indicating that the hydroxyl group of Tyr13 is critical for binding. Since Lys2 is also important for binding (Sato, K. Park, N.-G., Kohno, T. Maeda, T., Kim, J.-I., Kato, R., and Takahashi, M. (1993) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 194, 1292-1296), we propose a two-point binding model in which Tyr13 and Lys2 interact with specific amino acid residues of the Ca2+ channel through hydrogen bonding and ionic interaction, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1519060218,"In vitro decay of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA was examined on polysomes prepared from normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with phorbol ester (TPA) and phytohemagglutinin for 14 h. GM-CSF mRNA decayed with a half-life of 90 min while 18 S rRNA was stable. RNA gel mobility assay performed on crude cytosolic lysate (S20) with radiolabeled AUUUA containing RNA identified a 42-kDa RNA-protein complex on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The binding specificity was identical to that of the previously described adenosine-uridine binding factor (AUBF) (Malter, J. S. (1989) Science 246, 664-666). Further fractionation of the S20 cytosol through a sucrose gradient showed > 90% of AUBF activity associated with polysomes and 95% of polysome-associated AUBF. A decay system thus depleted of AUBF activity also showed accelerated decay of GM-CSF mRNA (t1/2 = 20 min). These data show that AUBF is preferentially located on polysomes and that its removal destabilizes GM-CSF mRNA. Therefore, AUBF likely prevents GM-CSF mRNA decay by binding to the AUUUA instability determinants in the 3'-untranslated region."
https://openalex.org/W1522219122,"1 alpha, 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) rapidly (within seconds) shifts the threshold for activation of inward calcium currents to more negative and physiological potentials. To determine whether the opening of calcium channels in bone cells is mediated by the cytosolic 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR), several natural metabolites 1,25-D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and synthetic analogs 25-hydroxy-16,23E-diene D3 (HO), 25-hydroxy-23-yne D3 (Y), and 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxy-16-ene-23-yne-26,27-F6 D3 (EO) were tested on dihydropyridine-sensitive inward barium currents. In order to probe the structural specificity at the 1 position of the steroid for stimulation of barium currents, we used several synthetic 1-(1'-hydroxyethyl) (NP, ON, NN, OP) and 1-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 analogs (14w-1 alpha and 14-w1 beta). Using the perforated patch-clamp technique, we found that the naturally occurring vitamin D3 analogs gave nearly the same rank order potency for stimulation of barium currents as their affinity for VDR with 1,25-D3 being the most potent analog. Using the synthetic analogs which have minimal affinity for VDR, we found that the compounds without 1-OH group but with additional double bonds in positions 16 and 23 or with a triple bond in position 23 retained high affinity for calcium channel activation. Furthermore, 1-hydroxyethyl-25-hydroxyvitamin D3R isomers at the 1' position had greater affinity than the S isomers at this position, and a beta oriented 2'-hydroxyethyl group gave the homolog greater affinity than did the alpha-oriented 2'-hydroxyethyl group. The fact that these synthetic analogs cause rapid effects on calcium channels and show pharmacological specificity different from the binding to the cytosolic vitamin D3 receptor suggests that calcium influx is mediated by a distinct signal transduction pathway. The high and physiological affinity of 1,25-D3 (50 pM) suggests that it is a biological regulator of calcium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1585955983,"The expression of polymerase delta (pol delta) during the cell cycle was studied in Molt 4 cells separated by counter-flow centrifugal elutriation. Northern blotting showed that pol delta mRNA levels increased by 3-fold at the G1/S border. Levels of pol delta protein determined by Western blotting also peaked at the G1/S border with qualitatively similar changes as the mRNA levels. Thus, pol delta gene expression appears to be regulated during the cell cycle at the transcriptional level. The mRNA half-life for pol delta was determined to be about 8 h and the protein half-life about 10 h. Parallel examination of the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen showed that the mRNA levels also increased about 2-fold at the G1/S border, while the protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen increased steadily through the whole cell cycle period, and remained high at G2/M. Analysis of pol alpha expression showed qualitatively similar behavior as pol delta, but the magnitude of the changes were higher. Pulse labeling of cells metabolically arrested in G1,S, or G2/M with 32Pi showed that pol delta is a phosphoprotein and that it is most actively phosphorylated during the S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2154409881,"One region of marked sequence diversity among the highly homologous alpha isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase is the lysine-rich NH2 terminus. Expression of a mutant cDNA encoding an alpha 1 protein, minus the 32 NH2-terminal residues, results in a modified enzyme (alpha 1M32), which behaves similarly to alpha 1 in overall Na/K exchange activity (Vmax) and apparent affinities for intracellular Na+ and extracellular K+. However, with membranes isolated from HeLa cells expressing the rat alpha 1M32 mutant, as well as membranes from cells expressing the rat alpha 1 and the ouabain-resistant mutated forms of rat alpha 2 (alpha 2*) and alpha 3 (alpha 3*) developed by Jewell and Lingrel (Jewell, E. A., and Lingrel, J. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16925-16930), distinct Na,K-ATPase kinetics are observed. Thus, at 1 microM ATP, the effects of K+ on the Na-ATPase activity of alpha 2* and alpha 1M32 are similar; both are activated, whereas alpha 1 and alpha 3 are inhibited by the addition of K+ at low (0.1 mM) concentration. These effects are attributed to different rates of a step involved in K+ deocclusion (E2(K) E1K E1 + K+) and are consistent with our earlier evidence (Wierzbicki, W., and Blostein, R. (1993) Proc.

These differences are not directly related to differences in apparent affinities for ATP, since alpha 3* has alpha 1-like high affinity K+ inhibition but resembles alpha 2* and alpha 1M32 with respect to a lower K'ATP. Na-ATPase activities of alpha 2*, alpha 3*, and alpha 1M32, but not alpha 1, are activated by Li+ but not Rb+, consistent with a relatively faster rate of Li+ deocclusion (Post, R. L., Hegyvary, C., and Kume, S. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6530-6540), as well as higher affinity of alpha 3 for extracellular K+ (Li+) activation of dephosphorylation (E2P + K+ E2(K) + Pi). Inhibition of Na-ATPase by higher concentrations (> or = 1 mM) K+ is observed with all isoforms and is attributed to K+ acting at inhibitory cytoplasmic sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1564159653,"Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease results from dysregulated production and deposition of beta-amyloid in the central nervous system. beta-Amyloid is derived from proteolytic processing of one of multiple amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms. The production of APP in many somatic tissues and tumor cell lines provides a more accessible model to study the regulation of APP gene expression. Recent data suggest that APP mRNAs accumulate in activated lymphocytes and neuronal tumor lines. We are interested in defining the contribution of alterations in stability to changes in steady-state APP mRNA levels in these model systems. Herein we demonstrate by mobility shift assay that the 3'-untranslated region of APP RNAs which contain a contiguous 29-base region interacts in vitro with multiple mRNA-binding proteins found in cytosolic lysates prepared from normal and transformed human cells. UV cross-linking of radiolabeled APP RNAs to cytosolic protein extracts followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified six distinct RNA-protein complexes of 42, 47, 65, 73, 84, and 104 kDa. Competition assays with APP, AU-rich, or irrelevant RNAs demonstrated that binding was specific and in some cases preferential for AU- or U-rich sequences by which we tentatively place the binding site of the proteins along the 29-base region. APP mRNA-binding proteins were constitutively active in all tumor lines examined as well as at diminished levels in whole human brain cytosolic lysates. The core element is AU-rich and highly conserved between human and some murine APP mRNAs. In the accompanying paper (Zaidi, S. H. E. and Malter, J. S. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24007-24013) we show that this 29-base element in the 3'-untranslated region regulates the stability of APP mRNA. Cumulatively these data suggest that steady-state APP mRNA levels are modulated by cytosolic protein-RNA interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1505885159,"Insulin action on fat cell/skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT4) redistribution to cell surface membranes appears to involve small GTP-binding proteins. It has been recently recognized that at least two GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) isoforms, GDI-1 and GDI-2, can bind and release GDP-bound Rab proteins from membranes (Shisheva, A., Sudhof, T.C., and Czech, M. P. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 3459-3468). The present studies show that a strikingly higher level of GDI-2 fractionates with total membranes of COS-1 cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to GDI-1, which is virtually totally cytosolic. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, most of the membrane-bound GDI-2 was present in a low density, intracellular membrane fraction. Immunodepletion of GLUT4-enriched vesicles from this membrane fraction also depleted significant amounts of GDI-2 proteins. Localization of both GDI-2 and GLUT4 in the same perinuclear regions of these cells was established by immunofluorescence microscopy, whereas GDI-1 displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution. Insulin acutely decreased both GLUT4 and GDI-2 protein levels in the low density microsomes by about 50%. Concomitantly, GLUT4 but not GDI-2 protein content of plasma membranes increased, suggesting release of GDI-2 into the cytoplasm in response to insulin. Taken together, these data suggest functional differences for the GDI-1 and GDI-2 protein isoforms, as well as a potential role of GDI-2 in the action of insulin on membrane movements."
https://openalex.org/W1606091578,"A recently cloned rat kidney protein (NBAT) mediates the sodium-independent transport of neutral as well as basic amino acids and cystine when expressed in Xenopus lacvis oocytes. The human equivalent of this transporter may be the one that is defective in cystinuria. Immunocytochemical studies have indicated that NBAT is primarily localized in the brush border membranes of rat kidney and intestinal epithelial cells, a localization consistent with its proposed role in amino acid transport. Two contrasting topological models have been proposed for NBAT: a four membrane-spanning domain (MSD) Nin-Cin model and a single MSD Nin-Cout model. We have investigated the topology of this membrane protein using two different approaches. One method was an immunofluorescent labeling technique in which intact or membrane-permeabilized cells expressing NBAT were probed with antibodies directed against putative extracellular and intracellular domains of the protein. In the second method, fragments generated by limited surface proteolysis of intact brush border membrane vesicles were subjected to immunoblot analysis using several site-specific antibodies. Both approaches yielded results consistent with a four MSD Nin-Cin topological model for NBAT.—Mosckovitz, R., Udenfriend, S., Felix, A., Heimer, E., Tate, S. S.

https://openalex.org/W1508035475,"Amphiphatic alpha-helices are the lipid-binding motif in many apolipoproteins. Two model peptides, namely Asp-Trp-Leu-Lys-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Glu-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Ala-Phe (18A) and Lys-Trp-Leu-Asp-Ala-Phe-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Val-Ala-Lys-Glu-Leu-Glu-Lys-Ala- Phe (18R), have been synthesized previously to mimic the structural and functional properties of apolipoprotein A-1. Here a quantitative thermodynamic analysis of the binding process of 18A and 18R to neutral and negatively charged lipid membranes is provided. Peptide 18A has a higher lipid affinity than 18R, and both peptides bind better to mixed 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-glycero-phosphocholine-1- palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-sn-glycero-phosphoglycerol (POPC/POPG) bilayers than to pure POPC bilayers. At lipid-to-peptide ratios > 100, the binding of 18A and 18R to phospholipid bilayers can be described by an apparent surface partition equilibrium with binding constants in the range of 40-900 M-1. At high peptide concentrations, the membrane affinity of 18A and 18R increases dramatically. NMR studies provide evidence that peptide-peptide interactions make additional contributions to the binding energy. A cooperative binding model is developed to describe the binding process over the whole concentration range. The cooperativity parameter sigma is identical for 18A and 18R yielding a peptide-peptide interaction energy of about -2.4 kcal/mol. The free energy of membrane insertion is about -6.5 kcal/mol for 18A and -5.5 kcal/mol for 18R. The binding reaction is driven by the hydrophobic surface energy which is partially balanced by the loss in translational and rotational degrees of freedom. A molecular analysis of the free energy of binding predicts a 40-60% insertion of the peptides into the hydrophobic membrane environment. Deuterium and phosphorus solid state NMR were used to monitor the influence of 18A and 18R on the long range and short range order of the phospholipids. The spectra are characteristic of fluid-like lipid bilayers and provide no evidence for the formation of discoidal particles. However, both peptides change the conformation of the phosphocholine dipoles, moving the N+ end of the latter toward the water phase. The rotation of the -P-N+ dipoles is due to the interaction of the phospholipids with the positive charges on 18A and 18R, with 18A being more effective than 18R. For 18R the NMR data predict a pK shift and a partial charge neutralization of the carboxylate groups located at the edge of the polar/nonpolar interface."
https://openalex.org/W1646710518,"The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene is parentally imprinted in the mouse and human species. By following the inheritance of natural polymorphisms of IGF-II mRNA, we demonstrated that the tissue-specific parental imprinting of the IGF-II gene is conserved in the rat. The expression of the paternal IGF-II allele exceeded by more than 3 orders of magnitude that of the maternal allele in livers of 3-day-old Wistar x Fisher interstrain rat crosses. In contrast, the two alleles were both expressed in the rat central nervous system, which is also the only district of the organism where this gene is active in adult rodents. We also analyzed the allelic usage of the three IGF-II promoters, which generate alternatively spliced transcripts, and showed that parental imprinting of all transcription starts sites is coordinately regulated since P1, P2, and P3 are all repressed on the maternal allele in neonatal rat liver, and all of them are activated on both alleles in the choroid plexus of the central nervous system. RNase protection assays demonstrated that the activity ratio of the three IGF-II promoters can be different in tissues that show the same imprinting mode."
https://openalex.org/W1512153592,"Previously we have found that binding of the nonpeptide substance P antagonist, CP 96,345, to the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor was critically dependent on two short segments adjacent to the top of transmembrane segments (TM) V and VI, called segments A (residues 183-195) and D (residues 271-276), respectively. In the present study we have systematically performed substitutions of nonconserved residues within these two segments with residues from the homologous NK-3 and/or NK-2 receptor. In segment A, deletion of residues Glu193 and Lys194, which are not present in the NK-3 receptor, or substituting them with leucines as in the NK-2 receptor, decreased the affinity of CP 96,345 10- and 22-fold, respectively. Surprisingly, switching the position of Glu193 and Lys194 did not affect the affinity of CP 96,345, suggesting that, rather than interacting directly with CP 96,345, an interaction of these residues with one another is important for CP 96,345 binding. In segment D substitution of Tyr272 with threonine as in the NK-2 receptor and with alanine as in the NK-3 receptor decreased the affinity of CP 96,345 7- and 24-fold, respectively. Mutation of the preceding Pro271 to glycine alone did not affect CP 96,345 binding, but, combined with the mutation of Tyr272 to threonine, the affinity decreased 28-fold. A series of CP 96,345 analogues with modifications of the major chemical moieties exhibited equally reduced affinity as that of CP 96,345 for the Tyr272- and Lys193-Glu194-substituted constructs, except CP 95,555, which lacks one of the phenyl rings in the benzhydryl group and which was almost unaffected by these mutations. In conclusion, our data indicate a direct interaction between CP 96,345 and Tyr272, which are located at the top of TM VI likely in close spatial proximity to the previously identified interaction point, His197, at the top of the adjacent TM V. Furthermore, the data demonstrated a critical involvement in CP 96,345 binding of Lys193 and Glu194 located one alpha-helical turn above His197."
https://openalex.org/W1767325671,"We have explored the mechanisms involved in the induction of five stress-response genes (heme oxygenase [HO], c-fos, Egr-1, gadd153, and HSP70) in human diploid fibroblasts growth-arrested by treatment with the antiproliferative prostaglandin A2 (PGA2). The kinetics of c-fos and Egr-1 induction were found to be rapid with maximum expression occurring within 60 min of treatment, whereas maximum expression of HO, gadd153, and HSP70 occurred between 4 and 8 h of treatment. Nuclear run-on assays and measurements of mRNA clearance in the presence of actinomycin D demonstrated that increases in both the rates of gene transcription and/or mRNA stability contribute to the genetic response to PGA2. Although the mechanisms responsible for increasing the mRNA levels differ for the individual genes, additional experiments provided evidence that alterations in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels were important in initiating the genetic response to PGA2. PGA2 treatment resulted in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i with the dose-response relationship for Ca2+ mobilization consistent with that seen for the induction of all five genes. [Ca2+]i chelators that attenuate Ca2+ mobilization by PGA2 also blocked the mRNA induction by PGA2 treatment. Density-inhibited confluent cells were less responsive than proliferating subconfluent cells with respect to Ca2+ mobilization after PGA2 treatment. This was correlated with a lower level of gene induction. These studies support the hypothesis that increased Ca2+ mobilization is an early and central event in the signal transduction pathway (or pathways) mediating the activation of genes in response to PGA2 treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1489329243,"Hepoxilins A3 and B3 have previously been shown to be formed from 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) through a heat-insensitive ferriheme catalysis as indicated by experiments with hemin or hemoglobin, typical of nonenzymatic rearrangement (Pace-Asciak, C. R. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 793, 485-488; Pace-Asciak, C. R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8332-8337). In this paper, we demonstrate through use of a mixture of (12S)- and (12R)-HPETE that an enzyme system exists in the rat pineal gland that selectively utilizes (12S)-HPETE for the transformation into A3, while the hemin-catalyzed transformation is not selective, with both (12S)- and (12R)-HPETE being utilized. A new procedure was established to rapidly extract (in the absence of acid) and directly derivatize from the incubation mixture the products of incubation using 9-anthryldiazomethane reagent to form the 9-anthryldiazomethane derivatives of the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hepoxilins and trioxilins, which could be detected by high performance liquid chromatography using a flow-through fluorescence detector. The following observations were made: 1) the pineal experiments showed a high preference for the formation of A3 with minor amounts of B3, while experiments with heme catalysis showed formation of both hepoxilins B3 and A3; 2) chiral phase analysis of the HETEs recovered from the incubation mixture showed the predominance of (12R)-HETE from the pineal experiments, indicating that (12S)-HPETE was selectively used up, whereas both (12S)- and (12R)-HPETE were utilized in the hemin experiments; 3) chiral phase analysis of A3 indicated the presence in the pineal experiments of only with the 11S,12S-configuration formed from (12S)-HPETE, while the hemin experiments contained both the native 11S,12S-configuration as well as the unnative or bis-epi-11R,12R-configuration in the epoxide group of A3; 4) reverse phase analysis of the epoxide hydrolase product of A3, i.e. trioxilin A3, showed that the pineal experiments contained only the products of enzymatic hydrolysis derived from the native A3, whose formation was inhibited by the epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, trichloropropene oxide. The pineal system is heat-sensitive, with formation of hepoxilins being abolished by tissue boiling, while the hemin system is insensitive to boiling. These experiments demonstrate that A3 formation in the pineal gland utilizes (12S)-HPETE exclusively, being transformed by a hepoxilin synthase primarily into A3."
https://openalex.org/W1842320575,"A mutant human hemoglobin, beta (V1M+H2 delta), has been constructed. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves obtained at pH 8.3, where the Bohr effect is inoperative, indicates that this mutation results in an additional stabilization of the T-state conformation by 0.9 kcal/mol. The crystal structure of deoxy-beta (V1M+H2 delta) has been determined to 2.2-A resolution and compared with the deoxy structure of human hemoglobin at the same resolution. In human hemoglobin, a sulfate anion is anchored to the beta-chains by a complex network of H-bonds and electrostatic interactions with the amino terminus and Lys beta 82. In the mutant hemoglobin, the shortening of the amino-terminal region of the A helix by 1 residue results in the formation of an intrachain electrostatic interaction between the amino-terminal amino and Asp beta 79. This eliminates the sulfate binding site, and the sulfate is replaced by two water molecules. At variance with human hemoglobin, the alkaline Bohr effect for beta (V1M+H2 delta) is not sensitive to the presence of Cl-. This indicates that the sulfate binding site in human hemoglobin also serves as a Cl- binding site, and that the amino-terminal Val beta 1 is essential for oxygen-linked Cl- binding to hemoglobin as well as the Cl(-)-dependent Bohr effect. Analysis of the oxygen binding curves indicates that the oxygen-linked Cl- ions are released upon binding of the first oxygen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1567011157,"Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10/group) were fully protected from a lethal dose (600 mg/kg, i.p.) of thioacetamide by adding 8% (w/w) palmitic acid to the diet and L-carnitine (2 mg/ml) to drinking water for the previous 7 days. Supplements of palmitic acid or L-carnitine alone did not confer protection. Liver injury induced by thioacetamide peaked between 36 and 48 h in both control and supplemented rats. Liver damage regressed thereafter in supplemented rats but progressed in control rats. Immunohistochemical and histopathological observations confirmed biochemical indicators of liver damage. Thus, hepatic tissue repair after thioacetamide-induced tissue injury seems to be stimulated by supplements of fatty acids together with L-carnitine, a mitochondrial transfer agent. The extent to which nutritional supplements may aid in inducing the recovery of liver from injury caused by other hepatotoxic agents remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1524477594,"For its function, the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL requires the presence of ATP and co-chaperonin GroES. We have observed that ADP displays a two-step inhibition of GroEL-dependent ATP hydrolysis, wherein one-half of the GroEL ATPase sites is strongly inhibited by ADP while the other half is affected very mildly. It is suggested that interaction with ATP induces structural and functional differences between two initially identical rings in GroEL (inter-ring negative cooperativity) and that the subsequent binding of GroES occurs to the ring that is occupied first by ATP in a positively cooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W1656238582,"We constructed a recombinant adenovirus carrying the firefly luciferase gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter and controlled by the palindromic thyroid hormone/retinoic acid-responsive element. The same adenovirus vector without the hormone-responsive element was used as control. Regulation of the luciferase gene expression was tested in pituitary-derived GH cells and hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells infected with the recombinant adenoviruses. Administration of triiodothyronine to GH cells and all-trans-retinoic acid to HepG2 cells resulted in 8.0 +/- 0.3-fold and 4.6 +/- 0.5-fold induction of luciferase activity, respectively. No significant increase was observed with the control adenovirus. Hormonal regulation was also examined in adult mice. Mice depleted of thyroid hormone were injected intravenously with the recombinant adenoviruses and given 4 times the replacement dose of triiodothyronine or vehicle only for 4 days. Hormone administration resulted in 4.2-fold increase of luciferase activity in liver homogenates. No significant effect was observed in animals injected with the control adenovirus. This recombinant adenovirus provides a new experimental system in the study of thyroid hormone and retinoic acid action and offers the potential to regulate by physiological means the expression of genes transferred for the purpose of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1539532106,"The aspartate residue of the (N/T)KXD concensus sequence for GTP-binding proteins is present in the eight available sequences of adenylosuccinate synthetase. Reported here is a comprehensive analysis of the substrate specificity of mutant enzymes, where the conserved Asp333 of the synthetase from Escherichia coli is changed to asparagine, glutamate, and glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants D333N, D333E, and D333Q generally show decreased kcat values and increased Km values for GTP. The decreased values of kcat exhibited by the mutants indicate that the interactions between Asp333 and the guanine are relayed by some mechanism to the catalytic residues around the gamma-phosphate of GTP, and that the energy provided by the interaction between Asp333 and the guanine moiety of GTP is utilized for rearrangement of the catalytic residues. The three mutants each have higher affinity for xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) and ITP than does the wild-type enzyme. In fact, the D333N mutant uses XTP more effectively than the wild-type enzyme employs GTP as a substrate. The side-chain of Asp333 forms hydrogen bonds with the N-1 and the exocyclic amino group of the guanine base of GTP. In the D333N mutant, this interaction is probably replaced by hydrogen bonds between the amide side chain of Asn333 and N-1 and the 2-oxo group of XTP. The D333Q mutant can use UTP as a substrate more effectively than the wild-type enzyme. The longer side chain of glutamine at residue 333 favors pyrimidine nucleotides over the purine nucleotides, GTP, XTP, and ITP. These results demonstrate that Asp333 in the (N/T)KXD consensus sequence of adenylosuccinate synthetase from E. coli is a determinant for GTP-specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1574640284,"A Ser/Thr difference at position 364 underlies a phenotypic difference between naturally occurring variants of microsomal cytochrome P450 2C3 in their capacity to catalyze the 6 beta-hydroxylation of progesterone, as well as in their sensitivity to the inhibitor 16 alpha-methyl-progesterone. Position 364 of P450 2C3 maps to a substrate contacting domain suggested by models for mammalian P450 enzymes based on the structure of P450,101. In this study, Thr-364 of P450 2C3v, a progesterone 6 beta- and 16 alpha-hydroxylase, was replaced by Gly, Asp, Asn, Val, Leu, or Ile. The latter three amino acids did not alter the regiospecificity of P450 2C3v, whereas the Gly, Asp, and Asn substitutions each produced enzymes with properties that correspond closely to the Ser mutant that catalyzes 16 alpha-hydroxylation but not 6 beta-hydroxylation. The former are distinguished from the latter amino acids by their greater hydrophobicity and size. In contrast, the 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity could be greatly diminished by the introduction of an alanine replacement for Val-113. This mutation conferred progesterone 21- and 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity to P450 2C3v at the expense of 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity, leaving the 6 beta-hydroxylase activity largely unaffected. Compound mutants displayed the additive effects of the two mutations. These results are consistent with two distinct orientations for the binding of progesterone to P450 2C3v, resulting in 6 beta- and 16 alpha-hydroxylation, respectively. The binding of progesterone in these two orientations can be modulated relatively independently by modifications of the two key amino acid residues at 113 and 364."
https://openalex.org/W1564160704,"Transmembrane segments 1 and 2 of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase are believed to form a helical hairpin structure that is joined by a short extracytoplasmic loop. The hairpin head region (Ala135-Phe144) was probed using site-directed mutagenesis. Scanning alanine mutagenesis produced functional H(+)-ATPase at all positions except Leu138, Asp143, and Phe144. D140A and V142A gave strong hygromycin B resistance and low pH sensitivity suggesting a major kinetic defect in these mutant enzymes. Other amino acid substitutions, such as L138Y, were highly perturbing, while mutations S139E and D140E produced minor effects on phenotype. Small uncharged residues Gly and Ala, which were inserted between Leu138 and Ser139 to examine the importance of loop length on H(+)-ATPase function, were well tolerated, while the insertion of a polar Ser residue was highly perturbing. Other additions were not tolerated by the enzyme. These results suggest that the turn region has limited structural flexibility. The conserved Phe144 residue could be changed to Trp with a minor effect on phenotype. However, neither Tyr, Arg, nor small hydrophobic residues could substitute, suggesting that this region is closely packed and hydrophobic. ATP hydrolysis measurements showed that Vmax was significantly reduced in nearly all mutant enzymes, except D140E; whereas, Km values were nearly normal. Vanadate-sensitivity and pH profiles for ATP hydrolysis were nearly normal for all mutant enzymes except insertion mutant S138+. Mutants with extreme phenotypes (S138+, Tyr138) showed significantly altered medium acidification profiles. These results support the notion that the hairpin head region linking transmembrane segments 1 and 2 forms a tightly packed conformationally sensitive domain that is coupled to the catalytic ATP hydrolysis domain."
https://openalex.org/W2112909420,"We report here a comprehensive infrared spectroscopic study of the interactions between the anesthetic nitrous oxide (N2O) and six proteins: lysozyme, cytochrome c, myoglobin, hemoglobin, serum albumin, and cytochrome c oxidase. Sites occupied by N2O molecules within these proteins were characterized. Three types of hydrophobic sites were found within the proteins. One with nu 3 near 2225 cm-1 is likely to be near peptide bond carbonyls; one with nu 3 near 2219 cm-1 may be near a benzene-like structure such as the side chains of phenylalanine and tyrosine; and the other with nu 3 near 2215 cm-1 is likely to be in a nonpolar alkane-like environment provided by the side chains of Leu, Ile, and Val residues. The amount of N2O molecules bound to myoglobin increases as the pH decreases from 9.2 to 5.2. N2O-protein interactions produced no detectable changes in the ligand-binding pockets of myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c oxidase. N2O-induced secondary structure changes were detected only in the fully reduced cytochrome c oxidase, not in the fully oxidized oxidase and the other five proteins. N2O-induced conformational changes in the alpha beta-interface of hemoglobin and the h2 and h3 alpha-helices of human serum albumin were detected by monitoring the S-H stretch vibrations of cysteine residues. These findings provide direct evidence that anesthetic N2O interacts with proteins and occupies sites in the interior of the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552758753,"Biosynthesis of molybdopterin was followed in the yeast, Pichia canadensis, using labeled precursors. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of extracts from cells labeled with [U-14C]guanosine showed that the label was incorporated into the molybdopterin oxidation product, dephospho Form A. Dephospho Form A isolated from cells labeled with [U-14C,5'-3H]guanosine was devoid of tritium, indicating partial loss of the ribose moiety of guanosine during the synthesis of molybdopterin. In vivo labeling of P. canadensis using [7-14C]neopterin and [6,7,1-14C]hydroxymethylpterin led to label from both compounds appearing in dephospho Form A as well as in folic acid in wild type cells. When these labeled precursors were incubated with P. canadensis mutants blocked in molybdopterin synthesis, only folic acid was labeled. These results suggest a shared pathway in the biosyntheses of molybdopterin and folic acid. [6-14C]Glucose labeling experiments led to exclusive incorporation into the 4'-position of dephospho Form A but not in folic acid. It is proposed that molybdopterin synthesis branches from the folic acid biosynthetic pathway at dihydrohydroxymethylpterin and that a 3-carbon phosphorylated compound such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate may condense with dihydrohydroxymethylpterin to form the 4-carbon side chain precursor to molybdopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1601131631,"We have previously identified an ubiquitous repressor binding site that binds a nuclear factor 1 (NF-1)-like transcription factor designated BEF-1. The DNA binding activity of BEF-1, a 98-kDa protein, is increased by the oncoproteins of adenovirus, the early region 1a proteins (E1a), which results in the induction of further repression. Using the prototype repressor sequence, first identified in the enhancer of the human polyoma virus BKV-P2 we have shown that phosphorylation of BEF-1 is required for its DNA binding activity. We demonstrate here that the inhibition of DNA binding by BEF-1 dephosphorylated with potato acid phosphatase or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was reversed by sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatases. In addition, BEF-1 binding activity, but not the binding of related factor NF-1, could be inhibited by dephosphorylation with a specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase. We found that both polyclonal and monoclonal phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies blocked binding of the repressor protein to the BEF-1 site. Moreover, BEF-1 activity could be adsorbed on an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody column and specially eluted with phosphotyrosine. In transfection studies in HeLa cells, which contain high levels of BEF-1, we show that E1a-induced repression mediated by BEF-1 was relieved with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin. Together, these results demonstrate that a phosphotyrosine on the BEF-1 repressor protein regulates DNA binding activity and thus regulates repression of the BKV-P2 enhancer. This report represents the first demonstration that the phosphorylated state of a tyrosine can control gene expression by altering the DNA binding activity of a transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W1597409879,"The topical application of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to murine skin produces acute inflammatory and hyperplastic responses that have been associated with the promotion stage of skin carcinogenesis. It has been shown in a previous study that TPA induces the expression of the highly inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL) -1 alpha, in the epidermis of SENCAR mice. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of IL-1 alpha in several TPA-induced responses in skin. Topical application of TPA (1 microgram) enhanced the production of immunoreactive IL-1 alpha protein, primarily associated with the suprabasal keratinocytes. IL-1 alpha intradermally injected in the dorsal surface significantly increased (P < 0.001) vascular permeability at low concentrations (1-1000 microU) and increased (P < 0.001) inflammatory cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia at higher concentrations (10(3) U). TPA produced fourfold increases in vascular permeability as measured by Evans blue dye leakage; this effect was prevented by intradermal injection of anti-IL-1 alpha antibody (25-75 micrograms). Furthermore, injected anti-IL-1 alpha antibody significantly reduced (P < 0.001) TPA-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and epidermal hyperplasia. This study suggests that IL-1 alpha directly or indirectly mediates the inflammatory and hyperplastic responses elicited by topical treatment with TPA."

Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase readily converts 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2. In contrast, the same preparations fail to hydroxylate 26,27-dihomo-1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 26,27-dihomo-24-epi-1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D2 on carbon 25. Thus, homologation of carbons 26 and 27 of the vitamin D compound likely sterically hinders vitamin D 25-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1575025210,"Abstract A recombinant hemoglobin containing Val beta 7 (Hb beta E7V) was engineered and expressed in yeast to evaluate amino acid specificity of the Glu beta 6-->Val mutation (Hb beta E6V) in promoting polymer formation of deoxyhemoglobin. The purified CO Hb beta E7V migrated as a single band on electrophoresis with a slightly decreased positive charge compared with CO Hb S. The oxygen affinity of Hb beta E7V was slightly higher than Hb S, while the absorption spectrum of the mutant was similar to Hb S. Critical concentrations for polymerization in 1.8 M phosphate of the deoxy forms of Hb beta E7V and Hb A were 15- and 25-fold, respectively, higher than Hb S. Oversaturated deoxy Hb beta E7V polymerized without a delay time prior to polymerization like deoxy Hb beta E6F and Hb beta E6W. These results demonstrate that Val beta 6 in Hb S is critical for rapid polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin. The oxy form of Hb beta E7V was approximately 2-3-fold more unstable to heat and mechanical agitation than oxy Hb S, suggesting that instability and polymerization of hemoglobin are distinct properties."
