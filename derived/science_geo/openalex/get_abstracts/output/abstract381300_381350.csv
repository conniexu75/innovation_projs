https://openalex.org/W1997581921,"Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a transcription factor induced under severe hypoxia and a component of the PERK pathway involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a process that protects cells from the negative consequences of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In this study, we have used small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microarray analysis to provide the first whole-genome analysis of genes regulated by ATF4 in cancer cells in response to severe and prolonged hypoxic stress. We show that ATF4 is required for ER stress and hypoxia-induced expansion of autophagy. MAP1LC3B (LC3B) is a key component of the autophagosomal membrane, and in this study we demonstrate that ATF4 facilitates autophagy through direct binding to a cyclic AMP response element binding site in the LC3B promoter, resulting in LC3B upregulation. Previously, we have shown that Bortezomib-induced ATF4 stabilization, which then upregulated LC3B expression and had a critical role in activating autophagy, protecting cells from Bortezomib-induced cell death. We also showed that severe hypoxia stabilizes ATF4. In this study, we demonstrate that severe hypoxia leads to ER stress and induces ATF4-dependent autophagy through LC3 as a survival mechanism. In summary, we show that ATF4 has a key role in the regulation of autophagy in response to ER stress and provide a direct mechanistic link between the UPR and the autophagic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1984497969,"Recently, genome-wide association studies have implicated the human LIN28B locus in regulating height and the timing of menarche. LIN28B and its homolog LIN28A are functionally redundant RNA-binding proteins that block biogenesis of let-7 microRNAs. lin-28 and let-7 were discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans as heterochronic regulators of larval and vulval development but have recently been implicated in cancer, stem cell aging and pluripotency. The let-7 targets Myc, Kras, Igf2bp1 and Hmga2 are known regulators of mammalian body size and metabolism. To explore the function of the Lin28-Let-7 pathway in vivo, we engineered transgenic mice to express Lin28a and observed in them increased body size, crown-rump length and delayed onset of puberty. Investigation of metabolic and endocrine mechanisms of overgrowth in these transgenic mice revealed increased glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Here we report a mouse that models the human phenotypes associated with genetic variation in the Lin28-Let-7 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1986170218,"Joseph Gleeson and colleagues report that mutations in TMEM216 cause Joubert, Meckel and related syndromes. They further show that TMEM216 localizes to the base of cilia and that its loss leads to defects in ciliogenesis and centrosome docking. Joubert syndrome (JBTS), related disorders (JSRDs) and Meckel syndrome (MKS) are ciliopathies. We now report that MKS2 and CORS2 (JBTS2) loci are allelic and caused by mutations in TMEM216, which encodes an uncharacterized tetraspan transmembrane protein. Individuals with CORS2 frequently had nephronophthisis and polydactyly, and two affected individuals conformed to the oro-facio-digital type VI phenotype, whereas skeletal dysplasia was common in fetuses affected by MKS. A single G218T mutation (R73L in the protein) was identified in all cases of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (n = 10). TMEM216 localized to the base of primary cilia, and loss of TMEM216 in mutant fibroblasts or after knockdown caused defective ciliogenesis and centrosomal docking, with concomitant hyperactivation of RhoA and Dishevelled. TMEM216 formed a complex with Meckelin, which is encoded by a gene also mutated in JSRDs and MKS. Disruption of tmem216 expression in zebrafish caused gastrulation defects similar to those in other ciliary morphants. These data implicate a new family of proteins in the ciliopathies and further support allelism between ciliopathy disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2107368610,"The activity of transcription factor FoxO1 is regulated by phosphorylation-dependent nuclear exclusion and deacetylation-dependent nuclear retention. It is unclear whether and how these two post-translational modifications affect each other. To answer this question, we expressed FoxO1 cDNAs with combined mutations of phosphorylation and acetylation sites in HEK-293 cells and analyzed their subcellular localization patterns. We show that mutations mimicking the acetylated state (KQ series) render FoxO1 more sensitive to Akt-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion and can reverse the constitutively nuclear localization of phosphorylation-defective FoxO1. Conversely, mutations mimicking the deacetylated state (KR series) promote FoxO1 nuclear retention. Oxidative stress and the Sirt1 activator resveratrol are thought to promote FoxO1 deacetylation and nuclear retention, thus increasing its activity. Accordingly, FoxO1 deacetylation was required for the effect of oxidative stress (induced by H2O2) to retain FoxO1 in the nucleus. H2O2 also inhibited FoxO1 phosphorylation on Ser-253 and Thr-24, the key insulin-regulated sites, irrespective of its acetylation. In contrast, the effect of resveratrol was independent of FoxO1 acetylation and its phosphorylation on Ser-253 and Thr-24, suggesting that resveratrol acts on FoxO1 in a Sirt1- and Akt-independent manner. The dissociation of deacetylation from dephosphorylation in H2O2-treated cells indicates that the two modifications can occur independently of each other. It can be envisaged that FoxO1 exists in multiple nuclear forms with distinct activities depending on the balance of acetylation and phosphorylation.

However, mammalian pannexin1 does not form canonical gap junctions, instead forming hexameric oligomers in single plasma membranes and intracellularly. Pannexin1 acts as an ATP release channel, whereas less is known about the function of Pannexin2. We purified cellular membranes isolated from MDCK cells stably expressing rat Pannexin1 or Pannexin2 and identified pannexin channels (pannexons) in single membranes by negative stain and immunogold labeling. Protein gel and Western blot analysis confirmed Pannexin1 (Panx1) or Pannexin2 (Panx2) as the channel-forming proteins. We expressed and purified Panx1 and Panx2 using a baculovirus Sf9 expression system and obtained doughnut-like structures similar to those seen previously in purified connexin hemichannels (connexons) and mammalian membranes. Purified pannexons were comparable in size and overall appearance to Connexin46 and Connexin50 connexons. Pannexons and connexons were further analyzed by single-particle averaging for oligomer and pore diameters. The oligomer diameter increased with increasing monomer molecular mass, and we found that the measured oligomeric pore diameter for Panxs was larger than for Connexin26. Panx1 and Panx2 formed active homomeric channels in Xenopus oocytes and in vitro vesicle assays. Cross-linking and native gels of purified homomeric full-length and a C-terminal Panx2 truncation mutant showed a banding pattern more consistent with an octamer. We purified Panx1/Panx2 heteromeric channels and found that they were unstable over time, possibly because Panx1 and Panx2 homomeric pannexons have different monomer sizes and oligomeric symmetry from each other.

https://openalex.org/W2157398883,"Selective proteolysis in plants is largely mediated by the ubiquitin (Ub)/proteasome system in which substrates, marked by the covalent attachment of Ub, are degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The 26 S proteasome is composed of two subparticles, the 20 S core protease (CP) that compartmentalizes the protease active sites and the 19 S regulatory particle that recognizes and translocates appropriate substrates into the CP lumen for breakdown. Here, we describe an affinity method to rapidly purify epitope-tagged 26 S proteasomes intact from Arabidopsis thaliana. In-depth mass spectrometric analyses of preparations generated from young seedlings confirmed that the 2.5-MDa CP-regulatory particle complex is actually a heterogeneous set of particles assembled with paralogous pairs for most subunits. A number of these subunits are modified post-translationally by proteolytic processing, acetylation, and/or ubiquitylation. Several proteasome-associated proteins were also identified that likely assist in complex assembly and regulation. In addition, we detected a particle consisting of the CP capped by the single subunit PA200 activator that may be involved in Ub-independent protein breakdown. Taken together, it appears that a diverse and highly dynamic population of proteasomes is assembled in plants, which may expand the target specificity and functions of intracellular proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2043677605,"Mammalian Wdr82 is a regulatory component of the Setd1a and Setd1b histone H3-lysine 4 methyltransferase complexes and is implicated in the tethering of Setd1 complexes to transcriptional start sites of active genes. In the studies reported here, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses reveal that Wdr82 additionally associates with multiple protein complexes, including an RNA polymerase II complex, four distinct histone H3-Lys(4) methyltransferase complexes, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-associated proteins, a chaperonin-containing Tcp1 complex, and other uncharacterized proteins. Further characterization of the PP1-associated proteins identified a stable multimeric complex composed of regulatory subunits PNUTS, Tox4, and Wdr82 and a PP1 catalytic subunit (denoted as the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex). The PTW/PP1 complex exhibits in vitro phosphatase activity in a PP1-dependent manner. Analysis of protein-protein interactions reveals that PNUTS mediates phosphatase complex formation by providing a binding platform to each component. The PNUTS and Tox4 subunits are predominantly associated with the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex in HEK293 cells, and the integrity of this complex remains intact throughout cell cycle progression. Inducible expression of a PP1 interaction-defective form of PNUTS (W401A) or small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PNUTS in HEK293 cells causes cell cycle arrest at mitotic exit and apoptotic cell death. PNUTS (W401A) shows normal association with chromosomes but causes defects in the process of chromosome decondensation at late telophase. These data reveal that mammalian Wdr82 functions in a variety of cellular processes and reveal a potential role of the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex in the regulation of chromatin structure during the transition from mitosis into interphase."
https://openalex.org/W2067680938,"Tubulin polyglutamylation is a reversible post-translational modification, serving important roles in microtubule (MT)-related processes. Polyglutamylases of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family add glutamate moieties to specific tubulin glutamate residues, whereas as yet unknown deglutamylases shorten polyglutamate chains. First we investigated regulatory machinery of tubulin glutamylation in MT-based sensory cilia of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that ciliary MTs were polyglutamylated by a process requiring ttll-4. Conversely, loss of ccpp-6 gene function, which encodes one of two cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs), resulted in elevated levels of ciliary MT polyglutamylation. Consistent with a deglutamylase function for ccpp-6, overexpression of this gene in ciliated cells decreased polyglutamylation signals. Similarly, we confirmed that overexpression of murine CCP5, one of two sequence orthologs of nematode ccpp-6, caused a dramatic loss of MT polyglutamylation in cultured mammalian cells. Finally, using an in vitro assay for tubulin glutamylation, we found that recombinantly expressed Myc-tagged CCP5 exhibited deglutamylase biochemical activities. Together, these data from two evolutionarily divergent systems identify C. elegans CCPP-6 and its mammalian ortholog CCP5 as a tubulin deglutamylase.

In contrast, the enzyme(s) underlying deglutamylation have not been discovered yet, although such proteins are suggested to be present in mouse brain neurons and in cultured cells (11.Audebert S.

In this study, we employed the genetically tractable nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to identify genes that regulate tubulin polyglutamylation/deglutamylation. Specifically, we investigated tubulin post-translational modification in C. elegans sensory cilia, which are MT-based organelles that extend from the distal dendrite tips of 60 sensory neurons found in sensory organs named amphid (head) and phasmid (tail) sensilla (see Fig. 1A). In this system, we identified a cytosolic carboxypeptidase (ccpp) gene, ccpp-6, as a candidate tubulin deglutamylase gene, whose functional properties are opposite to those of the tubulin polyglutamylase gene, ttll-4. Furthermore, we identified mammalian CCP5 as a functional homolog of nematode CCPP-6 and confirmed its deglutamylase activity in cultured cells and in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first report revealing the molecular nature of the tubulin deglutamylase enzyme. Nematodes were grown and maintained at 20 °C under standard conditions (13.Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mutant and transgenic strains used in this study are listed in the supplemental Methods. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described in previous studies (14.Nonet M.L. Staunton J.E. Kilgard M.P. Fergestad T. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. Meyer B.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8061-8073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Full details are described in the supplemental Methods. Immunostained worm samples were mounted on a slide glass with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed under an FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus). At least 20 adult worms for each strain were analyzed, and all images were collected using the same optical condition. Images were analyzed using FV10-ASW software (Olympus). Immunostained polyglutamylated (GT335) and α-tubulin signal intensities were measured in sensory cilia from the same optical slice. Following subtraction of background signals in non-ciliary regions, a GT335/α-tubulin signal intensity ratio was calculated for each image. GT335/α-tubulin ratios were averaged for each strain. The relative intensity of each strain was obtained from the average of GT335/ α-tubulin normalized by that of wild type and statistically analyzed by StatPlus (AnalystSoft). The conventional methods of cell culture and gene knockdown by RNAi are described in the supplemental Methods. Expression plasmids for CCP5 or -6 fused to a Myc tag (pCMV-tag3a-CCP5 and pCMV-tag3c-CCP6) were introduced into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed with PIPES-based buffer. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) and subsequently precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Tubulin deglutamylation assays were performed by adding 1.25 μg of porcine tubulin either to cell lysates or to immunoprecipitated Myc-CCP5 at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by diluting mixtures with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 15 min. Samples were then subjected to Western blotting using GT335 (1:5000), anti-α-tubulin polyclonal (1:5000), and anti-Myc 9E10 (1:1000) antibodies. We determined the distribution of polyglutamylation signals in C. elegans sensory cilia using antibodies that specifically recognize polyglutamylation. Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) GT335, which specifically recognizes both monoglutamylation and polyglutamylation (10.van Dijk J. Rogowski K. Miro J. Lacroix B. Eddé B. Janke C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 437-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), robust signals were detected in the ciliary regions of the nematode head and tail (Fig. 1, A and B, left; supplemental Fig. 2A; and supplemental Movie 1). To ensure that the observed signals are indeed those of ciliary MTs, we employed strains expressing ciliated cell-specific transcriptional GFP transgenes (derived from promoter-GFP constructs), which illuminate the entire sensory neuron. In such strains, we found that the cilia of most amphid head neurons (ASE, ADF, ASH, ASK, AWA, AWC, and AFD) showed GT335 signals (Fig. 1B middle and right; supplemental Fig. 3). Strong signals were also seen in the ciliary structures of the inner (Fig. 1B, left panel, white arrows) and outer labial sensilla (Fig. 1B, left panel, yellow arrows; supplemental Movie 1). In contrast, no GT335 signals were detected in other ciliary neurons such as the neurons of the cephalic sensilla (supplemental Fig. 3, bottom row, arrow). In the tail, the ciliary structures of the phasmid neurons PHA, PHB, and PQR were also labeled with GT335 (supplemental Fig. 2B). Another mAb, B3, which specifically recognizes polyglutamylated tubulins (15.Gagnon C. White D. Cosson J. Huitorel P. Eddé B. Desbruyères E. Paturle-Lafanechère L. Multigner L. Job D. Cibert C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielded similar signal staining patterns (supplemental Fig. 2C). Together, these data show that the MTs of C. elegans sensory cilia are highly polyglutamylated. Tubulin polyglutamylation is mediated by enzymes of the TTLL family (8.Ikegami K. Mukai M. Tsuchida J.

The C. elegans genome contains six TTLL genes (ttll-4, -5, -9, -11, -12, and -15), and each gene belongs to a different clade (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we studied the expression pattern of C. elegans ttll genes using transgenic worms carrying transcriptional GFP reporters (GFP directed by ttll promoter) or translational GFP reporters (GFP was fused to the entire open reading frame of the gene) under the control of the endogenous promoter of the gene (supplemental Figs. 4 and 5; summarized in supplemental Table 1). We found that three ttll genes, ttll-4, -9, and -11, are expressed in many ciliated sensory neurons in amphid (supplemental Fig. 5, D and F–H). C. elegans does not have any polyglycylase orthologs (TTLL3, -8, and -10) (16.Ikegami K. Horigome D. Mukai M. Livnat I. MacGregor G.R. Setou M.

Consistent with an absence of motile cilia and polyglycylase orthologs in C. elegans, immunostaining for polyglycylation in worms revealed no signals. 3Y. Kimura and M. Setou, unpublished data. To identify which ttll gene contributes to the polyglutamylation observed in the sensory cilia, we studied worm strains with mutations in the ttll genes (summarized in supplemental Table 1). The GT335 signals completely disappeared in ttll-4 worms (Fig. 1C, second row, asterisks, and D). To clearly evaluate the level of tubulin polyglutamylation, we quantified the signals of GT335 and of counterstained α-tubulin (Fig. 1C, middle column). The complete loss of GT335 signal was greater than a partial decrease of the α-tubulin signal in ttll-4 mutants (Fig. 1D). In contrast, only a slight reduction in GT335 signals was observed (Fig. 1, C, third row, and D, p < 0.01, Student's t test). We observed no overt decrease of GT335 immunoreactivities in a hypomorphic ttll-11(gk482) mutant (data not shown). The GT335 immunoreactivities were not altered in ttll-5(tm3360) and ttll-15(tm3871) mutants (data not shown), presumably because these genes are not expressed in ciliated sensory neurons (supplemental Fig. 5, E and J). The prominent loss of polyglutamylation observed in the ttll-4 mutant was reversed by overexpression of ttll-4::mCherry in sensory neurons (Fig. 1, C bottom row, and D). These findings demonstrate that TTLL-4 is a key enzyme that autonomously mediates tubulin polyglutamylation in sensory cilia. Previous reports suggest the presence of dynamic reversible regulation of tubulin polyglutamylation by deglutamylase activity (11.Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12.Regnard C. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. J.

Having identified TTLL-4 as a critical protein for tubulin polyglutamylation in C. elegans sensory cilia, we next turned our attention to identifying candidate deglutamylase genes in C. elegans. Cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs) were recently identified as a subfamily of M14 metallocarboxypeptidases (20.Kalinina E. Biswas R. Berezniuk I. Hermoso A. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21.Rodriguez de la Vega M. Sevilla R.G. Hermoso A. Lorenzo J. Tanco S. Diez A. Fricker L.D. Bautista J.M. Avilés F.X. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CCP1/Nna1, the first identified member of the CCP family, is mutated in Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mice (22.Fernandez-Gonzalez A. La Spada A.R. Treadaway J. Higdon J.C. Harris B.S. Sidman R.L. Morgan J.I. Zuo J. Science. 2002; 295: 1904-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); in these mice, the mitral cells in olfactory bulb show decreased signals of detyrosinated tubulins (20.Kalinina E. Biswas R. Berezniuk I. Hermoso A. Aviles F.X. Fricker L.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 836-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). C. elegans has only two CCP genes in its genome, F56H1.5 and EEED8.6, which we name here ccpp-1 and -6, respectively by their amino acid similarity and protein structure in comparison with six mammalian CCP genes (CCP1–6) (Fig. 2A; supplemental Fig. 6). CCPP-1 belongs to the M14D3 group with mammalian CCP1 and -4, and CCPP-6 belongs to the M14D2 group with mammalian CCP5 and -6 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether ccpp-1 and -6 are involved in the regulation of tubulin polyglutamylation, we first examined their expression in sensory neurons. A transcriptional GFP reporter of ccpp-1 was expressed in amphid neurons (supplemental Fig. 7C). On the other hand, that of ccpp-6 was expressed only in the labial neurons but not in amphid neurons (data not shown). A translational reporter mCherry fused to CCPP-1 protein showed the weak dotted signals around the pharynx (supplemental Fig. 7D, arrowheads). Meanwhile, a translational GFP reporter for ccpp-6 showed weak signals in the cell body of putative amphid neurons (supplemental Fig. 7, A and B, arrowheads), suggesting that expression in amphid cells was regulated by an enhancer element in a ccpp-6 intron(s). The weak signals observed for GFP/mCherry-tagged CCPP-1 and CCPP-6 transgenes indicate that both CCPP proteins are maintained at very low levels, possibly because they are rapidly degraded. Nevertheless, these results suggest that both CCPP-1 and CCPP-6 are expressed and function cell autonomously in amphid neurons. Importantly, we found a robust reduction in the GT335 signals in the cilia of CCPP-6::GFP-expressing animals (p < 0.001, Student's t test), consistent with our hypothesis that CCPP-6 functions as a deglutamylase (Fig. 2, B, third row, asterisks, and D, upper panel). In contrast, the GT335 signals did not decrease in the CCPP-1::mCherry-expressing animals. Rather, the amphids of these animals showed increased GT335 signals along with the increase in the tubulin signals (Fig. 2, C, lower row, and D, lower panel). Hence, CCPP-1 might be involved in regulating tubulin function in the sensory cilia but does not likely act as a deglutamylase. To determine whether endogenous CCPP-6 negatively regulates tubulin polyglutamylation, we analyzed tubulin polyglutamylation in ccpp-6 mutants. The tubulin GT335 signal significantly increased in ccpp-6 mutants (p < 0.05, Student's t test), indicating that CCPP-6 suppresses tubulin polyglutamylation (Fig. 2, B, second row, and D, upper panel). This enhanced signal is completely lost in the ccpp-6;ttll-4 double mutant background (Fig. 2, B, bottom row, and D, upper panel). These results indicate that ccpp-6 negatively regulates tubulin polyglutamylation in sensory cilia; this suggests that CCPP-6 is a tubulin deglutamylase. We next examined whether mammalian CCPs (Fig. 2A) harbor tubulin deglutamylase(s). To this end, we exogenously overexpressed Myc-tagged CCP5 and -6, which are orthologs of C. elegans CCPP-6, and CCP2 as a control along with tubulin polyglutamylases, TTLL5 and -6, in HEK293T cells. Remarkably, GT335-detected tubulin bands completely disappeared when CCP5 was expressed (Fig. 3A). We could not detect such an effect for CCP2 and -6 at least in our system (Fig. 3A, data not shown). Strikingly, CCP5 did show no effect on the level of tyrosinated tubulin (Fig. 3B), indicating that CCP5 does not have detyrosinase activity. This deglutamylation activity was also detected for other proteins (supplemental Fig. 8, arrowheads). We further analyzed the effect of CCP5 in the endogenous polyglutamylation by the overexpression in mouse cortical neurons. The CCP5-expressing cells showed marked reduction in the GT335 signals (Fig. 3C, middle column). To further examine whether mammalian CCP5 effectively counteracts tubulin polyglutamylation, we performed RNAi treatment of CCP5 in NIH3T3 cells. Two independent small interfering RNAs against CCP5 clearly increased intensities of GT335-detected bands at 50 kDa (Fig. 3D), which was overlapped with the β-tubulin band (Fig. 3D; green versus red). The two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the CCP5 knockdown caused an increase in the intensity of GT335-detected β-tubulin spots (Fig. 3E, top row), and more acidic β-tubulin spots were detected (Fig. 3E, bottom row). These results indicate that CCP5, one of the sequence orthologs of nematode CCPP-6 (Fig. 2A), is a tubulin deglutamylase in mammalian cells. The reason why β-tubulin polyglutamylation is effectively increased in CCP5 knockdown cells could be explained by the presence of endogenous glutamylation activity preferential to β-tubulin in non-neuronal cells (12.Regnard C. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next carried out an in vitro enzyme assay of recombinant CCP5. We first tried to use nematode CCPP-6 and murine CCP5 expressed in bacteria. However, these recombinants did not show the enzyme activity or were hardly solubilized (see the supplemental Methods). This is probably because CCPP-6 and CCP5 fails to fold into the correct three-dimensional structure when expressed in bacteria. Thus, we decided to use Myc-tagged CCP5 expressed in HEK293T cells and successfully detected deglutamylase activity in vitro (Fig. 3, F and G; supplemental Fig. 9). The salt concentration drastically affected the CCP5 activity in the cell lysates; the enzyme was more active with 100 mm NaCl than with 0 or 50 mm NaCl (supplemental Fig. 9). CCP5 activity appeared to be saturated at 15 min as the decrease in GT335 signals of tubulin reached plateau (Fig. 3F). The faint decrease of GT335 signals in the mock transfection sample could be caused by the presence of endogenous deglutamylase in the cell lysates as reported previously (11.Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12.Regnard C. Desbruyères E. Denoulet P. Eddé B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of α-tubulin signals in CCP5-containing samples could occur by the preferential binding of anti-α-tubulin antibody to less glutamylated tubulins (6.Ikegami K. Heier R.L. Taruishi M. Takagi H. Mukai M. Shimma S. Taira S. Hatanaka K. Morone N. Yao I. Campbell P.K. Yuasa S. Janke C. Macgregor G.R. Setou M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Despite the highest similarity between nematode CCPP-6 and mammalian CCP6, we were not able to detect deglutamylase activity of CCP6 in cultured cells. We were not able to detect the reduction of GT335 signal in the in vitro assay either (Fig. 3G). We would not, however, exclude possibilities that CCP6 functions as a deglutamylase. CCP6 might function under other experimental conditions or act on specific substrates, e.g. axonemal tubulins in cilia, as CCPP-6 works in the sensory cilia of C. elegans. Finally, we challenged the enzyme activity assay by using Myc-CCP5 immobilized on antibody-protein G beads. In the immunoprecipitant of anti-Myc antibody, the antibody-purified CCP5 was detected in a major band (Fig. 3H). The broad bands with the faster migration than Myc-CCP5 (Fig. 3H, asterisk) were likely to be degraded Myc-CCP5 as the anti-Myc antibody detected some proteins at the same position (supplemental Fig. 10). Other minor bands seemed to be non-specifically precipitated proteins because they were also detected in the bead fraction of the empty vector-transfected cell lysates. Thus, Myc-CCP5 was the major and specific component of the immunoprecipitant. Incubation of substrate pig brain tubulin with this immobilized Myc-CCP5 showed clear reduction in the GT335 signal (Fig. 3I). The background activity detected in cell lysates (Fig. 3F) was completely eliminated in this assay (Fig. 3I). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that CCP5 has a tubulin deglutamylase activity. By the genetic approach with C. elegans, we isolated CCPP-6 as a negative regulator of tubulin polyglutamylation in vivo. We also demonstrated that CCP5, a mammalian sequence ortholog of CCPP-6, had clear enzyme activity of tubulin deglutamylase by in vitro assay. In conclusion, we have identified C. elegans CCPP-6 and mammalian CCP5 as a tubulin deglutamylase by both in vitro and in vivo assay results."

Thus far, x-ray structures of EAL have not yet been available, although the structure of the EutB heterohexamer (α6) has been analyzed recently (Protein Data Bank ID, 2QEZ). To obtain crystals for x-ray analysis, we recently established methods for high level protein expression and simple purification of E. coli wild-type EAL (14Akita K. Hieda N. Baba N. Kawaguchi S. Sakamoto H. Nakanishi Y. Yamanishi M. Mori K. Toraya T. J. Biochem. 2010; 147: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, purified EAL protein precipitates at high concentrations with a concomitant loss of enzyme activity. Recently, we determined that N-terminal truncations of the β-subunit with the C34S mutation significantly improves EAL stability (14Akita K. Hieda N. Baba N. Kawaguchi S. Sakamoto H. Nakanishi Y. Yamanishi M. Mori K. Toraya T. J. Biochem. 2010; 147: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These data indicate that a short N-terminal sequence is sufficient to change the solubility and stability of the enzyme.In the present article, we report the crystallization and first x-ray structures of truncated EAL complexed with coenzyme B12 analogs and substrates. Mechanistically important insights obtained from these structures, which may give a hint to design inhibitors for the ethanolamine-degradative pathway of the food poisoning bacteria, are also described here. EAL was first discovered by Bradbeer (4Bradbeer C. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4669-4674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in choline-fermenting Clostridium sp. This enzyme is essential for the growth of many bacteria on ethanolamine in the presence of exogenous vitamin B12 (5Chang G.W. Chang J.T. Nature. 1975; 254: 150-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is the first enzyme in the ethanolamine-degradative pathway of the bacteria carrying the ethanolamine utilization (eut) operon (6Kofoid E. Rappleye C. Stojiljkovic I. Roth J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5317-5329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eut operon encodes the components of the carboxysome-like ethanolamine utilization microcompartment, a proteinaceous organelle containing the proteins required for ethanolamine degradation (7Sagermann M. Ohtaki A. Nikolakakis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8883-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Penrod J.T. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2865-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the pathway are of interest because considerable numbers of pathogens that carry the ethanolamine utilization genes are causative agents of food poisoning (9Li H. Kristensen D.M. Coleman M.K. Mushegian A. PLoS One. 2009; 4e5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Clostridial EAL has been investigated extensively (10Babior B.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 376-384Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar), together with diol dehydratase (11Abeles R.H. Dolphin D. Acc. Chem.

Recombinant enzyme has been used primarily after the cloning of the Salmonella genes encoding EAL (12Faust L.R. Connor J.A. Roof D.M. Hoch J.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12462-12466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Large (α) and small (β) subunits of EAL are encoded by the eutB and eutC genes, respectively, in the eut operon. Overexpression and purification of EAL from Salmonella typhimurium (13Faust L.P. Babior B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and E. coli (14Akita K. Hieda N. Baba N. Kawaguchi S. Sakamoto H. Nakanishi Y. Yamanishi M. Mori K. Toraya T. J.

EPR studies have demonstrated that the enzyme binds cobalamin in the base-on mode, that is, with 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole coordinating to the cobalt atom (14Akita K. Hieda N. Baba N. Kawaguchi S.

Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12462-12466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent EPR, ENDOR, and electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy studies have revealed not only the nature of the radical species but also the geometry of reactant centers of this enzyme (18LoBrutto R.

The three-dimensional structure of this enzyme has been constructed from the x-ray structure of diol dehydratase by modeling using spectroscopic results and sequence comparison (22Sun L. Warncke K.

It controls extracellular matrix remodeling by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and is implicated in processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Timp4-deficient mice (Timp4−/−) were generated to assess TIMP4 function in normal development and in models of heart disease. We deleted exons 1–3 of the Timp4 gene by homologous recombination. Timp4−/− mice are born healthy, develop normally, and produce litters of normal size and gender distribution. These mice show no compensation by overexpression of Timp1, Timp2, or Timp3 in the heart. Following cardiac pressure overload by aortic banding, Timp4−/− mice have comparable survival rate, cardiac histology, and cardiac function to controls. In this case, Timp4 deficiency is compensated by increased cardiac Timp2 expression. Strikingly, the induction of myocardial infarction (MI) leads to significantly increased mortality in Timp4−/− mice primarily due to left ventricular rupture. The post-MI mortality of Timp4−/− mice is reduced by administration of a synthetic MMP inhibitor. Furthermore, combining the genetic deletion of Mmp2 also rescues the higher post-MI mortality of Timp4−/− mice. Finally, Timp4−/− mice suffer reduced cardiac function at 20 months of age. Timp4 is not essential for murine development, although its loss moderately compromises cardiac function with aging. Timp4−/− mice are more susceptible to MI but not to pressure overload, and TIMP4 functions in its capacity as a metalloproteinase inhibitor after myocardial infarction.

https://openalex.org/W2021256296,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine, is considered an attractive therapeutic target in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In addition to its known biologic activities, MIF can also function as a tautomerase. Several small molecules have been reported to be effective inhibitors of MIF tautomerase activity in vitro. Herein we employed a robust activity-based assay to identify different classes of novel inhibitors of the catalytic and biological activities of MIF. Several novel chemical classes of inhibitors of the catalytic activity of MIF with IC(50) values in the range of 0.2-15.5 microm were identified and validated. The interaction site and mechanism of action of these inhibitors were defined using structure-activity studies and a battery of biochemical and biophysical methods. MIF inhibitors emerging from these studies could be divided into three categories based on their mechanism of action: 1) molecules that covalently modify the catalytic site at the N-terminal proline residue, Pro(1); 2) a novel class of catalytic site inhibitors; and finally 3) molecules that disrupt the trimeric structure of MIF. Importantly, all inhibitors demonstrated total inhibition of MIF-mediated glucocorticoid overriding and AKT phosphorylation, whereas ebselen, a trimer-disrupting inhibitor, additionally acted as a potent hyperagonist in MIF-mediated chemotactic migration. The identification of biologically active compounds with known toxicity, pharmacokinetic properties, and biological activities in vivo should accelerate the development of clinically relevant MIF inhibitors. Furthermore, the diversity of chemical structures and mechanisms of action of our inhibitors makes them ideal mechanistic probes for elucidating the structure-function relationships of MIF and to further determine the role of the oligomerization state and catalytic activity of MIF in regulating the function(s) of MIF in health and disease."

Although this cellular phenomenon is well established, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that sequential induction of NFAT and c-Myc transcription factors is sufficient and required for the TGF-β switch from a cell cycle inhibitor to a growth promoter pathway in cancer cells. Mechanistically, TGF-β induces in a calcineurin-dependent manner the expression and activation of NFAT factors, which then translocate into the nucleus to promote c-Myc expression. In response to TGF-β, activated NFAT factors bind to and displace Smad3 repressor complexes from the previously identified TGF-β inhibitory element (TIE) to transactivate the c-Myc promoter. c-Myc in turn stimulates cell cycle progression and growth through up-regulation of D-type cyclins. Most importantly, NFAT knockdown not only prevents c-Myc activation and cell proliferation, but also partially restores TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest and growth suppression.

Application of high fluid shear stress to chondrocytes recapitulates the earmarks of OA, as evidenced by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, matrix degradation, and chondrocyte apoptosis. Elevated levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin (PG) E2, and interleukin (IL)-6 have been reported in OA cartilage in vivo, and in shear-activated chondrocytes in vitro. Although PGE2 positively regulates IL-6 synthesis in chondrocytes, the underlying signaling pathway of shear-induced IL-6 expression remains unknown. Using the human T/C-28a2 chondrocyte cell line as a model system, we demonstrate that COX-2-derived PGE2 signals via up-regulation of E prostanoid (EP) 2 and down-regulation of EP3 receptors to raise intracellular cAMP, and activate protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathways. PKA and PI3-K/Akt transactivate the NF-κB p65 subunit via phosphorylation at Ser-276 and Ser-536, respectively. Binding of p65 to the IL-6 promoter elicits IL-6 synthesis in sheared chondrocytes. Selective knockdown of EP2 or ectopic expression of EP3 blocks PKA- and PI3-K/Akt-dependent p65 activation and markedly diminishes shear-induced IL-6 expression. Similar inhibitory effects on IL-6 synthesis were observed by inhibiting PKA, PI3-K, or NF-κB using pharmacological and/or genetic interventions.

Although OA is classified as a non-inflammatory joint disease, prostaglandins and cytokines are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Prior work has shown that OA cartilage spontaneously releases prostaglandin (PG)E2 at 50-fold higher levels than in normal cartilage (7Amin A.R. Attur M. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J. Rediske J. Stuchin S.A. Patel I.R. Abramson S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The superinduction of PGE2 is mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein, whose levels are markedly up-regulated in OA-affected cartilage (7Amin A.R. Attur M. Patel R.N. Thakker G.D. Marshall P.J.

Periodontal Res. 2002; 37: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) fibroblasts. PGE2 exerts its biological functions via binding to four distinct transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) termed E prostanoid (EP) 1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. Following PGE2 binding, the EP receptors activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways, which may account for the pleiotropic effects of this prostaglandin. EP1 couples to Gq protein and raises intracellular calcium (13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11613-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). EP2 and EP4 elevate intracellular cAMP levels by activating adenylate cyclase via stimulatory G (Gs) proteins (13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11613-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The major signaling pathway of the EP3 receptor is the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and thus reduction of intracellular cAMP, via inhibitory G (Gi) proteins (13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11613-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar).

Although high fluid shear (16 dyn/cm2) has been reported to induce IL-6 mRNA and protein expression in human chondrocytes (4Mohtai M. Gupta M.K. Donlon B. Ellison B. Cooke J. Gibbons G. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. J. Ortho. Res. 1996; 14: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanism of this process has yet to be elucidated. Because OA is often a consequence of excessive mechanical forces (2Buckwalter J.A. Martin J.A. Brown T.D. Biorheology. 2006; 43: 603-609PubMed Google Scholar) and given that application of high fluid shear to chondrocytes recapitulates the earmarks of OA (3Yokota H. Goldring M.B. Sun H.B. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar), we here delineate the signaling pathway of IL-6 induction in shear-activated human T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. Specifically, we demonstrate that COX-2-derived PGE2 signals via EP2 and EP3 receptors to regulate intracellular cAMP levels in chondrocytes, which in turn stimulate protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathways. PKA and PI3-K/Akt transactivate the NF-κB p65 subunit via phosphorylation at Ser-276 and Ser-536, respectively, which in turn binds to the IL-6 promoter and mediates IL-6 mRNA synthesis in shear-stimulated chondrocytes.

Human primary articular chondrocytes (Cell Applications) or T/C-28a2 chondrocytic cells were grown (37 °C in 5% CO2) on glass slides in F12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (5Healy Z.R.

Before shear exposure, cells were incubated for 18 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 1% Nutridoma-SP (Roche), a low serum replacement that maintains chondrocyte phenotype and establishes quiescence in the monolayer (19Goldring M.B.

Med. 2004; 100: 37-52PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then subjected to a shear stress level of 20 dyn/cm2 for prescribed periods of time in medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SP, using a streamer gold flow device (Flexcell International, Hillsborough, NC). In select experiments, the pharmacological agents were added to the medium at the indicated concentrations just before the onset of shear exposure. It is well established that transmission of the shear stress signal throughout the cell involves a complex interplay between cytoskeletal and biochemical constituents, and results in changes in structure, metabolism, and gene expression (21Papadaki M. Eskin S.G. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For ectopic expression of EP3 receptor or p65, T/C-28a2 chondrocytes were transfected with 1.6 μg/slide of plasmid containing the EP3 or p65 cDNA by using Lipofectamine 2000. In control experiments, cells were transfected with 1.6 μg/slide of the empty vector pCMV6-XL (OriGene Technologies). In select experiments, T/C-28a2 cells were transfected with 1.6 μg/slide of the IL-6 promoter reporter construct pIL-6-luc651 or pIL6-luc651 ΔNF-κB. In RNA interference assays, T/C-28a2 cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotide sequence specific for CREB1, ATF4, or p65. In control experiments, cells were transfected with 100 nm control siRNA. For EP2 shRNA experiments, T/C-28a2 chondrocytes were transfected with 1.6 μg/slide of plasmid containing the EP2 shRNA or scramble shRNA control. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used to specifically target the EP2 mRNA (underlined, sense and antisense sequences; boldface italicized, loop with linker): top strand, 5′-GATCCCCGATCCAGCTGCCTATTGATTTCAAGAGAATCAATAGGCAGCTGGATCTTTTTC-3′; bottom strand, 5′-TCGAGAAAAAGATCCAGCTGCCTATTGATTCTCTTGAAATCAATAGGCAGCTGGATCGGG-3′. Top and bottom strands were annealed, subcloned into the XhoI/BglII sites of pSuper, and the resulting construct sequence was verified. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for at least 12 h in growth medium and then incubated overnight in medium containing 1% Nutridoma-SP before their exposure to shear or static conditions. In promoter activity experiments, luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega), as previously described (5Healy Z.R. Lee N.H. Gao X. Goldring M.B.

GAPDH was used as internal control. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 15 min followed by 95 °C for 5 min, and then 35 PCR cycles were performed with the following temperature profile: 95 °C 15 s, 58 °C 30 s, 68 °C 1 min, 77 °C 20 s. Data were collected at the (77 °C 20 s) step to remove possible fluorescent contribution from dimer primers (22Zhu F. Massana R. Not F. Marie D. Vaulot D. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 2005; 52: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Gene expression values were normalized to GAPDH. T/C-28a2 cells, from sheared and matched static control specimens, were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Pierce). The protein content of the cell lysates was determined using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce). Total cell lysates (4 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and probed with a panel of specific antibodies. Each membrane was only probed using one antibody. β-Actin was used as loading control. All Western hybridizations were performed at least in triplicate using a different cell preparation each time. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were isolated using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (17Healy Z.R. Zhu F. Stull J.D. Konstantopoulos K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1146-C1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide probe (5′-GGGATTTTCC-3′) was synthesized containing the NF-κB cis-element present on the IL-6 promoter. EMSAs were performed with a commercially available nonradioisotopic EMSA kit (LightShift Chemiluminescence EMSA kit; Pierce). Briefly, nuclear extracts (1–2 μg) were incubated in 10× binding buffer (supplemented with 50 ng of poly(dI-dC), 2.5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mg of bovine serum albumin), containing 20 fmol of biotinylated, double-stranded probe for NF-κB for 30 min on ice. For competition binding, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled (cold) probe was incubated with nuclear extracts before the inclusion of the biotinylated one. For supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min on ice with an anti-p65 antibody. The biotinylated oligonucleotide probe specific for NF-κB was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for another 30 min on ice. To exclude the possibility of nonspecific binding, a 5′-biotinylated random probe (5′-TCATTTTGTC-3′) designed using a random sequence generator was used in shift and supershift assays (supplemental Fig. S1). The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a native 6% polyacrylamide retardation gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA running buffer at 10 mA for 1 h, transferred to a nylon membrane (Pierce), visualized using the LightShift Chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak x-ray film (Pierce). cAMP levels were determined by cyclic AMP enzyme immunoassay kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Cayman Chemical). The protein concentration of total cell lysate was used as loading control, and the results were expressed as pmol of cAMP/μg of total protein. IL-6 expression has been detected in chondrocytes from OA but not normal cartilage (4Mohtai M. Gupta M.K. Donlon B. Ellison B. Cooke J. Gibbons G. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. J. Ortho. Res. 1996; 14: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Prior work has shown that high fluid shear stress (16 dyn/cm2) induces IL-6 production in human articular chondrocytes in vitro (4Mohtai M. Gupta M.K. Donlon B. Ellison B. Cooke J. Gibbons G. Schurman D.J. Smith R.L. J. Ortho. Res. 1996; 14: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway of IL-6 induction in human chondrocytes in response to elevated levels of fluid shear remains unknown. In light of accumulating evidence suggesting that OA is often a consequence of abnormal mechanical forces (23Martin J.A. Buckwalter J.A. Biorheology. 2006; 43: 517-521PubMed Google Scholar), we here aimed to delineate the mechanism by which shear stress induces IL-6 expression in human chondrocytes. The human T/C-28a2 chondrocyte cell line was chosen as a model system, because T/C-28a2 cells have been shown to behave much like primary human chondrocytes when cultured under appropriate conditions (19Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 20Goldring M.B. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 100: 37-52PubMed Google Scholar). In view of previous observations showing a positive correlation between endogenous COX-2-mediated PGE2 production and IL-6 synthesis (24Anderson G.D. Hauser S.D. McGarity K.L. Bremer M.E. Isakson P.C. Gregory S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2672-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 25Hinson R.M. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4885-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), we first evaluated the effects of shear stress on COX-2 expression and formation of cAMP, because PGE2 is a well-known activator of the cAMP signaling pathway. In accord with prior data (17Healy Z.R. Zhu F. Stull J.D. Konstantopoulos K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C1146-C1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), high shear stress (20 dyn/cm2) rapidly induces COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B) expression in human T/C-28a2 chondrocytes and cAMP production (Fig. 1C). IL-6 mRNA and protein up-regulation follows later, after 30–60 min of cell stimulation with fluid shear (Fig. 1, D and E). Treatment of T/C-28a2 chondrocytes with the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 (30 μm) markedly suppresses both intracellular cAMP accumulation (Fig. 1C) and IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig. 1D), suggesting the potential involvement of cAMP in shear-induced IL-6 synthesis in human chondrocytes. To validate previously published observations suggesting that T/C-28a2 cells represent an appropriate model for studying chondrocyte function in vitro (19Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 20Goldring M.B. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 100: 37-52PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the responses of human primary articular chondrocytes to shear stress (20 dyn/cm2). Our data revealing significant similarities between primary articular chondrocytes and T/C-28a2 cells in the induction of IL-6 mRNA synthesis in response to shear stress (Fig. 1D) reinforce the aforementioned notion. The effects of PGE2 are mediated via four different transmembrane GPCRs, namely EP1–4, which are involved in the activation of phospholipase C (EP1) and activation (EP2, EP4) or inhibition (EP3) of adenyl cyclase (13Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11613-11617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In agreement with previously published data from primary human chondrocytes (26Aoyama T. Liang B. Okamoto T. Matsusaki T. Nishijo K. Ishibe T. Yasura K. Nagayama S. Nakayama T. Nakamura T. Toguchida J. J. Bone Miner Res. 2005; 20: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), T/C-28a2 cells express EP2, EP3 and very low levels of EP4, but lack EP1, receptors (supplemental Fig. S2A). As a next step, we assessed the influence of shear stress on EP receptor expression. Application of high fluid shear up-regulates EP2 (Fig. 2, A and C) while it down-regulates EP3 (Fig. 2, B and D) receptor expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. No significant changes are noted in the mRNA expression levels of EP1 and EP4 receptors in sheared relative to static control T/C-28a2 chondrocytes (supplemental Fig. S2B). The divergent effects of shear stress on EP2 and EP3 receptor expression are in line with the enhanced cAMP accumulation observed in shear-activated chondrocytes (Fig. 1C). Thus, we next investigated the effects of an EP2 receptor antagonist, AH6809 (9Chen B.C. Liao C.C. Hsu M.J. Liao Y.T. Lin C.C. Sheu J.R. Lin C.H. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Attur M. Al-Mussawir H.E. Patel J. Kitay A. Dave M. Palmer G. Pillinger M.H. Abramson S.B. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5082-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and an EP3 receptor agonist, sulprostone (14Li X. Ellman M. Muddasani P. Wang J.H. Cs-Szabo G. van Wijnen A.J. Im H.J. Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), on shear-induced cAMP formation and IL-6 synthesis. Incubation of T/C-28a2 chondrocytes with AH6809 (3 μm) does not alter the mRNA, and protein expression levels of EP2 receptor in shear-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, A and C). However, this pharmacological intervention dramatically attenuates shear-induced cAMP production (Fig. 2G) and IL-6 mRNA expression (Fig. 2E) in T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. Similarly, sulprostone (1 μm), although it does not impair the EP3 receptor transcript and protein levels (Fig. 2, B and D), inhibits the accumulation of cAMP (Fig. 2G) and IL-6 synthesis (Fig. 2F) in sheared chondrocytes. To verify the involvement of EP2 receptor in the signaling pathway of IL-6 induction in shear-stimulated chondrocytes, and given the rather non-selective nature of AH6809 (28Chan C.L. Jones R.L. Lau H.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), experiments were carried out by transfecting T/C-28a2 cells with an EP2 shRNA-containing plasmid. This genetic intervention effectively knocks down EP2 protein (Fig. 3A) and mRNA (Fig. 3C) expression in sheared T/C-28a2 chondrocytes relative to cells transfected with a scramble shRNA control. EP2 receptor knockdown also inhibits the shear-induced accumulation of intracellular cAMP (Fig. 3E) and IL-6 mRNA synthesis (Fig. 3F). Similarly, to confirm the role of EP3 receptor in this signaling pathway, and in view of its shear-induced down-regulation, T/C-28a2 chondrocytes were transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA of EP3 receptor. The efficacy of EP3 receptor overexpression is demonstrated at both the translational (Fig. 3B) and transcriptional (Fig. 3D) levels relative to cells transfected with an empty vector. Moreover, this genetic intervention results in a drastic reduction of cAMP formation (Fig. 3E) and IL-6 synthesis (Fig. 3F) in sheared T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. Taken together, our data reveal that shear stress up-regulates and down-regulates EP2 and EP3 receptor expression, respectively, thereby elevating intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn play a key role in the induction of IL-6. We next aimed to delineate the signaling mechanism of IL-6 up-regulation in sheared chondrocytes. In view of our observations showing that shear-induced cAMP formation precedes IL-6 mRNA expression in human chondrocytes (Fig. 1), we examined the potential contribution of downstream effectors of cAMP activity to this signaling cascade, which include PI3-K and PKA (29Ciullo I. Diez-Roux G. Di Domenico M. Migliaccio A. Avvedimento E.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1186-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Exposure of T/C-28a2 chondrocytes to high shear stress increases the phosphorylation levels of Akt at Ser-473 and CREB at Ser-133 without affecting total Akt and CREB levels (Fig. 4). The shear-induced Akt and CREB phosphorylation are significantly suppressed by treating T/C-28a2 cells with the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 (Fig. 4A), the EP2 receptor antagonist AH6809 or the EP3 receptor agonist sulprostone (Fig. 4B). Along these lines, selective EP2 receptor knockdown or EP3 receptor overexpression (Fig. 4C) reverses shear-induced Akt and CREB phosphorylation to near background levels in T/C-28a2 chondrocytes. To evaluate the involvement of PI3-K in the regulation of shear-induced IL-6 mRNA synthesis in human chondrocytes, T/C-28a2 cells were treated with the selective PI3-K inhibitors, LY294002 (30 μm) or wortmannin (10 μm). These pharmacological inhibitors abrogate the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 without affecting total Akt levels (Fig. 5D), and markedly attenuate shear-induced IL-6 mRNA synthesis (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, t"
https://openalex.org/W2063907721,"The Ras-assocation domain family (RASSF) of tumor suppressor proteins until recently contained six proteins named RASSF1–6. Recently, four novel family members, RASSF7–10, have been identified by homology searches for RA-domain-containing proteins. These additional RASSF members are divergent and structurally distinct from RASSF1–6, containing an N-terminal RA domain and lacking the Sav/RASSF/Hpo (SARAH) domain. Here, we show that RASSF8 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the murine embryo and in normal human adult tissues. Functionally, RNAi-mediated knockdown of RASSF8 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, increased anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and enhanced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Furthermore, EdU staining of RASSF8-depleted cells showed growth suppression in a manner dependent on contact inhibition. We show that endogenous RASSF8 is not only found in the nucleus, but is also membrane associated at sites of cell–cell adhesion, co-localizing with the adherens junction (AJ) component β-catenin and binding to E-cadherin. Following RASSF8 depletion in two different lung cancer cell lines using alternative small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences, we show that AJs are destabilized and E-cadherin is lost from the cell membrane. The AJ components β-catenin and p65 are also lost from sites of cell–cell contact and are relocalized to the nucleus with a concomitant increase in β-catenin-dependent and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent signaling following RASSF8 depletion. RASSF8 may also be required to maintain actin -cytoskeletal organization since immunofluorescence analysis shows a striking disorganization of the actin- cytoskeleton following RASSF8 depletion. Accordingly, scratch wound healing studies show increased cellular migration in RASSF8-deficient cells. These results implicate RASSF8 as a tumor suppressor gene that is essential for maintaining AJs function in epithelial cells and have a role in epithelial cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2055518825,"Orchestrated regulation of neuronal migration and morphogenesis is critical for neuronal development and establishment of functional circuits, but its regulatory mechanism is incompletely defined. We established and analyzed mice with neural-specific knock-out of Trio, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor with multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factor domains. Knock-out mice showed defective cerebella and severe signs of ataxia. Mutant cerebella had no granule cells in the internal granule cell layer due to aberrant granule cell migration as well as abnormal neurite growth. Trio-deficient granule cells showed reduced extension of neurites and highly branched and misguided processes with perturbed stabilization of actin and microtubules. Trio deletion caused down-regulation of the activation of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, and mutant granule cells appeared to be unresponsive to neurite growth-promoting molecules such as Netrin-1 and Semaphorin 6A. These results suggest that Trio may be a key signal module for the orchestrated regulation of neuronal migration and morphogenesis during cerebellar development. Trio may serve as a signal integrator decoding extrinsic signals to Rho GTPases for cytoskeleton organization."
https://openalex.org/W2010544588,"Crosslinks between the active and inactive M3R and the G-protein Gq to which it couples reveal GPCR-G protein movements that can occur upon agonist binding and define basic architectural features of the interface. The interaction of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) with heterotrimeric G proteins represents one of the most fundamental biological processes. However, the molecular architecture of the GPCR–G protein complex remains poorly defined. In the present study, we applied a comprehensive GPCR–G protein α subunit (Gα) chemical cross-linking strategy to map a receptor-Gα interface, both before and after agonist-induced receptor activation. Using the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R)-Gαq system as a model system, we examined the ability of ~250 combinations of cysteine-substituted M3R and Gαq proteins to undergo cross-link formation. We identified many specific M3R-Gαq contact sites, in both the inactive and active receptor conformations, allowing us to draw conclusions regarding the basic architecture of the M3R-Gαq interface and the nature of the conformational changes following receptor activation. As heterotrimeric G proteins as well as most GPCRs share a high degree of structural homology, our findings should be of broad general relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2046018151,"DNA polymerases must select nucleotides that preserve Watson-Crick base pairing rules and choose substrates with the correct (deoxyribose) sugar. Sugar discrimination represents a great challenge because ribonucleotide triphosphates are present at much higher cellular concentrations than their deoxy-counterparts. Although DNA polymerases discriminate against ribonucleotides, many therapeutic nucleotide analogs that target polymerases have sugar modifications, and their efficacy depends on their ability to be incorporated into DNA. Here, we investigate the ability of DNA polymerase β to utilize nucleotides with modified sugars. DNA polymerase β readily inserts dideoxynucleoside triphosphates but inserts ribonucleotides nearly 4 orders of magnitude less efficiently than natural deoxynucleotides. The efficiency of ribonucleotide insertion is similar to that reported for other DNA polymerases. The poor polymerase-dependent insertion represents a key step in discriminating against ribonucleotides because, once inserted, a ribonucleotide is easily extended. Likewise, a templating ribonucleotide has little effect on insertion efficiency or fidelity. In contrast to insertion and extension of a ribonucleotide, the chemotherapeutic drug arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate is efficiently inserted but poorly extended. These results suggest that the sugar pucker at the primer terminus plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis; a 3′-endo sugar pucker facilitates nucleotide insertion, whereas a 2′-endo conformation inhibits insertion.

To maintain faithful DNA synthesis, DNA polymerases have evolved to select a dNTP from a pool of structurally similar molecules that preserve Watson-Crick base pairing. This is facilitated by geometric constraints (size, shape, and hydrogen bonding potential) imposed by the template strand, primer terminus, and polymerase. Although the fidelity of base substitution errors, and their correction, has been extensively studied, the fidelity of sugar discrimination has received much less attention. It is well recognized that the dNTP pool imbalances influence DNA polymerase fidelity. In this context, cellular rNTP levels are far greater than their dNTP counterparts (1Ferraro P. Franzolin E.

Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). To prevent significant levels of RNA synthesis during replication and repair, DNA polymerases must inherently discriminate against nucleotides with a ribose sugar (i.e. possessing a 2′-OH) and select 2′-deoxyribose triphosphates. Previous studies with A- and B-family polymerases have found significant effects on nucleotide incorporation as a result of modifying the deoxyribose ring (3Astatke M. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. J.

DNA polymerase β is a critical component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which operates to repair simple DNA lesions. It is best suited for filling short DNA gaps (1–5 nucleotides) after a lesion-specific DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease have removed the damaged base and incised the abasic site (9Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β is composed of an 8-kDa lyase domain and a 31-kDa polymerase domain with functionally distinct subdomains as follows: DNA binding (D), catalytic (C), and nascent base pair binding (N) (10Beard W.A.

Several global conformational changes occur when pol β binds substrates. The most notable change occurs when the N-subdomain of the binary enzyme-DNA complex closes around the nascent base pair upon binding a correct or incorrect dNTP. This subdomain re-positioning from an open binary to a closed ternary complex is accompanied by subtle protein side chain and DNA-nucleotide re-adjustments (11Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D.

Importantly, two α-helices (M and N) of this subdomain provide key interactions with the sugar and base moieties of the incoming nucleotide (Fig. 1). In addition, the primer terminus provides significant interactions that influence insertion efficiency (11Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H.

The C-subdomain includes acidic side chains (Asp-190, Asp-192, and Asp-256) that coordinate two essential divalent magnesium ions that are required for catalysis. Among other roles, these metals coordinate nonbridging oxygens of the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide. Several other side chains of the C-subdomain also participate in metal coordination or binding of the triphosphate portion of the incoming nucleotide. One approach to dissect the mechanism of nucleotide selectivity is to employ a series of analogs that are strategically modified to resemble the natural substrate. This popular approach has been successfully applied to examine incoming nucleotide base attributes (size, volume, hydrogen bonding capacity, and charge) that influence nucleotide binding, insertion, and fidelity (19Kool E.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 191-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To a lesser extent, this approach has also been used to probe triphosphate attributes that influence binding with pol β (20Liang F. Jain N. Hutchens T. Shock D.D. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H.

Relative to base substitution fidelity, much less is understood about sugar discrimination as it pertains to X-family DNA polymerases. The polymerase domain of members of this family is structurally homologous; however, many subtle structural differences exist that fine tune their catalytic activities to be able to utilize specific substrates necessary to fulfill their biological function (25Moon A.F.

Here, we investigate the effects of modifying the deoxyribose sugar of the incoming nucleotide on insertion efficiency and fidelity of pol β. More importantly, we examine whether insertion of a ribonucleotide influences further synthesis or whether a ribonucleotide in the template (coding) position alters DNA synthesis or fidelity. The biological significance of these results is discussed. Ultrapure rNTP and dNTP solutions were purchased from Sigma, and [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The ddNTPs were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and araCTP was purchased from Jena Biosciences (Germany). Human pol β was purified as described previously (26Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was determined by absorbance of 280 nm (ɛ = 23,380 m−1 cm−1) (18Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Batra V.K.

A 34-mer oligonucleotide substrate with a single-nucleotide gap was prepared by annealing three high pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) to create a single-nucleotide gap at position 16. Each oligonucleotide was dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and their concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The upstream primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using Optikinase (United States Biochemical Corp.), and free radioactive ATP was removed using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad). The downstream oligonucleotide was synthesized with a 5′-phosphate. The DNA substrates were annealed (1:1.2:1.2, primer/template/downstream oligonucleotide) as described previously (see Fig. 2A) (15Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31921-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide gap-filling reactions were determined as described previously (15Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31921-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Reactions typically contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 nm single-nucleotide gapped DNA, and varying concentrations of nucleoside triphosphate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and run at 37 °C. Enzyme concentrations and reaction time intervals were chosen so that substrate depletion or product inhibition did not influence initial velocity measurements. Reactions (30 μl) were quenched with 15 μl of 0.3 m EDTA and 45 μl of 95% formamide dye (bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Products were separated on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified using phosphorimagery and ImageQuant software. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. To determine how the structure of the deoxyribose sugar affects nucleotide incorporation by pol β, we examined various nucleotide sugars modified at C2′ and C3′ of the furanose ring and measured how efficiently pol β inserted them in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate (Fig. 2). A dideoxynucleoside triphosphate (ddNTP) lacks the 3′-OH on the deoxyribose ring and thus prevents further DNA synthesis once it has been inserted (Fig. 2B). These modified nucleotides are the basis for Sanger DNA sequencing and are commonly employed to capture crystallographic ternary (polymerase-dideoxyterminated DNA-dNTP) substrate complex structures of DNA polymerases poised for catalysis. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that pol β efficiently inserted ddCTP in a single-nucleotide gap with a templating dG, which was only 3.3-fold less efficient than insertion with dCTP (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained for the reciprocal base pair, i.e. pol β incorporated ddGTP only 2-fold less efficiently than dGTP opposite template dC (data not shown).TABLE 1Incorporation and misinsertion efficiencies of modified sugars by DNA polymerase βIncoming nucleotidekcatKmkcat/KmSugar discriminationaSugar discrimination is defined as (kcat/Km)deoxy/(kcat/Km)NTP, where NTP refers to the incoming nucleotide with a deoxy-, dideoxy-, ribo-, or arabinose sugar.10−2(s−1)μm10−3(s−1μm−1)dCTP38.8 (0.6)0.42 (0.05)900 (100)1ddCTP12 (3)0.45 (0.07)270 (80)3.3rCTP4.6 (0.7)400 (90)0.11 (0.03)8200araCTP34 (7)3.5 (0.4)100 (20)9dATP0.43 (0.06)710 (10)0.0060 (0.0008)150,000ddATP0.038 (0.005)150 (30)0.0025 (0.0006)360,000dTTP1.3 (0.2)1300 (300)0.010 (0.003)90,000ddTTP0.6 (0.2)470 (40)0.013 (0.004)69,000a Sugar discrimination is defined as (kcat/Km)deoxy/(kcat/Km)NTP, where NTP refers to the incoming nucleotide with a deoxy-, dideoxy-, ribo-, or arabinose sugar. Open table in a new tab Likewise, the absence of 3′-OH on the deoxyribose sugar had little effect on misincorporation. DNA polymerase β misinserted dATP and ddATP opposite template dG with catalytic efficiencies of 6.0 × 10−6 and 2.5 × 10−6 s−1 μm−1, respectively. Similarly, dTTP and ddTTP were misincorporated opposite template dG with comparable catalytic efficiencies (Table 1). Thus, pol β does not discriminate between dideoxy- and deoxyribose sugars. As expected, however, incorrect dNTPs and ddNTPs were inserted much more slowly and bound more weakly than when forming a Watson-Crick base pair. Although 3′-OH had little effect on nucleotide incorporation, adding an additional hydroxyl at C2′ had a much greater impact. DNA polymerase β inserted rCTP more than 3 orders of magnitude less efficiently than dCTP opposite template dG in a single-nucleotide gapped substrate (Table 1 and Fig. 3B) consistent with previously reported results (27Nick McElhinny S.A. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The loss in efficiency was due to a lower binding affinity (70-fold) and slower rate of insertion of rCTP (220-fold). 3When DNA product release is rapid, kcat and Km values are equivalent to kpol and Kd. Accordingly, the fold effect was calculated from the kinetic constants in Table 1 (rCTP) and previously reported constants (kpol, Kd) for dCTP (17Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate (araCTP) is the active form of a common chemotherapeutic and antiviral drug. araCTP and rCTP have 2′-OH on opposite sides of the plane of the sugar (2′-OH is nearer cytosine for araCTP, see Fig. 2B). araCTP was incorporated much more efficiently than rCTP opposite dG (900-fold relative to rCTP and 9-fold lower than dCTP, see Table 1 and Fig. 3B), despite its close structural resemblance to rCTP. Products formed from the addition of either araCTP or rCTP were easily distinguishable from the incorporation of dCTP due to differences in gel mobility (data not shown). Thus, the simple inversion of the 2′-OH configuration results in a significant recovery of catalytic efficiency for pol β. Significantly, despite the relative inefficient incorporation of rNTPs, pol β inserted a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar (correct base, i.e. rCTP) more efficiently than misinserting a nucleotide with an incorrect base (correct sugar, i.e. dTTP, 4dTTP was selected as the dNTP most likely to be misinserted opposite template dG, as determined previously (14Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R7-R13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to its ability to form a Wobble base pair. see Table 1 and Fig. 3B) opposite template dG. This indicates that pol β prefers incorporating the nucleotide that maintained Watson-Crick base pairing rather than the nucleotide that would maintain the identity of the sugar suggesting that the incorrect base distorted the active site more than a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar. Because pol β can incorporate rNTPs, albeit inefficiently, we probed how detrimental a single ribonucleotide could be in various DNA gap contexts on pol β insertion and fidelity. For a ribonucleotide to persist in DNA, the incorporated ribonucleotide needs to be extended to bury this aberrant residue. DNA polymerase β does not possess an intrinsic 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activity that might remove a nucleotide with the wrong sugar. To determine how efficiently pol β could extend a ribonucleotide, we designed an upstream primer with a single rCMP at the 3′-end that correctly base-paired with the upstream template base dGMP (Fig. 4A), and we examined the ability of pol β to add the next correct nucleotide. We maintained dG as our template nucleotide to directly compare with the kinetic parameters obtained for ribonucleotide incorporation (Table 1). The catalytic efficiencies for dCTP incorporation were comparable for rNMP- and dNMP-terminated primers, 1.0 and 0.90 s−1 μm−1, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Moreover, we determined catalytic efficiencies for misinsertion of dTTP opposite template dG for both dNMP- and rNMP-terminated primers. The results indicate that a ribonucleotide at the primer terminus does not influence misinsertion or fidelity (Fig. 4B). The relative discrimination for dTTP compared with dCTP was 9 × 104 for both primers. These results suggest that a ribonucleotide at the 3′-primer terminus does not significantly perturb the conformation of the primer terminus or the incoming nucleotide.TABLE 2Incorporation and misinsertion efficiencies on various ribonucleotide-containing oligonucleotidesIncoming nucleotidekcatKmkcat/Km10−2(s−1)μm10−3s−1μm−1X = rC; Y = dG; Z = dGdCTP80 (10)0.8 (0.2)1000 (300)rCTP5.3 (0.7)200 (20)0.27 (0.04)dTTP2.0 (0.7)1800 (300)0.011 (0.004)X = dC; Y = rG; Z = dGdCTP8.6 (0.7)0.75 (0.03)110 (10)rCTP0.25 (0.03)560 (50)0.0044 (0.0007)dTTP0.11 (0.01)1100 (200)0.0010 (0.0002)X = rC; Y = rG; Z = dGdCTP27 (3)0.62 (0.03)440 (50)rCTP0.90 (0.06)610 (70)0.015 (0.002)dTTP0.24 (0.02)690 (40)0.0035 (0.0004)X = dC; Y = dG; Z = rGdCTP60 (10)5.3 (0.8)110 (30)rCTP0.51 (0.06)810 (80)0.006 (0.001)dTTP0.081 (0.009)880 (80)0.0009 (0.0001) Open table in a new tab To determine whether pol β could insert two consecutive ribonucleotides, we measured the catalytic efficiency for rCTP incorporation opposite template dG using the rNMP-terminated primer. DNA polymerase β was able to incorporate rCTP on a ribo-terminated primer (i.e. rCMP) similar to that with a dCMP-terminated primer (Fig. 4B and Table 2). These results demonstrate that ribonucleotide discrimination for the nascent base pair is independent of the identity of the sugar (i.e. deoxyribose or ribose) at the primer terminus. This also suggested that pol β could insert consecutive ribonucleotides with the same efficiency as long as proper Watson-Crick base pairing was maintained. In contrast to efficient insertion of araCTP, pol β was extremely slow at extension of an araC-terminated primer (Fig. 5). DNA polymerase β was preincubated with araCTP and a two-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate to generate a single-nucleotide gapped substrate. Correct insertion of dATP opposite the templating dT was measured (Fig. 5A). The efficiency of dATP addition on an araC-terminated primer (kcat/Km = 8.8 × 10−3 s−1 μm−1; Fig. 5B) was 110-fold lower than insertion opposite a single-nucleotide gap dT annealed to a dC-terminated primer (kcat/Km = 1.0 s−1 μm−1, data not shown). Therefore, araCTP is inserted much more efficiently than rCTP, but pol β prefers to add the next correct deoxynucleotide on a ribo-terminated primer rather than an arabino-terminated primer. Because the presence of a single ribonucleotide at the primer terminus had little effect on extension, we examined if other termini would also be tolerated by pol β. We modified the upstream template sugar from dGMP to rGMP and annealed the resulting template to the dC- and rC-terminated primers to create rG-dC and rG-rC (template-primer) 5The terminus nomenclature is aY − bX, where X and Y are the bases A, T/U, C, or G, and a and b are the sugars, deoxyribose (d) or ribose (r), as illustrated in Fig. 2A. termini, respectively. We maintained correct Watson-Crick base pairing at the terminus in all sequence contexts because mismatched termini have been shown to have variable effects on dNTP extension (15Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31921-31929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for extension of these termini are tabulated in Table 2, and their catalytic efficiencies for extension are plotted in Fig. 6. Altering the upstream template strand sugar from dGMP to rGMP decreased the catalytic efficiency of correct incorporation (i.e. dCTP opposite template dG) 8.2-fold and decreased the efficiency of dTTP misinsertion 10-fold (Table 2 and Fig. 6B). Surprisingly, changing the terminus from a deoxynucleotide to a ribonucleotide base pair (i.e. dG-dC to rG-rC) had less of an effect on both correct incorporation of dCTP and misinsertion of dTTP (2- and 3-fold, respectively; see Table 2 and Fig. 6B), suggesting that a ribonucleotide base pair at the terminus does not significantly distort the DNA duplex relative to a deoxy-terminal base pair. The relative discrimination of dTTP compared with dCTP was not significantly affected by rG-dC or rG-rC termini compared with the dG-rC and dG-dC termini (Figs. 4B and 6B and Table 2). We also examined incorporation of rCTP opposite template dG using both rG-dC and rG-rC termini. Interestingly, when the upstream template nucleotide was modified from dGMP to rGMP, rCTP insertion decreased 25-fold (Table 2 and Fig. 6B), but when the terminus became a ribonucleotide base pair (i.e. rG-rC), rCTP efficiency decreased only 7.3-fold relative to when the terminus was a deoxynucleotide base pair (i.e. dG-dC, see Table 2 and Fig. 6B). Together, these data suggest that a ribonucleotide immediately upstream from the templating base has the greatest effect on the efficiency of extension by pol β in all of the termini sequence contexts examined. A persistent ribonucleotide in duplex DNA may serve as a templating residue during DNA replication and repair. Thus, we investigated whether a ribonucleotide templating residue influences dNTP insertion and fidelity. To determine the effect of a ribose sugar in the templating position, we changed the dG at the templating position of our single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate to rG, to maintain the identity of the base while altering the sugar (Table 2 and Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7B, changing this template position to a ribonucleotide generally decreased catalytic efficiency for correct insertion of dCTP ∼8-fold, whereas misinsertion of dTTP was 11-fold less efficient with a template rG relative to dG (Table 2). Accordingly, the relative discrimination for dTTP was unaltered because both correct and incorrect efficiency decreased to about the same extent. Thus, a ribonucleotide in the template (coding) position results in a modest distortion of the nascent base pair for both correct and incorrect insertions. Interestingly, pol β was able to insert rCTP opposite a ribonucleotide at the template position (i.e. creating a ribonucleotide base pair), but this process was 18-fold less efficient than inserting rCTP opposite a deoxynucleotide template sugar (Fig. 7B and Table 2). This was surprising given the fact that pol β is a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, yet it apparently can read a ribonucleotide in a template to incorporate an incoming rNTP (albeit slow) and make a proper Watson-Crick base pair. To determine the contribution of the deoxyribose ring on nucleotide insertion, we examined the ability of pol β to incorporate sugars modified at the 2′ and 3′ positions. Crystallographic structures of substrate complexes of polymerases from several families indicate that 3′-OH of the incoming nucleotide is within hydrogen bonding distance to a nonbridging oxygen on the β-phosphate (pro-(Sp)). For pol β, and other members of the X-family, a conserved arginine residue (Arg-183 in pol β, see Fig. 1B) also forms a hydrogen bond with this nonbridging oxygen. DNA polymerase β inserted ddNTPs only 2–3-fold less efficiently than dNTPs in a single-nucleotide gapped DNA template indicating that the polymerase did not require a hydroxyl at C3′ of the incoming nucleotide for efficient nucleotide incorporation. More importantly, this result suggests that Arg-183 was sufficient to stabilize the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide in the absence of O3′. The sensitivity of A-family DNA polymerases toward ddNTPs depends on the identity (phenylalanine or tyrosine) of a conserved aromatic residue. Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment, Phe-762) and TaqDNA polymerase (Phe-667) discriminate against ddNTPs, whereas T7 DNA polymerase (Tyr-526) and pol γ (Tyr-951) do not. Changing this residue to the alternative aromatic side chain alters dideoxynucleotide discrimination accordingly; phenylalanine discriminates against and tyrosine facilitates ddNTP incorporation (3Astatke M.

These residues appear to be characteristic for aminoacyl-CP-oxidizing P450s, allowing sequence based identification of P450 function for this subgroup of P450s that play vital roles in the biosyntheses of many important natural products in addition to the vancomycin-type antibiotics. The ability to analyze such P450 function based upon sequence data alone should prove an important tool in the analysis and identification of new medicinally relevant biomolecules. The cytochrome P450 OxyD from the balhimycin glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthetic operon of Amycolatopsis mediterranei is involved in the biosynthesis of the modified amino acid β-R-hydroxytyrosine, an essential precursor for biosynthesis of the vancomycin-type aglycone. OxyD binds the substrate tyrosine not free in solution, but rather covalently linked to the carrier protein (CP) domain of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase BpsD, exhibiting micromolar binding affinity to a tyrosine-loaded carrier protein construct. The crystal structure of OxyD was determined to 2.1-Å resolution, revealing a potential binding site for the carrier protein-bound substrate in a different orientation to that seen with the acyl carrier protein-bound P450BioI (Cryle, M. J., and Schlichting, I. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 15696–15701).

https://openalex.org/W1985445562,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which consists of multiple domains arranged as abb'xa'c, is a key enzyme responsible for oxidative folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this work we focus on the conformational plasticity of this enzyme. Proteolysis of native human PDI (hPDI) by several proteases consistently targets sites in the C-terminal half of the molecule (x-linker and a' domain) leaving large fragments in which the N terminus is intact. Fluorescence studies on the W111F/W390F mutant of full-length PDI show that its fluorescence is dominated by Trp-347 in the x-linker which acts as an intrinsic reporter and indicates that this linker can move between ""capped"" and ""uncapped"" conformations in which it either occupies or exposes the major ligand binding site on the b' domain of hPDI. Studies with a range of constructs and mutants using intrinsic fluorescence, collision quenching, and extrinsic probe fluorescence (1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate) show that the presence of the a' domain in full-length hPDI moderates the ability of the x-linker to generate the capped conformation (compared with shorter fragments) but does not abolish it. Hence, unlike yeast PDI, the major conformational plasticity of full-length hPDI concerns the mobility of the a' domain ""arm"" relative to the bb' ""trunk"" mediated by the x-linker. The chaperone and enzymatic activities of these constructs and mutants are consistent with the interpretation that the reversible interaction of the x-linker with the ligand binding site mediates access of protein substrates to this site."
https://openalex.org/W2023108832,"Cell survival and death play critical roles in tissues composed of post-mitotic cells. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) has been known to exert a distinct effect on cell susceptibility to apoptosis, protecting neuronal cells and deteriorating myocardial cells. These effects are primarily studied using protein kinase A activation. In this study we show the differential roles of Epac, an exchange protein activated by cAMP and a new effector molecule of cAMP signaling, in regulating apoptosis in these cell types. Both stimulation of Epac by 8-p-methoxyphenylthon-2′-O-methyl-cAMP and overexpression of Epac significantly increased DNA fragmentation and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated biotin nick end-labeling)-positive cell counts in mouse cortical neurons but not in cardiac myocytes. In contrast, stimulation of protein kinase A increased apoptosis in cardiac myocytes but not in neuronal cells. In cortical neurons the expression of the Bcl-2 interacting member protein (Bim) was increased by stimulation of Epac at the transcriptional level and was decreased in mice with genetic disruption of Epac1. Epac-induced neuronal apoptosis was attenuated by the silencing of Bim. Furthermore, Epac1 disruption in vivo abolished the 3-nitropropionic acid-induced neuronal apoptosis that occurs in wild-type mice. These results suggest that Epac induces neuron-specific apoptosis through increasing Bim expression. Because the disruption of Epac exerted a protective effect on neuronal apoptosis in vivo, the inhibition of Epac may be a consideration in designing a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Induction of apoptosis in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons and cardiac myocytes, has been thought to be responsible for such irreversible disorders as Alzheimer and Huntington diseases as well as stroke and heart failure (1Mattson M.P. Kroemer G. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 196-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The effect on cell death of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a major second messenger, has been extensively studied. In neuronal cells it is well known that activation of cAMP signals reduces the rate of neuronal cell death under a variety of stresses (i.e. β-amyloid protein, sialoglycopeptide, low potassium-induced neurotoxicity) (2D'Mello S.R.

Therefore, the model proposing that cAMP signaling plays a protective role in neuronal cells but a deteriorative role in myocardial cells is well accepted. Most studies that have demonstrated the effect of cAMP signaling on apoptosis have focused primarily on protein kinase A (PKA), 2The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase ABimBcl-2 interacting member proteinpMe-cAMP8-p-methoxyphenylthon-2′-O-methyl-cAMPBnz-cAMPN6-benzoyladenosine-cAMPRTreverse transcriptionTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated biotin nick end-labeling3-NP3-propionic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNADAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseKOknock-out. a classic target molecule of cAMP. Recent studies involving cAMP signaling have focused instead on Epac, an exchange protein activated by cAMP that has been identified as a new target of cAMP, independent of PKA (9Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Epac has been found to regulate a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, secretion, and differentiation (10Roscioni S.S. Elzinga C.R. Schmidt M. Naunyn. Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2008; 377: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that Epac either alone or with PKA plays a protective role in immune cells against apoptosis (11Grandoch M. Bujok V. Fleckenstein D. Schmidt M. Fischer J.W. Weber A.A. J.

To date two isoforms of Epac have been identified, Epac1 and Epac2 (9Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar); they differ in that Epac2 contains a second binding site for cAMP. It has recently been reported that there is an up-regulation of Epac1 mRNA in Alzheimer disease (13McPhee I. Gibson L.C. Kewney J. Darroch C. Stevens P.A. Spinks D. Cooreman A. MacKenzie S.J.

J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), implicating that cAMP signaling may not always play a protective role in neurons. The change in the Epac1 expression pattern has also been demonstrated in other cell types (i.e. heart, vasculature, kidney, and lung) (15Murray A.J. Shewan D.A. Mol. Cell.

The stoichiometry of Epac, especially of Epac1, and that of PKA might be changed in several diseases, including neuronal and cardiac disorders; this could lead to the various effects of cAMP signaling on cell death. Through experiments using Epac- or PKA-selective cAMP analogs and overexpression of Epac1 and the PKA catalytic subunit and Epac1-deficient mice, the present study demonstrates that cAMP signaling no longer increases neuronal cell viability when Epac is selectively activated: instead, cAMP signaling induces apoptosis through increasing Bcl-2 interacting member protein (Bim) expression. Our findings also suggest that the selective inhibition of Epac signaling may become a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. 8-p-Methoxyphenylthon-2′-O-methyl-cAMP (pMe-cAMP) and N6-benzoyladenosine-cAMP (Bnz-cAMP) were purchased from BioLog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany) and Sigma, respectively. Antibodies to Epac1, Epac2, and a PKA α catalytic subunit were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody to Bim was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, BC, Canada). Antibodies to Bim and cleaved caspase 3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). An antibody to Bcl-2 was purchased from BD Biosciences. Epac1 knock-out mice (Epac1 KO; accession number CDB0542K (LARGE (Laboratory for Animal Resources and Genetic Engineering)) were generated by means of homologous recombination (19Okumura S. Kawabe J. Yatani A. Takagi G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Takagi I. Sadoshima J. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, the targeting vector was constructed by inserting loxP/PGK-Neo-pA/loxP (LARGE) into exon 1 and exon 2 of the genomic Epac1 locus (see Fig. 7A). The targeting vector was introduced into TT2 embryonic stem cells, and homologous recombinant clones were first identified by PCR, then confirmed by Southern blot analysis (see Fig. 7B). The targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into CD-1 8-cell stage embryos, and the resultant male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6 females to establish germ line transmission. All experiments were performed on C57BL/6 and CBA mixed-background 3–5-month-old male homozygous Epac1 KO and wild type (WT) littermates from F1 heterozygote crosses. Mice were genotyped by PCR using a mixture of three primers (F1, TGA GAA GAG CCC CAT CGT TGT G; B1, GCC TGG CAC ATG GAA GTG AT; NeoF1, TGA ATG GAA GGA TTG GAG CTA CG) as indicated in Fig. 7A. The PCR conditions consisted of 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s each, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by 72 °C for 7 min (Fig. 7C). All experiments were performed on 3–5-month-old homozygous Epac1 KO mice and WT littermates. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Yokohama City University School of Medicine. Primary cortical neurons were isolated from the cortices of embryonic day 15–17 C57BL/6 or Epac1 KO mice, as previously described (20Yamashita N. Uchida Y. Ohshima T. Hirai S. Nakamura F. Taniguchi M. Mikoshiba K. Honnorat J. Kolattukudy P. Thomasset N. Takei K. Takahashi T. Goshima Y. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13357-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the cortex was incubated with 0.3% trypsin (Invitrogen) by titration; then cells were plated onto a 12-mm glass coverslip precoated with 6 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/glass. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% atmospheric air in a neurobasal medium containing 1× GlutaMAX-1, B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were used in experiments 4–7 days later. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1-day-old mice as previously described (21Geng Y.J. Ishikawa Y. Vatner D.E. Wagner T.E. Bishop S.P. Vatner S.F. Homcy C.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, myocytes were chopped into small pieces and digested with 0.1% collagenase type II and 0.04% pancreatin 3 times at 7-min intervals. To remove the non-myocyte fraction, the cells were plated onto culture dishes in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin for 45 min, after which the non-attached myocyte-rich fraction was plated onto a 12-mm glass coverslip precoated with 20 mg/ml laminin (Sigma) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/glass in the same medium. Twenty-four hours after plating, the culture medium was changed to minimum essential medium with an insulin-transferrin-selenium-A supplement (ITS-A, Invitrogen) containing 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% atmospheric air incubator at 37 °C. Primary culture of mouse renal epithelial cells was performed as previously described (22Biju M.P. Akai Y. Shrimanker N. Haase V.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F1217-F1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cortical neurons using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both the generation of cDNA and the RT-PCR analysis were performed as previously described (17Yokoyama U. Patel H.H. Lai N.C. Aroonsakool N. Roth D.M. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6386-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H.

Real-time PCR was executed using a MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and an SYBR Green kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Primers for amplification were designed based on Bim (5′-CCCGGAGATACGGATTGCAC-3′ and 5′- GCCTCGCGGTAATCATTTGC-3′) and 18 S ribosomal RNA. The forward and reverse primer set was designed between multiple exons. Abundance of mRNA was determined relative to that of 18 S ribosomal RNA. Partial fragments of mouse Epac1 and Epac2 cDNA clones were obtained by PCR. A mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was used as an internal control. Northern blotting was performed as previously described (24Ishikawa N. Shimada N. Munakata Y. Watanabe K. Kimura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14366-14372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cortical neurons and cardiac myocytes was performed as previously described (25Iwatsubo K. Suzuki S. Li C. Tsunematsu T. Nakamura F. Okumura S. Sato M. Minamisawa S. Toya Y. Umemura S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C1498-C1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells in 35-mm plastic dishes were lysed and collected with a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone or Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units of erythrina trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). After protein concentrations were determined using the RC DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed followed by densitometric analysis using LAS3000 and Science Lab Multi Gauge Version 3.0 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Lysates from cells treated with pMe-cAMP or Bnz-cAMP for 24 h were incubated with 2 μg of anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Bim antibody overnight. Immune complexes were captured with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). Beads were washed 3 times in the lysis buffer and boiled in an SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Billerica, MA). For construction of adenoviral vectors, full-length cDNA-encoding human Epac1, Epac2, and PKA α catalytic subunits were cloned into an adenoviral vector using an AdenoX adenovirus construction kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) (17Yokoyama U. Patel H.H. Lai N.C. Aroonsakool N. Roth D.M. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6386-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Human Epac1 and Epac2 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos of University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Adenovirus-mediated transfection was performed using LacZ control. The cells were infected with adenoviruses at the indicated multiplicities of infection and used for their corresponding assays 24 h later. Silencing of Bim was carried out using Accell SMARTpool siRNAs (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO), each of which contains four siRNAs designed for use with the Bim gene (5′-CUGGCUUCCUUUACGUUUU-3′, 5′-CUAUGAAUUGUAGAAGUAU-3′, 5′-CGCUUAUUUAAAUGUCUUA-3′, and 5′-UCAUAAUUAAGGAUUUGUA-3′) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 48 h after plating, cortical neurons were transfected with 1 μm siRNA and subsequently cultured in a neurobasal medium. The efficiency of the knockdown of the Bim protein was evaluated 72 h after transfection by Western blot analysis. Scrambled siRNAs for Bim-targeted siRNA (Dharmacon Inc.) were used as a negative control. In situ labeling of fragmented DNA in cultured cortical neurons and cardiac myocytes was performed using the DeadEndTM fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with the presence or absence of pMe-cAMP or Bnz-cAMP for 48 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, and then incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 200 mm potassium cacodylate (pH 6.6), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm cobalt chloride at room temperature for 10 min followed by 60 min of incubation with a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction buffer containing 100 μm dATP, 5 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 40 μm terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme at 37 °C. DNAs were stained with DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2 phenylindole). The percentage of the total cells that were TUNEL-positive was determined in a blinded manner. Approximately 2000–3000 cells in 10 randomly selected fields from each sample were counted. For detection of apoptosis in brain tissues from WT or Epac1 KO mice, deparaffinized tissue sections were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K and 50 mm EDTA in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then subjected to the equilibration step in the procedures described above. Histone-associated DNA fragments were quantified using the Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cortical neurons and cardiac myocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of pMe-cAMP or Bnz-cAMP for 48 h, they were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.2) and 0.1% Triton-X) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by vigorous shaking for 30 s. The cell lysates containing cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments were applied to a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. Subsequently, a mixture of biotin-labeled anti-histone antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was added, and the resulting mixture was incubated with moderate shaking for 2 h. After unbound antibodies were removed by washing, the amount of nucleosomes was quantified based on the peroxidase retained in the immune complex. The activity of the peroxidase was determined photometrically using 2,2-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonate] as a substrate. The values from triplicate absorbance (at 405 nm) measurements were then averaged. Mitochondrial membrane potential of cortical neurons was quantified using a MitocaptureTM Mitochondrial Apoptosis Detection kit (BioVision Inc., Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cortical neurons were incubated on a 12-mm glass coverslip in the presence or absence of pMe-cAMP or Bnz-cAMP for 48 h, then stained with Mitocapture reagent and incubated in DAPI to allow the visualization of all nuclei. The images were obtained using an inverted microscope (TE2000-E, Nikon, Japan). The red emission of the dye detected at 543 nm is due to a potential-dependent aggregation in the mitochondria reflecting normal membrane potential. Green fluorescence detected at 488 nm reflects the monomeric form of MitocaptureTM, appearing in the cytosol after mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The percentage of the total cells representing apoptotic cells was determined in a blinded manner by counting ∼1000–3000 cells in 10 randomly selected fields from each sample. Rap1 activity was measured using the EZ-Detect RAP1 activation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary renal epithelial cells from WT and Epac1 KO mice were lysed 15 min after stimulation with pMe-cAMP (50 μm). Cell lysates were incubated with the Rap binding domain RalGDS-RBD fused to a glutathione S-transferase disk. After cells were washed several times, bound GTP-Rap1 was removed from the disk through boiling in an SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Rap1 antibody. 3-Propionic acid (3-NP, Sigma) was prepared and administered as previously described (26Brouillet E. Jacquard C. Bizat N. Blum D. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 1521-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). 3-NP was dissolved in saline, and the resulting solution was adjusted to pH 7.3–7.4 with 5 n NaOH. 3-NP (140 mg/kg/day) was the injected intraperitoneally into the animals once per day for 2 days. Twenty-four hours after the second injection, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially injected with 10% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Brains were fixed in the same fixative solution overnight, immersed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, then embedded in paraffin. Sections 4 μm in thickness were subjected to TUNEL staining. All data are reported as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using Student's t test. For multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance was used with a Bonferroni post-hoc test. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. We first investigated whether the stimulation of Epac has similar effects on apoptosis in various kinds of post-mitotic cells using a primary culture of mouse cortical neurons and cardiac myocytes. Apoptosis was detected by means of TUNEL staining 48 h after treatment with pMe-cAMP or Bnz-cAMP, the Epac- and PKA-selective cAMP analogs, respectively (27Christensen A.E. Selheim F. de Rooij J. Dremier S. Schwede F. Dao K.K. Martinez A. Maenhaut C. Bos J.L. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35394-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We observed strong TUNEL labeling of apoptotic bodies in cortical neurons treated with pMe-cAMP (Fig. 1A, upper panels, inset). In contrast, pMe-cAMP did not induce apoptosis in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1A, lower panels). The number of TUNEL-positive cells was quantified, showing that stimulation of Epac significantly increased apoptosis in cortical neurons but not in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1, B and C). Because a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio is associated with greater vulnerability to apoptotic activation (28Chae I.H. Park K.W. Kim H.S. Oh B.H. Clin. Chim.

Cell Res. 2003; 13: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we quantified the protein expression of Bax/Bcl-2 to confirm our findings. Activation of Epac by pMe-cAMP increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in cortical neurons but not in cardiac myocytes (supplemental Fig. 1, A–D). It is already known that activation of cAMP/PKA signaling plays a protective role in neuronal cells but a deteriorative role in myocardial cells (30Communal C. Colucci W.S. Arch. Mal. Coeur. Vaiss. 2005; 98: 236-241PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang X. Tang X. Li M. Marshall J. Mao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16705-16713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In accordance with previous reports, the PKA-selective cAMP analog Bnz-cAMP induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes but not in cortical neurons, even at 100 μm (Fig. 1, A–C). These results suggest that the activation of Epac has different effects on apoptosis in neuronal cells and cardiac myocytes. To confirm that Epac was involved in neuronal cell death, we performed adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Epac1 and Epac2 (as both isoforms of Epac (9Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) are known to be activated by pMe-cAMP), a PKA α catalytic subunit, or a LacZ control. Overexpression of Epac1, Epac2, PKA α catalytic subunit proteins, or PKA α regulatory subunit proteins in cortical neurons and cardiac myocytes 12 h after infection with each adenovirus is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Endogenous protein expression of Epac1, Epac2, and PKA subunits was not significantly affected by any of the adenoviruses. We also confirmed that overexpression of PKA α catalytic subunit significantly increased PKA activity in cortical neurons (supplemental Fig. 2). Overexpression of Epac1 or Epac2, unlike LacZ, significantly increased the incidence of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in cortical neurons but not in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, overexpression of PKA increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in cardiac myocytes but not in cortical neurons. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay yielded results similar to those of TUNEL staining (Fig. 2, E and F), indicating that overexpression of Epac1 or Epac2 increased DNA fragmentation in cortical neurons but not in cardiac myocytes. Importantly, these results are different from those obtained through PKA overexpression, suggesting that, at least in part, Epac promotes neuronal, but not myocardial, apoptosis. The Bcl-2 interacting member (Bim) is a sensor of apoptotic stress located upstream of the Bcl-2 family. Bim regulates Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in apoptosis (32Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 33Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Bim protein was highly expressed in brain tissue and cortical neurons (Fig. 3, A and B) but was expressed either slightly or not at all in heart tissue and cardiac myocytes, as previously described (34Guo J. Gertsberg Z. Ozgen N. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35O'Reilly L.A. Cullen L. Visvader J. Lindeman G.J. Print C. Bath M.L. Huang D.C.

A previous paper suggested the involvement of cAMP/PKA signaling in regulating Bim expression in lymphoid cells (55Zhang L. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the change in the expression levels of Bim mRNA and protein in cortical neurons using pMe-cAMP. We found that pMe-cAMP increased expression of Bim mRNA and protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3C and see Fig. 5, C and F). Furthermore, pMe-cAMP, but not Bnz-cAMP, significantly increased Bim protein in cortical neurons 24 h after treatment (Fig. 3,D and E). These results suggest that the stimulation of Epac increases Bim expression by enhancing transcription in cortical neurons, although the stimulation of PKA does not.FIGURE 5Activation of Epac promoted interaction between Bcl-2 and Bim protein and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential in cortical neurons.

Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 proteins dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and activate specific target genes involved in cell-cycle progression. Despite its importance in cancer cells, the molecular mechanisms by which this protein is regulated in response to DNA damage remain to be characterized. In this study, we show that STAT3 is activated in response to topoisomerase I inhibition. Following treatment, STAT3 is phosphorylated on its C-terminal serine 727 residue but not on its tyrosine 705 site. We also show that topoisomerase I inhibition induced the up-regulation of the cdk5 kinase, a protein initially described in neuronal stress responses. In co-immunoprecipitations, cdk5 was found to associate with STAT3, and pulldown experiments indicated that it associates with the C-terminal activation domain of STAT3 upon DNA damage. Importantly, the cdk5-STAT3 pathway reduced DNA damage in response to topoisomerase I inhibition through the up-regulation of Eme1, an endonuclease involved in DNA repair.

In contrast to normal cells where its phosphorylation is only transient, constitutive activation of STAT3 has been reported in several primary cancers and tumor cell lines (1Bromberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 2Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This abnormal activation is due to oncogenic kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor, Her2/Neu, src, or bcr-abl, which induce STAT3 activation through phosphorylation of its tyrosine 705 residue (4Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation allows the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the STAT3 dimer and the up-regulation of several genes involved in cell-cycle and cell survival such as cyclin D1, Myc, or bclxl. The up-regulation of these cancer genes mediates the oncogenic activity of STAT3 and its ability to transform cells (5Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar).A second phosphorylation occurs on the serine 727 residue of the C-terminal activation domain. It has been proposed that this phosphorylation is necessary for maximal gene activation, because its mutation prevents STAT3 transcriptional function (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). It is believed that this modification favors the recruitment of transcriptional cofactors such as CBP, NcoA, or P-Tefb that binds to the C-terminal domain of the transcription factor (7Giraud S.

Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if the association of STAT3 with its coactivators is a direct consequence of Ser-727 phosphorylation.Although it was initially believed that the tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for STAT3 activity, several groups have recently reported that specific forms of the transcription factor, which are only phosphorylated on its Ser-727 residue, can induce gene activation. In prostate cancer, Ser-727 phosphorylation is sufficient to activate STAT3 and drive tumorigenesis in the absence of tyrosine 705 activation (11Qin H.R. Kim H.J. Kim J.Y. Hurt E.M. Klarmann G.J. Kawasaki B.T. Duhagon Serrat M.A. Farrar W.L. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7736-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Elegant results have shown that tyrosine 705 mutants can associate with NF-κB and induce the expression of genes such as mras or met, which are likely to play an important role in cell transformation by STAT3 (12Yang J. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Staugaitis S.M. Nguyen H. Schlessinger K. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R.

Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). These results lead to the important conclusion that the influence of STAT3 on cell transformation can be independent of the tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and that this site should not be considered as a unique marker of STAT3 oncogenic activity.This conclusion also leads to the hypothesis that STAT3 can induce different transcriptional programs, depending on which sites are phosphorylated and certainly on the type of stimulation. Although STAT3 activation is well characterized in response to growth factor stimulation, little is known about its regulation in response to other stimulation such as DNA damage and chemotherapy treatment. Interestingly, several studies have suggested that an abnormal activation of this transcription factor is associated with intrinsic drug resistance (15Barré B. Vigneron A. Perkins N. Roninson I.B. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 4-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). STAT3 expression has been associated with resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis (16Sano S. Chan K.S. Kira M. Kataoka K. Takagi S. Tarutani M. Itami S. Kiguchi K. Yokoi M. Sugasawa K. Mori T.

Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernández-Luna J.L. Nuñez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R.

Most of the time, escape to drug treatment is related to the STAT3-mediated expression of survival proteins such as bcl-xl or survivin (21Diaz N. Minton S. Cox C. Bowman T. Gritsko T. Garcia R. Eweis I. Wloch M. Livingston S. Seijo E. Cantor A. Lee J.H. Beam C.A. Sullivan D. Jove R. Muro-Cacho C.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 22Gritsko T.

Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor-src-STAT3 pathway can prevent senescence induction (23Vigneron A. Roninson I.B. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8927-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and activate DNA repair genes (24Vigneron A. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to confer resistance to chemotherapy treatments.In this study, we have further characterized the regulation of STAT3 during DNA damage. In colorectal cell lines, we have found that the transcription factor is phosphorylated on its serine 727 residue following topoisomerase I inhibition and that tyrosine 705 phosphorylation is not modified. In addition, we have also observed that this phosphorylation is due to the binding of the cdk5 kinase to the transcription factor. cdk5 is a serine/threonine kinase, which was initially characterized in postmitotic neurons. Once associated with its specific activators p35/p25, this protein plays an important role in neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and cytoskeletal functions (25Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar, 26Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In response to topoisomerase I inhibition, we have observed that cdk5 is activated and that it interacts with STAT3 to induce its serine phosphorylation. Cdk5 appeared to be involved in the STAT3-mediated regulation of the cyclin D1, myc, and Eme1 genes. Importantly, ChIP analysis showed that the transcription factor can be found associated with the Eme1 promoter when phosphorylated only on serine 727. We therefore propose that cdk5 regulates the STAT3-Eme1 pathway and that this is an important step in the response of colorectal tumors to topoisomerase I inhibition.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have found that the STAT3 transcription factor is phosphorylated on its serine C-terminal residue but not on tyrosine 705 upon topoisomerase I inhibition. Our results indicate that this is due to the activation of the cdk5 kinase, which binds to the C-terminal of domain of the transcription factor to induce its phosphorylation. Importantly, cdk5 is involved in the down-regulation of early G1 genes such as myc and cyclin D1 and in the STAT3-mediated up-regulation of the Eme1 gene, an endonuclease involved in the processing of damaged replication forks. In light of these results, we propose that the cdk5-STAT3-Eme1 pathway plays an important role in the response to topoisomerase I inhibition and chemotherapy treatments.It is well known that STAT3 is activated at the G0-G1 transition following cytokine or growth factor stimulation. In this condition, the transcription factor binds to the promoter of several cell cycle genes such as myc, cyclin D1, fos, or cdc25A to induce their expression and activate progression toward S phase. Gene activation by STAT3 during the G0-G1 transition is due to the phosphorylation of STAT3 on its tyrosine residue, followed by nuclear translocation and DNA binding. The second phosphorylation of STAT3 on its serine residue allows the contact of the tyrosine-phosphorylated dimer with transcriptional cofactors such as CBP, NcoA, or Ptefb. However, this pathway is probably not the only mechanism by which STAT proteins are activated, because several results have shown that these transcription factors induce transcription in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation. This was originally described with STAT1 when it was shown that this transcription factor can drive the expression of several genes in the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation (45Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Stark G.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Using non-phosphorylated forms of STAT3 on its tyrosine residue, Yang et al. have shown that these mutants can induce the expression of genes such as met and mras, which certainly play an important role in the oncogenic activity of STAT3. Under these conditions, gene activation is a consequence of the formation of a STAT3-NF-κB enhanceosome that plays a key role in transformed cells (12Yang J. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Staugaitis S.M. Nguyen H. Schlessinger K. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1396-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the genes regulated by STAT3 in these conditions are normally not activated when the transcription factor is phosphorylated on its tyrosine residue. This leads to the important conclusion that the STAT3 transcriptional targets depends on its post-translational modifications.Importantly, using ChIP analysis, we have been able to detect STAT3 on the Eme1 promoter when phosphorylated only on its Ser-727 residue. We therefore propose that STAT3 is activated by DNA damage during the G2 phase of the cell cycle and that its serine phosphorylation allows the specific up-regulation of DNA repair genes such as the Eme1 endonuclease. Surprisingly, the role of STAT3 in the response to genotoxic treatment has not been well characterized. By contrast, it is known that both STAT1 and STAT5 are regulated following DNA damage. STAT1 is involved in the S and G2/M checkpoints and can associate with repair signaling proteins such as Chk2 and Mdc1 in response to γ-irradiation (46Townsend P.A. Cragg M.S. Davidson S.M. McCormick J. Barry S. Lawrence K.M. Knight R.A. Hubank M. Chen P.L. Latchman D.S. Stephanou A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 47Thomas M. Finnegan C.E. Rogers K.M. Purcell J.W. Trimble A. Johnston P.G. Boland M.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8357-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, this transcription factor is also phosphorylated in response to topoisomerase inhibitors (47Thomas M. Finnegan C.E. Rogers K.M. Purcell J.W. Trimble A. Johnston P.G. Boland M.P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8357-8364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). STAT5 has been shown to regulate the expression of rad51 and, importantly, this has been linked to the ability of several oncogenic kinases such as bcr-abl or tel-jak2 to induce drug resistance (48Slupianek A. Schmutte C. Tombline G. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Hoser G. Nowicki M.O. Pierce A.J. Fishel R. Skorski T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 49Slupianek A. Hoser G. Majsterek I. Bronisz A. Malecki M. Blasiak J. Fishel R. Skorski T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4189-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent results also suggest that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of genome stability. The inactivation of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase induces a constitutive activation of STAT3 probably as a consequence of replication fork stalling, and this leads to aberrant mitoses with lagging chromosomes (50Shields B.J. Hauser C. Bukczynska P.E. Court N.W. Tiganis T. Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 166-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the link between STAT3 and DNA repair has not been characterized in this study, because this effect has been linked to a sustained expression of cyclin D1 during S phase. Further suggesting a link between STAT3 and DNA stability, it is well known that a direct target of STAT3, myc, can induce DNA damage and dysregulate genomic stability and DNA repair pathways (51Vafa O. Wade M. Kern S. Beeche M. Pandita T.K. Hampton G.M. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). In this study, we further extend these observations, showing that this transcription factor is activated by Cdk5 in response to topoisomerase I inhibitors. We speculate that this kinase allows the formation of a new STAT3 enhanceosome that would specifically regulate the expression of DNA repair genes upon genotoxic treatment. In light of recent results showing an essential role of NF-κB in the response to DNA damage (52Campbell K.J. Witty J.M. Rocha S. Perkins N.D. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), one interesting hypothesis is that genes involved in the response to sn38 are controlled by a specific STAT3-NF-κB complex that would be activated by cdk5. It will be interesting to determine if this enhanceosome preferentially binds DNA repair genes as opposed to more conventional STAT3 targets such as myc or cdc25A.As a consequence of DNA repair genes regulation, our results indicate that the cdk5-STAT3 pathway reduces DNA damage in response to topoisomerase I inhibition. This suggests that these proteins might play an essential role in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Further confirming the importance of this oncogenic cascade, recent results have shown that the cdk5-STAT3 pathway plays an essential role in thyroid carcinomas (53Lin H. Chen M.C. Chiu C.Y. Song Y.M. Lin S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2776-2784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have recently shown that STAT3 prevents the induction of senescence through p53-p21 inactivation (18Niu G. Wright K.L. Ma Y. Wright G.M. Huang M. Irby R. Briggs J.

Cell. 2005; 16: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cdk5 is also involved in senescence programs, because this kinase regulates cell morphology through ezrin and rac1 modulation (32Alexander K. Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2808-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1163-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine if cdk5 is also involved in the inactivation of the p53-p21 pathway by the STAT3 oncogene during senescence induction.In light of this study and other results (53Lin H. Chen M.C. Chiu C.Y. Song Y.M. Lin S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2776-2784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we therefore propose that cdk5 plays an important role in cell transformation by the STAT3 oncogene. Because it has been proposed that cell transformation induces an intrinsic resistance program to chemotherapy (56Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar), we speculate that cdk5-STAT3 provides cancer cells with intrinsic resistance capacities due to enhanced Eme1 expression and that this a corollary of cell transformation. We propose that the early detection on tumor biopsies of the cdk5-STAT3 oncogenic pathway, both of its phosphorylation status and of its target genes, will provide oncologists with a resistance profile indicative of tumors that will fail to respond to chemotherapy (15Barré B.

IntroductionSignal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) 3The abbreviations used are: STAT3signal transducers and activators of transcription 3ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCBPCREB-binding proteincdkcyclin-dependent kinasesiRNAsmall interference RNAPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptionIL-6interleukin-6FACSfluorescent-activated cell sorting. proteins are cytoplasmic transcription factors that translocate into the nucleus following growth factor stimulation. In contrast to normal cells where its phosphorylation is only transient, constitutive activation of STAT3 has been reported in several primary cancers and tumor cell lines (1Bromberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 2Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Lee C.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This abnormal activation is due to oncogenic kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor, Her2/Neu, src, or bcr-abl, which induce STAT3 activation through phosphorylation of its tyrosine 705 residue (4Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation allows the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of the STAT3 dimer and the up-regulation of several genes involved in cell-cycle and cell survival such as cyclin D1, Myc, or bclxl. The up-regulation of these cancer genes mediates the oncogenic activity of STAT3 and its ability to transform cells (5Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar).A second phosphorylation occurs on the serine 727 residue of the C-terminal activation domain. It has been proposed that this phosphorylation is necessary for maximal gene activation, because its mutation prevents STAT3 transcriptional function (6Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). It is believed that this modification favors the recruitment of transcriptional cofactors such as CBP, NcoA, or P-Tefb that binds to the C-terminal domain of the transcription factor (7Giraud S.

Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined if the association of STAT3 with its coactivators is a direct consequence of Ser-727 phosphorylation.Although it was initially believed that the tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for STAT3 activity, several groups have recently reported that specific forms of the transcription factor, which are only phosphorylated on its Ser-727 residue, can induce gene activation. In prostate cancer, Ser-727 phosphorylation is sufficient to activate STAT3 and drive tumorigenesis in the absence of tyrosine 705 activation (11Qin H.R. Kim H.J. Kim J.Y. Hurt E.M. Klarmann G.J. Kawasaki B.T. Duhagon Serrat M.A. Farrar W.L. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7736-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Elegant results have shown that tyrosine 705 mutants can associate with NF-κB and induce the expression of genes such as mras or met, which are likely to play an important role in cell transformation by STAT3 (12Yang J. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Staugaitis S.M. Nguyen H. Schlessinger K. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R.

Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 283-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). These results lead to the important conclusion that the influence of STAT3 on cell transformation can be independent of the tyrosine 705 phosphorylation and that this site should not be considered as a unique marker of STAT3 oncogenic activity.This conclusion also leads to the hypothesis that STAT3 can induce different transcriptional programs, depending on which sites are phosphorylated and certainly on the type of stimulation. Although STAT3 activation is well characterized in response to growth factor stimulation, little is known about its regulation in response to other stimulation such as DNA damage and chemotherapy treatment. Interestingly, several studies have suggested that an abnormal activation of this transcription factor is associated with intrinsic drug resistance (15Barré B. Vigneron A. Perkins N. Roninson I.B. Gamelin E. Coqueret O. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 4-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). STAT3 expression has been associated with resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis (16Sano S. Chan K.S. Kira M. Kataoka K. Takagi S. Tarutani M. Itami S. Kiguchi K. Yokoi M. Sugasawa K. Mori T.

MRSA is resistant to oxacillin because of the presence of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which allows peptidoglycan synthesis to continue after oxacillin-mediated acylation of native PBPs. We show that ECg binds predominantly to the cytoplasmic membrane (CM), initially decreasing the fluidity of the bilayer, and induces changes in gene expression indicative of an attempt to preserve and repair a compromised cell wall. On further incubation, the CM is reorganized; the amount of lysylphosphatidylglycerol is markedly reduced, with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylglycerol, and the proportion of branched chain fatty acids increases, resulting in a more fluid structure. We found no evidence that ECg modulates the enzymatic activity of PBP2a through direct binding to the protein but determined that PBP2 is delocalized from the FtsZ-anchored cell wall biosynthetic machinery at the septal division site following intercalation into the CM. We argue that many features of the ECg-induced phenotype can be explained by changes in the fluid dynamics of the CM."
https://openalex.org/W1985554302,"The malignant phenotype in breast cancer is driven by aberrant signal transduction pathways. Mixed-lineage kinase-3 (MLK3) is a mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that activates multiple MAPK pathways. Depending on the cellular context, MLK3 has been implicated in apoptosis, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Here we investigated the effect of MLK3 and its signaling to MAPKs in the acquisition of malignancy in breast cancer. We show that MLK3 is highly expressed in breast cancer cells. We provide evidence that MLK3's catalytic activity and signaling to c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is required for migration of highly invasive breast cancer cells and for MLK3-induced migration of mammary epithelial cells. Expression of active MLK3 is sufficient to induce the invasion of mammary epithelial cells, which requires AP-1 activity and is accompanied by the expression of several proteins corresponding to AP-1-regulated invasion genes. To assess MLK3's contribution to the breast cancer malignant phenotype in a more physiological setting, we implemented a strategy to inducibly express active MLK3 in the preformed acini of MCF10A cells grown in 3D Matrigel. Induction of MLK3 expression dramatically increases acinar size and modestly perturbs apicobasal polarity. Remarkably, MLK3 expression induces luminal repopulation and suppresses the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BimEL, as has been observed in Her2/Neu-expressing acini. Taken together, our data show that MLK3–JNK–AP-1 signaling is critical for breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Our current study uncovers both a proliferative and novel antiapoptotic role for MLK3 in the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in mammary epithelial cells. Thus, MLK3 may be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of invasive breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1970421873,"Synovial sarcoma is a high-grade soft tissue malignancy, for which current cytotoxic chemotherapies provide limited benefit. Although histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to suppress synovial sarcoma in vitro and in vivo, the exact mechanism is not clear. In this study, we report a central role of the transcription factor, early growth response-1 (EGR1), in the regulation of HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptotic cell death in synovial sarcoma. The SS18-SSX oncoprotein, characteristic of synovial sarcoma, maintains EGR1 expression at low levels, whereas it is significantly increased after HDAC inhibitor treatment. On the contrary, EGR1 knockdown leads to a decrease in HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we find that under these conditions phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) is upregulated and this occurs through direct binding of EGR1 to an element upstream of the PTEN promoter. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we show that EGR1 modulation of PTEN contributes to HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis in synovial sarcoma. Finally, restoration of EGR1 or PTEN expression is sufficient to induce synovial sarcoma cell death. Taken together, our findings indicate that SS18-SSX-mediated attenuation of an EGR1–PTEN network regulates synovial sarcoma cell survival, and that HDAC inhibitor-mediated apoptosis operates at least in part through reactivation of this pathway."

We targeted conserved N-glycosylated carbohydrate ligands on viral envelope surfaces using novel immune therapies. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and L-ficolin (L-FCN) were selected because they function as opsonins and activate complement. Given that MBL has a complex quaternary structure unsuitable for large scale cost-effective production, we sought to develop a less complex chimeric fusion protein with similar ligand recognition and enhanced effector functions. We tested recombinant human MBL and three L-FCN/MBL variants that contained the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain and varying lengths of the L-FCN collagenous domain. Non-reduced chimeric proteins formed predominantly nona- and dodecameric oligomers, whereas recombinant human MBL formed octadecameric and larger oligomers. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that L-FCN/MBL76 had the highest binding affinities for N-acetylglucosamine-bovine serum albumin and mannan. The same chimeric protein displayed superior complement C4 cleavage and binding to calreticulin (cC1qR), a putative receptor for MBL. L-FCN/MBL76 reduced infection by wild type Ebola virus Zaire significantly greater than the other molecules. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy revealed that L-FCN/MBL76 was significantly less tall than the other molecules despite similar polypeptide lengths. We propose that alterations in the quaternary structure of L-FCN/MBL76 resulted in greater flexibility in the collagenous or neck region. Similarly, a more pliable molecule might enhance cooperativity between the carbohydrate recognition domains and their cognate ligands, complement activation, and calreticulin binding dynamics.

Development of effective therapies against antimicrobial-resistant and emerging infectious diseases is an urgent priority (1Wainberg M.A. Antiviral Res. 2009; 81: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ebola and Marburg viruses, members of the Filovirus family, are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category A agents that represent a substantial threat to public health because they cause rapidly fatal hemorrhagic fevers. As such, they also pose a potential danger if manipulated as bioweapons. Therefore, a key unmet need is the development of effective therapies against this class of viral pathogens. To that end, we set about developing large molecule therapies that are aimed at viral elimination. Our thinking was influenced by previous work from our and other laboratories that indicates a role for endogenous circulating mannose-binding lectin (MBL) 3The abbreviations used are: MBLmannose-binding lectinAFMatomic force microscopyBSAbovine serum albuminCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainHeVHendra virusHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusL-FCNL-ficolinMASPMBL-associated serine proteaseNiVNipah virusrhMBLrecombinant human MBLVBSVeronal-buffered salinehMBLhuman MBLHRPhorseradish peroxidaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayC4complement component 4GPglycoproteinenv negenvelope-negativeEMEMEagle's minimum essential mediumeGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. as a first line host defense against a wide variety of viral and other pathogens (2Takahashi K. Ip W.E. Michelow I.C. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Mannose-binding lectin may be considered an ante-antibody because it serves as a broad spectrum recognition molecule and acts as an opsonin either alone or in conjunction with complement in the first minutes or hours after exposure to an infectious agent (3Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Biol. 1991; 1: 60-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mannose-binding lectin, which is a C-type lectin, recognizes specific configurations of hexose sugars that include mannose, glucose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine but not galactose and sialic acid, the penultimate and ultimate sugars of most mammalian glycoproteins, respectively. Therefore, MBL recognizes the conserved sugars that decorate the cell walls of many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as the surface glycoproteins of viruses like influenza virus, HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Ebola virus (2Takahashi K.

The potential clinical applications of MBL as a therapeutic agent are illustrated by animal studies in which MBL effectively protected mice against Staphylococcus aureus (5Shi L. Takahashi K.

Mannose-binding lectin has a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) followed by a neck region that forms an α-helical coiled coil that favors the formation of trimers that are stabilized by an N-terminal collagen helix (8Sheriff S.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Mannose-binding lectin is a hexamer of trimers and resembles the first complement component, C1q. The complex quaternary structure of MBL makes it difficult to produce recombinant material with a cost-effective process. We therefore sought to develop an idealized chimeric fusion protein that maintained the binding repertoire of MBL and the ability to activate complement but represented a less complex quaternary structure. The design of new chimeric proteins was derived from a novel paradigm described by Hartshorn and co-workers (10Hartshorn K.L. Sastry K.N. Chang D. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Physiol.

In certain instances, the degree of molecular oligomerization contributed to these observations, but it is also possible that conformational changes in protein quaternary structure played a role. We selected two proteins that are able to activate the lectin complement pathway, MBL and L-ficolin (ficolin/P35; ficolin-2). Both MBL and L-ficolin (L-FCN) have similar structural templates comprising collagen-like and ligand binding domains. Each parent molecule consists of three identical polypeptides that form a helical homotrimeric structure that is further organized into higher order multimers stabilized by N-terminal disulfide bonds (9Weis W.I.

Unlike MBL, L-FCN forms stable tetramers of trimers that represent a simpler structure (17Hummelshoj T. Thielens N.M. Madsen H.O. Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Garred P. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whereas MBL is a C-type lectin defined by its ability to bind certain N-glycosylated carbohydrates via calcium-dependent CRDs, L-FCN binds acetylated compounds (such as GlcNAc and GalNAc), elastin, corticosteroids, lipoteichoic acid, and 1,3-β-d-glucan via fibrinogen-like domains (18Edgar P.F.

Both molecules form complexes with an MBL-associated serine protease (MASP-2) dimer stabilized by Ca2+ ions and initiate the lectin complement pathway by cleaving complement component 4 (C4) and C2 to form C4b2a, the C3 convertase, thereby triggering the complement cascade (23Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). One important difference is that several candidate receptors for MBL have been proposed including calreticulin (cC1qR) (24Pagh R. Duus K. Laursen I. Hansen P.R. Mangor J. Thielens N. Arlaud G.J. Kongerslev L. Højrup P. Houen G. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas L-FCN apparently functions only as an opsonin. Our objective was to generate novel recombinant chimeric fusion proteins derived from human MBL and L-FCN with enhanced effector functions. We compared the relative function of three recombinant L-FCN/MBL structural variants with recombinant human MBL (rhMBL). To model infection, we selected enveloped RNA viruses and viral derivatives from the order Mononegavirales and families Filoviridae (Ebola virus) in the first instance and Paramyxoviridae (Hendra and Nipah viruses), which are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category C agents, because all these viruses have N-glycosylated mannose-rich glycoproteins on their surfaces, high mortality, and no effective therapies (25Dolnik O.

We report that L-FCN/MBL76 had superior effector activity that appeared to be mediated by greater structural flexibility and should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent. Expression plasmids encoding fusion proteins containing the respective polypeptide sequences from L-FCN and human MBL have been described (Ref. 46Kongerslev, L. Weilguny, D., Matthiesen, F. (August 24, 2006) U. S. Patent 20060188963Google Scholar; NatImmune A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and are schematically shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, the parental vector pcDNA2003-cintMBLcDNA was derived from a high copy number plasmid and contained the cDNA for human MBL, a human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, an ampicillin resistance gene, and a neomycin resistance gene driven by the SV40 early promoter. The L-FCN/MBL constructs were cloned by fusing the linearized insert derived from Gene Storm clone RG000632 (Invitrogen) containing the L-ficolin sequence to the linearized MBL vector. Correct recombinant plasmid sequences were verified with restriction analyses and DNA sequencing by the Massachusetts General Hospital DNA Sequencing Core with four overlapping primers per plasmid. The proteins are referred to as L-FCN/MBL126, L-FCN/MBL76, and L-FCN/MBL64 based on the identity of the first amino acid of the MBL polypeptide (Fig. 1). Specifically, 1) L-FCN/MBL126 (251 amino acids) consisted of the entire L-FCN N-terminal and collagenous region ending at amino acid 104; the collagen stalk contained 17 Gly-X-Y triplet repeats (where X and Y represent any amino acid). 2) L-FCN/MBL76 (255 amino acids) contained components of the collagen stalk from both L-FCN and MBL including 21 Gly-X-Y triplet repeats and the MBL coiled coil neck region; the transition was at a lysine residue that corresponded to the MASP-binding site. 3) L-FCN/MBL64 (247 amino acids) comprised a proportionately shorter fragment of L-FCN (to amino acid 45) and a larger portion of the MBL collagenous region including 21 Gly-X-Y triplet repeats in total and the MBL “kink” (supplemental figure). In summary, each chimera had the identical L-FCN signal peptide, varying lengths of the L-FCN and MBL collagenous domains, variations in the protein sequences flanking the MASP-binding site, and the same entire MBL CRD. Complete protein sequences, based on their DNA sequences, are available in the supplemental figure. We selected stable transfectants of each of three L-FCN/MBL plasmids using the Freestyle 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). Freestyle 293-F cells (1 × 106/ml) were transfected with 30 μg of each plasmid DNA and 40 μl of 293fectin in Opti-MEM I. Cells were incubated in Freestyle Expression Medium and 300 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen), and individual transfectants were selected with limiting dilutions. Protein expression in the supernatant of at least 10 expanded clones per plasmid was quantified by mannan binding and C4 cleavage assays (see below) using anti-hMBL antibody HYB 131-01 (BioPorto, Gentofte, Denmark). One high expressing clone per plasmid was selected and propagated in T175 flasks (BD Biosciences) with Freestyle Expression Medium, 2% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 300 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The supernatant was harvested twice weekly and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Filtered aliquots of supernatant were incubated with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris buffer, 50 mm CaCl2, 1.25 m NaCl, pH 7.8 and 1 ml of d-mannose, 4% agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C in a rocking flask. Beads were washed with the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm Tris buffer, 50 mm EDTA, 1.25 m NaCl, pH 7.8 in 0.5-ml fractions. Buffer was exchanged with the same as that used for rhMBL (10 mm Tris, 1 mm CaCl2, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) using a Vivaspin 20 (Vivaproducts, Littleton, MA). Protein suspensions were filter-sterilized using a 0.22-μm Millipore syringe filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA); all batches contained ≤0.5 endotoxin units/ml as determined by the quantitative Kinetic-QCL kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Lonza, Walkersville, MD). Sequential fractions were resolved with SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Precise Protein Gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) under reducing and non-reducing conditions with Tris-HEPES-SDS buffer and visualized with Imperial Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Apparent molecular sizes were compared with Kaleidoscope Precision Plus Protein standards (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with Bio-Rad Quantity One 1-D software. The protein identities were verified by Western blot after electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) and blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat milk (Carnation). Detection was performed with 1 μg/ml anti-hMBL antibody HYB 131-01, 1:1000 HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako Denmark A/S), and Amersham Biosciences ECL chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare). Proteins were observed predominantly in the second through fourth eluted fractions, which were pooled for experiments (Fig. 2). On average for each chimera, ∼200 μg/ml was produced per batch. Recombinant human MBL was produced identically (Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bridgewater, NJ) (27Vorup-Jensen T. Sørensen E.S. Jensen U.B. Schwaeble W. Kawasaki T. Ma Y. Uemura K. Wakamiya N. Suzuki Y. Jensen T.G. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz R.A. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The rhMBL was used as a comparator and to generate standard curves for functional assays. Microtiter wells (Immulon 2HB, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with triplicate samples of 10 μg/ml mannan (Sigma-Aldrich) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 37 °C for 1 h; washed with Tris-buffered saline, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4; and blocked with 0.1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (blocking solution). Recombinant hMBL (Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was used to generate the standard curve. The rhMBL is also expressed in HEK293F cells, is similar in structure and function to native MBL (27Vorup-Jensen T. Sørensen E.S. Jensen U.B. Schwaeble W. Kawasaki T. Ma Y. Uemura K. Wakamiya N. Suzuki Y. Jensen T.G. Takahashi K. Ezekowitz R.A. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2001; 1: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and forms predominantly high molecular mass multimers >350 kDa. Purified L-FCN/MBL samples, diluted in blocking solution, were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. For competitive ELISAs, 100 ng of each protein was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with a variety of acetylated and non-acetylated hexose monosaccharides (1–100 mm) and then added to mannan-coated wells. After washing, detection was performed using 1 μg/ml anti-hMBL HYB-131-01 together with 1:7500 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) diluted in blocking solution and 0.5 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance at A405 nm was measured with a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Chimeric protein titers were interpolated from the rhMBL standard curve. C4 cleaving activity of chimeric proteins was measured by a modification of previously reported methods (28Petersen S.V. Thiel S. Jensen L. Steffensen R. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 257: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In brief, triplicate samples of diluted chimeric proteins were added to mannan-coated microtiter plates with 1% MBL-null mouse serum (5Shi L. Takahashi K. Dundee J. Shahroor-Karni S. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Gad F. Hamblin M.R. Sastry K.N. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) as a source of MASP (animal protocol approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care). Normal human serum complement standard (Quidel, San Diego, CA) containing native MBL was used to generate a standard curve. After incubation at 37 °C and rinsing, deposited human C4 fragments (Sigma-Aldrich) were detected with anti-human C4c antibodies (Dako Denmark A/S) followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), avidin-containing Vectastain ABC-alkaline phosphatase reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and p-nitrophenyl phosphate measured at A405 nm. To quantify the protein content of L-FCN/MBL chimeric fusion proteins and rhMBL, aliquots were hydrolyzed with 6 n hydrochloric acid, 0.2% phenol for 16 h at 115 °C. This standard technique does not accurately quantitate tryptophan (degrades; reports low) and cysteine (detected as cysteine and cystine peaks; cysteine can coelute with proline), which were excluded from the final estimation of protein concentration. The hydrolysates were analyzed with a Hitachi L-8900 Amino Acid Analyzer (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc.) that separates the amino acids with an ion exchange column and then derivatizes them with ninhydrin for detection at 570 and 440 nm. Data analysis was performed with EZChrom Elite software for the Hitachi Amino Acid Analyzer. Results are accurate within a 10% margin of error. Amino acid analyses were performed by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT) by J. M. Crawford and F. M. Pineda. Real time surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was performed using a BIAcore 3000 biosensor and BIAevaluation 3.1 software (GE Healthcare) to determine the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between rhMBL or L-FCN/MBL chimeric fusion proteins and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) or mannan, a mannose polymer, as described previously (29Montalto M.C. Collard C.D. Buras J.A. Reenstra W.R. McClaine R. Gies D.R. Rother R.P. Stahl G.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4148-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, for mannan binding experiments, all the lectins were covalently bound to CM5 biosensor chips as ligands according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Because the analyte N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-BSA did not bind to immobilized L-FCN/MBL76, all the proteins were then tested as analytes using immobilized N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-BSA as a ligand. Only L-FCN/MBL76 and rhMBL bound to immobilized N-acetyl-d-glucosamine-BSA. Therefore, KD values were measured using different methods as indicated in Fig. 3A. Analytes (rhMBL, L-FCN/MBL76, or carbohydrates where appropriate) diluted in running buffer (143 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) were injected over the control (immobilized BSA) and the experimental flow cells with nonspecific binding subtracted. For affinity analyses, the compounds were diluted in duplicate using five different concentrations injected at 20 μl/min for 2.5 min. Data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Microtiter wells (Immulon 2HB) were coated with triplicate samples of 10 μg/ml chimeric proteins, BSA (negative control), and rhMBL (positive control) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at room temperature for 1 h. Washing and blocking methods were the same as for mannan binding assays. Wells were incubated with 50 μg/ml biotinylated human placental calreticulin or BSA at room temperature for 1 h (24Pagh R.

Detection was achieved with the same reagents as for the C4 cleavage assay. HIV-Ebola (Zaire) glycoprotein (GP) virions that express luciferase were produced as described previously (4Ji X. Olinger G.G. Aris S. Chen Y. Gewurz H. Spear G.T. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Virus concentration was determined by ELISA for the HIV p24 core protein according to the manufacturer's instructions (SAIC-Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Binding characteristics of chimeric fusion proteins to HIV-Ebola GP and the negative control, HIV-env neg (pNL 4-3 E−; AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD), were determined as described previously (4Ji X. Olinger G.G. Aris S. Chen Y. Gewurz H. Spear G.T. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the chimeras and rhMBL were diluted to 10 μg/ml in Veronal-buffered saline (VBS; 12.5 mm barbituric acid, 7.3 mm sodium barbital, 0.72 m NaCl, pH 7.3) with 5 mm CaCl2, and the final virus concentration was 10 ng of p24/ml diluted in VBS-CaCl2. The percentage of viral binding relative to virus input was calculated after subtracting background binding. HepG2 cells (ATCC HB-8065) were grown to ∼80% confluence in 96-well cell culture microplates (Costar) in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM; ATCC) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich). HIV-Ebola GP virus diluted to 400 pg/ml in VBS and 10 mm CaCl2 was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0, 0.1, or 1 μg/ml L-FCN/MBL proteins or rhMBL diluted in MBL-deficient (MASP-replete) serum (1:1) from a consenting healthy volunteer (protocol approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board) with MBL haplotype LYPB/LYPB and undetectable serum MBL (<2.5 ng/ml). The adherent cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), the virus/MBL mixture was added, and the plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 h to facilitate infection followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and incubated with fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. The cells were lysed with 10% Triton X-100, and chemiluminescence was measured with a luciferase assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Corp.).

The virus/MBL mixture was replaced with fresh EMEM, and the cells were incubated for 48 h at which time fluorescence was read with a spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices; excitation, 485 nm; emission, 515 nm). HeV was isolated in Vero cells from the lung of a horse infected in Brisbane, Australia in 1994 as described previously (31Hyatt A.D. Selleck P.W.

https://openalex.org/W1976771782,"Advances in the field of tumor biology have identified that tumor cells co-opt developmental signaling pathways of embryonic stem cells and thus gain the ability to proliferate, differentiate and alter cell-cell interactions. One such pathway is the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. High levels of EMMPRIN expression have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and metastasis in a broad range of tumors. Although a variety of functions are attributed to EMMPRIN in tumorigenesis, the specific mechanism(s) through which it can exert its effects have not been elucidated, until now. In this study, we identify EMMPRIN as a novel regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer. Increasing EMMPRIN expression levels in lung cancer epithelial cells upregulated the beta-catenin signaling pathway and silencing EMMPRIN inhibited beta-catenin signaling, cell migration, proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and tumor growth in a mouse tumor xenograft model. These results provide a compelling rationale for targeting EMMPRIN for anticancer therapies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving EMMPRIN-induced lung tumorigenesis will provide enormous benefits in developing new therapeutic treatments for this and other forms of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2109298504,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins stimulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and tissue patterning at multiple points in animal development. A single Hh homolog is present in Drosophila, but three Hh homologs, Sonic Hh, Indian Hh, and Desert Hh, are present in mammals. Distribution, movement, and reception of Hh signals are tightly regulated, and abnormal Hh signaling is associated with developmental defects and cancer. In addition to the integral membrane proteins Patched and Smoothened, members of the Drosophila Ihog family of adhesion-like molecules have recently been shown to bind Hh proteins with micromolar affinity and positively regulate Hh signaling. Cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDO) and Brother of CDO (BOC) are the closest mammalian relatives of Drosophila Ihog, and CDO binds Sonic Hh with micromolar affinity and positively regulates Hh signaling. Despite these similarities, structural and biochemical studies have shown that Ihog and CDO utilize nonorthologous domains and completely different binding modes to interact with cognate Hh proteins. We report here biochemical and x-ray structural studies of Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh proteins both alone and complexed with active domains of CDO and BOC. These results show that all mammalian Hh proteins bind CDO and BOC in the same manner. We also show that interactions between Hh proteins and CDO are weakened at low pH. Formation of Hh-mediated Hh oligomers is thought to be an important feature of normal Hh signaling, but no conserved self-interaction between Hh proteins is apparent from inspection of 14 independent Hh-containing crystal lattices.

https://openalex.org/W2071516475,"myo-Inositol-1-phosphate synthase is a conserved enzyme that catalyzes the first committed and rate-limiting step in inositol biosynthesis. Despite its wide occurrence in all eukaryotes, the role of myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase and de novo inositol biosynthesis in cell signaling and organism development has been unclear. In this study, we isolated loss-of-function mutants in the Arabidopsis MIPS1 gene from different ecotypes. It was found that all null mips1 mutants are defective in embryogenesis, cotyledon venation patterning, root growth, and root cap development. The mutant roots are also agravitropic and have reduced basipetal auxin transport. mips1 mutants have significantly reduced levels of major phosphatidylinositols and exhibit much slower rates of endocytosis. Treatment with brefeldin A induces slower PIN2 protein aggregation in mips1, indicating altered PIN2 trafficking. Our results demonstrate that MIPS1 is critical for maintaining phosphatidylinositol levels and affects pattern formation in plants likely through regulation of auxin distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2143703838,"The impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on morbidity and mortality is significant in that it causes bronchiolitis in infants, exacerbations in patients with obstructive lung disease, and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. RSV activates protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular kinase relevant to limiting viral replication (Groskreutz, D. J., Monick, M. M., Powers, L. S., Yarovinsky, T. O., Look, D. C., and Hunninghake, G. W. (2006) J. Immunol. 176, 1733-1740). It is activated by autophosphorylation, likely triggered by a double-stranded RNA intermediate during replication of the virus. In most instances, ph-PKR targets the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) protein via phosphorylation, leading to an inhibition of translation of cellular and viral protein. However, we found that although ph-PKR increases in RSV infection, significant eIF2alpha phosphorylation is not observed, and inhibition of protein translation does not occur. RSV infection attenuates eIF2alpha phosphorylation by favoring phosphatase rather than kinase activity. Although PKR is activated, RSV sequesters PKR away from eIF2alpha by binding of the kinase to the RSV N protein. This occurs in conjunction with an increase in the association of the phosphatase, PP2A, with eIF2alpha following PKR activation. The result is limited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and continued translation of cellular and viral proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2162370873,"Pancreatic beta-cells are vulnerable to multiple stresses, leading to dysfunction and apoptotic death. Deterioration in beta-cells function and mass is associated with type 2 diabetes. Comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from pancreatic MIN6 cells that were maintained at varying glucose concentrations was carried out. An induced expression of a protein spot, detected in MIN6 cells experiencing high glucose concentration, was identified by mass spectrometry as the oxidized form of DJ-1. DJ-1 (park7) is a multifunctional protein implicated in familial Parkinsonism and neuroprotection in response to oxidative damage. The DJ-1 protein and its oxidized form were also induced following exposure to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in MIN6 and betaTC-6 cells and also in mouse pancreatic islets. Suppression of DJ-1 levels by small interfering RNA led to an accelerated cell death, whereas an increase in DJ-1 levels by adenovirus-based infection attenuated cell death induced by H(2)O(2) and thapsigargin in beta-cell lines and mouse pancreatic islets. Furthermore, DJ-1 improved regulated insulin secretion under basal as well as oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress conditions in a dose-dependent manner. We identified TFII-I (Gtf2i) as DJ-1 partner in the cytosol, whereas the binding of TFII-I to DJ-1 prevented TFII-I translocation to the nucleus. The outcome was attenuation of the stress response. Our results suggest that DJ-1 together with TFII-I operate in concert to cope with various insults and to sustain pancreatic beta-cell function."

Four novel heterozygous mutations were also identified in the intron (Intron1265T→A), 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR101C→G, 3′-UTR186T→C), and promoter (Pro-423C→T) of the SHP gene. The exonic R38H and K170N mutants exhibited impaired nuclear translocation. K170N made SHP more susceptible to ubiquitination mediated degradation and blocked SHP acetylation, which displayed lost repressive activity on its interacting partners ERRγ and HNF4α but not LRH-1. In contrast, G171A increased SHP mRNA and protein expression and maintained normal function. In general, the interaction of SHP mutants with LRH-1 and EID1 was enhanced. K170N also markedly impaired the recruitment of SHP, HNF4α, HDAC1, and HDAC3 to the apoCIII promoter. Molecular dynamics simulations of SHP showed that G171A stabilized the nuclear receptor boxes, whereas K170N promoted the conformational destabilization of all the structural elements of the receptor.

SHP is expressed in the cerebellum and other regions of the brain; however, the function of SHP in brain remains undetermined. In this study we screened germinal SHP gene polymorphisms in normal subjects and CADASIL-like patients. CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is caused by mutations in the Notch3 receptor (20Fouillade C. Chabriat H. Riant F. Mine M. Arnoud M. Magy L. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Joutel A. Hum. Mutat. 2008; 29: 452Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We identified six novel variants in the SHP gene that have not been identified before in other diseases. Interestingly, the three exonic SHP mutants exhibited differential functional alterations with regard to their nuclear translocation, gene expression, repressive activity, protein-protein interaction, stability, and degradation. The later was associated with post-translational modification of SHP ubiquitination and acetylation. This report is the first study that identified novel SHP variants in humans and elucidated the molecular and structural basis for the altered functions of SHP mutants. Genomic DNAs (provided by Dr. Eliecer Coto) were obtained from leukocytes of a total of 84 subjects (34 healthy and 50 CADASIL-like patients, recruited through the Neurology and the Molecular Genetics Departments of Hospital University Central Asturias, Spain). A total of 14 patients had a NOTCH3 gene-causative mutation, and 36 had no observed Notch3 mutations. The normal subjects were collected at two different times (10 and 24 cases each time). Informed consent was obtained from the patients and controls to participate in a study of the genetic bases of stroke, approved by the Ethical Committee of Hospital UnivCentral Asturias (Spain). Case numbers and Notch3 mutations in CADASIL patients are provided in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. Two sets of primers that cross the intron-exon boundaries, SHPe1 forward (5′-GCCACTTCATTGACTGAGGTGATA-3′) and reverse (5′-AATGAGGACCCAATGAGATAACAGA-3′) and SHPe2 forward (5′-CTCTAAAGGAGGAGGTAGTAGTGGGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGTGATGGGATTGTGAACTGATAC-3′), were used in a PCR to amplify the exon1 and exon2 from genomic DNAs. The primers SHPin forward (5′-GGGACCATCCTCTTCAACCC) and SHPin reverse (5′-CTTGGAGGCCTGGCACATCT) were used to amplify the intron, and primers SHPpro forward (5′-TAGATTGGACAGTGGGCAAAGT-3′) and SHPpro reverse (5′-CAGCTCTCTGGCTCTGTGTTCT-3′) were used to amplify the promoter region of the SHP gene. PCR was carried out using high fidelity Tag DNA polymerase. PCR products were purified and then sequenced and analyzed on an ABI 377 automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequencing was completed by the Sequencing and Genomic Core laboratory, which is one of the HSC Core Research Facilities at the University of Utah. The identified SHP variants were deposited to the NCBI data base, and the accession numbers are 142101870 (c.113G→A), 142101873 (c.510A→T), 142101875 (c.512G→C), 142101877 (3′-UTR101C→G), 142101879 (3′-UTR186T→C), 142101881 (Intron1265T→A), and 142101883 (Pro-423C→T). The cDNA NM_021969.2 and protein NP_068804.1 sequences were used for mutation nomenclature, with DNA +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG start codon. All sequence variants were verified using the Mutalyzer program. The cDNA of the wild-type human SHP gene was cloned in the expression plasmids pcDNA3-GFP and pCMV-FLAG, respectively. SHP genes carrying the identified mutations were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. All SHP constructs including SHPR38H, SHPK170N, and SHPG171A were subcloned into the pcDNA3-GFP and pCMV-FLAG vectors and verified by sequencing. The primers used were G113A forward (5′-cgaccccgtagccactgcctatgtagg-3′) and G113A reverse (5′-cctacataggcagtggctacggggtcg-3′), A510T forward (5′-ggaatatgcctgcctgaatgggaccatcctcttc-3′) and A510T reverse (5′-gaagaggatggtcccattcaggcaggcatattcc-3′), G512C forward (5′-tatgcctgcctgaaagggaccatcctcttcaac-3′) and G512C reverse (5′-gttgaagaggatggtccctttcaggcaggcata-3′). For luciferase reporter assay, YY1 promoter reporter was used to determine SHP repression of ERRγ transactivation using HeLa cells (11Song G. Wang L. PloS One. 2009; 4: e6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SHP promoter was used to determine SHP repression of LRH-1 transactivation (8Zhang Y. Soto J. Park K. Viswanath G. Kuwada S. Abel E.D. Wang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1341-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ApoCIII and apoB promoters (21Hwang-Verslues W.W. Sladek F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) from Dr. Frances Sladek were used to determine SHP repression of HNF4a transactivation. The luciferase reporter activity was measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiency. HeLa cells were transfected with the FLAG-SHPWT, FLAG-SHPR38H, FLAG-SHPK170N, and FLAG-SHPG171A and HA-ubiquitin plasmids by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and treated with 5 μm MG132 (Cayman) after transfection. Twenty-four hours later cells were harvested and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and analyzed with anti-HA (Sigma) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) by Western blots. HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-SHPWT, FLAG-SHPR38H, FLAG-SHPK170N, and FLAG-SHPG171A for 24 h or co-transfected with CBP, P300, PCAF, Tip60, and males absent on the first (MOF) expression vectors (22Li K. Wang R. Lozada E. Fan W. Orren D.K. Luo J. PloS One. 2010; 5: e10341Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), then treated with 0.2 μm trichostatin A for an additional 2 h. Whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) as described in the ubiquitination assays. Western blots were performed, and immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with antibodies against acetylated lysine (Cell Signaling) and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma).

In vitro protein synthesis of FLAG-SHPWT, FLAG-SHPR38H, FLAG-SHPK170N, and FLAG-SHPG171A was performed using the TNT- T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system utilizing the T7 promoter (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To express GST fusion proteins, GST, GST-ERRγ, GST-LRH1, GST-HNF4α, or GST-EID1 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21/DE3/RIL. The cells containing the transformed plasmids were cultured overnight and inoculated into 4 ml of LB at 37 °C for 3 h (A600 0.6–0.8), and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was allowed to grow at 30 °C with vigorous shaking for about 4 h. Cells were harvested, then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.4 ml of cell lysis buffer provided by the kit. For pulldown experiments, bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-containing MagneGSTTM particles, and the binding of the in vitro translated FLAG-SHP protein with GST fusion protein was conducted using the MagneGSTTM pulldown system as described in the manufacturer’s manual with some modification. Briefly, 5 μl of particles carrying bait proteins (GST fusion protein or GST alone) were combined with 20 μl of prey protein (the TNT-T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation reaction). After capturing, the particles were washed, and the prey proteins were then eluted by suspending in 1× SDS sample buffer. The released proteins were displayed through SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard procedures. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked for 1 h with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk, then incubated with anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase) antibody (catalog #A8592, Sigma) at 1:2000 dilution in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed four times with TBST before antibody binding was visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (catalog #34080, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The homology model of SHPWT was constructed on the basis of the sequence similarity with the Ultraspiracle protein (pdb code 1g2n) as previously reported (27Macchiarulo A. Rizzo G. Costantino G. Fiorucci S. Pellicciari R. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2006; 24: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SHPK170Nand SHPG171A models were generated replacing Lys-170 and Gly-171 with asparagine and alanine residues in the structure of SHPWT, respectively. Hydrogen atoms were added using the Protein Preparation Wizard workflow as implemented in the Schrödinger Suite 2009 (28Schrödinger L.C.C. Maestro. 2009 Ed. 2009Google Scholar). Each of the three models was solvated in an orthorhombic box using TIP3P water molecules (29Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29885) Google Scholar, 30Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Sodium and chlorine atoms were also placed to counterbalance the net charges of the receptor. After the construction of the solvent environment, each system consisted of ∼36,000 atoms in a volume of 374,000 Å3 (see Table 3).TABLE 3RMSD values of the backbone atoms in different structural motifs of SHP wild type, SHPK170N, and SHPG171N mutants as calculated during the 2–10 ns of the molecular dynamic simulationsStructural motifSHPWTSHPK170NSHPG171AAverage±S.DAverage±S.D.Average±S.D.Backbone3.560.464.590.323.670.26NRbox1 (residues 21–25)2.50.723.780.912.130.95NRbox2 (residues 118–123)8.252.358.611.363.30.75NRbox3 (residues 214–219)1.550.431.810.591.090.25PSXXLP (residues 74–80)1.130.272.820.352.470.46H12 (residues 243–257)2.570.33.420.532.880.3 Open table in a new tab All the molecular dynamic simulations (MDs) were performed using Desmond 2.2 software (31Shaw D.E. Desmond Molecular Dynamics System. 2.2 Ed. 2009Google Scholar) and the force field OPLS-2005 as implemented in the Schrödinger Suite 2009. In particular, the simulation protocol consisted of the desmond default relaxation steps, a 2-ns equilibration phase, and a final production phase of 8 ns. In particular, desmond default relaxation steps were (i) the energetic minimization of the system over a maximum of 2000 steps, with the first 10 steps using the steepest descendent and the convergence criterion set to 50 kcal/mol Å−1 and harmonic restraints placed on the solute atoms (force constant = 50.0 kcal/mol), (ii) an analogous energetic refinement of the system without restraints, (iii) MDs of 12 ps at 10 K with harmonic restraints on the solute heavy atoms (force constant = 50.0 kcal/mol), NVT Berendesen ensemble, (iv) MDs of 12 ps at 10 K retaining the harmonic restrains, NPT Berendesen ensemble; (v) MDs of 24 ps of heating phase to 300 K retaining the harmonic restrains, NPT Berendesen ensemble, (vi) MDs of 24 ps at 300 K without harmonic restrains, NPT Berendesen ensemble. Both equilibration and production phases were run using the NPT Berendesen ensemble at temperature 300 K. During all the simulations, a time step of 2 fs was used. Other not specified parameters were set to the default values. The atomic coordinates of each system were saved every 4.8 ps. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were carried out using one-way analysis of variance followed by Student’s t test; p < 0.01 was considered significant. To identify gene polymorphisms of SHP, we collected germinal genomic DNAs of leukocytes from 34 normal and 50 CADASIL-like subjects (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Promoter, coding region, intron, and 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the SHP gene were screened using PCR and direct sequencing. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C and TABLE 1, TABLE 2, novel exonic variants p.R38H (c.113G→A) and p.K170N (c.510A→T) were found in exon 1 of the SHP gene in normal and CADASIL-like subjects. A novel variant Intron1265T→A, 1265 bp downstream of the exon 1/intron boundary, was found in the intron of the SHP gene. Additionally, two novel variants 3′-UTR101C→G and 3′-UTR186T→C, 101 bp and 186 bp downstream of the translation stop site, were found in the 3′-UTR region of the SHP gene, respectively. A novel variant, Pro-423C→T, was also identified in the promoter of the SHP gene. The nucleotide change p.G171A (c.512G→C), a previously identified common SNP in obesity, diabetes, and lipodystrophy subjects (Table 2), was also found in normal and CADASIL-like subjects. All the identified SHP SNPs were in heterozygous forms. Several subjects carried more than one variant, including two normal (#8, #2) and two CADASIL-like (#69, #116) subjects (Table 1). In general, SHP gene exonic mutations are less commonly seen in patients with CADASIL-like that have Notch3 mutations as compared with the controls. On the other hand, SNPs in intron and 3′-UTR of the SHP gene occurred more frequently in CADASIL-like patients than in normal subjects.TABLE 1Mutations identified in the human SHP gene (NROB2)RegionCodonNucleotide changeAmino acid changeControls (n = 34)CADASIL patients (n = 50)Frequency%Exon 138c.113G→A*p.R38H*1 (3)08.8, 0Exon 1170c.510A→T*p.K170N*5 (7, 13, 261, 262, 273)1 (210)14.7, 2Exon 1171c.512G→Cp.G171A3 (1, 6, 8)2 (98, 116)5.88, 4IntronIntron1265T→A*1 (8)3 (55, 69, 141)2.94, 63′-UTR3′-UTR101C→G*1 (2)1 (69)2.94, 23′-UTR3′-UTR186T→C*2 (2, 8)4 (90, 116, 179, 180)5.88, 8PromoterPro-423C→T*1 (1)1 (116)2.94, 2 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Summary of the mutations already published for the SHP (NROB2) geneExonMutationEffectReferences1H53fsdel10Nishigori et al.

We constructed FLAG-SHPWT, FLAG-SHPR38H, FLAG-SHPK170N, and FLAG-SHPG171A expression vectors and examined steady-state SHP protein using anti-FLAG antibodies and Western blots. Mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells had barely detectable endogenous mouse SHP (7Zhang Y. Xu P. Park K. Choi Y. Moore D.D. Wang L. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Song G. Wang L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5727-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), thus, provided a good model system to determine the level of exogenously overexpressed hSHP. Unexpectedly, the mutant FLAG-SHPK170N protein at 48 h post-transfection was lost compared with wild-type SHP protein, whereas mutant FLAG-SHPG171A was expressed at about 2–3-fold higher levels than FLAG-SHPWT (Fig. 2B). Those exogenously expressed hSHP proteins were further examined with anti-hSHP antibodies, which detected SHPK170N expression at a constant low level compared with SHPWT, SHPR38H, and SHPG171A. The mRNA levels of SHPR38H and SHPG171A were about 3-fold higher than SHPWT and SHPK170N (Fig. 2C), suggesting enhanced SHP gene transcription. Thus, the increased level of p.G171A protein may in part be associated with its increased transcription, and the decreased p.K170N protein is likely due to its degradation by post-translational modification. A recent report has shown that SHP undergoes rapid degradation with a short half-life in HepG2 cells (∼30 min) (32Miao J. Xiao Z. Kanamaluru D. Min G. Yau P.M. Veenstra T.D. Ellis E. Strom S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Kemper J.K. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We examined the half-life of each SHP mutant in Hepa-1 cells followed by treatment of cells with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The half-life of FLAG-SHPWT was about 30 min, which extended to about 60 min by p.R38H and p.G171A (Fig. 2D). FLAG-SHPK170N exhibited the lowest expression. The higher basal level and longer half-life of FLAG-SHPG171A suggest a slow degradation rate and increased protein stability. To access the effect of each mutation on SHP subcellular localization, we constructed GFP-SHPWT, GFP-SHPR38H, GFP-SHPK170N, and GFP-SHPG171A expression vectors, overexpressed them into Hepa-1 cells, and monitored the location of SHP proteins by green fluorescence under microscopy. As early as 6 h post-transfection, GFP-SHPWT, GFP-SHPR38H, and GFP-SHPK170N were observed in the cytoplasmic compartment, which did not overlay with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stained nucleus, whereas some of the GFP-SHPG171A were found in the nucleus (Fig. 3A). By 18 h after transfection, the nuclear localization of all four SHP proteins was detected (Fig. 3B), although in a large number of cells GFP-SHPR38H and GFP-SHPK170N was still retained in the cytosol. Interestingly, GFP-SHPWT and GFP-SHPG171A were constantly observed in the nucleus at 24 (Fig. 3C) and 48 h (Fig. 3D) post-transfection, whereas most of the GFP-SHPR38H appeared in the cytosol with a few overlaying with the nuclear staining, and the majority of GFP-SHPG171A were found outside the nucleus. Similar results were observed in HeLa cells (not shown). These results suggest a possible scenario that p.R38H and p.K170N may alter the ability of SHP to efficiently translocate to the nucleus. We focused on SHPK170N because it showed a significant down-regulation (Fig. 2B). The nuclear FLAG-SHPK170N levels were low at all the time points compared with FLAG-SHPWT, whereas it showed higher levels in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, the levels of FLAG-SHPK170N were significantly down-regulated 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B), suggesting it may have undergone degradation. The Lys-170 lysine residue in SHP is well conserved in several species including human and mouse (Fig. 1C). Although Lys-170 was not identified as a major ubiquitination site in a recent study (32Miao J. Xiao Z. Kanamaluru D. Min G. Yau P.M. Veenstra T.D. Ellis E. Strom S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Kemper J.K. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 986-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it remains an interesting question if Lys-170 plays a role in SHP protein ubiquitination and if p.K170N mutation alters such process. The antibodies against the FLAG tag produced nonspecific bands in Hepa-1 cells (Fig. 2B) but appeared very specific in HeLa cells (not shown). Thus, we used HeLa cells for the coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting in Fig. 4. Consistent with the results in Hepa-1 cells (Fig. 2B), FLAG-SHPK170N was undetectable in HeLa cells 48 h post-transfection (not shown). We collected proteins 18 h post-"

The K12R mutant of BZLF1, which no longer becomes sumoylated, exhibits stronger transactivation than the wild-type BZLF1 in a reporter assay system as well as in the context of virus genome with nucleosomal structures. Furthermore, exogenous supply of a SUMO-specific protease, SENP, caused de-sumoylation of BZLF1 and enhanced BZLF1-mediated transactivation. Immunoprecipitation experiments proved that histone deacetylase 3 preferentially associated with the sumoylated form of BZLF1. Levels of the sumoylated BZLF1 increased as lytic replication progressed. Based on these observations, we conclude that sumoylation of BZLF1 regulates its transcriptional activity through histone modification during Epstein-Barr virus productive replication.

https://openalex.org/W2006718662,"Aberrant activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been found in human cancers of various origins, and has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. The therapeutic anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and matuzumab inhibit both ligand-induced receptor activation and growth of EGFR-expressing tumor cells. The efficacy of such EGFR-targeted therapies may be further enhanced by induction of functionally equivalent endogenous antibody responses. Here we describe novel peptide sequences selected from random peptide libraries for binding to single-chain antibody fragments of cetuximab or matuzumab. Two of these peptides characterized by KTL and YPLG motifs are recognized equally well by cetuximab and matuzumab, although nonoverlapping epitopes were previously reported for these antibodies. Immunization of experimental animals with synthetic KTL- and YPLG-containing peptides led to induction of antibodies that cross-react with human EGFR, and prevent binding of natural EGFR ligands, ligand-induced receptor activation and tumor cell growth in a manner similar to cetuximab and matuzumab. Our findings show that these peptide mimotopes can induce anti-EGFR antibodies with antitumoral activity, which may have implications for EGFR-specific cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2013130796,"15-Lipoxygenase 2 (15-LOX2), a lipid-peroxidizing enzyme, is mainly expressed in the luminal compartment of the normal human prostate, and is often decreased or lost in prostate cancer. Previous studies from our lab implicate 15-LOX2 as a functional tumor suppressor. To better understand the biological role of 15-LOX2 in vivo, we generated prostate-specific 15-LOX2 transgenic mice using the ARR2PB promoter. Unexpectedly, transgenic expression of 15-LOX2 or 15-LOX2sv-b, a splice variant that lacks arachidonic acid-metabolizing activity, resulted in age-dependent prostatic hyperplasia and enlargement of the prostate. Prostatic hyperplasia induced by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b was associated with an increase in luminal and Ki-67+ cells; however, 15-LOX2-transgenic prostates also showed a prominent increase in basal cells. Microarray analysis revealed distinct gene expression profiles that could help explain the prostate phenotypes. Strikingly, 15-LOX2, but not 15-LOX2sv-b, transgenic prostate showed upregulation of several well-known stem or progenitor cell molecules including Sca-1, Trop2, p63, Nkx3.1 and Psca. Prostatic hyperplasia caused by both 15-LOX2 and 15-LOX2sv-b did not progress to prostatic intraprostate neoplasia or carcinoma and, mechanistically, prostate lobes (especially those of 15-LOX2 mice) showed a dramatic increase in senescent cells as revealed by increased SA-βgal, p27Kip1 and heterochromatin protein 1γ staining. Collectively, our results suggest that 15-LOX2 expression in mouse prostate leads to hyperplasia and also induces cell senescence, which may, in turn, function as a barrier to tumor development."

The current topology models predict 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with a large glycosylated loop between TMDs 5 and 6; both termini are cytoplasmic (14Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J.

A similar organization of the transporters is supported by identical functional consequences of mutations. Substitution of Tyr1087 to aspartate in KCC2 or its congener in KCC1 reduced transport activity (21Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of threonines by alanine at positions 991 and 1048 in KCC3 or their congeners in KCC2 increased transport activity (22Rinehart J. Maksimova Y.D. Tanis J.E. Stone K.L.

Cell. 2009; 138: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Despite the overall structural similarity, heterologous expression analyses have revealed marked functional differences between KCCs, encompassing sensitivity to loop diuretics, ion affinities, and transport activity under isotonic conditions (13Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These differences were observed not only between the two subfamilies but also within a given subfamily. Biochemical analyses of the closely related KCC2 and KCC4, for instance, demonstrated several differences. Most strikingly, KCC2 is active under isotonic conditions (23Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KCC4 mediates significant cotransport only under hypoosmotic conditions (24Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KCC2 has a high affinity to potassium and a low affinity to chloride (23Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KCC4 shows an equal affinity to both ions (24Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Finally, the IC50 for the loop diuretic furosemide is considerably lower for KCC2 than for KCC4 (∼50 versus ∼900 μm) (13Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 24Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 2002; 103: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The underlying structural differences of these distinct properties are poorly understood. Mutational analyses have so far tackled the intracellular C terminus and the transmembrane domains, identifying a C-terminal domain that is required for the activity of KCC2 under isotonic conditions (26Mercado A. Broumand V. Zandi-Nejad K. Enck A.H. Mount D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1016-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15959-15969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the sequence requirements of the large extracellular loop (LEL) between TMDs 5 and 6 in the closely related cotransporters KCC2 and KCC4 and addressed its role for binding to loop diuretics. Our results, obtained from 26 mutants, demonstrate an unexpected heterogeneity in the extracellular face of KCCs.DISCUSSIONVia site-directed mutagenesis and generation of chimeras, we have investigated the sequence requirements of the LEL in KCC2 and KCC4 for protein expression, function, and drug binding. The main finding of our study is that transport function of KCC2 and KCC4 depends on different sequence requirements of the LEL. In contrast to KCC4, elimination of all four evolutionary conserved cysteines in the LEL reduced KCC2 transport activity by more than 75%. In addition, the LEL of KCC2 requires the parental backbone, whereas the LEL of KCC4 also functions together with the homologous backbone of KCC2 (KCC22-4-2). Another interesting observation was that the LEL plays a role in the sensitivity of KCCs to loop diuretics. This was evidenced by the different IC50 values obtained for KCC2wt and its chimera KCC22-4-2, which differed only in the LEL.Our analysis of the four evolutionary conserved cysteines in the LEL of KCC2 revealed their crucial requirement for transport activity. Each of the six generated single cysteine mutants was non-functional (Fig. 2). The importance of the extracellular cysteines for KCC2 transport activity was corroborated by the observation that the wild-type LEL of KCC4 but not the mutated one could replace the LEL of KCC2. This requirement of cysteines is in line with the related Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporter NKCC1, which also requires any of the five cysteines present in the LEL between TMDs 7 and 8 to be transport-active (37Jacoby S.C. Gagnon E. Caron L. Chang J. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C684-C692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, KCC4 activity was only impaired by single cysteine mutants, and most importantly, the quadruple mutant of KCC4 is still fully active (Fig. 4B). The impaired transport activity of the single KCC4 mutants might be due to abnormal cysteine bonds.We first considered the different expression systems as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (KCC2 mutants analyzed in HEK-293 cells (initial part of this study), KCC4 mutants analyzed in X. laevis oocytes).4 However, after having performed subsequent reciprocal experiments (i.e. having analyzed KCC2 mutants in Xenopus oocytes and KCC4 mutants in HEK-293 cells), we can rule out this possibility (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. 3). Only for KCC4 single mutants did we observe an increased impairment of transport activity in HEK-293 cells compared with X. laevis oocytes (supplemental Fig. 5).4 Thus, we propose a robust difference in requirements of cysteines in the LEL between KCC2 and KCC4. Our results also demonstrate that data arising from mutation analyses cannot easily be transferred to related KCC isoforms, even if their amino acids are highly conserved. It will be interesting to analyze the functional roles of the cysteines in the LEL of KCC1 and KCC3 as well, in order to find out whether they resemble KCC2, KCC4, neither, or both. Different effects after mutating conserved amino acids have also been reported for other transporters, such as the closely related ileal and hepatic sodium-dependent bile acid transporters Isbt and Ntcp (38Saeki T. Kuroda T. Matsumoto M. Kanamoto R. Iwami K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or the two chloride channels CLC-Kb and CLC-Ka (39Martinez G.Q. Maduke M. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The underlying structural differences, however, have not been elucidated so far.The precise role of the analyzed cysteines for KCC2 transport activity is still unknown. Our data point to subtle but important conformational changes. First, immunocytochemical and immunoblot analyses of all the 18 transport-inactive mutants analyzed in this study yielded expression levels comparable with that of KCC2wt (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2) (data not shown). The mutants thus appear to pass the quality control in the endoplasmatic reticulum. This suggests that they are not grossly misfolded, because this would probably result in premature degradation (40Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Second, our biotinylation experiments demonstrated that elimination of all four cysteine residues in KCC2q still resulted in surface expression similar to KCC2wt (Fig. 8). This is in agreement with the immunocytochemical data on the mutants, which revealed for most of the mutants no apparent decrease in plasma membrane staining. These data indicate that the cysteines are dispensable for correct trafficking and membrane insertion. Even in the quadruple mutant KCC22-4q-2, surface expression was reduced by merely 50% (Fig. 8), which contrasts with the almost complete (>85%) loss transport activity (Fig. 6). Thus, reduced surface expression may contribute in some of our constructs to the observed drop in transport activity, but it is definitely not the major cause.It is unclear whether the cysteine replacements effect oligomerization of the KCC2 transporter. We have recently presented evidence that KCC2 oligomers are connected by disulfide bridges (17Blaesse P. Guillemin I. Schindler J. Schweizer M. Delpire E. Khiroug L. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10407-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas a recent study has observed sensitivity of KCC2 oligomers to SDS (18Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Soni S. Hübner C.A. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13696-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We could not investigate the oligomeric status of the KCC2 mutants because we noticed strong aggregation of the proteins after heterologous expression in HEK-293 cells, 5A. M. Hartmann and H. G. Nothwang, unpublished data. which is consistent with the findings of Uvarov et al. (18Uvarov P. Ludwig A. Markkanen M. Soni S. Hübner C.A. Rivera C. Airaksinen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13696-13704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, future studies have to address the precise role of the cysteine residues, such as their involvement in intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds.The observed difference of the LEL between KCC2 and KCC4, together with the lower identity of the LEL (55.2%) compared with the total protein identity (72%), prompted us to investigate whether this region is involved in furosemide binding. The IC50 value of the transport-active chimera KCC22-4-2 was closer to that of KCC4 than to KCC2 (Fig. 7). This indicates but does not prove that the LEL plays a role in the affinity for loop diuretics and is probably involved in binding. Unfortunately, the strongly reduced or completely abolished transport activity in other chimeras prevented analyzing their furosemide sensitivity. A previous analysis in the related NKCC1 failed to identify the bumetanide-binding site but did not analyze the LEL separately (41Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, nonlinear effects were observed in the analyzed NKCC1 chimera, and the authors therefore concluded that multiple sites affect binding of loop diuretics. This is in agreement with our observation that the IC50 of the chimera KCC22-4-2 was not congruent with that of KCC4wt.In summary, our data reveal an important role of the LEL on the transport-active conformation of KCC2 and KCC4. Furthermore, our study demonstrates a robust difference in the LEL of KCC2 and KCC4, a region so far not presumed to participate in the different functional properties of these two cotransporters. This will open up new avenues in structure-function analysis of KCCs, and future studies will reveal whether this difference relates not only to a different affinity to loop diuretics but also to other differences, such as the activity under isotonic conditions.

Finally, targeted deletion of murine KCC4 results in renal tubular acidosis and deafness (12Boettger T. Hübner C.A. Maier H. Rust M.B. Beck F.X. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).KCC proteins share considerable conservation of primary sequence; KCC1 and KCC3 exhibit 75% identity, and KCC2 and KCC4 share 72% of their amino acid residues (13Gamba G.

The current topology models predict 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with a large glycosylated loop between TMDs 5 and 6; both termini are cytoplasmic (14Payne J.A. Stevenson T.J. Donaldson L.F. J.

A similar organization of the transporters is supported by identical functional consequences of mutations. Substitution of Tyr1087 to aspartate in KCC2 or its congener in KCC1 reduced transport activity (21Strange K. Singer T.D. Morrison R. Delpire E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C860-C867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of threonines by alanine at positions 991 and 1048 in KCC3 or their congeners in KCC2 increased transport activity (22Rinehart J. Maksimova Y.D. Tanis J.E. Stone K.L.

Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These differences were observed not only between the two subfamilies but also within a given subfamily. Biochemical analyses of the closely related KCC2 and KCC4, for instance, demonstrated several differences. Most strikingly, KCC2 is active under isotonic conditions (23Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KCC4 mediates significant cotransport only under hypoosmotic conditions (24Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KCC2 has a high affinity to potassium and a low affinity to chloride (23Payne J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas KCC4 shows an equal affinity to both ions (24Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Finally, the IC50 for the loop diuretic furosemide is considerably lower for KCC2 than for KCC4 (∼50 versus ∼900 μm) (13Gamba G. Physiol.

Mutational analyses have so far tackled the intracellular C terminus and the transmembrane domains, identifying a C-terminal domain that is required for the activity of KCC2 under isotonic conditions (26Mercado A.

Here, we analyzed the sequence requirements of the large extracellular loop (LEL) between TMDs 5 and 6 in the closely related cotransporters KCC2 and KCC4 and addressed its role for binding to loop diuretics. Our results, obtained from 26 mutants, demonstrate an unexpected heterogeneity in the extracellular face of KCCs.

In mammals, the family consists of the four members KCC1 - KCC4, which are involved in different fundamental physiological processes.

Although the polymerase and exonuclease active sites are located on the catalytic subunit Pol gammaA, in holoenzyme both activities are regulated by the accessory subunit Pol gammaB. Several patients with severe neurological and muscular disorders were reported to carry the Pol gammaA substitutions R232G or R232H, which lie outside of either active site. We report that Arg(232) substitutions have no effect on independent Pol gammaA activities but show major defects in the Pol gammaA-Pol gammaB holoenzyme, including decreased polymerase and increased exonuclease activities, the latter with decreased selectivity for mismatches. We show that Pol gammaB facilitates distinguishing mismatched from base-paired primer termini and that Pol gammaA Arg(232) is essential for mediating this regulatory function of the accessory subunit. This study provides a molecular basis for the disease symptoms exhibited by patients carrying those substitutions."

RNA granules contain specific RNA-binding proteins, including RNA granule protein 105 (RNG105), which is likely to participate in the transport and translation of mRNAs. In the present report, an RNG105 paralog, RNG140 is described. A homolog of RNG105/RNG140 is found in insects, echinoderms, and urochordates, whereas vertebrates have both of the two genes. RNG140 and RNG105 are similar in that both bind to mRNAs and inhibit translation in vitro, induce the formation of RNA granules, are most highly expressed in the brain, and are localized to dendritic RNA granules, part of which are accumulated at postsynapses. However, they differ in several characteristics; RNG105 is highly expressed in embryonic brains, whereas RNG140 is highly expressed in adult brains. Furthermore, the granules where RNG105 or RNG140 is localized are distinct RNA granules in both cultured cells and neuronal dendrites. Thus, RNG140 is an RNA-binding protein that shows different expression and localization patterns from RNG105. Knockdown experiments in cultured neurons also are performed, which demonstrate that suppression of RNG140 or RNG105 reduces dendrite length and spine density. Knockdown effects of RNG140 were not rescued by RNG105, and vise versa, suggesting distinct roles of RNG105 and RNG140. These results suggest that RNG140 has roles in the maintenance of the dendritic structure in the adult vertebrate brain through localizing to a kind of RNA granules that are distinct from RNG105-containing granules.

The transport of specific mRNAs and local control of translation play important roles in local translation in a cell, which contributes to several cellular processes including axis formation, stress responses, and long term synaptic plasticity (1Kloc M.

The specific mRNAs are recruited into RNA granules, which are key RNA-protein complexes for controlling the transport, stability, and translation of mRNAs. There are different types of RNA granules, including neuronal RNA granules, stress granules, and processing bodies (P bodies). 3The abbreviations used are: P bodiesprocessing bodiesRNGRNA granule proteinRNGIRNG invertebrateGSTglutathione S-transferaseFMRPfragile X mental retardation proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinmRFPmonomeric red fluorescent proteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNARNAiRNA interference. Neuronal RNA granules store specific mRNAs and repress their translation during the transport of the mRNAs into dendrites. The granules release the mRNAs to be translated in response to synaptic stimulation, which is responsible for long term synaptic plasticity (5Kiebler M.A. Bassell G.J. Neuron. 2006; 51: 685-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Sossin W.S. DesGroseillers L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Stress granules appear in the cytoplasm of somatic cells in response to stress such as arsenite treatment. Stress granules recruit mRNAs encoding “housekeeping” proteins and repress their translation, which contributes to stress-induced translational arrest (7Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). P bodies are cytoplasmic RNA granules containing mRNA decay machinery and are involved in mRNA degradation and translational repression (8Parker R. Sheth U. Mol.

All of the three types of RNA granules share some protein components such as translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). On the other hand, other components are shared only between neuronal RNA granules and stress granules, e.g. G3BP (RasGAP SH3 domain-binding protein) and ribosomes (6Sossin W.S. DesGroseillers L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). P bodies are distinguished from the other two granules by the absence of ribosomes and are characterized by the presence of enzymes for the mRNA decay pathway such as DCP1/2 and XRN1. Although stress granules and P bodies are distinct structures, they are linked dynamically and share some enzymes, including XRN1 (7Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). RNG105 is an RNA-binding protein highly expressed in the brain and localized to neuronal RNA granules in dendrites (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RNG105 also is expressed in proliferating cells, so it also is known as caprin-1 (cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1) (10Grill B. Wilson G.M. Zhang K.X. Wang B. Doyonnas R. Quadroni M. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, RNG105 is localized to stress granules (9Shiina N. Shinkura K.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RNG105 binds to mRNAs nonspecifically and represses translation in vitro or when overexpressed in cells (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Solomon S. Xu Y. Wang B. David M.D. Schubert P. Kennedy D. Schrader J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, endogenous RNG105 binds to specific mRNAs both in neurons and proliferating cells, and loss of RNG105 does not affect the global translation rates in cells (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Solomon S. Xu Y. Wang B. David M.D. Schubert P. Kennedy D. Schrader J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RNG105 has two basic domains, N-terminal basic helices (coiled-coil) and C-terminal RGG boxes (RG-rich region), which are responsible for RNA binding and translational repression in vitro and for RNA granule formation (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In neurons, the localization of RNG105 to neuronal RNA granules coincides with cargo mRNAs and is regulated dynamically by synaptic stimulation, suggesting the role of RNG105 in mRNA transport and local translational control (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RNG140, also termed EEG-1L or caprin-2, is reported as a paralog of RNG105 (10Grill B. Wilson G.M.

Although similarities in the amino acid sequences between RNG140 and RNG105 have been shown, the functions of RNG140 still remain to be characterized. In this study, RNG140 was identified as an RNA-binding protein, which was present in RNA granules that were distinct from RNG105-containing RNA granules. RNG140 and RNG105 also were different in their expression patterns in fetal and adult mouse brains. Loss of RNG140 or RNG105 in neurons resulted in the reduction of dendrite length and spine density. The results suggested roles of RNG140 and RNG105 in dendrite organization at different location and times in neurons. cDNA sequences were obtained from the GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ databases.

The aligned sequences were compared using ClustalW software. Dendrograms were generated using Phylodendron software. The following antibodies were used in the present study: anti-ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FMRP (Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Sigma), anti-PSD-95 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-GFP (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), anti-DCP2 (generous gift from Dr. M.

Rat cDNAs encoding amino acids 884–1,031 of RNG140 and the full length of G3BP were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from rat brain RNA. These fragments were cloned into a pGEX-5X-3 vector (GE Healthcare) to produce fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (GE Healthcare). The GST tag was removed by factor Xa cleavage, and then RNG140 and G3BP proteins were purified in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The purified proteins were used as antigens to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The antibodies were affinity-purified on Affi-Gel 10 gel (Bio-Rad), which had been conjugated with the respective antigens. Extracts from mouse tissues or cultured A6 cells were prepared by homogenization in 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Extracts were loaded on polyacrylamide gels (30 μg protein per lane), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and probed with the primary antibodies. Biotinylated secondary antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin were used for detection with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium solution. To construct the expression vectors for GST-RNG140 and GST-RNG140 deletion mutants, Rng140 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from rat brain RNA and cloned into the SmaI/NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-3 vector. The primers were 5′-TCCCCCGGGTCATGAAGTCAGCCAAGTCCCAAG-3′ (N-SmaI) and 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCTTAATCTTGATAAAGAAGATAGCCT-3′ (C-NotI) for GST-RNG140, 5′-TCCCCCGGGTCGAAGCAGTAGAAAAGTATGAAG-3′ (ΔN-SmaI) and C-NotI for GST-RNG140ΔN, N-SmaI and 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCTCAACTACTGATAAATGGCTGAGCAG-3′ (ΔC-NotI) for GST-RNG140ΔC, and ΔN-SmaI and ΔC-NotI for GST-RNG140ΔNC. The recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21) and subjected to RNA-binding assay as described previously (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins also were subjected to translation assays in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega, Madison, WI) using luciferase mRNA as a template as described previously (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To construct the expression vectors for RNG140-green fluorescent protein (RNG140-GFP) and RNG140-GFP deletion mutants, rat Rng140 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XhoI and KpnI sites of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). The primers were 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGAAGTCAGCCAAGTCCCAAG-3′ (N-XhoI) and 5′-GGGGTACCCCACCTCCACCTCCATCTTGATAAAGAAGATAGCCTGAAA-3′ (C-KpnI) for RNG140-GFP, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGAAGCAGTAGAAAAGTATGAAG-3′ and C-KpnI for RNG140ΔN-GFP, and N-XhoI and 5′-GGGGTACCCCCCCACCCCCCCCACTACTGATAAATGGCTG-3′ for RNG140ΔC-GFP. Cultured Chinese hamster ovary and A6 cells were transfected with the vectors according to the Lipofectin protocol (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected by treatment with Geneticin (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Shiina N. Tsukita S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For in situ hybridization, A6 cells or rat hippocampal slices were subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 3′-digoxigenin-labeled poly(dT) probe (55-mer) as described previously (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The specimens were imaged using an FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) with a PlanApo 60× oil objective lens or a Delta Vision optical sectioning microscope (Applied Precision, Inc., Issaquah, WA) equipped with an IX70 microscope (Olympus Optical) with a PlanApo 60× oil objective lens or a UPlanApo 20× objective lens. A6 cells co-transfected with RNG140-GFP and RNG105-monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) vectors were cultured on glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). Time-lapse images of the cells were taken with an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX71; Olympus Optical) using a LUC Plan FL 40× objective lens and a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan). Cells with low expression levels of RNG140-GFP and RNG105-mRFP were selected for the imaging. The cells had very few RNG140-GFP-localizing and RNG105-mRFP-localizing granules before arsenite treatment. Mixtures of siRNAs for RNG105, RNG140, and control were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) (siGENOME SMART pool M-056618-00-0005, M-057521-01-0005, and D-001206-13-05, respectively). Cerebral cortical neurons from embryonic day 15.5 mice were cultured in minimum essential medium (Sigma) containing N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and 2% fetal bovine serum. The neurons were co-transfected with the siRNAs (0.5 μg each for 7.1 cm2) and pEGFP-N1 vector (0.5 μg for 7.1 cm2) at 7 days in vitro using the conventional calcium-phosphate precipitation method. In rescue experiments, the expression vector for RNG105-GFP or RNG140-GFP (2 μg each for 7.1 cm2) was introduced to the neurons. Three days later, the neurons were subjected to immunofluorescence studies. RNG105 has been shown previously to contain specific domains such as basic helices (coiled-coil), a glutamic acid-rich region, a glutamine-rich region, and RGG boxes (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The N-terminal basic helices and the C-terminal RGG boxes are responsible for the strong and weak RNA-binding abilities, respectively. Structural analysis of RNG140 revealed that RNG140 also contains basic helices and RGG boxes, suggesting that RNG140 is an RNA-binding protein (Fig. 1A). However, RNG140 does not contain the glutamic acid-rich region or glutamine-rich region. RNG140 is characterized by the C-terminal domain, which is homologous to the globular domain of complement component C1q of the immune system (Fig. 1A) (14Reid K.B. Colomb M. Petry F. Loos M. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 115-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Database homology searches found that an RNG105/RNG140 homolog is conserved in urochordates, echinoderms, and insects (Fig. 1, A and B). Only one gene for RNG105/RNG140 homolog was found in the invertebrate animals, suggesting that duplication and divergence of the gene had occurred in the early evolution of vertebrates. We designated the invertebrate homolog RNGI (RNG invertebrate). Sequence alignment of RNG105, RNG140, and RNGI revealed that the basic helix-containing region was the most highly conserved region across animal phyla (Fig. 1, A and C). This region had two peaks of basic charge, corresponding to two basic helices (Fig. 1, A and C). In each helix, the amino acids are arranged to form a hydrophobic stripe along one side of the α-helix and basic clusters on the other side (Fig. 1D). The hydrophobic stripe may contribute to protein-protein interactions, such as those found in coiled-coil domains, and the basic clusters may serve as a docking surface for nucleic acids (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-RNG140 was expressed in E. coli and purified, and then its RNA-binding ability was examined in vitro. RNG140, as well as RNG105, bound directly to RNA (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the N terminus containing the basic helices (ΔN and ΔNC) markedly reduced the binding ability. In contrast, deletion of the C terminus containing the RGG boxes (ΔC) did not appear to affect the RNA-binding ability (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that the N-terminal region of RNG140 is a major RNA-binding site, consistent with findings in RNG105 (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA binding of RNG140 was sequence-independent, which was similar to that of RNG105 (data not shown). It was shown previously that RNG105 represses the translation of bound mRNAs in vitro, and the N terminus is required for the repression activity (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, B and C, the effect of RNG140 on translation was examined in vitro. Full-length RNG140 repressed translation in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion of the C terminus (ΔC) did not alter the translation repression activity, whereas deletion of the N terminus (ΔN and ΔNC) resulted in decreases in the repression activity. These results indicated that RNG140 has translation repression activity in vitro and that the basic helix region was responsible for the activity. These results were similar to the case of RNG105 (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RNG105 induces the formation of cytoplasmic RNA granules when overexpressed in cultured cells, and both the N-terminal basic helices and the C-terminal RGG boxes are required for granule formation (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was examined whether RNG140 also has ability to induce cytoplasmic RNA granules in cultured cells. Overexpression of RNG140-GFP in Chinese hamster ovary and A6 cultured cells induced the formation of cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). The granules contained mRNAs as judged by in situ hybridization with poly(dT) (Fig. 3, top panels), indicating that they were RNA granules. Deletion of the N terminus (ΔN) markedly reduced granule formation (supplemental Fig. 1). The effect of the C-terminal deletion (ΔC) was more severe, i.e. the granules were not formed at all (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicated that RNG140 induces the formation of cytoplasmic RNA granules and that both the N- and the C- terminal regions are required for the granule formation. It is reported that cytoplasmic RNA granules such as stress granules are dynamic structures containing translationally inactive mRNAs which are in equilibrium with polysomes. Granules formed by trapping translationally inactive mRNAs are disassembled by cycloheximide that stabilizes polysomes (15Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). RNG140-induced RNA granules as well as RNG105-induced granules were disassembled by cycloheximide (supplemental Fig. 2), which suggested that these granules are related to repression of translation. RNG105-induced RNA granules contain ribosomes, G3BP, and T cell intracellular antigen-1, and they also are induced by stress, indicating that they are stress granules (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Solomon S. Xu Y. Wang B. David M.D. Schubert P. Kennedy D. Schrader J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RNG105-GFP-expressing cultured cells were immunostained, and it was confirmed that RNG105-induced RNA granules contained the components of stress granules such as ribosomes, G3BP, and FMRP (Fig. 3). The granules also contained P body components DCP2 and XRN1, which were consistent with the report that stress granules and P bodies are dynamically linked and share some components (7Anderson P. Kedersha N. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 8Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). RNG140-GFP-expressing cells were immunostained with the same antibodies (Fig. 3). In contrast to the RNG105-induced RNA granules, the RNG140-induced granules were not co-localized with ribosomes, G3BP, or RNG105, suggesting that they were not stress granules. FMRP, which reportedly is localized in all the three types of RNA granules, was contained in the RNG140-induced granules. The results that RNG140-induced RNA granules do not contain ribosomes led to an experiment to determine whether the granules are identical to P bodies. Immunostaining of RNG140-GFP-expressing cells revealed that the RNG140-induced RNA granules did not contain DCP2 or XRN1, indicating that the granules were not P bodies (Fig. 3). Time-lapse observation of stress-induced granule formation after arsenite treatment was performed in cultured cells co-expressing RNG105-mRFP and RNG140-GFP (Fig. 4). Cells that expressed low amounts of RNG105-mRFP and RNG140-GFP were used so that no or few granules were formed in the cytoplasm before arsenite treatment. After arsenite treatment, stress granules where RNG105-mRFP was concentrated were induced in the cytoplasm. In contrast, RNG140-GFP remained distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm and was not concentrated into RNG105-containing stress granules (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicated that RNG140 was not recruited into the RNG105-containing RNA granules and that RNG140-induced RNA granules were not stress granules or P bodies. To examine the expression and localization of RNG140 in tissues, a polyclonal antibody against RNG140 was generated. The antibody recognized recombinant RNG140 specifically, and absorption of the antibody with recombinant RNG140 diminished the reaction as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown). Immunoblotting of extracts from adult mouse brain showed that the antibody recognized a 140-kDa protein (Fig. 5A). Extracts from adult mouse tissues were immunoblotted with the antibodies against RNG105 and RNG140 (Fig. 5B). RNG105 was expressed highly in the brain, and it also was expressed at low levels in other tissues such as thymus, heart, liver, and testis. On the other hand, RNG140 was expressed specifically in the brain and was not detectable in other tissues (Fig. 5B). Expression of RNG105 in the brain was abundant in embryos compared with adult mice (Fig. 5C). In contrast, RNG140 was abundant in the brain in adult mice but markedly less abundant in embryos (Fig. 5C). Thus, RNG140 appeared to be expressed mainly in adult brain. The subcellular localizations of RNG105 and RNG140 were examined in the brain by immunostaining of slices of adult mouse brains (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. 3). In hippocampal neurons, RNG140, as well as RNG105, was localized to granular structures in dendrites (supplemental Fig. 3A). In the cerebellar molecular layers, RNG140 was localized to granular structures in the dendrites of Purkinje cells, but RNG105 was not detectable in the dendrites and was limited to the nucleus (supplemental Fig. 3B). To compare the subcellular localizations of RNG105 and RNG140 in hippocampal dendrites, brain slices were double stained with RNG105 and RNG140 antibodies (Fig. 6A). Although both RNG140 and RNG105 were localized to granular structures, the granules did not show any significant co-localization (Fig. 6A). It was shown previously that RNG105 co-localized well with ribosomes in hippocampal dendrites (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to RNG105, RNG140 did not show significant co-localization with ribosomes in dendrites (Fig. 6B). In addition, RNG140 did not show significant co-localization with markers of neuronal and stress granules such as FMRP, staufen, or G3BP, except that a little fraction of RNG140 granules were co-localized with staufen (Fig. 6, C–E and H). In contrast, RNG140 granules were significantly co-localized with mRNAs as judged by in situ hybridization with poly(dT) (Figs. 6, G and H, and supplemental Fig. 4). In RNG140 granules with low fluorescence intensity of RNG140 (<40 arbitrary units), poly(dT) fluorescence intensity was significantly low (supplemental Fig. 4B). This may be partly due to low sensitivity of poly(dT) staining in small RNG140 granules and resulted in underestimation of co-localization of mRNA and RNG140 (Fig. 6H, ∼25%). Co-localization of RNG105 with mRNA, judged by the same method in Fig. 6H, was similar (∼29%) to that of RNG140. Some of RNG140 granules were accumulated near the postsynaptic sites stained with anti-PSD-95 antibody (Fig. 6, F and H), as reported for neuronal RNA granules (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Knowles R.B. Sabry J.H. Martone M.E. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Bassell G.J. Kosik K.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7812-7820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Steward O. Levy W.B. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RNG140 is localized to dendritic RNA granules in neurons, but the granules were distinct from RNG105-containing RNA granules. Next, to examine the physiological significance of RNG105 and RNG140 in neurons, RNAi of RNG105 and RNG140 was performed. Cultured neurons from mouse cerebral cortex were co-transfected with siRNA for RNG105 or RNG140 and a GFP reporter to trace the affected cells. Expression of RNG105 or RNG140 was suppressed in neurons expressing the GFP reporter (supplemental Fig. 5). RNG140 siRNA-transfected GFP-positive neurons apparently reduced their dendrite area (Fig. 7A). Quantification revealed that dendrites of RNG140 RNAi neurons were reduced in number, length, and branching (Fig. 7B). RNG105 RNAi also reduced dendrite length, but RNAi of RNG140 had more severe effects on dendrites than RNG105 RNAi (Fig. 7). Rescue experiments showed that RNG105 knockdown was rescued by not RNG140 but RNG105 expression, whereas RNG140 knockdown was rescued by not RNG105 (except the number of primary dendrites) but RNG140 (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that RNG105 and RNG140 play distinct roles in the maintenance and/or development of dendrites. RNAi of RNG105 and RNG140 also affected dendritic spines. Although the size of spines was not affected, spine density was reduced by RNG105 and RNG140 RNAi (Fig. 8). Furthermore, RNAi of RNG105 and RNG140 in postsynaptic neurons resulted in the decrease of the attachment of synapsin I-containing axon terminals from GFP-negative normal neurons to spines (Fig. 8). Although the phenotype was similar between RNG105 and RNG140 RNAi, RNG140 knockdown was not rescued by RNG105 and vice versa (Fig. 8B). These results suggested that RNG105 and RNG140 play distinct roles, but both of them participate in the maintenance and/or development of dendrites and dendritic spines. This study characterized RNG140, a paralog of RNG105 in vertebrates. RNG140 was revealed to be an RNA-binding protein, whose in vitro properties were similar to those of RNG105. RNG140 and RNG105 share two RNA-binding domains: N-terminal basic helices and C-terminal RGG boxes. The basic helices were the most highly conserved region between the two proteins and were responsible for the RNA-binding ability and the formation of RNA granules. RNG140, as well as RNG105, was most highly expressed in the brain. However, the time of their expression was different; expression of RNG105 was high in embryos but that of RNG140 was high in adults. RNA granules that contain RNG105 or RNG140 were also distinct structures: RNG140-localizing RNA granules did not contain ribosomes, G3BP, or RNG105 in proliferating cells and in neurons. Furthermore, RNG140-induced granules were not stress-inducible, unlike RNG105-induced granules. These results indicated that RNG140-localizing RNA granules were distinct from stress granules or neuronal RNA granules where RNG105 was localized. In addition, RNG140-localizing RNA granules did not contain DCP2 or XRN1, suggesting that they were not P bodies either. Thus, it was found that RNG140 and RNG105 are localized to distinct RNA granules and are different in spatiotemporal expression patterns in the brain. Present results that the suppression of RNG105 and RNG140 in cultured neurons reduced dendrite length and spine density suggested that these paralogs are involved in the maintenance and/or development of dendrites and spines at distinct location and time in vertebrate neurons. In the highly conserved basic helices among RNG105, RNG140, and RNGI, hydrophobic amino acids are arranged in a stripe on one side, and basic amino acids are arranged in clusters on the other side. The basic clusters may serve as a docking surface for nucleic acids, as in the case of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, signal recognition particle, and basic helix-loop-helix proteins (18Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Rupert P.B. Ferré-D'amaré A.R. Structure. 2000; 8: R99-R104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Nelson H.C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In fact, deletion of the basic helices of RNG105 and RNG140 resulted in a marked decrease in their RNA-binding abilities (Fig. 2A) (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RGG box is an RNA-binding motif conserved among a variety of RNA-binding proteins (21Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). The RGG boxes of RNG105 and RNG140 appear to play minor roles in RNA-binding in vitro (Fig. 2A) (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but major roles in the formation of RNA granules in cultured cells (supplemental Fig. 1) (9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Glutamic acid-rich and glutamine-rich regions are contained in RNG105 but not conserved in RNG140 or RNGI, although acidic and glutamine-clusters are present in RNGI. Glutamine-rich regions have been reported in some of RNA- and DNA-binding proteins to participate in protein-protein interaction (22Ström A.C. Forsberg M. Lillhager P. Westin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Förch P. Puig O. Martínez C. Séraphin B. Valcárcel J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6882-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The glutamic acid-rich region is highly acidic and may be involved in electrostatic interaction with some proteins. The C1q globular domain is contained only in RNG140. The C1q globular domain is found in many extracellular proteins, playing roles in homo- or heterotrimerization and in targeting to specific extracellular receptors (24Innamorati G. Bianchi E. Whang M.I. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Tacnet P. Cheong E.C. Goeltz P. Ghebrehiwet B. Arlaud G.J. Liu X.Y. Lesieur C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to the extracellular proteins, three intracellular proteins containing the C1q globular domain have been reported, including RNG140 (EEG-1L) (12Aerbajinai W. Lee Y.T. Wojda U. Barr V.A. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1916-1921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Innamorati G. Bianchi E. Whang M.I. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C1q globular domain inside the cell is suggested to play a role as a scaffolding element and be involved in the formation of complexes to regulate signaling cascades (24Innamorati G. Bianchi E. Whang M.I. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, glutamic acid-rich and glutamine-rich regions are specific to RNG105, whereas the C1q globular domain is specific to RNG140. As all of these domains are likely to participate in protein-protein interactions, it is possible that the RNG105- and the RNG140-specific domains may mediate the formation of distinct complexes for RNG105 and RNG140. RNG140 as well as RNG105 bound to mRNAs in a sequence-independent manner and inhibited translation in vitro. However, it has been reported that knock-out of RNG105 (caprin-1) in chicken DT40 cells does not increase global rates of translation (11Solomon S. Xu Y. Wang B. David M.D. Schubert P. Kennedy D. Schrader J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The knock-out phenotype that was explained by the effects of RNG105 on translation may be regulated by posttranslational modification or may be dependent on mRNA and associated proteins in vivo (11Solomon S. Xu Y. Wang B. David M.D. Schubert P. Kennedy D. Schrader J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2324-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although translation inhibition activity was a common in vitro feature of RNG105 and RNG140, detailed studies on the effects of RNG105 and RNG140 on mRNAs in vivo are required to answer the question of whether RNG105 and RNG140 act as translational repressors. The expression of RNG105 and RNG140 in cultured cells induced the formation of RNA granules. The granule induction was likely to be dependent on the amount of the exogenously expressed proteins. Although ∼85% of RNG105-expressing cells contained RNA granules, only ∼8% of RNG140-expressing cells contained RNA granules. In the other cells, RNG105 and RNG140 showed diffuse cytoplasmic distributions. A possible reason for the low frequency of the cells containing RNG140-induced RNA granules was that the overexpression of RNG140 increased the level of apoptosis (12Aerbajinai W. Lee Y.T. Wojda U. Barr V.A. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1916-1921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the expression level of RNG140 was high in cells containing RNG140-induced RNA granules, such cells may be susceptible to cell death. However, in the adult brain, the RNG140 expression level was high, and RNG140-localizing RNA granules were formed without apparent cell death. A possible notion was that the formation of RNG140-localizing RNA granules and the susceptibility to cell death may depend on the state of the cells, e.g. the cells were differentiated or not. The present study showed that RNG140-localizing granules were mRNA-containing RNA granules that were related to repression of translation but were distinct from RNG105-localizing stress granules or neuronal RNA granules. The RNG140-localizing granules may not be P bodies because they did not contain the enzymes for mRNA decay. RNG140-localizing RNA granules may be like “transport particles” in yeast that do not contain ribosomes (6Sossin W.S. DesGroseillers L. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or a novel kind of RNA granule. Detailed studies such as the identification of RNG140-associated proteins and mRNAs would be required. Expression of RNG105 (caprin-1) reportedly was up-regulated when T and B lymphoblasts are activated (10Grill B. Wilson G.M. Zhang K.X. Wang B. Doyonnas R. Quadroni M. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2389-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression of RNG140 (EEG-1L) was reported to be up-regulated when erythroblasts shift from a proliferative state toward their terminal phase of differentiation (12Aerbajinai W. Lee Y.T. Wojda U. Barr V.A. Miller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1916-1921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression timings of RNG105 and RNG140 suggested a possibility that they may be involved in the regulation of translation at the onset of differentiation by binding to specific mRNAs. On the other hand, there is a report that RNG140 (caprin-2) participates in the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (26Ding Y. Xi Y. Chen T. Wang J.Y. Tao D.L. Wu Z.L. Li Y.P. Li C. Zeng R. Li L. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This report may suggest another possible role of RNG140 besides acting as an RNA-binding protein. RNG105/RNG140/RNGI is conserved in deuterostomes and insects but was not found in yeast or Caenorhabditis elegans. In vertebrates, e.g. frogs and rodents, both RNG105 and RNG140 were most highly expressed in the brain (this study and 9Shiina N. Shinkura K. Tokunaga M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4420-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These facts suggested a possibility that RNG105, RNG140, and possibly RNGI are involved in functions of the central nervous system. In fact, in the present study, RNG105 and RNG140 were demonstrated to be localized to dendrites and postsynapses in neurons and play roles in the maintenance and/or development of dendrites and postsynaptic spines, suggesting their involvement in the proper networking of neurons. RNG105 knock-out mice were generated previously, and they were shown to die soon after birth because of respiratory failure, suggesting defects in the brainstem. 4N. Shiina and M. Tokunaga, unpublished observations. Further lines of evidence were obtained that RNG105 was responsible for the formation of synapses and neuronal networks.4 These results are consistent with the idea that RNG105 is involved in the function of embryonic brain. In contrast to RNG105, RNG140 was highly expressed in the brain of adults, suggesting a possibility that RNG140 has roles that are specific in the brain of adult vertebrates. Moreover, the effects of RNG140 knockdown on dendrites and spines were more severe than those of RNG105 knockdown and were not rescued by RNG105 expression, suggesting a possibility that RNG140 plays roles in the maintenance of dendritic structure through different mechanisms from RNG105. Further studies such as the identification of RNG140-associated mRNAs and RNG140 knock-out in mice would further elucidate these possibilities. We thank K. Shinkura and K.

Here we report the first identification and characterization of the promoter for ITGB8. We show that a SP binding site and a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the ITGB8 core promoter are required for its expression and that Sp1, Sp3, and several AP-1 transcription factors form a complex that binds to these sites in a p38-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the requirement for Sp3, ATF-2, and p38 for the transcription and protein expression of integrin beta8. Additionally, reduction of SP3 or inhibition of p38 blocks alphavbeta8-mediated transforming growth factor beta activation.

WS is unique among early aging syndromes in that affected individuals are developmentally normal, and phenotypic onset is in early adulthood. The protein defective in WS (WRN) is a member of the large RecQ family of helicases but is unique among this family in having an exonuclease. RecQ helicases form multimers, but the mechanism and consequence of multimerization remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify a novel heptad repeat coiled coil region between the WRN nuclease and helicase domains that facilitates multimerization of WRN. We mapped a novel and unique DNA-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site proximal to the WRN multimerization region. However, phosphorylation at this site affected neither exonuclease activity nor multimeric state. We found that WRN nuclease is stimulated by DNA-dependent protein kinase independently of kinase activity or WRN nuclease multimeric status. In addition, WRN nuclease multimerization significantly increased nuclease processivity. We found that the novel WRN coiled coil domain is necessary for multimerization of the nuclease domain and sufficient to multimerize with full-length WRN in human cells. Importantly, correct homomultimerization is required for WRN function in vivo as overexpression of this multimerization domain caused increased sensitivity to camptothecin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide similar to that in cells lacking functional WRN protein.

WS arises due to hereditary defects in the WRN gene, which encodes a 160-kDa protein (WRN) containing a central 3′–5′ DNA helicase domain that has sequence homology to the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase, whose roles in DNA metabolism remain incompletely defined (8Yu C.E.

Werner syndrome DNA-dependent protein kinase WRN exonuclease domain catalytic DNA-PK subunit adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate Werner syndrome protein Bloom syndrome protein. WRN is one of five RecQ homologues that have been identified in mammalian cells; the others are RecQL1, BLM, RECQL4, and RECQL5. Hereditary mutations in BLM result in the marked cancer-predisposed Bloom syndrome (11Kaneko H. Kondo N. Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2004; 4: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in RecQL4 cause Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, which results in skin abnormalities and skeletal defects (12Dietschy T. Shevelev I. Stagljar I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Disease-linked mutations in RecQL1 or -5 have not yet been described. The pathologies of the three RecQ-associated diseases appear to be quite distinct, suggesting that WRN, BLM, and RecQL4 have discrete functions within the cell. Interestingly, the regions outside of the conserved central helicase domains are divergent and may endow the diversity of functionalities to these different RecQ family members. In WRN, the amino-terminal extension contains a 3′–5′ exonuclease domain (10Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Structural biochemistry studies on the WRN exonuclease domain (WRN-exo) revealed an architecture and two-metal ion-mediated molecular mechanism similar to the E. coli DNA polymerase I proofreading domain (14Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, WRN-exo has gained an additional function over the DNA polymerase I proofreading exonuclease as WRN-exo also displays increased enzymatic activity in the presence of the Ku70/80 subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (14Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). DNA-PK has essential functions in the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA double strand break repair in mammalian cells and capping functions at mammalian telomeres (15Williams E.S. Klingler R.

The kinase function of this enzyme is activated when the catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, associates with the Ku70/80 component that is bound to DNA termini. This activated holo-DNA-PK is then able to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on a wide variety of substrates in vitro (19Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem.

Full-length WRN is also observed to assemble with DNA-PK on DNA, and WRN activity is regulated by the Ku70/80 subunit and the DNA-PK holoenzyme (7Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W. Murphy M.B. Huang S.

Moreover, non-homologous end joining-mediated repair in WS cells exhibits extensive deletions, suggesting perhaps that another, less regulated exonuclease substitutes for WRN in these cells (26Oshima J. Huang S. Pae C. Campisi J. Schiestl R.H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 547-551PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we characterize the unique amino-terminal region of WRN and identify a specific multimerization region between the exonuclease and helicase domains near the amino terminus of WRN. Absence of this multimerization region altered the multimeric state of WRN-exo constructs and reduced nuclease processivity, resulting in pausing/terminating at specific sites on double-stranded DNA substrates. Expression of a small WRN fragment containing this region was sufficient to assemble heteromultimers with full-length WRN in human cells. Moreover, heteromultimer formation disrupted WRN function, causing sensitivity to camptothecin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide similar to that observed in WS cells. The multimerization region also contains one unique DNA-PK phosphorylation site, but surprisingly, phosphorylation did not affect exonuclease processivity or multimerization state in vitro. However, interactions with DNA-PK increased nuclease processivity in WRN-exo constructs irrespective of the multimerization region, suggesting interactions with the core nuclease domain that stabilize WRN-exo interactions with DNA substrates. Our results identify a novel domain functional in WRN multimeric assembly that gives insight into the organization and architecture of the WRN protein. PCR primers were designed based on limited proteolysis results and secondary structure predictions. PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase, the resulting PCR products were cloned into pET23 expression vector (Novagen), and the sequence was confirmed. Clones were grown in liquid culture and induced with 100 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in midlog phase, harvested after 4–12 h, and lysed by sonication, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation. Expression and solubility were evaluated by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Clones showing high levels of soluble protein expression were scaled up to multiple liter scale, and the proteins were purified to near homogeneity with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (GE Healthcare), Mono Q (GE Healthcare), and Superdex S-200 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) chromatography. Antibodies recognizing WRN amino termini were raised in New Zealand white rabbits against purified recombinant WRN(1–333) using standard protocols (Apex Materials Safety). Antiserum from two rabbits was tested for reactivity on WRN(38–236), WRN(1–236), and WRN(1–333); antiserum 10061 recognized epitopes within WRN(236–333). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies recognizing polyhistidine (H-15) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Kinase assays were carried out as described previously (7Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W.

Reactions were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, visualized, and quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software from GE Healthcare. The purified WRN(38–236), WRN(1–236), and WRN(1–333) proteins were loaded onto a Superdex S-200 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated with 150 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at 4 °C. The protein mass standards were purchased from GE Healthcare and were run under identical chromatographic conditions for column calibration (ferritin, 440 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; chymotrypsinogen, 25 kDa). Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out using a DynaPro 99 dynamic light scattering instrument from Protein Solutions. 250-μl samples of WRN(38–236), WRN(1–236), and WRN(1–333) in gel filtration buffer were filtered through a Whatman membrane of 0.2-μm pore size, manually injected into the 16 °C flow cell, and illuminated with an incident beam from a 25-milliwatt, 790 nm solid-state laser. Exonuclease assays were carried out under conditions reported previously (7Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W. Murphy M.B. Huang S. Campisi J. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38242-38248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 35-bp double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide with five nucleotide single strand extensions on both 5′ termini was labeled on one strand and annealed (5′-GGC GCA AAT CAA CAC GTT GAC TAC CGT CTT GAG GCA GAG T; 5′-CCG GGA CTC TGC CTC AAG ACG GTA GTC AAC GTG TTG ATT T). Approximately 300 fmol of probe was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol with the indicated amount of protein(s). Reaction products were resolved on 16 or 20% polyacrylamide, Tris borate-EDTA gels containing 8.3 m urea and visualized by phosphorimaging and/or autoradiography. HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-WRN(250–366) were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) on ice for 20 min. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min and then precleared with mouse IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was then incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and WRN monoclonal antibody (raised against 940–1432 amino acid region of WRN) for 4 h at 4 °C, and antibody-antigen complex was recovered by using protein A/G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, then eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Parental HeLa and HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-WRN(250–366) were plated in triplicate (3 × 102–2 × 103 cells/25-cm2 flask) and incubated for 12–18 h. Cells were then treated with varying doses of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, hydroxyurea, and camptothecin. Cells were washed twice, trypsinized, counted, and replated in three 10-cm2 dishes at 1, 24, and 72 h after 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, hydroxyurea, and camptothecin treatments, respectively. After a 12-day incubation, dishes were stained with crystal violet (0.5% crystal violet, 1% formaldehyde, 1× phosphate buffered saline), and survival was scored by quantifying colonies. Survival curves were generated from three independent experiments with colony numbers normalized to sham-treated controls. A search for homologues of human WRN (UniProt accession number Q14191) was conducted using PSI-BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59448) Google Scholar). Alignments were performed using the BioEdit (Ibis Therapeutics, Carlsbad, CA) and ClustalW alignment software followed by manual adjustment. Analysis of coiled coil motifs was conducted using Coils (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar) and Marcoil (29Delorenzi M. Speed T. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Our previous studies defining the crystal structure of the core WRN exonuclease, amino acids 38–236 (WRN(38–236)), determined that this domain was monomeric (14Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, a slightly larger construct, WRN(1–333), was reported to form a high order complex (30Huang S. Beresten S. Li B. Oshima J. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To identify potential multimerization regions and define domain boundaries, we purified and characterized WRN(1–333). Purified recombinant protein from E. coli cells was subjected to limited proteolysis with either trypsin or chymotrypsin and visualized by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry and amino terminus sequencing were used to delineate the proteolytic fragments and identify domain boundaries. Our data indicated two major proteolytic cleavage sites located approximately at amino acids 38 and 236 of the WRN(1–333) construct. These results guided the construction and purification of three soluble WRN-exo proteins of diminishing size (Fig. 1B). All three proteins were isolated and stored in identical buffers at equivalent concentrations of 1.5 mg/ml. The multimeric states of our nuclease constructs were investigated using size exclusion chromatography under stringent (0.5 m NaCl) buffer conditions (Fig. 2). The smallest construct WRN(38–236) eluted as a single symmetrical peak at a volume most consistent with a monomeric form of the 24-kDa protein (Fig. 2). The largest 39-kDa WRN(1–333) protein also eluted as a single symmetrical peak; however, the elution volume in this case is most consistent with a trimeric form with a corresponding mass of ∼108 kDa (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the intermediate sized construct (WRN(1–236)) eluted as three separate detectable peaks under our experimental conditions with the predominant WRN(1–236) peak consistent with a monomeric form, whereas the less abundant forms were consistent with dimeric and trimeric forms of this construct (Fig. 2). The multimeric states of the three WRN nuclease constructs were further investigated with dynamic light scattering to independently evaluate dispersity and approximate mass in solution (Table 1). Under buffer conditions identical to the chromatography above, dynamic light scattering measurements showed that 91% of WRN(38–236) is in the monomeric form with a calculated mass of 26.4 kDa (Table 1). Measurements of WRN(1–333) are also in agreement with the gel filtration results, revealing that 97% of the protein is in one form; in this case, however, the dominant species is again most consistent with a trimer, having a mass of 113 kDa calculated from the light scattering data. The WRN(1–236) showed the greatest population heterogeneity among the three constructs with the majority of the material (86%) being monomeric, again completely consistent with the chromatography results (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Thus, the first 38 amino acids of WRN play a relatively minor role in multimerization, whereas amino acids 236–333 constitute a carboxyl-terminal extension from the core exonuclease that largely mediates WRN nuclease multimerization.TABLE 1Dynamic light scattering measurements for three WRN nuclease constructsWRNMolecular weightPopulationRadiusCalculated massaa%(nm)kDa1–33339,20097.44.531131–23627,80086.12.4926.438–23623,60091.62.4926.4 Open table in a new tab Inspection of the human WRN amino acid sequence revealed an amino acid pattern indicative of a heptad coiled coil motif within the identified multimerization region. Coiled coil motifs often function to mediate protein-protein interactions and protein multimerization (31Rose A. Meier I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1996-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Alignment of the human WRN sequence with homologous proteins having both helicase and exonuclease domains revealed conservation of the coiled coil motif with hydrophobic residues predominating heptad positions 1 and 4 (Fig. 3A). The amino acid composition at positions 1 and 4 dictates the number of helices in a coiled coil (32Woolfson D.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A repeated pattern of isoleucine at position 1 and leucine at position 4 in the heptad repeat gives rise to a dimeric coiled coil, whereas a repeating pattern of leucine and isoleucine at positions 1 and 4, respectively, causes the formation of a trimeric coiled coil (32Woolfson D.N. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 79-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Inspection of the heptad repeat in human WRN revealed a pattern most consistent with the formation of a trimeric coiled coil (Fig. 3A). To further evaluate the functionality of the multimerization region, we constructed a bacterial expression vector fusing a polyhistidine tag to WRN amino acids 228–333. This construct included the entirety of the predicted coiled coil region. Initial expression screening surprisingly revealed a ladder of bands visible on SDS-PAGE with an apparent periodicity of increasing mass in addition to the expected 17-kDa band (Fig. 3B, left). To test whether these bands were multimers of the WRN coiled coil that were resistant to SDS denaturation, we carried out Western blots using antibodies recognizing a WRN epitope between amino acids 228 and 333 (Fig. 3C). These data show that WRN(228–333) forms multimers of the 17-kDa construct that are resistant to disassembly on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C). To confirm this unexpected result, we repeated this experiment with commercial antibodies recognizing polyhistidine (Fig. 3D). These data confirm that WRN(228–333) forms multimers that are resistant to SDS denaturation. Variations in buffers and expression conditions were found to perturb the distribution of multimeric forms, but no conditions tested dissociated all multimers (data not shown). Although the monomeric (17-kDa) form is the predominant species, other discrete bands are clearly visible on the Western blots. Notably, higher mass forms migrating at approximate masses of 51 and 102 kDa, which correspond to trimeric and hexameric forms, respectively, and no larger multimers were observed (Fig. 3, C and D). To test the relevance of the identified coiled coil domain to WRN assembly in human cells, we constructed a mammalian expression vector containing the identified coiled coil motif (amino acids 250–366) fused to a FLAG epitope tag. This expression vector was stably transfected into HeLa cells, and WRN was immunoprecipitated from cleared cellular extracts. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies recognizing FLAG-WRN(250–366) precipitated the associated full-length WRN, indicating that a significant proportion of these proteins assemble into heteromultimers in vivo (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Likewise, immunoprecipitation of extracts with antibodies recognizing WRN epitopes not present on the recombinant FLAG-WRN(250–366) effectively co-precipitated the WRN(250–366) well above background levels (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Taken together, these data indicate that the coiled coil region of WRN is sufficient to facilitate multimerization with full-length WRN in human cells. Cells lacking functional WRN protein have a markedly increased sensitivity to the DNA-damaging drugs camptothecin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (33Pichierri P. Franchitto A. Mosesso P. Palitti F.

To determine the influence of WRN(250–366) expression on WRN function, we carried out toxicity assays using cells expressing FLAG-WRN(250–366). We found that recombinant expression of the WRN multimerization domain causes a distinctly elevated sensitivity to both camptothecin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (Fig. 4, B and C). Notably, expression of the multimerization domain did not increase sensitivity to hydroxyurea, suggesting that this effect is not a generalized loss of cellular fitness (Fig. 4D). These data are most consistent with heteromultimeric forms of WRN and WRN(250–366) having compromised function in vivo. The DNA-PK is known to influence the helicase and nuclease activities of WRN through interaction and phosphorylation of the full-length WRN (7Yannone S.M. Roy S. Chan D.W. Murphy M.B. Huang S.

We therefore tested whether DNA-PK phosphorylation events occur on the nuclease domain. In vitro kinase reactions using radioactive [32P]ATP were carried out with purified WRN-exo proteins and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). We observed robust radioactive labeling of both full-length WRN and WRN(1–333) in sharp contrast to the marginal radioactive labeling of WRN(1–236) in equivalent DNA-PK kinase reactions (Fig. 4A). Inspection of the 97 amino acids absent from WRN(1–236) but included in WRN(1–333) revealed 11 serine and five threonine residues, none of which were within a canonical (S/T)Q recognition motif for DNA-PK (38Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of in vitro phosphorylated WRN(1–333) revealed a nearly saturated single phosphorylation on a peptide that contained two serine residues, Ser-319 and Ser-323. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on either of these two sites to establish the specific serine phosphorylated by DNA-PK. The mutant proteins were partially purified from E. coli and subjected to in vitro kinase reactions. Somewhat surprisingly, despite not being in the canonical SQ context, we found that Ser-319 is the singular DNA-PK phosphorylation site among the 45 serines and threonines in the WRN(1–333) sequence (Fig. 5B). Because the phosphorylation site for DNA-PK at Ser-319 is proximal to the coiled coil region of WRN (see Fig. 7B), we next investigated whether phosphorylation perturbed the multimeric state of WRN(1–333). Equivalent quantities of WRN(1–333) were incubated with either DNA-PK or a mixture of commercially available phosphatases (λ and PP1). The reaction products were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, and the elution profiles were inspected for changes in WRN(1–333) multimeric state. Kinase reactions were validated by inclusion of radioactive ATP and incorporation of 32P (data not shown). We observed that irrespective of phosphorylation status WRN(1–333) eluted as a single symmetrical peak at a volume consistent with a trimeric form (Fig. 6A). Therefore, DNA-PK phosphorylation at serine 319 does not alter the multimeric state of this construct in vitro.FIGURE 6DNA-PK phosphorylation of WRN(1–333) does not alter multimeric state or nuclease activity.

They are formed by a pigment-containing cytoelastic sacculus, surrounded by muscle fibers directly innervated from the brain. Muscle contraction and relaxation are responsible for expansion and retraction of the pigment-containing cell. Their functioning depends on glutamate and Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH(2)-related peptides, which induce fast and slow cell expansion, respectively, and 5-hydroxytryptamine, which induces retraction. Apart from these three substances and acetylcholine, which acts presynaptically, no other neuroactive compounds have so far been found to be involved in the neuroregulation of chromatophore physiology, and the detailed signaling mechanisms are still little understood. Herein, we disclose the role of nitric oxide (NO) as mediator in one of the signaling pathways by which glutamate activates body patterning. NO and nitric-oxide synthase have been detected in pigment and muscle fibers of embryo, juvenile, and adult chromatophore organs from Sepia officinalis. NO-mediated Sepia chromatophore expansion operates at slower rate than glutamate and involves cGMP, cyclic ADP-ribose, and ryanodine receptor activation. These results demonstrate for the first time that NO is an important messenger in the long term maintenance of the body coloration patterns in Sepia."
https://openalex.org/W2078688652,"Herpesvirus replication involves the expression of over 80 viral genes in a well ordered sequence, leading to the production of new virions. Viral genes expressed during the earliest phases of replication often regulate both viral and cellular genes. Therefore, they have the potential to bring about dramatic functional changes within the cell. Replication and transcription activator (RTA) is a potent immediate early transcription activator of the gamma-herpesvirus family. This family includes Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, human pathogens associated with malignancy. Here we combine gene array technology with transcription factor profiling to identify the earliest DNA promoter and cellular transcription factor targets of RTA in the cellular genome. We find that expression of RTA leads to both activation and inhibition of distinct groups of cellular genes. The identity of the target genes suggests that RTA rapidly changes the cellular environment to counteract cell death pathways, support growth factor signaling, and also promote immune evasion of the infected cell. Transcription factor profiling of the target gene promoters highlighted distinct pathways involved in gene activation at specific time points. Most notable throughout was the high level of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-response elements in RTA target genes. We find that RTA can function as either an activator or an inhibitor of CREB-response genes, depending on the promoter context. The association with CREB also highlights a novel connection and coordination between viral and cellular ""immediate early"" responses."

In humans, the common β (βc) receptor is shared by the three cytokines and functions together with cytokine-specific α subunits in signaling. A widely accepted hypothesis is that receptor activation requires heterodisulfide formation between the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide in human βc (hβc) and unidentified cysteine residues in the N-terminal domains of the α receptors. Since the development of this hypothesis, new data have been obtained showing that domain 1 of hβc is part of the cytokine binding epitope of this receptor and that an IL-3Rα isoform lacking the N-terminal Ig-like domain (the “SP2” isoform) is competent for signaling. We therefore investigated whether distortion of the domain 1-domain 4 ligand-binding epitope in hβc and the related mouse receptor, βIL-3, could account for the loss of receptor signaling when the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide is disrupted. Indeed, mutation of the disulfide in hβc led to both a complete loss of high affinity binding with the human IL-3Rα SP2 isoform and of downstream signaling. Mutation of the orthologous residues in the mouse IL-3-specific receptor, βIL-3, not only precluded direct binding of mouse IL-3 but also resulted in complete loss of high affinity binding and signaling with the mouse IL-3Rα SP2 isoform.

GM-CSF also regulates the differentiation and activation of alveolar macrophages, and mutations affecting GM-CSF receptor α (GM-CSFRα) have been detected in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (5Martinez-Moczygemba M.

In mice, in addition to the mouse βc receptor, there is an IL-3-specific β receptor (denoted βIL-3) that binds IL-3 directly but still requires mIL-3Rα for signaling (15Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Structurally, the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF receptors belong to the cytokine class I receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for growth hormone, erythropoietin, gp130, and IL-4/IL-13 (16Murphy J.M. Young I.G. Vitam. Horm. 2006; 74: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The unifying structural feature of this family is the cytokine receptor homology module (CRM) present in the receptor ectodomains, a module composed of two fibronectin III domains (reviewed in Ref. 16Murphy J.M. Young I.G. Vitam. Horm. 2006; 74: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of the ectodomains of several members of this receptor family have been solved over the past 2 decades, revealing that the two fibronectin-III domains that compose each CRM are universally in an approximately orthogonal configuration relative to one another, with residues from loops at the receptor “elbow” region serving key functions in ligand binding (17Somers W.

Subsequently, we established that despite the marked deviation from the growth hormone receptor paradigm, a novel elbow region formed between domains 1 and 4, contributed by the two protein chains of the homodimer, served as an unusual ligand-binding elbow region (24Murphy J.M.

The IL-3Rα, IL-5Rα, and GM-CSFRα subunits are part of a subgroup of the class I cytokine receptor superfamily that possess an additional Ig-like domain (D1) N-terminal to the CRM in their ectodomains. In other cytokine receptor systems, structural studies have clearly established that Ig-like domains play important roles in mediating cytokine binding and receptor activation (e.g. in the IL-6·IL-6Rα·gp130 (27Boulanger M.J.

In the case of IL-5, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IL-5Rα subunit identified residues Asp55, Asp56, and Tyr57 in IL-5Rα domain D1 as essential determinants of IL-5 binding (29Cornelis S.

Additionally, deletion of domain D1 of the hIL-5Rα was shown to block IL-5 signaling (29Cornelis S. Plaetinck G. Devos R. Van der Heyden J. Tavernier J. Sanderson C.J. Guisez Y. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By comparison, we have recently shown that a naturally occurring splice variant of IL-3Rα, which lacks domain D1 (designated “SP2”; Fig. 1B), is capable of binding IL-3 with high affinity and is competent for signaling (31Chen J. Olsen J. Ford S. Mirza S. Walker A. Murphy J.M. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5763-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies illustrate that details of the mechanisms underlying activation by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF receptors are still emerging, and recent structural and biochemical studies suggest that receptor activation is likely to differ markedly from the paradigms established for other class I cytokine receptors.Although it is well established that heterodimerization with the α subunits is required for hβc activation, evidence has also been reported for an additional step in receptor activation. It was shown that a proportion of the heterodimers involving hβc were disulfide-cross-linked (32Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J. Woodcock J. Goodall G. Andrews R.K. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3035-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A critical link between the disulfide cross-linking and receptor activation was suggested by the properties of hβc mutants in which the D-E loop disulfide had been mutated (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These mutants retained high affinity binding but lost intersubunit cross-linking and receptor activation (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The domain 1 D-E loop disulfide is highly conserved in the hβc, mβc, and βIL-3 receptors and is additional to the two structural disulfides present in the CRM of these receptors. It was hypothesized that hβc receptor activation requires the initial formation of a high affinity complex with the α subunit and cytokine ligand prior to intersubunit cross-linking between the D-E loop disulfide on hβc and a free SH group on domain 1 of the α receptor (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Implicit in the hypothesis is that mutation of the D-E loop disulfide does not result in any structural perturbation that could prevent receptor activation. The heterodisulfide hypothesis has been widely accepted and is potentially very important in understanding the activation of the hβc receptor. However, a number of details of the mechanism have not been elucidated. For example, the Cys residues involved in the interchain disulfide in the respective α receptors have not been identified, and it is not clear how the mechanism would operate with a recently characterized splice variant of IL-3Rα (denoted SP2), which is capable of ligand binding and receptor activation despite lacking D1 (31Chen J. Olsen J. Ford S. Mirza S. Walker A. Murphy J.M. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5763-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on the x-ray crystal structure of the hβc ectodomain (23Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 26500-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we identified a previously unrecognized role for domain 1 of hβc in forming the functional epitope for ligand binding and receptor activation (Fig. 1C). This novel function for domain 1 of hβc was validated in the recently solved crystal structure of the activated hGM-CSFR complex (26Hansen G. Hercus T.R. McClure B.J. Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Powell J. Ramshaw H. Woodcock J.M. Xu Y. Guthridge M. McKinstry W.J. Lopez A.F. Parker M.W. Cell. 2008; 134: 496-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, there is a notable absence of electron density for domain 1 of the GM-CSFRα subunit and no apparent means by which the remaining domains (domains 2 and 3, the CRM) of the GM-CSFRα could contribute to a disulfide cross-link with the hβc domain 1 D-E loop within the hexameric complex, although a cross-link between adjacent hexamers may still be possible (26Hansen G. Hercus T.R. McClure B.J. Stomski F.C. Dottore M. Powell J. Ramshaw H. Woodcock J.M. Xu Y. Guthridge M. McKinstry W.J. Lopez A.F. Parker M.W. Cell. 2008; 134: 496-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).In the present work, we have sought further details of the heterodisulfide mechanism by studying both the hβc and βIL-3 receptors. We have confirmed the original finding that mutation of the D-E loop disulfide in domain 1 of hβc does not destroy high affinity binding for hIL-3 (in the presence of the full-length hIL-3Rα, the “SP1” isoform) or for hGM-CSF in the presence of hGM-CSFRα, although the binding properties are different from those of the wild type receptors. However, when a hIL-3Rα isoform lacking the N-terminal Ig-like domain (the SP2 isoform) was used, mutational disruption of the hβc domain 1 D-E loop disulfide resulted in complete loss of the high affinity binding and signal transduction, in absolute contrast to the high affinity binding and signaling observed in parallel experiments with wild type hβc. Analogous domain 1 D-E loop mutations in the related βIL-3 receptor not only led to a loss of high affinity mIL-3 binding and downstream signaling when co-expressed with a mIL-3Rα SP2 ortholog but also ablated the unique capacity of βIL-3 to directly bind IL-3. These data are most consistent with a role for the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide within the orthologous receptors, hβc and βIL-3, in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of domain 1 rather than the postulated unique role of this disulfide in heterodisulfide formation. In agreement with this, we found that the only unpaired cysteine residue in the hIL-5Rα ectodomain, Cys66 in the Ig-like domain, could be mutated to alanine without compromising the capacity of this α subunit to signal normally when co-expressed with wild type hβc in the presence of hIL-5. These data suggest a revised model for receptor activation in which the integrity of the D-E loop disulfide in domain 1 of hβc and βIL-3 is essential for maintaining the precise three-dimensional positions of essential ligand-binding residues that are necessary for high affinity binding and receptor activation. These data do not support a role for heterodisulfide cross-linking between the IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF α subunits and the D-E loop disulfide in domain 1 of hβc and βIL-3 as a key step in receptor activation.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that the activation of hβc by IL-3, IL-5, or GM-CSF involves the formation of a heterodimer involving hβc and the respective cytokine-specific α receptors. An additional novel step in receptor activation involving the formation of a critical interchain disulfide between α and β receptors was proposed by Stomski et al. (32Stomski F.C. Sun Q. Bagley C.J.

A critical link between this disulfide cross-linking and receptor activation was suggested by the properties of hβc mutants in which the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide had been mutated. Stomski et al. (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that mutagenesis of either Cys residue of the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide of hβc abolished receptor activation without abolishing high affinity binding. The domain 1 D-E loop disulfide is well conserved in the hβc, mβc, and βIL-3 receptors (Fig. 1D) and is additional to the two structural disulfides present in the CRMs of these receptors. The results with the mutant receptors (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggested that the disulfide might have a unique non-structural role that involves a disulfide exchange with a free SH group in domain 1 of the α receptor, with the participating Cys residues being brought into close proximity in the high affinity complex. Implicitly, this hypothesis presumes that there will be no structural perturbation caused by mutation of the β subunit domain 1 D-E loop disulfide that could explain the loss of receptor activation.The present work aimed to clarify the role of the hβc domain 1 D-E loop disulfide in receptor activation.

We thoroughly investigated the role of the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide in hβc and βIL-3 high affinity binding and receptor activation. We included the βIL-3 receptor, which is closely related to hβc, as well as IL-3Rα SP2, a new isoform of IL-3Rα, in the study.Disruption of the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide gave complete abolition of growth signaling in CTLL2 cells expressing either the hβc or βIL-3 receptor in combination with any of the available α receptors, including IL-3Rα SP2, a splice variant that lacks domain 1 of the α receptor. Using the C67Ahβc mutant, in which the key disulfide was disrupted, we verified the previous finding (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) of retention of high affinity binding with hIL-3Rα SP1 and hGM-CSFRα. However, the hIL-3 and hGM-CSF binding characteristics of the C67A mutant hβc when co-expressed with hIL-3Rα SP1 and hGM-CSFRα, respectively, were noticeably different from those of the wild type receptor counterparts. There were far fewer high affinity sites for both hIL-3 and hGM-CSF when hβc domain 1 D-E loop disulfide mutants were co-expressed with the hIL-3Rα SP1 and hGM-CSFRα, respectively, compared with the wild type counterparts, despite comparable levels of cell surface expression. This trend was also seen in the data obtained by Stomski et al. (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although it was attributed to receptor aggregation. The binding also appeared to be of higher affinity in the previous study (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).We believe that the abnormal high affinity binding properties of the C67Ahβc subunit described above are due to a loss of structural integrity of the receptor. Unequivocal verification of structural perturbation of this receptor resulting from loss of the domain 1 D-E loop disulfide was obtained from our studies with the hIL-3Rα SP2 splice variant. hIL-3Rα SP2 could bind hIL-3 with high affinity in the presence of the wild type hβc subunit, but no high affinity binding was detectable with the C67A mutant hβc. These data provide clear support for the hypothesis that mutating the hβc domain 1 D-E loop disulfide bond causes structural distortion of the hβc ligand-binding epitope. It is also notable that the hIL-3Rα SP2 isoform is a naturally occurring splice variant that lacks D1, the domain attributed the function of mediating the heterodisulfide cross-link with the hβc domain 1 D-E loop cysteines in the original receptor activation model (33Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the fact that wild type hβc and wild type hIL-3Rα SP2 subunit can bind hIL-3 with high affinity and initiate signaling argues against the necessity of intersubunit cross-linking as a step in IL-3 receptor activation.Further compelling evidence that mutation of the domain 1 D-E loop causes a structural perturbation came from extension of our study to the related mouse IL-3-specific receptor, βIL-3. Studies with C73AβIL-3 (the mutation analogous to C67A in hβc) in the presence of the mIL-3Rα SP1 or SP2 subunits gave findings analogous to those in our studies of their human receptor counterparts. For instance, in the case of mIL-3Rα SP1 and C73AβIL-3, high affinity binding was retained, although it was abnormal, with a low number of high affinity ligand-binding sites. In contrast, no binding was detected when C73AβIL-3 was coexpressed with the mIL-3Rα SP2 isoform. The βIL-3 receptor provides a unique opportunity for the direct interaction with mIL-3 to be examined in the absence of any mIL-3Rα subunit because βIL-3 binds mIL-3 directly with a Kd of ∼20 nm. Strikingly, in complete contrast to wild type βIL-3, the C73AβIL-3 mutant receptor did not detectably bind mIL-3 in cold saturation assays, providing unequivocal evidence that disruption of the βIL-3 domain 1 D-E loop compromises structural integrity within domain 1 of the receptor. It is probable that this mutation causes a distortion of the βIL-3 domain 1-domain 4 ligand-binding epitope (25Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Olsen J.E. Gustin S.E. Jeffrey P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26500-26508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), thereby accounting for the resultant loss of direct mIL-3 binding. This epitope is also critical for high affinity binding with mIL-3Rα SP2 (31Chen J. Olsen J. Ford S. Mirza S. Walker A. Murphy J.M. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5763-5773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), explaining the complete loss of high affinity binding with this isoform. In contrast, high affinity binding with mIL-3Rα SP1 is not dependent on this epitope, but the low number of high affinity sites observed when this mIL-3Rα isoform and C73AβIL-3 are co-expressed provides evidence that this mutation causes a loss of βIL-3 structural integrity.The above findings are most consistent with a revised model for receptor activation where, rather than an α subunit forming a heterodisulfide with the β subunit domain 1 D-E loop disulfide as a step in receptor activation, the β subunit domain 1 D-E loop plays a crucial role in maintaining the position(s) of a key ligand-binding residue(s) in domain 1, with mutation of the D-E loop cysteines compromising ligand recognition and receptor activation. In addition, our finding that a mutant hIL-5Rα possessing no free Cys in its ectodomain still signals effectively is also contrary to the α·β heterodisulfide receptor activation model.
