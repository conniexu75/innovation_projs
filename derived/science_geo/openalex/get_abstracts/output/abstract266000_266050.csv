https://openalex.org/W2010732079,Numerical integration of the rotation of Mars shows that the obliquity of Mars undergoes large chaotic variations. These variations occur as the system evolves in the chaotic zone associated with a secular spin-orbit resonance.
https://openalex.org/W2013210818,"The effects of multiple phase transitions on mantle convection are investigated by numerical simulations that are based on three-dimensional models. These simulations show that cold sheets of mantle material collide at junctions, merge, and form a strong downflow that is stopped temporarily by the transition zone. The accumulated cold material gives rise to a strong gravitational instability that causes the cold mass to sink rapidly into the lower mantle. This process promotes a massive exchange between the lower and upper mantles and triggers a global instability in the adjacent plume system. This mechanism may be cyclic in nature and may be linked to the generation of superplumes."
https://openalex.org/W2071117646,"Biological experience and intuition suggest that self-replication is an inherently complex phenomenon, and early cellular automata models support that conception. More recently, simpler computational models of self-directed replication called sheathed loops have been developed. It is shown here that ""unsheathing"" these structures and altering certain assumptions about the symmetry of their components leads to a family of nontrivial self-replicating structures, some substantially smaller and simpler than those previously reported. The dependence of replication time and transition function complexity on initial structure size, cell state symmetry, and neighborhood are examined. These results support the view that self-replication is not an inherently complex phenomenon but rather an emergent property arising from local interactions in systems that can be much simpler than is generally believed."

With this technique, both the existence and the relative amounts of possible structural isomers can be determined. More than 99% of the ions C(5)(-) to C(9)(-) were found to be linear under these experimental conditions. Starting with C(10)(-), a monocyclic isomer was observed, and linear and moncyclic structures coexisted from C(10)(-) through at least C(20)(-). This result is in contrast to previous work on positive ions, which showed the existence of linear isomers from C(5)(+) to C(10)(+), with linear and cyclic isomers coexisting only from C(7)(+) to C(10)(+). Above C(10)(+), no linear clusters were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2072989478,"The Mediterranean Sea produces a salty, dense outflow that is strongly modified by entrainment as it first begins to descend the continental slope in the eastern Gulf of Cadiz. The current accelerates to 1.3 meters per second, which raises the internal Froude number above 1, and is intensely turbulent through its full thickness. The outflow loses about half of its density anomaly and roughly doubles its volume transport as it entrains less saline North Atlantic Central water. Within 100 kilometers downstream, the current is turned by the Coriolis force until it flows nearly parallel to topography in a damped geostrophic balance. The mixed Mediterranean outflow continues westward, slowly descending the continental slope until it becomes neutrally buoyant in the thermocline where it becomes an important water mass."
https://openalex.org/W2063123078,"Stick-slip, or interrupted, motion rather than smooth uninterrupted motion occurs in many different phenomena such as friction, fluid flow, material fracture and wear, sound generation, and sensory ""texture."" During stick-slip, a system is believed to undergo transitions between a static (solid-like) state and a kinetic (liquid-like) state. The stick-slip motion between various types of pretreated surfaces was measured, and a second, much more kinetic state that exhibits ultra-low friction was found. Transitions to and from this super-kinetic state also give rise to stick-slip motion but are fundamentally different from conventional static-kinetic transitions. The results here suggest practical conditions for the control of unwanted stick-slip and the attainment of ultra-low friction."
https://openalex.org/W2012823073,"The mesospheric sodium and iron layers at an altitude between about 80 and 110 kilometers are routinely monitored by atmospheric physicists using resonance fluorescence lidar techniques because these constituents are excellent tracers of mesopause chemistry and dynamics. The mesospheric metals are the products of meteoric ablation. Existing ablation profiles are model calculations based in part on radar observations of the ionized background atmosphere left in the wake of high-speed (> 20 kilometers per second) meteoroids. Thin trails of neutral metal atoms, ablated from individual meteoroids, are occasionally observed with high-power lidars. The vertical distribution of 101 sodium and 5 iron meteor trails observed during the past 4 years at Urbana, Illinois; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; and near Hawaii is approximately Gaussian in shape with a centroid height of 89.0 (+/- 0.3) kilometers and a root-mean-square width of 3.3 (+/- 0.2) kilometers. This directly measured ablation profile is nearly the same as the mean iron layer profile but is considerably different from existing models and the distribution of ionized meteor trails observed by radars. A lower limit on the influx to the mesopause region from the lidar meteors is approximately 1.6 x 10(3) sodium and 2.7 x 10(4) iron atoms per second per square centimeter, which corresponds to an annual flux of meteoric debris into the mesosphere of about 2.0 (+/-0.6) gigagrams. Because the lidars can detect only the ablation trails left by the larger meteors, the observations suggest that the actual meteoric influx may be larger than the more recently reported values, which range between 16 and 78 gigagrams per year."
https://openalex.org/W2007804202,"The Brazilian government has launched a program to replace much of the country's imported oil with ethyl alcohol produced from sugarcane and other crops. It has been demonstrated that alcohol is a far more flexible fuel than gasoline, since it can be used in motors designed for gasoline in proportions as high as 20 percent with no adjustment to ordinary automobile engines. Alcohol can also be burned in a 50-50 mixture with diesel fuel in truck and bus engines through use of an ingeneous double-carburetion system and seems to be an ideal turbine fuel for use in electric generating plants. Officials of the Brazilian program estimate that about 4 billion liters of alcohol per year will be required to substitute for 20 percent of gasoline consumption by the early 1980's. This level of production would require 1.3 million hectares of cane or between 1 and 2 million hectares of manioc. The alcohol program will also have a favorable impact in areas such as: pollution, employment, and industrial growth."

https://openalex.org/W4237452675,"Infrared astronomy has shown that certain classes of stars are abundant producers of refractory grains, which condense in their atmospheres and are blown into interstellar space by the radiation pressure of these stars. Metallic silicates of the kind that produce terrestrial planets are injected by the oxygen-rich stars and carbon and its refractories by carbon stars. Much of the interstellar dust may be produced by this mechanism. A number of ""infrared stars"" are completely surrounded by their own dust, and a few of these exhibit a unique morphology that suggests the formation of a planetary system or a stage in the evolution of a planetary nebula. Certain novae also condense grains, which are blown out in their shells. In our own solar system, comets are found to contain the same silicates that are present elsewhere in the galaxy, suggesting that these constituents were present in the primeval solar nebula."

https://openalex.org/W2064647118,"A new procedure has been invented for the study of large biological molecules as they break down or react. The new technique is known as Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance Mass Spectrometry (ICR-MS). ICR-MS preserves molecules so that they can be modified. Instead of simply deflecting charged molecules with a magnetic field, ICR-MS magnetically traps them in circular orbits within a miniature cyclotron. As the charged molecules pass metal plates along the periphery of the cyclotron chamber, they induce sinusoidal electrical signals, whose amplitudes reflect the molecules' concentrations. And because more massive molecules orbit more slowly in a magnetic field, the frequencies of the signals reveal molecular masses. In a device that has been built, frequency differences can reveal differences in molecualar weight equivalent to a single hydrogen atom in a large protein. Reagents can be introduced into the chamber and molecular masses monitored as reactions take place. Protein sequencing and structure determination are possibilities for ICR-MS."

https://openalex.org/W2074061049,"N = Noe -At, in which N is the number of particles remaining at the time, t; No, the initial number of particles; and X, the decay constant, or fraction of the number present disintegrating per unit time. The time may be expressed in any desired units if the corresponding reciprocal unit is understood for the decay constant. An alternative form of the equation is N=No. 10-A't, in which A' = 0.4343A. The time interval, Ti, during which the activity decreases to half of its original value is called the half-life. Since XTj = 0.69315 and A'TI= 0.30103, any of the three quantities Ti, A, and A' may be used to characterize a particular radioactive species. Calculations involving this equation may be carried out to any desired precision with the aid of tables of logarithms. For a material of known half-life which is used frequently, it is convenient to prepare a logarithmic plot of activity against time on a linear scale. The decay curve is a straight line passing through the points N/N0=1 at t=0 and N/N,=0.5 at t=Ti. If the precision of values obtainable from the chart is inadequate, a table may be computed showing the fraction remaining at convenient time intervals. The purpose of this note is to call attention to the ease with which decay calculations may be made with an ordinary slide rule. For example, to find N/NO, the fraction of a preparation of a given half-life remaining after time t, one may proceed as follows: Use the rule in the usual way to divide 0.301 by the half-life and multiply by the time, to obtain A 't. Set the mantissa of this logarithm on the L-scale opposite the index of the C-scale (or D-scale, depending on the style of rule) and read N/No on the C-scale (or D-scale) opposite the index of the L-scale. If I't is greater than 1 (i.e. t > 3.32 To), the characteristic is greater than zero, and the reading on the C-scale (or D-scale) is divided by the power of 10 called for by the characteristic. Note that it is necessary to remember only the half-life and the common"
