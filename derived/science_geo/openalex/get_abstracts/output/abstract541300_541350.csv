https://openalex.org/W2153773863,"Analysis of de novo CNVs (dnCNVs) from the full Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) (N = 2,591 families) replicates prior findings of strong association with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and confirms six risk loci (1q21.1, 3q29, 7q11.23, 16p11.2, 15q11.2-13, and 22q11.2). The addition of published CNV data from the Autism Genome Project (AGP) and exome sequencing data from the SSC and the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) shows that genes within small de novo deletions, but not within large dnCNVs, significantly overlap the high-effect risk genes identified by sequencing. Alternatively, large dnCNVs are found likely to contain multiple modest-effect risk genes. Overall, we find strong evidence that de novo mutations are associated with ASD apart from the risk for intellectual disability. Extending the transmission and de novo association test (TADA) to include small de novo deletions reveals 71 ASD risk loci, including 6 CNV regions (noted above) and 65 risk genes (FDR ≤ 0.1)."

The gastrointestinal tract is predominantly responsive to heat stress. The currently available information about the multifaceted response to heat stress within different parts of the intestine is limited, especially in avian species. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the heat stress-induced sequence of events in the intestines of chickens. Furthermore, the gut health-promoting effect of dietary galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) was investigated in these heat stress-exposed chickens. Chickens were fed a control diet or diet supplemented with 1% or 2.5% GOS (6 days) prior to and during a temperature challenge for 5 days (38–39°C, 8h per day). The parameters measured in different parts of the intestines included the genes (qPCR) HSF1, HSF3, HSP70, HSP90, E-cadherin, claudin-1, claudin-5, ZO-1, occludin, TLR-2, TLR-4, IL-6, IL-8, HO-1, HIF-1α) and their associated proteins HSP70, HSP90 and pan-cadherin (western blots). In addition, IL-6 and IL-8 plasma concentrations were measured by ELISA. In the jejunum, HSF3, HSP70, HSP90, E-cadherin, claudin-5, ZO-1, TLR-4, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and HSP70 protein expression were increased after heat stress exposure and a more pronounced increase in gene expression was observed in ileum after heat stress exposure, and in addition HSF1, claudin-1 and HIF-1α mRNA levels were upregulated. Furthermore, the IL-8 plasma levels were decreased in chickens exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, the heat stress-related effects in the jejunum were prevented in chickens fed a GOS diet, while dietary GOS did not alter these effects in ileum. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the differences in susceptibility to heat stress along the intestine, where the most obvious modification in gene expression is observed in ileum, while dietary GOS only prevent the heat stress-related changes in jejunum."
https://openalex.org/W1767661185,"Forming distinct representations and memories of multiple contexts and episodes is thought to be a crucial function of the hippocampal-entorhinal cortical network. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 are known to contribute to these functions, but the role of the entorhinal cortex (EC) is poorly understood. Here, we show that Ocean cells, excitatory stellate neurons in the medial EC layer II projecting into DG and CA3, rapidly form a distinct representation of a novel context and drive context-specific activation of downstream CA3 cells as well as context-specific fear memory. In contrast, Island cells, excitatory pyramidal neurons in the medial EC layer II projecting into CA1, are indifferent to context-specific encoding or memory. On the other hand, Ocean cells are dispensable for temporal association learning, for which Island cells are crucial. Together, the two excitatory medial EC layer II inputs to the hippocampus have complementary roles in episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W1756731880,"Progress in electron microscopy-based high-resolution connectomics is limited by data analysis throughput. Here, we present SegEM, a toolset for efficient semi-automated analysis of large-scale fully stained 3D-EM datasets for the reconstruction of neuronal circuits. By combining skeleton reconstructions of neurons with automated volume segmentations, SegEM allows the reconstruction of neuronal circuits at a work hour consumption rate of about 100-fold less than manual analysis and about 10-fold less than existing segmentation tools. SegEM provides a robust classifier selection procedure for finding the best automated image classifier for different types of nerve tissue. We applied these methods to a volume of 44 × 60 × 141 μm(3) SBEM data from mouse retina and a volume of 93 × 60 × 93 μm(3) from mouse cortex, and performed exemplary synaptic circuit reconstruction. SegEM resolves the tradeoff between synapse detection and semi-automated reconstruction performance in high-resolution connectomics and makes efficient circuit reconstruction in fully-stained EM datasets a ready-to-use technique for neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W2102268778,"In the retina, rod and cone photoreceptors form distinct connections with different classes of downstream bipolar cells. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their selective connectivity are unknown. Here we identify a cell-adhesion protein, ELFN1, to be essential for the formation of synapses between rods and rod ON-bipolar cells in the primary rod pathway. ELFN1 is expressed selectively in rods where it is targeted to the axonal terminals by the synaptic release machinery. At the synapse, ELFN1 binds in trans to mGluR6, the postsynaptic receptor on rod ON-bipolar cells. Elimination of ELFN1 in mice prevents the formation of synaptic contacts involving rods, but not cones, allowing a dissection of the contributions of primary and secondary rod pathways to retinal circuit function and vision. We conclude that ELFN1 is necessary for the selective wiring of rods into the primary rod pathway and is required for high sensitivity of vision."
https://openalex.org/W2117897492,"Cortical function is regulated by a strikingly diverse array of local-circuit inhibitory neurons. We evaluated how optogenetically activating somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive interneurons subtractively or divisively suppressed auditory cortical cells' responses to tones. In both awake and anesthetized animals, we found that activating either family of interneurons produced mixtures of divisive and subtractive effects and that simultaneously recorded neurons were often suppressed in qualitatively different ways. A simple network model shows that threshold nonlinearities can interact with network activity to transform subtractive inhibition of neurons into divisive inhibition of networks, or vice versa. Varying threshold and the strength of suppression of a model neuron could determine whether the effect of inhibition appeared divisive, subtractive, or both. We conclude that the characteristics of response inhibition specific to a single interneuron type can be ""masked"" by the network configuration and cellular properties of the network in which they are embedded."
https://openalex.org/W2169580990,"Ultrafast neurotransmitter release requires tight colocalization of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with primed, release-ready synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone. RIM-binding proteins (RIM-BPs) are multidomain active zone proteins that bind to RIMs and to Ca(2+) channels. In Drosophila, deletion of RIM-BPs dramatically reduces neurotransmitter release, but little is known about RIM-BP function in mammalian synapses. Here, we generated double conditional knockout mice for RIM-BP1 and RIM-BP2, and analyzed RIM-BP-deficient synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons and the calyx of Held. Surprisingly, we find that in murine synapses, RIM-BPs are not essential for neurotransmitter release as such, but are selectively required for high-fidelity coupling of action potential-induced Ca(2+) influx to Ca(2+)-stimulated synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Deletion of RIM-BPs decelerated action-potential-triggered neurotransmitter release and rendered it unreliable, thereby impairing the fidelity of synaptic transmission. Thus, RIM-BPs ensure optimal organization of the machinery for fast release in mammalian synapses without being a central component of the machinery itself."
https://openalex.org/W2151093700,"Spatial and temporal features of synaptic inputs engage integration mechanisms on multiple scales, including presynaptic release sites, postsynaptic dendrites, and networks of inhibitory interneurons. Here we investigate how these mechanisms cooperate to filter synaptic input in hippocampal area CA1. Dendritic recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons reveal that proximal inputs from CA3 as well as distal inputs from entorhinal cortex layer III (ECIII) sum sublinearly or linearly at low firing rates due to feedforward inhibition, but sum supralinearly at high firing rates due to synaptic facilitation, producing a high-pass filter. However, during ECIII and CA3 input comparison, supralinear dendritic integration is dynamically balanced by feedforward and feedback inhibition, resulting in suppression of dendritic complex spiking. We find that a particular subpopulation of CA1 interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) contributes prominently to this dynamic filter by integrating both ECIII and CA3 input pathways and potently inhibiting CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2114263972,"Frontal neocortex is thought to support our highest intellectual abilities, including our ability to plan and enact a sequence of tasks toward a desired goal. In everyday life, such task sequences are abstract in that they do not require consistent movement sequences and are often assembled ""on the fly."" Yet, remarkably little is known about the necessity of frontal sub-regions for such control. Participants repeatedly completed sequences of simple tasks during fMRI scanning. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) activation ramped over sequence position and reset at the initiation of each new sequence. To establish the necessity and function of RLPFC in this task, participants performed the sequential task while undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the RLPFC versus two prefrontal control regions. Across two independent experiments, only RLPFC stimulation increasingly disrupted task performance as each sequence progressed. These data establish RLPFC as necessary for uncertainty resolution during sequence-level control."
https://openalex.org/W1763127570,"Within a controlled laboratory environment, high-intensity interval training (HIT) elicits similar cardiovascular and metabolic benefits as traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). It is currently unclear how HIT can be applied effectively in a real-world environment.To investigate the hypothesis that 10 weeks of HIT, performed in an instructor-led, group-based gym setting, elicits improvements in aerobic capacity (VO2max), cardio-metabolic risk and psychological health which are comparable to MICT.Ninety physically inactive volunteers (42±11 y, 27.7±4.8 kg.m-2) were randomly assigned to HIT or MICT group exercise classes. HIT consisted of repeated sprints (15-60 seconds, >90% HRmax) interspersed with periods of recovery cycling (≤25 min.session-1, 3 sessions.week-1). MICT participants performed continuous cycling (~70% HRmax, 30-45 min.session-1, 5 sessions.week-1). VO2max, markers of cardio-metabolic risk, and psychological health were assessed pre and post-intervention.Mean weekly training time was 55±10 (HIT) and 128±44 min (MICT) (p<0.05), with greater adherence to HIT (83±14% vs. 61±15% prescribed sessions attended, respectively; p<0.05). HIT improved VO2max, insulin sensitivity, reduced abdominal fat mass, and induced favourable changes in blood lipids (p<0.05). HIT also induced beneficial effects on health perceptions, positive and negative affect, and subjective vitality (p<0.05). No difference between HIT and MICT was seen for any of these variables.HIT performed in a real-world gym setting improves cardio-metabolic risk factors and psychological health in physically inactive adults. With a reduced time commitment and greater adherence than MICT, HIT offers a viable and effective exercise strategy to target the growing incidence of metabolic disease and psychological ill-being associated with physical inactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2268247467,"Nitric Oxide (NO) is a bioactive signaling molecule that mediates a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. The present study investigated the role of NO (as SNP [sodium nitroprusside]) in ameliorating lead (Pb)-toxicity in Triticum aestivum (wheat) roots. Pb (50 and 250 μM) alone and in combination with SNP (100 μM) was given to hydroponically grown wheat roots for a period of 0-8 h. NO supplementation reduced the accumulation of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, conjugated dienes, hydroxyl ions and superoxide anion) and decreased the antioxidant enzyme activity in wheat roots particularly up to 6 h, thereby suggesting its role as an antioxidant. NO ameliorated Pb-induced membrane damage in wheat roots as evidenced by decreased ion-leakage and in situ histochemical localization. Pb-exposure significantly decreased in vivo NO level. The study concludes that exogenous NO partially ameliorates Pb-toxicity, but could not restore the plant growth on prolonged Pb-exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2198590280,"Anthropogenic noise in the ocean has increased substantially in recent decades, and motorized vessels produce what is likely the most common form of underwater noise pollution. Noise has the potential to induce physiological stress in marine fishes, which may have negative ecological consequences. In this study, physiological effects of increased noise (playback of boat noise recorded in the field) on a coastal marine fish (the giant kelpfish, Heterostichus rostratus) were investigated by measuring the stress responses (cortisol concentration) of fish to increased noise of various temporal dynamics and noise levels. Giant kelpfish exhibited acute stress responses when exposed to intermittent noise, but not to continuous noise or control conditions (playback of recorded natural ambient sound). These results suggest that variability in the acoustic environment may be more important than the period of noise exposure for inducing stress in a marine fish, and provide information regarding noise levels at which physiological responses occur."

The governing non-linear analysis of partial differential equations is reduced into the ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations. The resulting problems are computed for both series and numerical solutions. Series solution is constructed using homotopy analysis method (HAM) whereas numerical solution is presented by two different techniques namely shooting method and bvp4c. A comparison of homotopy solution with numerical solution is also tabulated. Both solutions are found in an excellent agreement.

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of intranasal oxytocin on consummatory behaviour and emotional recognition in patients with AN and BN in comparison to healthy controls.A total of 102 women, including 35 patients with anorexia nervosa (AN), 34 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 33 healthy university students of comparable age and intelligence, participated in a double-blind, single dose placebo-controlled cross-over study. A single dose of intranasal administration of oxytocin (40 IU) (or a placebo) was followed by an emotional recognition task and an apple juice drink. Food intake was then recorded for 24 hours post-test.Oxytocin produced no significant change in appetite in the acute or 24 hours free living settings in healthy controls, whereas there was a decrease in calorie consumption over 24 hours in patients with BN. Oxytocin produced a small increase in emotion recognition sensitivity in healthy controls and in patients with BN, In patients with AN, oxytocin had no effect on emotion recognition sensitivity or on consummatory behaviour.The impact of oxytocin on appetite and social cognition varied between people with AN and BN. A single dose of intranasal oxytocin decreased caloric intake over 24 hours in people with BN. People with BN showed enhanced emotional sensitivity under oxytocin condition similar to healthy controls. Those effects of oxytocin were not found in patients with AN.ClinicalTrials.gov KCT00000716."

Hence, feedforward inhibition, known to enforce temporal fidelity of excitatory inputs, dominates hippocampus-amygdala interactions to gate heterosynaptic plasticity. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are part of an extensive neural circuit encoding emotional memories (Fanselow, 2010Fanselow M.S.

This circuit can be dysfunctional in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans (Phelps, 2004Phelps E.A. Human emotion and memory: interactions of the amygdala and hippocampal complex.Curr. Opin.

Optogenetic inhibition of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells impairs contextual fear memory acquisition and retrieval (Goshen et al., 2011Goshen I. Brodsky M. Prakash R. Wallace J. Gradinaru V. Ramakrishnan C. Deisseroth K. Dynamics of retrieval strategies for remote memories.Cell. 2011; 147: 678-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The disconnection of the vHPC to the BLA prevents the renewal of an extinguished fear memory (Orsini et al., 2011Orsini C.A. Kim J.H. Knapska E. Maren S. Hippocampal and prefrontal projections to the basal amygdala mediate contextual regulation of fear after extinction.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17269-17277Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This suggests that the vHPC gates fear behavior by sending contextual information to the BLA (Maren et al., 2013Maren S. Phan K.L. Liberzon I. The contextual brain: implications for fear conditioning, extinction and psychopathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Additionally, optogenetic manipulation of the projections from the BLA to the vHPC shows that these two structures are involved in anxiety-related behavior (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013Felix-Ortiz A.C. Beyeler A. Seo C. Leppla C.A. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M.

Tye K.M. Amygdala inputs to the ventral hippocampus bidirectionally modulate social behavior.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Synchronous oscillatory activity between HPC and BLA represents an intermediate phenomenon to link the firing of single neurons to behavior (Paré et al., 2002Paré D. Collins D.R. Pelletier J.G. Amygdala oscillations and the consolidation of emotional memories.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2002; 6: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Theta synchronization of lateral amygdala (LA) and CA1 HPC increases during fear memory retrieval in rodents (Seidenbecher et al., 2003Seidenbecher T. Laxmi T.R. Stork O. Pape H.C. Amygdalar and hippocampal theta rhythm synchronization during fear memory retrieval.Science. 2003; 301: 846-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and the degree of theta synchrony predicts memory performance after fear conditioning (Popa et al., 2010Popa D. Duvarci S. Popescu A.T. Léna C. Paré D. Coherent amygdalocortical theta promotes fear memory consolidation during paradoxical sleep.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 6516-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Likewise, dynamic shifts in theta synchrony of CA1, BLA, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are associated with ongoing defensive behavior (Likhtik et al., 2014Likhtik E. Stujenske J.M.

What cellular mechanisms orchestrate vHPC-BLA interactions? Neurons of the BLA fire phase-locked to entorhinal (Paré and Gaudreau, 1996Paré D. Gaudreau H. Projection cells and interneurons of the lateral and basolateral amygdala: distinct firing patterns and differential relation to theta and delta rhythms in conscious cats.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3334-3350PubMed Google Scholar) and hippocampal theta oscillations (Bienvenu et al., 2012Bienvenu T.C. Busti D. Magill P.J. Ferraguti F. Capogna M. Cell-type-specific recruitment of amygdala interneurons to hippocampal theta rhythm and noxious stimuli in vivo.Neuron. 2012; 74: 1059-1074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that the firing of single neurons of the BLA could be synchronized by external theta inputs. However, the mechanisms through which CA1 inputs recruit BLA neurons to drive network synchronization remain unknown. Anatomical work demonstrated reciprocal connections between the ventral CA1 (vCA1) and the BLA (Pitkänen et al., 2000Pitkänen A. Pikkarainen M. Nurminen N. Ylinen A.

Sci. 2000; 911: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In particular, the basal (BA) and basomedial (BM) nuclei of the amygdala are the most densely innervated by the vCA1 (Kishi et al., 2006Kishi T. Tsumori T. Yokota S. Yasui Y.

At the single cell level, individual vCA1 pyramidal neurons project to several areas, including the BLA and mPFC (Arszovszki et al., 2014Arszovszki A. Borhegyi Z. Klausberger T.

Fear renewal preferentially activates ventral hippocampal neurons projecting to both amygdala and prefrontal cortex in rats.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is thought that vCA1 pyramidal neurons modulate the activity of BLA principal neurons (PNs), as “fear neurons” have been shown to receive functional input from this area (Herry et al., 2008Herry C. Ciocchi S. Senn V. Demmou L. Müller C. Lüthi A. Switching on and off fear by distinct neuronal circuits.Nature. 2008; 454: 600-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). We previously reported that anatomically identified BLA interneuron (IN) populations preferentially fire in phase with hippocampal theta oscillations in vivo (Bienvenu et al., 2012Bienvenu T.C. Busti D. Magill P.J. Ferraguti F. Capogna M.

Physiol. 2012; 590: 5611-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to hypothesize that GABAergic INs of the BA would gate excitatory input from vCA1 to control the firing and synaptic plasticity of PNs. To test this hypothesis, we combined in vivo and ex vivo recordings from single neurons of the BA and optical stimulation of vCA1 pyramidal cell axons. We found that feedforward inhibition (FFI) dynamics gate vHPC input and heterosynaptic plasticity via GABAB-receptor-dependent mechanisms and change in Cl− driving force. First, we set out to investigate the activity of PNs and GABAergic INs of the BA when theta oscillations occur in areas interconnected with the amygdala. We recorded the firing of single neurons of the BA and the local field potential (LFP) in CA1 and/or Temporal associative cortex (TeA), two structures projecting to the BLA, in urethane-anesthetized mice. In the BA, PNs (n = 27) and INs (n = 25) could be separated on the basis of their spike waveforms and firing regularity (Figures S1A–S1C; Experimental Procedures), consistent with previous observations (Bienvenu et al., 2012Bienvenu T.C. Busti D. Magill P.J. Ferraguti F. Capogna M.

Immunoreactivity for CaMKIIα (14/14) and VGAT (10/10) was confirmed for a subset of PNs and INs juxtacellularly labeled after their recording (Figures 1B and 1E , respectively). The firing rates of the recorded neurons were cell type specific and brain state dependent, consistent with previous data obtained in awake cats (Paré and Gaudreau, 1996Paré D. Gaudreau H. Projection cells and interneurons of the lateral and basolateral amygdala: distinct firing patterns and differential relation to theta and delta rhythms in conscious cats.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3334-3350PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, BA PNs fired at higher frequencies during cortical and hippocampal slow wave activity (SWA) (0.52 ± 0.08 Hz) and at significantly lower frequencies during theta oscillations (0.04 ± 0.02 Hz, p < 0.0001, n = 16; Figures 1A and 1C). In contrast, INs fired at lower rates during cortical and hippocampal SWA (5.42 ± 1.35 Hz) and at significantly higher rates during theta oscillations (8.35 ± 1.48 Hz, p < 0.05, n = 20; Figures 1D and 1F). Although most of the INs (16/20) increased their firing rates during theta episodes, a few (4/20) showed a reduction. These results suggest that the firing of BA PNs might be more tightly controlled by GABAergic INs during theta epochs compared to slow wave states. We then sought to understand the influence of a theta frequency input from vCA1 pyramidal cells on the firing of BA neurons. To this aim, we transfected pyramidal cells of vCA1 with the ultrafast (E123T/T159C) Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (Figures 2A and S2), which more efficiently evokes action potentials at high frequency stimulation compared to the common H134R variant (Berndt et al., 2011Berndt A. Schoenenberger P. Mattis J. Tye K.M. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Oertner T.G. High-efficiency channelrhodopsins for fast neuronal stimulation at low light levels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7595-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Three to four weeks after viral injection, ChR2+ axons densely innervated the BA and BM, together with the external and intermediate capsules surrounding the BLA, whereas only sparse fibers were observed in the LA (Figure 2B). This pattern of innervation was consistent with previous tracing studies in rodents (Kishi et al., 2006Kishi T. Tsumori T. Yokota S. Yasui Y.

Funct. 2012; 217: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To optically stimulate ChR2+ vCA1 pyramidal cell axons while recording from single neurons of the BA in vivo, we implanted a fiber optic above the BA (Figures 2C and S1D). An optical theta burst stimulation (TBS) was delivered during spontaneous non-theta epochs to mimic physiological rhythmic activity at theta frequency (Luo et al., 2011Luo A.H. Tahsili-Fahadan P. Wise R.A. Lupica C.R. Aston-Jones G. Linking context with reward: a functional circuit from hippocampal CA3 to ventral tegmental area.Science. 2011; 333: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Optical TBS of vCA1 axons inhibited the firing of BA PNs (n = 10; 2 additional cells were not responsive) during light trains (baseline 0.5 ± 0.05 Hz, light trains 0.1 ± 0.03 Hz, p < 0.0001, n = 10, Figures 2D and 2E), suggesting that the hippocampal input may disynaptically inhibit BA PNs via recruitment of GABAergic INs. Consistent with this hypothesis, the same optogenetic stimulation evoked firing in INs (n = 7; 4 additional cells were not responsive; baseline 1.2 ± 0.2 Hz, light trains 3.4 ± 1 Hz, p < 0.05, Figures 2F and 2G). To test whether vCA1 axons directly target BA neurons, confocal microscopy of recorded and biocytin-filled BA PNs and INs was used to detect ChR2-YFP-positive boutons apposed to their dendrites (Figures S3A and S3B). Hippocampal axons were found to preferentially innervate PNs by targeting dendritic spines, whereas INs were primarily, but not exclusively, contacted on dendritic shafts (Figure S3E). Further electron microscopy data confirmed that axons of vCA1 pyramidal cells formed excitatory synapses with PNs and INs dendrites (Figures S3C and S3D). Thus, vCA1 pyramidal cell axons monosynaptically contact PNs and INs of the BA. However, their theta frequency activation evoked opposite responses on PNs and INs recorded in vivo. These effects resembled the contrasting firing rates between PNs and INs observed during theta oscillations. Because vCA1 pyramidal cells are glutamatergic, we hypothesized that the inhibition of PNs was due to the disynaptic activation of feedforward INs, while the monosynaptic excitation of PNs would remain subthreshold. To test this hypothesis, we optogenetically dissected the BA circuit activated by vCA1 HPC ex vivo. We prepared acute brain slices 3 to 4 weeks after the ChR2 injection and recorded single BA neurons in cell attached mode (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This configuration did not alter the intracellular milieu of the recorded cell and mimicked our extracellular in vivo conditions. PNs and INs could be distinguished according to their soma size (diameter ≥ 20 μm for PNs, < 15 μm for INs). After cell-attached recordings, 8/40 PNs and 6/18 INs were re-patched in whole-cell mode to confirm their identity. Optical stimulations were delivered through the microscope objective to excite vCA1 axons within an area of ∼200 μm diameter around the soma of the recorded neurons. We observed that the power of a single light pulse stimulation had to be significantly higher (p < 0.0001) to trigger one action potential in PNs (9.5 ± 0.3 mW/mm2, n = 33) compared to INs (2.5 ± 0.2 mW/mm2, n = 11) (Figure 3). To investigate how synaptic excitation and inhibition evoked by activation of vCA1 fibers influence the firing of BA neurons, we recorded neurons in whole-cell mode. Intracellularly recorded neurons were classified as PNs or INs according to both electrophysiological and anatomical parameters (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Single light pulse stimulation triggered a monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by an early-fast and late-slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in 66% of PNs (n = 80/122, Figures 3C and S4A) and EPSP followed by early IPSP in 15% of PNs (n = 18/122, Figure S4B). When we recorded from BA INs (n = 31) or intercalated neurons (ITCs) (n = 13, Figure S5; pooled in the experiments presented below), the same stimulation evoked an EPSP in 61% of the neurons (n = 27/44, Figure 3F). All types of synaptic responses observed in PNs or INs are summarized in the legend of Figure S4. Notably, 11/13 recorded ITCs were histologically verified, and their cell bodies were found either in the external capsule (n = 4), intermediate capsule (n = 4), or main intercalated nucleus (n = 3). The IPSPs were disynaptic because they were abolished by the application of the glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX (10 μM) and APV (100 μM) (Figure 3H, n = 5). In PNs, the early and late IPSPs were mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors because they were abolished by SR95531 (10 μM, Figures 3I and 3J, n = 5) and CGP54626 (5 μM, Figure 3J, n = 26), respectively. We further confirmed that the optogenetic stimulation activated presynaptic Na+ channels by blocking PSPs with 1 μM tetrodotoxin (n = 3, data not shown). Blockade of GABAA receptor alone or together with blockade of GABAB receptors increased the duration of the EPSPs (Figures 3I and 3J), consistently with previous demonstrations that FFI narrows the time window for the integration of synaptic excitation (Gabernet et al., 2005Gabernet L. Jadhav S.P. Feldman D.E. Carandini M. Scanziani M. Somatosensory integration controlled by dynamic thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition.Neuron. 2005; 48: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Next, we wished to test whether TBS-evoked inhibition of PNs spontaneous firing occurred in a slice preparation. In these conditions, long-range projections to the BA are cut, ruling out that their stimulation would in turn trigger activation of other regions projecting to the BA. First, we optically activated vCA1 fibers at theta frequency while recording from BA neurons in cell-attached mode, using light intensities sufficient to evoke an action potential in INs but not in PNs (range: 2 to 3 mW/mm2). Optogenetic TBS transiently inhibited the firing of PNs (Figures 4A–4C, second train versus baseline p < 0.0001, n = 7). In contrast, TBS triggered action potentials synchronized to each light train in INs (Figures 4D–4F, second train versus baseline p < 0.01, n = 7). We also used higher light intensities, sufficient to evoke action potentials in PNs (>10 mW/mm2) to examine the impact of TBS on evoked firing. In this case, optogenetic TBS transiently depressed the evoked spike probability in BA PNs (Figures S6A and S6B, second versus first TBS trains p < 0.001, n = 22) via activation of GABAB receptors (Figures S6E and S6F, second versus first train p > 0.05, n = 9). In contrast, TBS did not reduce the spike probability of INs (Figures S6C and S6D, second versus first TBS trains p > 0.05, n = 10). These results suggest that the activation of hippocampal fibers at theta frequency preferentially recruits GABAergic INs of the BA, inhibiting the spontaneous firing of PNs or sculpting their hippocampal-driven firing via FFI. Next, we investigated synaptic and membrane excitability dynamics that are likely to cause modulation of firing by TBS in PNs. To this end, we performed whole-cell recordings of PNs and INs in the BA during optical TBS. First, TBS elicited a transient membrane hyperpolarization (Figures 5A–5B, second train versus first train p < 0.0001, n = 34) that resulted in EPSP peak transitorily lowered to more hyperpolarized potentials (Figures 5A and 5C, second train versus first train p < 0.001, n = 34). Both effects were mediated by GABAB receptors, since they were blocked by CGP54626 (5 μM) (Figures 5A–5C, second train versus first train p > 0.05, n = 17). Second, TBS caused a depression of the IPSP amplitude (Figures 5A and 5D, second train versus first train p < 0.0001, n = 34). This led to a significant increase of the EPSP area (Figures 5A and 5E, second train versus first train p < 0.05, n = 30), consistent with FFI constraining the duration of excitatory inputs. These effects were also dependent on GABAB receptor activation, because they were blocked by 5 μM CGP54626 (Figures 5A, 5D, and 5E, second train versus first train p > 0.05, n = 17). Furthermore, when light stimulation elicited only an EPSP followed by GABAA-IPSP, as observed in a few PNs (Figure S4B), the membrane hyperpolarization and the depression of IPSP amplitude were greatly reduced (Figure S7, p > 0.05, n = 9), consistent with the GABAB receptor dependency of these effects. In these cases, the GABA reuptake blocker SKF89976A (25 μM) produced a transient hyperpolarization and depression of the IPSP amplitude, most likely through GABA spill-over and activation of extra-synaptic GABAB receptors (Figure S7, n = 6, p < 0.05). Next, we used as optical stimulation a spike train that was recorded during open field exploration from a vCA1 place cell projecting to the BLA (as well as to the nucleus accumbens and mPFC) (Ciocchi et al., 2015Ciocchi S. Passecker J. Malagon-Vina H. Mikus N. Klausberger T. Brain computation. Selective information routing by ventral hippocampal CA1 projection neurons.Science. 2015; 348: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This stimulation elicited responses in BA PNs highly similar to TBS, namely a transient membrane hyperpolarization (second light pulse versus first light pulse p < 0.001, n = 8) and a dynamic depression of FFI (second light pulse versus first light pulse p < 0.0001, n = 8) (Figures 6A–6E). Moreover, we tested whether the depression of the IPSP was caused by a reduction in GABAA conductance. We recorded PNs in voltage-clamp mode, applying optical TBS at different holding potentials to plot the peak current of the first and second IPSC versus the holding potential. The slope of this I/V relationship was reduced for the second IPSC (from 11.7 ± 2.9 nS to 6.4 ± 2.6 nS, p < 0.05, n = 6), suggesting that the GABAA conductance was indeed decreased. We also observed that the reversal potential of the IPSC (EIPSC) shifted from −72.8 ± 3.3 mV for the first IPSC to −61.6 ± 4.7 mV for second IPSC (p < 0.05, n = 6, Figures 6F–6H). The EIPSC shift suggests that a reduction in the driving force for Cl− contributes to the depression of FFI during TBS, consistent with the residual IPSP depression trend still present with CGP54626 (Figure 5D) and previous reports (Thompson and Gähwiler, 1989Thompson S.M. Gähwiler B.H. Activity-dependent disinhibition. I. Repetitive stimulation reduces IPSP driving force and conductance in the hippocampus in vitro.J. Neurophysiol. 1989; 61: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Woodin et al., 2003Woodin M.A. Ganguly K. Poo M.M. Coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity modifies GABAergic synapses by postsynaptic changes in Cl- transporter activity.Neuron. 2003; 39: 807-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, GABAB-dependent reduction of GABAA conductance and shift in the EIPSC account for the synaptic dynamics observed. The GABAB-receptor-mediated effects could be due to the depression of either glutamatergic synapses from vCA1 fibers onto BA INs and/or GABAergic synapses from BA INs onto PNs. We distinguished between these two possibilities by recording directly from GABAergic INs with the soma in the BA and ITCs (Figure S5). The EPSPs recorded in these cells displayed a gradual increase in amplitude through the TBS (Figure 5F, tenth versus first train p < 0.05, n = 23). Hence, vCA1-BA INs excitatory synapses could not be responsible for the transient depression of the IPSPs recorded from PNs. Furthermore, the amplitude of the EPSPs recorded from PNs was stable in presence of antagonists for GABA receptors (Figure 5A, F, tenth versus first train p > 0.05, n = 6), indicating that vCA1-BA PNs excitatory synapses do not undergo depression during TBS. Next, we tested whether presynaptic mechanisms contribute to the depression of the IPSP amplitude. Monosynaptic IPSPs were triggered in PNs through local electrical stimulation in the presence of NBQX (10 μM) and APV (100 μM). The application of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (10 μM) abolished the monosynaptic IPSPs (Figures 7A and 7B , n = 5, p < 0.01). The magnitude of this effect suggests that activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors and an increase in postsynaptic membrane conductance induced by baclofen accounted for this effect. To further corroborate the involvement of presynaptic GABAB receptors in the depression of the IPSP amplitude, additional experiments were carried out. First, electrical stimulation was delivered while recording postsynaptic neurons in voltage-clamp mode. The paired pulse ratio (PPR) of electrically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), a parameter critically dependent on presynaptic GABAB receptors (Davies et al., 1990Davies C.H.

https://openalex.org/W2256201617,"Precise delineation of the specific genes and pathways altered with aging and estrogen (E) therapy may lead to new skeletal biomarkers and the development of novel bone therapeutics. Previous human bone studies, however, have been limited by only examining pre-specified genes and pathways. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq), on the other hand, offers an unbiased approach to examine the entire transcriptome. Here we present an RNAseq analysis of human bone samples, obtained from iliac crest needle biopsies, to yield the first in vivo interrogation of all genes and pathways that may be altered in bone with aging and E therapy in humans. 58 healthy women were studied, including 19 young women (mean age ± SD, 30.3 ± 5.4 years), 19 old women (73.1 ± 6.6 years), and 20 old women treated with 3 weeks of E therapy (70.5 ± 5.2 years). Using generally accepted criteria (false discovery rate [q] < 0.10), aging altered a total of 678 genes and 12 pathways, including a subset known to regulate bone metabolism (e.g., Notch). Interestingly, the LEF1 transcription factor, which is a classical downstream target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, was significantly downregulated in the bones from the old versus young women; consistent with this, LEF1 binding sites were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of the differentially expressed genes in the old versus young women, suggesting that aging was associated with alterations in Wnt signaling in bone. Further, of the 21 unique genes altered in bone by E therapy, the expression of INHBB (encoding for the inhibin, beta B polypeptide), which decreased with aging (by 0.6-fold), was restored to young adult levels in response to E therapy. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that aging alters a substantial portion of the skeletal transcriptome, whereas E therapy appears to have significant, albeit less wide-ranging effects. These data provide a valuable resource for the potential identification of novel biomarkers associated with age-related bone loss and also highlight potential pathways that could be targeted to treat osteoporosis.

A small investment in screening this diversity for a wide range of traits is likely to reveal many traditional varieties with distinguished values. One objective of this study was to demonstrate, with Capsicum as model crop, the application of indicators of phenotypic and geographic diversity as effective criteria for selecting promising genebank accessions for multiple uses from crop centers of diversity. A second objective was to evaluate the expression of biochemical and agromorphological properties of the selected Capsicum accessions in different conditions. Four steps were involved: 1) Develop the necessary diversity by expanding genebank collections in Bolivia and Peru; 2) Establish representative subsets of ~100 accessions for biochemical screening of Capsicum fruits; 3) Select promising accessions for different uses after screening; and 4) Examine how these promising accessions express biochemical and agromorphological properties when grown in different environmental conditions. The Peruvian Capsicum collection now contains 712 accessions encompassing all five domesticated species (C. annuum, C. chinense, C. frutescens, C. baccatum, and C. pubescens). The collection in Bolivia now contains 487 accessions, representing all five domesticates plus four wild taxa (C. baccatum var. baccatum, C. caballeroi, C. cardenasii, and C. eximium). Following the biochemical screening, 44 Bolivian and 39 Peruvian accessions were selected as promising, representing wide variation in levels of antioxidant capacity, capsaicinoids, fat, flavonoids, polyphenols, quercetins, tocopherols, and color. In Peru, 23 promising accessions performed well in different environments, while each of the promising Bolivian accessions only performed well in a certain environment. Differences in Capsicum diversity and local contexts led to distinct outcomes in each country. In Peru, mild landraces with high values in health-related attributes were of interest to entrepreneurs. In Bolivia, wild Capsicum have high commercial demand."
https://openalex.org/W2233089496,"The demographic history of human populations in North Africa has been characterized by complex processes of admixture and isolation that have modeled its current gene pool. Diverse genetic ancestral components with different origins (autochthonous, European, Middle Eastern, and sub-Saharan) and genetic heterogeneity in the region have been described. In this complex genetic landscape, Algeria, the largest country in Africa, has been poorly covered, with most of the studies using a single Algerian sample. In order to evaluate the genetic heterogeneity of Algeria, Y-chromosome, mtDNA and autosomal genome-wide makers have been analyzed in several Berber- and Arab-speaking groups. Our results show that the genetic heterogeneity found in Algeria is not correlated with geography or linguistics, challenging the idea of Berber groups being genetically isolated and Arab groups open to gene flow. In addition, we have found that external sources of gene flow into North Africa have been carried more often by females than males, while the North African autochthonous component is more frequent in paternally transmitted genome regions. Our results highlight the different demographic history revealed by different markers and urge to be cautious when deriving general conclusions from partial genomic information or from single samples as representatives of the total population of a region."

Kir7.1 is present in epithelial tissues where it colocalizes with the Na+/K+-pump probably serving to recycle K+ taken up by the pump. Human mutations affecting Kir7.1 are associated with retinal degeneration diseases. We generated a mouse lacking Kir7.1 by ablation of the Kcnj13 gene. Homozygous mutant null mice die hours after birth and show cleft palate and moderate retardation in lung development. Kir7.1 is expressed in the epithelium covering the palatal processes at the time at which palate sealing takes place and our results suggest it might play an essential role in late palatogenesis.

Molecular cues and neuronal activity both play critical roles in map formation, but their interaction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that when molecular- and activity-dependent cues are rendered nearly equal in force, they drive topographic mapping stochastically. The functional and anatomical representation of azimuth in the superior colliculus of heterozygous Islet2-EphA3 knockin (Isl2(EphA3/+)) mice is variable: maps may be single, duplicated, or a combination of the two. This heterogeneity is not due to genetic differences, since map organizations in individual mutant animals often differ between colliculi. Disruption of spontaneous waves of retinal activity resulted in uniform map organization in Isl2(EphA3/+) mice, demonstrating that correlated spontaneous activity is required for map heterogeneity. Computational modeling replicates this heterogeneity, revealing that molecular- and activity-dependent forces interact simultaneously and stochastically during topographic map formation."
https://openalex.org/W2189911506,"Pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas often display increased Akt phosphorylation through up regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) signaling. Additionally, Akt signaling has been linked to resistance to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors in sarcoma, further demonstrating the role of Akt in tumor survival. This suggests targeting components of the PI3K/Akt pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we investigated the in vitro activity of the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) in pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Buparlisib inhibited activation of Akt and signaling molecules downstream of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) in Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Anti-proliferative effects were observed in both anchorage dependent and independent conditions and apoptosis was induced within 24 hours of drug treatment. Buparlisib demonstrated cytotoxicity as a single agent, but was found to be more effective when used in combination. Synergy was observed when buparlisib was combined with the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The addition of NVP-AEW541 also further reduced phospho-Akt levels and more potently induced apoptosis compared to buparlisib treatment alone. Additionally, the combination of buparlisib with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib resulted in synergy in sarcoma cell lines possessing MAPK pathway mutations. Taken together, these data indicate buparlisib could be a novel therapy for the treatment of pediatric bone and soft tissue sarcomas."
https://openalex.org/W2231114804,"The gonadotropin known as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) plays a key role in regulating reproductive processes. Physiologically active FSH is a glycoprotein that can accommodate glycans on up to four asparagine residues, including two sites in the FSHα subunit that are critical for biochemical function, plus two sites in the β subunit, whose differential glycosylation states appear to correspond to physiologically distinct functions. Some degree of FSHβ hypo-glycosylation seems to confer advantages toward reproductive fertility of child-bearing females. In order to identify possible mechanistic underpinnings for this physiological difference we have pursued computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations on complexes between the high affinity site of the gonadal FSH receptor (FSHR) and several FSH glycoforms including fully-glycosylated (FSH24), hypo-glycosylated (e.g., FSH15), and completely deglycosylated FSH (dgFSH). These simulations suggest that deviations in FSH/FSHR binding profile as a function of glycosylation state are modest when FSH is adorned with only small glycans, such as single N-acetylglucosamine residues. However, substantial qualitative differences emerge between FSH15 and FSH24 when FSH is decorated with a much larger, tetra-antennary glycan. Specifically, the FSHR complex with hypo-glycosylated FSH15 is observed to undergo a significant conformational shift after 5-10 ns of simulation, indicating that FSH15 has greater conformational flexibility than FSH24 which may explain the more favorable FSH15 kinetic profile. FSH15 also exhibits a stronger binding free energy, due in large part to formation of closer and more persistent salt-bridges with FSHR."
https://openalex.org/W1651832043,"Fusarium graminearum is a predominant component of the Fusarium head blight (FHB) complex of small grain cereals. Ascosporic infection plays a relevant role in the spread of the disease. A 3-year study was conducted on ascospore discharge. To separate the effect of weather on discharge from the effect of weather on the production and maturation of ascospores in perithecia, discharge was quantified with a volumetric spore sampler placed near maize stalk residues bearing perithecia with mature ascospores; the residues therefore served as a continuous source of ascospores. Ascospores were discharged from perithecia on 70% of 154 days. Rain (R) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were the variables that most affected ascospore discharge, with 84% of total discharges occurring on days with R≥0.2 mm or VPD≤11 hPa, and with 70% of total ascospore discharge peaks (≥ 30 ascospores/m3 air per day) occurring on days with R≥0.2 mm and VPD≤6.35 hPa. An ROC analysis using these criteria for R and VPD provided True Positive Proportion (TPP) = 0.84 and True Negative Proportion (TNP) = 0.63 for occurrence of ascospore discharge, and TPP = 0.70 and TNP = 0.89 for occurrence of peaks. Globally, 68 ascospores (2.5% of the total ascospores sampled) were trapped on the 17 days when no ascospores were erroneously predicted. When a discharge occurred, the numbers of F. graminearum ascospores sampled were predicted by a multiple regression model with R2 = 0.68. This model, which includes average and maximum temperature and VPD as predicting variables, slightly underestimated the real data and especially ascospore peaks. Numbers of ascospores in peaks were best predicted by wetness duration of the previous day, minimum temperature, and VPD, with R2 = 0.71. These results will help refine the epidemiological models used as decision aids in FHB management programs."

During the formative qualitative study, we conducted in-depth interviews with circumcised males (n = 14), uncircumcised males (n = 16), and participatory group discussions (n = 20) with men and women aged 20–49 years in Njombe and Tabora regions of Tanzania. Participants reported that mothers and female partners have an important influence on men’s decisions to seek VMMC both directly by denying sex, and indirectly through discussion, advice and providing information on VMMC to uncircumcised partners and sons. Our findings suggest that in Tanzania and potentially other settings, an expanded role for women in VMMC communication strategies could increase adult male uptake of VMMC services."
https://openalex.org/W2188445889,"Purpose This study was initiated to identify causal mutations responsible for autosomal recessive congenital cataracts in consanguineous familial cases. Methods Affected individuals underwent a detailed ophthalmological and clinical examination, and slit-lamp photographs were ascertained for affected individuals who have not yet been operated for the removal of the cataractous lens. Blood samples were obtained, and genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. A genome-wide scan was completed with short tandem repeat (STR) markers, and the logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated. Protein coding exons of CRYAB were sequenced, bi-directionally. Evolutionary conservation was investigated by aligning CRYAB orthologues, and the expression of Cryab in embryonic and postnatal mice lens was investigated with TaqMan probe. Results The clinical and ophthalmological examinations suggested that all affected individuals had nuclear cataracts. Genome-wide linkage analysis suggested a potential region on chromosome 11q23 harboring CRYAB. DNA sequencing identified a missense variation: c.34C>T (p.R12C) in CRYAB that segregated with the disease phenotype in the family. Subsequent interrogation of our entire cohort of familial cases identified a second familial case localized to chromosome 11q23 harboring a c.31C>T (p.R11C) mutation. In silico analyses suggested that the mutations identified in familial cases, p.R11C and p.R12C will not be tolerated by the three-dimensional structure of CRYAB. Real-time PCR analysis identified the expression of Cryab in mouse lens as early as embryonic day 15 (E15) that increased significantly until postnatal day 6 (P6) with steady level of expression thereafter. Conclusion Here, we report two novel missense mutations, p.R11C and p.R12C, in CRYAB associated with autosomal recessive congenital nuclear cataracts."
https://openalex.org/W2211373358,"Precise mapping of above-ground biomass (AGB) is a major challenge for the success of REDD+ processes in tropical rainforest. The usual mapping methods are based on two hypotheses: a large and long-ranged spatial autocorrelation and a strong environment influence at the regional scale. However, there are no studies of the spatial structure of AGB at the landscapes scale to support these assumptions. We studied spatial variation in AGB at various scales using two large forest inventories conducted in French Guiana. The dataset comprised 2507 plots (0.4 to 0.5 ha) of undisturbed rainforest distributed over the whole region. After checking the uncertainties of estimates obtained from these data, we used half of the dataset to develop explicit predictive models including spatial and environmental effects and tested the accuracy of the resulting maps according to their resolution using the rest of the data. Forest inventories provided accurate AGB estimates at the plot scale, for a mean of 325 Mg.ha-1. They revealed high local variability combined with a weak autocorrelation up to distances of no more than10 km. Environmental variables accounted for a minor part of spatial variation. Accuracy of the best model including spatial effects was 90 Mg.ha-1 at plot scale but coarse graining up to 2-km resolution allowed mapping AGB with accuracy lower than 50 Mg.ha-1. Whatever the resolution, no agreement was found with available pan-tropical reference maps at all resolutions. We concluded that the combined weak autocorrelation and weak environmental effect limit AGB maps accuracy in rainforest, and that a trade-off has to be found between spatial resolution and effective accuracy until adequate “wall-to-wall” remote sensing signals provide reliable AGB predictions. Waiting for this, using large forest inventories with low sampling rate (<0.5%) may be an efficient way to increase the global coverage of AGB maps with acceptable accuracy at kilometric resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2145339787,"Dry eye is a common disorder caused by inadequate hydration of the ocular surface that results in disruption of barrier function. The homeostatic protein clusterin (CLU) is prominent at fluid-tissue interfaces throughout the body. CLU levels are reduced at the ocular surface in human inflammatory disorders that manifest as severe dry eye, as well as in a preclinical mouse model for desiccating stress that mimics dry eye. Using this mouse model, we show here that CLU prevents and ameliorates ocular surface barrier disruption by a remarkable sealing mechanism dependent on attainment of a critical all-or-none concentration. When the CLU level drops below the critical all-or-none threshold, the barrier becomes vulnerable to desiccating stress. CLU binds selectively to the ocular surface subjected to desiccating stress in vivo, and in vitro to the galectin LGALS3, a key barrier component. Positioned in this way, CLU not only physically seals the ocular surface barrier, but it also protects the barrier cells and prevents further damage to barrier structure. These findings define a fundamentally new mechanism for ocular surface protection and suggest CLU as a biotherapeutic for dry eye."
https://openalex.org/W2188799151,"Background Wound healing involves the integration of complex biological processes. Several studies examined numerous approaches to enhance wound healing and to minimize its related morbidity. Both chitosan and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were used in treating skin wounds. The aim of the current work was to compare MSCs versus chitosan in wound healing, evaluate the most efficient route of administration of MSCs, either intradermal or systemic injection, and elicit the mechanisms inducing epidermal and dermal cell regeneration using histological, immunohistochemical and fluorescent techniques. Material and Methods Forty adult male Sprague Dawley albino rats were divided into four equal groups (ten rats in each group): control group (Group I); full thickness surgical skin wound model, Group II: Wound and chitosan gel. Group III: Wound treated with systemic injection of MSCs and Group IV: Wound treated with intradermal injection of MSCs. The healing ulcer was examined on day 3, 5, 10 and 15 for gross morphological evaluation and on day 10 and 15 for histological, immunohistochemical and fluorescent studies. Results Chitosan was proved to promote wound healing more than the control group but none of their wound reached complete closure. Better and faster healing of wounds in MSCs treated groups were manifested more than the control or chitosan treated groups. It was found that the intradermal route of administration of stem cells enhanced the rate of healing of skin wounds better than the systemic administration to the extent that, by the end of the fifteenth day of the experiment, the wounds were completely healed in all rats of this group. Histologically, the wound areas of group IV were hardly demarcated from the adjacent normal skin and showed complete regeneration of the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis and underlying muscle fibers. Collagen fibers were arranged in many directions, with significant increase in their area percent, surrounding fully regenerated hair follicles and sebaceous glands in the dermis of the healed areas more than in other groups. Conclusion MSCs enhanced the healing process of wound closure more than chitosan gel treatment. Furthermore, MSCs injected intradermally, were more efficient in accelerating wound healing than any other mode of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2219934998,"Introduction This study aimed to assess whether weight growth velocity (WGV) predicts neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs). Methods Subjects were infants who weighed 501–1000 g at birth and were included in the cohort of the Neonatal Research Network of Japan (2003–2007). Patel’s exponential model (EM) method was used to calculate WGV between birth and discharge. Assessment of predictions of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) was performed at 3 years of age based on the WGV score, which was categorized by per one increase in WGV. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results In the 2961 ELBWIs assessed, the median WGV was 10.5 g/kg/day (interquartile, 9.4–11.9). With the categorical approach, the adjusted odds ratios for death or NDI with WGV scores of 6 and 7 were 2.41 (95%CI, 1.60–3.62) and 1.81 (95%CI, 1.18–2.75), respectively, relative to the reference WGV score of 10. WGV scores ≥8 did not predict death or NDI. Conclusions WGV scores <8 were significant predictors suggesting that values of WGV during hospitalization in a NICU are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Further investigations is necessary to determine whether additional nutritional support may improve low WGV in ELBWIs."
https://openalex.org/W2255943172,"The role of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), the enzyme involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, has not yet been explored in tumor initiating cells (TICs). We investigated PC-PLC expression and effects of PC-PLC inhibition in two adherent (AD) squamous carcinoma cell lines (A431 and CaSki), with different proliferative and stemness potential, and in TIC-enriched floating spheres (SPH) originated from them.Compared with immortalized non-tumoral keratinocytes (HaCaT) A431-AD cells showed 2.5-fold higher PC-PLC activity, nuclear localization of a 66-kDa PC-PLC isoform, but a similar distribution of the enzyme on plasma membrane and in cytoplasmic compartments. Compared with A431-AD, A431-SPH cells showed about 2.8-fold lower PC-PLC protein and activity levels, but similar nuclear content. Exposure of adherent cells to the PC-PLC inhibitor D609 (48h) induced a 50% reduction of cell proliferation at doses comprised between 33 and 50 μg/ml, without inducing any relevant cytotoxic effect (cell viability 95±5%). In A431-SPH and CaSki-SPH D609 induced both cytostatic and cytotoxic effects at about 20 to 30-fold lower doses (IC50 ranging between 1.2 and 1.6 μg/ml). Furthermore, D609 treatment of A431-AD and CaSki-AD cells affected the sphere-forming efficiency, which dropped in both cells, and induced down-modulation of stem-related markers mRNA levels (Oct4, Nestin, Nanog and ALDH1 in A431; Nestin and ALDH1 in CaSki cells).These data suggest that the inhibition of PC-PLC activity may represent a new therapeutic approach to selectively target the most aggressive and tumor promoting sub-population of floating spheres originated from squamous cancer cells possessing different proliferative and stemness potential."
https://openalex.org/W2182688426,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic degenerative autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation of synovial membranes, which leads to cartilage destruction and bone erosion. To date, there are no effective therapies to slow the progress of this degenerative condition. Here, we evaluate the anti-arthritic effect of chebulanin, an abundant anti-inflammatory agent isolated from Terminalia chebula, in collagen induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice by intragastric administration. Arthritic severity was scored by performing histopathological evaluation of the joints and measuring the expression of inflammatory cytokines and relative enzymes by immunohistochemical staining. In parallel, bone destruction and erosion were confirmed by micro-CT. Our data revealed that chebulanin significantly improved the severity of arthritis. Specifically, the histopathological characteristics of the tissues were improved and expression of TNF-α, IL-6, MMP-3 and COX-2 in the paws and joints of the treated mice decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with control mice. Furthermore, micro-CT analysis revealed that chebulanin induced a dose-dependent reduction in cartilage destruction and bone erosion. Taken together, our findings suggest that chebulanin suppresses the expression of inflammatory mediators and prevents cartilage destruction and bone erosion in mice. Therefore, chebulanin is a strong therapeutic alternative for the treatment of RA."
https://openalex.org/W2183672065,"Assessing skeletal age is a subjective and tedious examination process. Hence, automated assessment methods have been developed to replace manual evaluation in medical applications. In this study, a new fully automated method based on content-based image retrieval and using extreme learning machines (ELM) is designed and adapted to assess skeletal maturity. The main novelty of this approach is it overcomes the segmentation problem as suffered by existing systems. The estimation results of ELM models are compared with those of genetic programming (GP) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) models. The experimental results signify improvement in assessment accuracy over GP and ANN, while generalization capability is possible with the ELM approach. Moreover, the results are indicated that the ELM model developed can be used confidently in further work on formulating novel models of skeletal age assessment strategies. According to the experimental results, the new presented method has the capacity to learn many hundreds of times faster than traditional learning methods and it has sufficient overall performance in many aspects. It has conclusively been found that applying ELM is particularly promising as an alternative method for evaluating skeletal age."
https://openalex.org/W2341150045,"Transboundary industrial pollution requires international actions to control its formation and effects. In this paper, we present a stochastic differential game to model the transboundary industrial pollution problems with emission permits trading. More generally, the process of emission permits price is assumed to be stochastic and to follow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). We make use of stochastic optimal control theory to derive the system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations satisfied by the value functions for the cooperative and the noncooperative games, respectively, and then propose a so-called fitted finite volume method to solve it. The efficiency and the usefulness of this method are illustrated by the numerical experiments. The two regions’ cooperative and noncooperative optimal emission paths, which maximize the regions’ discounted streams of the net revenues, together with the value functions, are obtained. Additionally, we can also obtain the threshold conditions for the two regions to decide whether they cooperate or not in different cases. The effects of parameters in the established model on the results have been also examined. All the results demonstrate that the stochastic emission permits prices can motivate the players to make more flexible strategic decisions in the games."
https://openalex.org/W2207963805,"Prior research has found that persons who favor more analytic modes of thought are less religious. We propose that individual differences in analytic thought are associated with reduced religious beliefs particularly when analytic thought is measured (hence, primed) first. The current study provides a direct replication of prior evidence that individual differences in analytic thinking are negatively related to religious beliefs when analytic thought is measured before religious beliefs. When religious belief is measured before analytic thinking, however, the negative relationship is reduced to non-significance, suggesting that the link between analytic thought and religious belief is more tenuous than previously reported. The current study suggests that whereas inducing analytic processing may reduce religious belief, more analytic thinkers are not necessarily less religious. The potential for measurement order to inflate the inverse correlation between analytic thinking and religious beliefs deserves additional consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2340474097,"The reliability of single time point measurements of the novel adipokines retinol-binding protein 4 and omentin-1 in the blood has not been evaluated in large samples yet. The present study aimed to assess the amount of biological variation of these two adipokines within individuals. The study sample comprised 207 participants (124 women and 83 men) from Potsdam (Germany) and surrounding areas, with an average age of 56.5 years (SD 4.2). Blood samples were collected from each participant twice, approximately four months apart. Using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays, the concentrations of retinol-binding protein 4 and omentin-1 were determined in EDTA plasma. As indicators of reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated from the repeated biomarker measurements. The ICCs for repeated retinol-binding protein 4 and omentin-1 measurements were 0.77 (95% CI 0.71, 0.82) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.78, 0.87), respectively, indicating for both adipokines excellent reliability. ICCs were stable across strata according to sex, age, BMI, and blood pressure. Thus, for epidemiological studies it seems reasonable to rely on concentrations of retinol-binding protein 4 and omentin-1 in samples from a single time point if repeated measurements are not available."
https://openalex.org/W1692240727,"The porphyrin compound, TMPyP4 (5,10,15,20-Tetrakis-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine), is widely used as a photosensitizer and a modulator of nucleic acid secondary structure stability. Our group recently showed in cultured cells and forebrain slice cultures that this compound can also down regulate expression of Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, by stabilizing DNA secondary structures in the Th proximal promoter. The current study sought to establish whether treatment with TMPyP4 could modify mouse Th expression levels in vivo. Intraperitoneal administration of low TMPyP4 doses (10mg/kg), similar to those used for photosensitization, did not significantly reduce Th transcript levels in several catecholaminergic regions. Administration of a high dose (40 mg/kg), similar to those used for tumor xenograph reduction, unexpectedly induced flaccid paralysis in an age and sex-dependent manner. In vitro analyses revealed that TMPyP4, but not putative metabolites, inhibited Acetylcholinesterase activity and pre-treatment of TMPyP4 with Hemeoxygenase-2 (HO-2) rescued Acetylcholinesterase function. Age-dependent differences in HO-2 expression levels may account for some of the variable in vivo effects of high TMPyP4 doses. Together, these studies indicate that only low doses of TMPyP4, such as those typically used for photosensitization, are well tolerated in vivo. Thus, despite its widespread use in vitro, TMPyP4 is not ideal for modifying neuronal gene expression in vivo by manipulating nucleic acid secondary structure stability, which highlights the need to identify more clinically suitable compounds that can modulate nucleic acid secondary structure and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2205511977,"Shifts in plant species phenology (the timing of life-history events such as flowering) have been observed worldwide in concert with rising global temperatures. While most species display earlier phenology with warming, there is large variation among, and even within, species in phenological sensitivity to rising temperatures. Other indirect effects of climate change, such as shifting species composition and altered species interactions, may also be contributing to shifting plant phenology. Here, we describe how experimental warming and the presence of a range-expanding species, sagebrush (Artemisia rothrockii), interact to influence the flowering phenology (day of first and peak flowering) and production (number of flowers) of an alpine cushion plant, Trifolium andersonii, in California's White Mountains. Both first flowering and peak flowering were strongly accelerated by warming, but not when sagebrush was present. Warming significantly increased flower production of T. andersonii, but less so in the presence of sagebrush. A shading treatment delayed phenology and lowered flower production, suggesting that shading may be the mechanism by which sagebrush presence delayed flowering of the understory species. This study demonstrates that species interactions can modify phenological responses to climate change, and suggests that indirect effects of rising temperatures arising from shifting species ranges and altered species interactions may even exceed the direct effects of rising temperatures on phenology."
https://openalex.org/W2194784356,"After the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, the residents living around the Chernobyl were revealed to have been internally exposed to 137Cs through the intake of contaminated local foods. To evaluate the current situation of internal 137Cs exposure and the relationship between the 137Cs soil contamination and internal exposure in residents, we investigated the 137Cs body burden in residents who were living in 10 selected cities from the northern part of the Zhitomir region, Ukraine, and collected soil samples from three family farms and wild forests of each city to measured 137Cs concentrations. The total number of study participants was 36,862, of which 68.9% of them were female. After 2010, the annual effective doses were less than 0.1 mSv in over 90% of the residents. The 137Cs body burden was significantly higher in autumn than other seasons (p < 0.001) and in residents living in more contaminated areas (p < 0.001). We also found a significant correlation between the proportion of residents in each city with an estimated annual exposure dose exceeding 0.1 mSv and 137Cs concentration of soil samples from family farms (r = 0.828, p = 0.003). In conclusion, more than 25 years after the Chernobyl accident, the internal exposure doses to residents living in contaminated areas of northern Ukraine is limited but still related to 137Cs soil contamination. Furthermore, the consumption of local foods is considered to be the cause of internal exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2201982874,"The importance of providing effective analgesia during sedation for complex endoscopic procedures has been widely recognized. However, repeated administration of opioids in order to achieve sufficient analgesia may carry the risk of delayed recovery after propofol based sedation. This study was done to compare recovery profiles and the satisfaction of the endoscopists and patients between conventional balanced propofol sedation and analgesia-oriented combination sedation for patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).Two hundred and two adult patients scheduled for ERCP were sedated by either the Conventional (initial bolus of meperidine with propofol infusion) or Combination (repeated bolus doses of fentanyl with propofol infusion) method. Recovery profiles, satisfaction levels of the endoscopists and patients, drug requirements and complications were compared between groups.Patients of the Combination Group required significantly less propofol compared to the Conventional Group (135.0 ± 68.8 mg vs. 165.3 ± 81.7 mg, P = 0.005). Modified Aldrete scores were not different between groups throughout the recovery period, and recovery times were also comparable between groups. Satisfaction scores were not different between the two groups in both the endoscopists and patients (P = 0.868 and 0.890, respectively).Considering the significant reduction in propofol dose, the non-inferiority of recovery profiles and satisfaction scores of the endoscopists and patients, analgesia oriented combination sedation may be a more safe yet effective sedative method compared to conventional balanced propofol sedation during ERCP."
https://openalex.org/W2260144801,"Improving gastric accommodation and gastric emptying is an attractive physiological treatment target in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). We evaluated the effect of DA-9701, a new drug for FD, on gastric motor function after a meal in healthy volunteers using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Forty healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to receive either DA-9701 or placebo. After 5 days of treatment, subjects underwent gastric MRI (60 min before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after a liquid test meal). Gastric volume was measured through 3-dimensional reconstruction from MRI data. We analyzed 4 outcome variables including changes in total gastric volume (TGV), proximal TGV, and proximal to distal TGV ratio after a meal and gastric emptying rates after adjusting values at the pre-test meal.Changes in TGV and proximal TGV after a meal did not differ between the DA-9701 and placebo groups (difference between groups -25.9 mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -54.0 to 2.3 mL, P = 0.070 and -2.9 mL, 95% CI -30.3 to 24.5 mL, P = 0.832, respectively). However, pre-treatment with DA-9701 increased postprandial proximal to distal TGV ratio more than placebo (difference between groups 0.93, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.79, P = 0.034). In addition, pre-treatment with DA-9701 significantly increased gastric emptying as compared with placebo (mean difference between groups 3.41%, 95% CI 0.54% to 6.29%, P = 0.021, by mixed model for repeated measures).Our results suggested that DA-9701 enhances gastric emptying and does not significantly affect gastric accommodation in healthy volunteers. Further studies to confirm whether DA-9701 enhances these gastric motor functions in patients with FD are warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02091635."
https://openalex.org/W2221358880,This study offers a new perspective on the evolutionary patterns of cities or urban agglomerations. Such developments can range from chaotic to fully ordered. We demonstrate that in a dynamic space of interactive human behaviour cities produce a wealth of gravitational attractors whose size and shape depend on the resistance of space emerging inter alia from transport friction costs. This finding offers original insights into the complex evolution of spatial systems and appears to be consistent with the principles of central place theory known from the spatial sciences and geography. Our approach is dynamic in nature and forms a generalisation of hierarchical principles in geographic space.
https://openalex.org/W2183957547,"HIV infection provokes a myriad of pathological effects on the immune system where many markers of CD4+ T cell dysfunction have been identified. However, most studies to date have focused on single/double measurements of immune dysfunction, while the identification of pathological CD4+ T cell clusters that is highly associated to a specific biomarker for HIV disease remain less studied. Here, multi-parametric flow cytometry was used to investigate immune activation, exhaustion, and senescence of diverse maturation phenotypes of CD4+ T cells. The traditional method of manual data analysis was compared to a multidimensional clustering tool, FLOw Clustering with K (FLOCK) in two cohorts of 47 untreated HIV-infected individuals and 21 age and sex matched healthy controls. In order to reduce the subjectivity of FLOCK, we developed an ""artificial reference"", using 2% of all CD4+ gated T cells from each of the HIV-infected individuals. Principle component analyses demonstrated that using an artificial reference lead to a better separation of the HIV-infected individuals from the healthy controls as compared to using a single HIV-infected subject as a reference or analyzing data manually. Multiple correlation analyses between laboratory parameters and pathological CD4+ clusters revealed that the CD4/CD8 ratio was the preeminent surrogate marker of CD4+ T cells dysfunction using all three methods. Increased frequencies of an early-differentiated CD4+ T cell cluster with high CD38, HLA-DR and PD-1 expression were best correlated (Rho = -0.80, P value = 1.96×10-11) with HIV disease progression as measured by the CD4/CD8 ratio. The novel approach described here can be used to identify cell clusters that distinguish healthy from HIV infected subjects and is biologically relevant for HIV disease progression. These results further emphasize that a simple measurement of the CD4/CD8 ratio is a useful biomarker for assessment of combined CD4+ T cell dysfunction in chronic HIV disease."
https://openalex.org/W2202055389,"Objective We investigated whether and to what extent cystatin C was associated with angiographic coronary collateralization in patients with stable coronary artery disease and chronic total occlusion. Methods Serum levels of cystatin C and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined in 866 patients with stable angina and angiographic total occlusion of at least one major coronary artery. The degree of collaterals supplying the distal aspect of a total occlusion from the contra-lateral vessel was graded as poor (Rentrop score of 0 or 1) or good coronary collateralization (Rentrop score of 2 or 3). Results In total, serum cystatin C was higher in patients with poor collateralization than in those with good collateralization (1.08 ± 0.32 mg/L vs. 0.90 ± 0.34 mg/L, P < 0.001), and correlated inversely with Rentrop score (adjusted Spearmen’s r = -0.145, P < 0.001). The prevalence of poor coronary collateralization increased stepwise with increasing cystatin C quartiles (P for trend < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, risk factors for coronary artery disease, GFR and hsCRP, serum cystatin C ≥ 0.97 mg/L remained independently associated with poor collateralization (OR 2.374, 95% CI 1.660 ~ 3.396, P < 0.001). The diagnostic value of cystatin C levels for detecting poor coronary collateralization persisted regardless of age, gender, presence or absence of diabetes, hypertension or renal dysfunction. Conclusions Serum cystatin C reflects angiographic coronary collateralization in patients with stable coronary artery disease, and cystatin C ≥ 0.97 mg/L indicates a great risk of poor coronary collaterals."
https://openalex.org/W2339143067,"Saccharification of cellulose is a promising technique for producing alternative source of energy. However, the efficiency of conversion of cellulose into soluble sugar using any currently available methodology is too low for industrial application. Many additives, such as surfactants, have been shown to enhance the efficiency of cellulose-to-sugar conversion. In this study, we have examined first whether cattle saliva, as an additive, would enhance the cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose, and subsequently elucidated the mechanism by which cattle saliva enhanced this conversion. Although cattle saliva, by itself, did not degrade cellulose, it enhanced the cellulase-catalyzed degradation of cellulose. Thus, the amount of reducing sugar produced increased approximately 2.9-fold by the addition of cattle saliva. We also found that non-enzymatic proteins, which were present in cattle saliva, were responsible for causing the enhancement effect. Third, the mechanism of cattle saliva mediated enhancement of cellulase activity was probably similar to that of the canonical surfactants. Cattle saliva is available in large amounts easily and cheaply, and it can be used without further purification. Thus, cattle saliva could be a promising additive for efficient saccharification of cellulose on an industrial scale."
https://openalex.org/W1912963908,"Citrus greening (huanglongbing) is the most destructive citrus disease worldwide. The disease is associated with three species of 'Candidatus Liberibacter' among which 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus' has the widest distribution. 'Ca. L. asiaticus' is commonly transmitted by a phloem-feeding insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri. A previous study showed that isolates of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' were clearly differentiated by variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) profiles at four loci in the genome. In this study, the VNTR analysis was further validated by assessing the stability of these repeats after multiplication of the pathogen upon host-to-host transmission using a 'Ca. L. asiaticus' strain from Japan. The results showed that some tandem repeats showed detectable changes after insect transmission. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that the repeat numbers VNTR 002 and 077 of 'Ca. L. asiaticus' change through psyllid transmission. VNTRs in the recipient plant were apparently unrelated to the growing phase of the vector. In contrast, changes in the number of tandem repeats increased with longer acquisition and inoculation access periods, whereas changes were not observed through psyllid transmission after relatively short acquisition and inoculation access periods, up to 20 and 19 days, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1944085604,"There is a constant threat of zoonotic influenza viruses causing a pandemic outbreak in humans. It is virtually impossible to predict which virus strain will cause the next pandemic and it takes a considerable amount of time before a safe and effective vaccine will be available once a pandemic occurs. In addition, development of pandemic vaccines is hampered by the generally poor immunogenicity of avian influenza viruses in humans. An effective pre-pandemic vaccine is therefore required as a first line of defense. Broadening of the protective efficacy of current seasonal vaccines by adding an adjuvant may be a way to provide such first line of defense. Here we evaluate whether a seasonal trivalent virosomal vaccine (TVV) adjuvated with the saponin-based adjuvant Matrix-M (MM) can confer protection against avian influenza H5 and H7 virus strains in mice and ferrets. We demonstrate that mice were protected from death against challenges with H5N1 and H7N7, but that the protection was not complete as evidenced by severe clinical signs. In ferrets, protection against H7N9 was not observed. In contrast, reduced upper and lower respiratory tract viral loads and reduced lung pathology, was achieved in H5N1 challenged ferrets. Together these results suggest that, at least to some extent, Matrix-M adjuvated seasonal virosomal influenza vaccine can serve as an interim measure to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with a pandemic outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2179953347,"NBN plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis as a core component for both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathways. Genetic variants in the NBN gene have been associated with multiple cancers risk, suggesting pleiotropic effect on cancer. We hypothesized that genetic variants in the NBN gene may modify the risk of gastric cancer. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the association between four potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in NBN and gastric cancer risk in a case-control study of 1,140 gastric cancer cases and 1,547 controls in a Chinese population. We found that the A allele of rs10464867 (G>A) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.71-0.94; P = 4.71×10-3). Furthermore, the association between A allele of rs10464867 and decreased risk of gastric cancer was more significantly in elder individuals (per-allele OR = 0.72[0.59-0.88], P = 1.07×10-3), and male individuals (per-allele OR = 0.73[0.62-0.87], P = 3.68×10-4). We further conducted a haplotype analysis and identified that the NBN Ars10464867Grs14448Grs1063053 haplotype conferred stronger protective effect on gastric cancer (OR = 0.76[0.65-0.89], P = 6.39×10-4). In summary, these findings indicate that genetic variants at NBN gene may contribute to gastric cancer susceptibility and may further advance our understanding of NBN gene in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2184411674,"Changes in intermolecular interactions (differential interactions) may influence the progression of cancer. Specific genes and their regulatory networks may be more closely associated with cancer when taking their transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and dynamic and static interactions into account simultaneously. In this paper, a differential interaction analysis was performed to detect lung adenocarcinoma-related genes. Furthermore, a miRNA-TF (transcription factor) synergistic regulation network was constructed to identify three kinds of co-regulated motifs, namely, triplet, crosstalk and joint. Not only were the known cancer-related miRNAs and TFs (let-7, miR-15a, miR-17, TP53, ETS1, and so on) were detected in the motifs, but also the miR-15, let-7 and miR-17 families showed a tendency to regulate the triplet, crosstalk and joint motifs, respectively. Moreover, several biological functions (i.e., cell cycle, signaling pathways and hemopoiesis) associated with the three motifs were found to be frequently targeted by the drugs for lung adenocarcinoma. Specifically, the two 4-node motifs (crosstalk and joint) based on co-expression and interaction had a closer relationship to lung adenocarcinoma, and so further research was performed on them. A 10-gene biomarker (UBC, SRC, SP1, MYC, STAT3, JUN, NR3C1, RB1, GRB2 and MAPK1) was selected from the joint motif, and a survival analysis indicated its significant association with survival. Among the ten genes, JUN, NR3C1 and GRB2 are our newly detected candidate lung adenocarcinoma-related genes. The genes, regulators and regulatory motifs detected in this work will provide potential drug targets and new strategies for individual therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2227913821,"A rubella outbreak occurred in Anqing city of Anhui province, China, from February to July of 2012, and a total of 241 clinically diagnosed or lab-confirmed patients were reported. The highest number of rubella cases during this outbreak was recorded in teenagers between 10 and 19 years of age who had not previously received the rubella vaccine. Genotyping results indicated that the genotype 2B rubella virus (RV) was responsible for the outbreak. However, a phylogenetic analysis showed that the genotype 2B RVs isolated in Anqing City were not related to 2B RVs found in other cities of Anhui province and in other provinces of China, thus providing evidence for importation. After importation, the transmission of Anqing RVs was interrupted owing to an effective immunization campaign against rubella, suggesting the timeliness and effectiveness of contingency vaccination. Strengthening rubella surveillance, including the integration of epidemiologic information and laboratory data, is a vital strategy for rubella control and elimination. In addition, except for routine immunization, targeted supplementary immunization activities aimed at susceptible groups according to sero-epidemiological surveillance data also play a key role in stopping the continuous transmission of rubella viruses and in preventing further congenital rubella syndrome cases."
