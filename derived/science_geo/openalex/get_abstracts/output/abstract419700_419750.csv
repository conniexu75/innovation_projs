https://openalex.org/W2096391240,"DNA methylation is highly dynamic during mammalian embryogenesis. It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively depleted of 5-methylcytosine at fertilization, followed by passive loss that reaches a minimum at the blastocyst stage. However, this model is based on limited data, and so far no base-resolution maps exist to support and refine it. Here we generate genome-scale DNA methylation maps in mouse gametes and from the zygote through post-implantation. We find that the oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation, particularly at specific families of long interspersed element 1 and long terminal repeat retroelements, which are disparately methylated between gametes and have lower methylation values in the zygote than in sperm. Surprisingly, the oocyte contributes a unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)—including many CpG island promoters—that are maintained in the early embryo but are lost upon specification and absent from somatic cells. In contrast, sperm-contributed DMRs are largely intergenic and become hypermethylated after the blastocyst stage. Our data provide a genome-scale, base-resolution timeline of DNA methylation in the pre-specified embryo, when this epigenetic modification is most dynamic, before returning to the canonical somatic pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2092035637,"Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at non-uniform speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can affect a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the messenger RNA. Thus, redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of translational pausing in bacteria by ribosome profiling--deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This approach enables the high-resolution measurement of ribosome density profiles along most transcripts at unperturbed, endogenous expression levels. Unexpectedly, we found that codons decoded by rare transfer RNAs do not lead to slow translation under nutrient-rich conditions. Instead, Shine-Dalgarno-(SD)-like features within coding sequences cause pervasive translational pausing. Using an orthogonal ribosome possessing an altered anti-SD sequence, we show that pausing is due to hybridization between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA of the translating ribosome. In protein-coding sequences, internal SD sequences are disfavoured, which leads to biased usage, avoiding codons and codon pairs that resemble canonical SD sites. Our results indicate that internal SD-like sequences are a major determinant of translation rates and a global driving force for the coding of bacterial genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2163958669,"Glial cells constitute nearly 50% of the cells in the human brain. Astrocytes, which make up the largest glial population, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity during postnatal development. Because defects in astrocyte generation are associated with severe neurological disorders such as brain tumours, it is important to understand how astrocytes are produced. Astrocytes reportedly arise from two sources: radial glia in the ventricular zone and progenitors in the subventricular zone, with the contribution from each region shifting with time. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, the glial cell population, which contains predominantly astrocytes, expands 6-8-fold in the rodent brain. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this expansion. Here we show that a major source of glia in the postnatal cortex in mice is the local proliferation of differentiated astrocytes. Unlike glial progenitors in the subventricular zone, differentiated astrocytes undergo symmetric division, and their progeny integrate functionally into the existing glial network as mature astrocytes that form endfeet with blood vessels, couple electrically to neighbouring astrocytes, and take up glutamate after neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2054490148,"α-Synuclein has a central role in Parkinson disease, but its physiological function and the mechanism leading to neuronal degeneration remain unknown. Because recent studies have highlighted a role for α-synuclein in regulating mitochondrial morphology and autophagic clearance, we investigated the effect of α-synuclein in HeLa cells on mitochondrial signaling properties focusing on Ca(2+) homeostasis, which controls essential bioenergetic functions. By using organelle-targeted Ca(2+)-sensitive aequorin probes, we demonstrated that α-synuclein positively affects Ca(2+) transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria, augmenting the mitochondrial Ca(2+) transients elicited by agonists that induce endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release. This effect is not dependent on the intrinsic Ca(2+) uptake capacity of mitochondria, as measured in permeabilized cells, but correlates with an increase in the number of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria interactions. This action specifically requires the presence of the C-terminal α-synuclein domain. Conversely, α-synuclein siRNA silencing markedly reduces mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, causing profound alterations in organelle morphology. The enhanced accumulation of α-synuclein into the cells causes the redistribution of α-synuclein to localized foci and, similarly to the silencing of α-synuclein, reduces the ability of mitochondria to accumulate Ca(2+). The absence of efficient Ca(2+) transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria results in augmented autophagy that, in the long range, could compromise cellular bioenergetics. Overall, these findings demonstrate a key role for α-synuclein in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis in physiological conditions. Elevated α-synuclein expression and/or eventually alteration of the aggregation properties cause the redistribution of the protein within the cell and the loss of modulation on mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2163386000,"Protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone of conservation efforts and now cover nearly 13% of the world's land surface, with the world's governments committed to expand this to 17%. However, as biodiversity continues to decline, the effectiveness of PAs in reducing the extinction risk of species remains largely untested. We analyzed PA coverage and trends in species' extinction risk at globally significant sites for conserving birds (10,993 Important Bird Areas, IBAs) and highly threatened vertebrates and conifers (588 Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, AZEs) (referred to collectively hereafter as ‘important sites’). Species occurring in important sites with greater PA coverage experienced smaller increases in extinction risk over recent decades: the increase was half as large for bird species with>50% of the IBAs at which they occur completely covered by PAs, and a third lower for birds, mammals and amphibians restricted to protected AZEs (compared with unprotected or partially protected sites). Globally, half of the important sites for biodiversity conservation remain unprotected (49% of IBAs, 51% of AZEs). While PA coverage of important sites has increased over time, the proportion of PA area covering important sites, as opposed to less important land, has declined (by 0.45–1.14% annually since 1950 for IBAs and 0.79–1.49% annually for AZEs). Thus, while appropriately located PAs may slow the rate at which species are driven towards extinction, recent PA network expansion has under-represented important sites. We conclude that better targeted expansion of PA networks would help to improve biodiversity trends."
https://openalex.org/W2091849811,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step for cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) regulates the EMT and the metastasis suppressor gene, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1), could play a role in regulating the TGF-β pathway. NDRG1 expression is markedly increased after chelator-mediated iron depletion via hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-dependent and independent pathways (Le, N. T. and Richardson, D. R. (2004) Blood 104, 2967-2975). Moreover, novel iron chelators show marked and selective anti-tumor activity and are a potential new class of anti-metabolites. Considering this, the current study investigated the relationship between NDRG1 and the EMT to examine if iron chelators can inhibit the EMT via NDRG1 up-regulation. We demonstrated that TGF-β induces the EMT in HT29 and DU145 cells. Further, the chelators, desferrioxamine (DFO) and di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), inhibited the TGF-β-induced EMT by maintaining E-cadherin and β-catenin, at the cell membrane. We then established stable clones with NDRG1 overexpression and knock-down in HT29 and DU145 cells. These data showed that NDRG1 overexpression maintained membrane E-cadherin and β-catenin and inhibited TGF-β-stimulated cell migration and invasion. Conversely, NDRG1 knock-down caused morphological changes from an epithelial- to fibroblastic-like phenotype and also increased migration and invasion, demonstrating NDRG1 knockdown induced the EMT and enhanced TGF-β effects. We also investigated the mechanisms involved and showed the TGF-β/SMAD and Wnt pathways were implicated in NDRG1 regulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin expression and translocation. This study demonstrates that chelators inhibit the TGF-β-induced EMT via a process consistent with NDRG1 up-regulation and elucidates the mechanism of their activity."
https://openalex.org/W1967450909,"Microglia are specialized immune cells of the brain. Upon insult, microglia initiate a cascade of cellular responses including a characteristic change in cell morphology. To study the dynamics of microglia immune response in situ, we developed an automated image analysis method that enables the quantitative assessment of microglia activation state within tissue based solely on cell morphology. Per cell morphometric analysis of fluorescently labeled microglia is achieved through local iterative threshold segmentation, which reduces errors caused by signal-to-noise variation across large volumes. We demonstrate, utilizing systemic application of lipopolysaccharide as a model of immune challenge, that several morphological parameters, including cell perimeter length, cell roundness and soma size, quantitatively distinguish resting versus activated populations of microglia within tissue comparable to traditional immunohistochemistry methods. Furthermore, we provide proof-of-concept data that monitoring soma size enables the longitudinal assessment of microglia activation in the mouse neocortex imaged via 2-photon in vivo microscopy. The ability to quantify microglia activation automatically by shape alone allows unbiased and rapid analysis of both fixed and in vivo central nervous system tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2012282535,"During tissue morphogenesis, simple epithelial sheets undergo folding to form complex structures. The prevailing model underlying epithelial folding involves cell shape changes driven by myosin-dependent apical constriction. Here we describe an alternative mechanism that requires differential positioning of adherens junctions controlled by modulation of epithelial apical-basal polarity. Using live embryo imaging, we show that before the initiation of dorsal transverse folds during Drosophila gastrulation, adherens junctions shift basally in the initiating cells, but maintain their original subapical positioning in the neighbouring cells. Junctional positioning in the dorsal epithelium depends on the polarity proteins Bazooka and Par-1. In particular, the basal shift that occurs in the initiating cells is associated with a progressive decrease in Par-1 levels. We show that uniform reduction of the activity of Bazooka or Par-1 results in uniform apical or lateral positioning of junctions and in each case dorsal fold initiation is abolished. In addition, an increase in the Bazooka/Par-1 ratio causes formation of ectopic dorsal folds. The basal shift of junctions not only alters the apical shape of the initiating cells, but also forces the lateral membrane of the adjacent cells to bend towards the initiating cells, thereby facilitating tissue deformation. Our data thus establish a direct link between modification of epithelial polarity and initiation of epithelial folding."

https://openalex.org/W1976796139,"Food production is considered to be the main source of human impact on the environment and the concerns about detrimental effects of pesticides on biodiversity and human health are likely to lead to an increasingly restricted use of chemicals in agriculture. Since the first successful field trial, pheromone based mating disruption enabled sustainable insect control, which resulted in reduced levels of pesticide use. Organic farming is one of the fastest growing segments of agriculture and with the continuously growing public concern about use of pesticides, the main remaining challenge in increasing the safety of the global food production is to identify appropriate alternative mating disruption approaches for the numerous insect pests that do not rely on chemical communication. In the present study, we show for the first time that effective mating disruption based on substrate-borne vibrational signals can be achieved in the field. When disruptive vibrational signals were applied to grapevine plants through a supporting wire, mating frequency of the leafhopper pest Scaphoideus titanus dropped to 9 % in semi-field conditions and to 4 % in a mature vineyard. The underlying mechanism of this environmentally friendly pest-control tactic is a masking of the vibrational signals used in mate recognition and location. Because vibrational communication is widespread in insects, mating disruption using substrate vibrations can transform many open field and greenhouse based farming systems."
https://openalex.org/W2017589730,"The role and the mechanisms by which β1 integrins regulate the survival and chemoresistance of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) still are poorly addressed. In this study, we demonstrate in T-ALL cell lines and primary blasts, that engagement of α2β1 integrin with its ligand collagen I (ColI), reduces doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, whereas fibronectin (Fn) had no effect. ColI but not Fn inhibited doxorubicin-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and -3. ColI but not Fn also prevented doxorubicin from down-regulating the levels of the prosurvival Bcl-2 protein family member Mcl-1. The effect of ColI on Mcl-1 occurred through the inhibition of doxorubicin-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Mcl-1 knockdown experiments showed that the maintenance of Mcl-1 levels is essential for ColI-mediated T-ALL cell survival. Furthermore, activation of MAPK/ERK, but not PI3K/AKT, is required for ColI-mediated inhibition of doxorubicin-induced JNK activation and apoptosis and for ColI-mediated maintenance of Mcl-1 levels. Thus, our study identifies α2β1 integrin as an important survival pathway in drug-induced apoptosis of T-ALL cells and suggests that its activation can contribute to the generation of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2058574741,"The ubiquitous transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels function as non-selective, Ca(2+)-permeable channels and mediate numerous cellular functions. It is commonly assumed that TRPC channels are activated by stimulation of Gα(q)-PLC-coupled receptors. However, whether the Gα(q)-PLC pathway is the main regulator of TRPC4/5 channels and how other Gα proteins may regulate these channels are poorly understood. We previously reported that TRPC4/TRPC5 can be activated by Gα(i). In the current work, we found that Gα(i) subunits, rather than Gα(q), are the primary and direct activators of TRPC4 and TRPC5. We report a novel molecular mechanism in which TRPC4 is activated by several Gα(i) subunits, most prominently by Gα(i2), and TRPC5 is activated primarily by Gα(i3). Activation of Gα(i) by the muscarinic M2 receptors or expression of the constitutively active Gα(i) mutants equally and fully activates the channels. Moreover, both TRPC4 and TRPC5 are activated by direct interaction of their conserved C-terminal SESTD (SEC14-like and spectrin-type domains) with the Gα(i) subunits. Two amino acids (lysine 715 and arginine 716) of the TRPC4 C terminus were identified by structural modeling as mediating the interaction with Gα(i2). These findings indicate an essential role of Gα(i) proteins as novel activators for TRPC4/5 and reveal the molecular mechanism by which G-proteins activate the channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090800692,"Nuclear localization of multiple receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGF receptor (EGFR), ErbB-2, FGF receptor (FGFR), and many others, has been reported by several groups. We previously showed that cell surface EGFR is trafficked to the nucleus through a retrograde pathway from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that EGFR is then translocated to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) through the INTERNET (integral trafficking from the ER to the nuclear envelope transport) pathway. However, the nuclear trafficking mechanisms of other membrane RTKs, apart from EGFR, remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the nuclear transport of EGFR family proteins with that of FGFR-1. Interestingly, we found that digitonin permeabilization, which selectively releases soluble nuclear transporters from the cytoplasm and has been shown to inhibit nuclear transport of FGFR-1, had no effects on EGFR nuclear transport, raising the possibility that EGFR and FGFR-1 use different pathways to be translocated into the nucleus. Using the subnuclear fractionation assay, we further demonstrated that biotinylated cell surface ErbB-2, but not FGFR-1, is targeted to the INM, associating with Sec61β in the INM, similar to the nuclear trafficking of EGFR. Thus, ErbB-2, but not FGFR-1, shows a similar trafficking pathway to EGFR for translocation to the nucleus, indicating that at least two different pathways of nuclear transport exist for cell surface receptors. This finding provides a new direction for investigating the trafficking mechanisms of various nuclear RTKs."
https://openalex.org/W2082974388,"Background The search for disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's disease advances, however necessary markers for early detection of the disease are still lacking. There is compelling evidence that changes of postural stability occur at very early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease, making it tempting to speculate that changes in sway performance may even occur at a prodromal stage, and may have the potential to serve as a prodromal marker for the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings Balance performance was tested in 20 individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, 12 Parkinson's disease patients and 14 controls using a cross-sectional approach. All individuals were 50 years or older. Investigated groups were similar with respect to age, gender, and height. An accelerometer at the centre of mass at the lower spine quantified sway during quiet semitandem stance with eyes open and closed, as well as with and without foam. With increasing task difficulty, individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease showed an increased variability of trunk acceleration and a decrease of smoothness of sway, compared to both other groups. These differences reached significance in the most challenging condition, i.e. the eyes closed with foam condition. Conclusions/Significance Individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease have subtle signs of a balance deficit under most challenging conditions. This preliminary finding should motivate further studies on sway performance in individuals with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, to evaluate the potential of this symptom to serve as a biological marker for prodromal Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2041348758,"Manganese occupational and dietary overexposure has been shown to result in specific clinical central nervous system syndromes, which are similar to those observed in Parkinson disease. To date, modes of neurotoxic action of Mn are still to be elucidated but are thought to be strongly related to Mn accumulation in brain and oxidative stress. However, the pathway and the exact process of Mn uptake in the brain are yet not fully understood. Here, two well characterized primary porcine in vitro models of the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier were applied to assess the transfer of Mn in the brain while monitoring its effect on the barrier properties. Thus, for the first time effects of MnCl2 on the integrity of these two barriers as well as Mn transfer across the respective barriers are compared in one study. The data reveal a stronger Mn sensitivity of the in vitro blood-CSF barrier compared with the blood-brain barrier. Very interestingly, the negative effects of Mn on the structural and functional properties of the highly Mn-sensitive blood-CSF barrier were partly reversible after incubation with calcium. In summary, both the observed stronger Mn sensitivity of the in vitro blood-CSF barrier and the observed site-directed, most probably active, Mn transport toward the brain facing compartment, reveal that, in contrast to the general assumption in literature, after oral Mn intake the blood-CSF barrier might be the major route for Mn into the brain.

https://openalex.org/W1978653015,"In vitro expansion of β-cells from adult human pancreatic islets would overcome donor β-cell shortage for cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Using a β-cell-specific labeling system we have shown that β-cell expansion is accompanied by dedifferentiation resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition and loss of insulin expression. Epigenetic analyses indicate that key β-cell genes maintain open chromatin structure in expanded β-cell-derived (BCD) cells, although they are not transcribed. In the developing pancreas important cell-fate decisions are regulated by NOTCH receptors, which signal through the Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1) transcription regulator. We have reported that BCD cell dedifferentiation and proliferation in vitro correlate with reactivation of the NOTCH pathway. Inhibition of HES1 expression using shRNA during culture initiation results in reduced β-cell replication and dedifferentiation, suggesting that HES1 inhibition may also affect BCD cell redifferentiation following expansion. Here, we used HES1 shRNA to down-regulate HES1 expression in expanded human BCD cells, showing that HES1 inhibition is sufficient to induce BCD cell redifferentiation, as manifested by a significant increase in insulin expression. Combined treatment with HES1 shRNA, cell aggregation in serum-free medium, and a mixture of soluble factors further stimulated the redifferentiation of BCD cells. In vivo analyses demonstrated the ability of the redifferentiated cells to replace β-cell function in hyperglycemic immunodeficient mice. These findings demonstrate the redifferentiation potential of ex vivo expanded BCD cells and the reproducible differentiating effect of HES1 inhibition in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1997459647,"Myelin protein zero (P0 or MPZ) is a major myelin protein (∼30 kDa) expressed in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in terrestrial vertebrates. Several groups have detected a P0-related 36-kDa (or 35-kDa) protein that is expressed in the PNS as an antigen for the serum IgG of patients with neuropathy. The molecular structure and function of this 36-kDa protein are, however, still unknown. We hypothesized that the 36-kDa protein may be derived from P0 mRNA by stop codon readthrough. We found a highly conserved region after the regular stop codon in predicted sequences from the 3'-UTR of P0 in higher animals. MS of the 36-kDa protein revealed that both P0 peptides and peptides deduced from the P0 3'-UTR sequence were found among the tryptic fragments. In transfected cells and in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the 36-kDa molecule was also produced from the identical mRNA that produced P0. We designated this 36-kDa molecule as large myelin protein zero (L-MPZ), a novel isoform of P0 that contains an additional domain at the C terminus. In the PNS, L-MPZ was localized in compact myelin. In transfected cells, just like P0, L-MPZ was localized at cell-cell adhesion sites in the plasma membrane. These results suggest that L-MPZ produced by the stop codon readthrough mechanism is potentially involved in myelination. Since this is the first finding of stop codon readthrough in a common mammalian protein, detailed analysis of L-MPZ expression will help to understand the mechanism of stop codon readthrough in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1978581123,"Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a constituent of edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits growth of breast cancer cells but the mechanisms underlying growth inhibitory effect of BITC are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that BITC treatment causes FoxO1-mediated autophagic death in cultured human breast cancer cells. The BITC-treated breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, BT-474, and BRI-JM04) and MDA-MB-231 xenografts from BITC-treated mice exhibited several features characteristic of autophagy, including appearance of double-membrane vacuoles (transmission electron microscopy) and acidic vesicular organelles (acridine orange staining), cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and/or suppression of p62 (p62/SQSTM1 or sequestosome 1) expression. On the other hand, a normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) was resistant to BITC-induced autophagy. BITC-mediated inhibition of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell viability was partially but statistically significantly attenuated in the presence of autophagy inhibitors 3-methyl adenine and bafilomycin A1. Stable overexpression of Mn-superoxide dismutase, which was fully protective against apoptosis, conferred only partial protection against BITC-induced autophagy. BITC treatment decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and its downstream targets (P70s6k and 4E-BP1) in cultured MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 xenografts, but activation of mTOR by transient overexpression of its positive regulator Rheb failed to confer protection against BITC-induced autophagy. Autophagy induction by BITC was associated with increased expression and acetylation of FoxO1. Furthermore, autophagy induction and cell growth inhibition resulting from BITC exposure were significantly attenuated by small interfering RNA knockdown of FoxO1. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the molecular circuitry of BITC-induced cell death involving FoxO1-mediated autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2023200632,"DNA topoisomerases manage chromosome supercoiling and organization in all cells. Gyrase, a prokaryotic type IIA topoisomerase, consumes ATP to introduce negative supercoils through a strand passage mechanism. All type IIA topoisomerases employ a similar set of catalytic domains for function; however, the activity and specificity of gyrase are augmented by a specialized DNA binding and wrapping element, termed the C-terminal domain (CTD), which is appended to its GyrA subunit. We have discovered that a nonconserved, acidic tail at the extreme C terminus of the Escherichia coli GyrA CTD has a dramatic and unexpected impact on gyrase function. Removal of the CTD tail enables GyrA to introduce writhe into DNA in the absence of GyrB, an activity exhibited by other GyrA orthologs, but not by wild-type E. coli GyrA. Strikingly, a ""tail-less"" gyrase holoenzyme is markedly impaired for DNA supercoiling capacity, but displays normal ATPase function. Our findings reveal that the E. coli GyrA tail regulates DNA wrapping by the CTD to increase the coupling efficiency between ATP turnover and supercoiling, demonstrating that CTD functions can be fine-tuned to control gyrase activity in a highly sophisticated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2059839506,"NK cells are known as innate immune cells that lack immunological memory. Recently, it has been shown that NK cells remember encounters with chemical haptens that induce contact hypersensitivity and cytomegalovirus infection. Here, we show the existence of NK cell memory following HSV-2 infection. Stimulation with HSV-2 Ags led to higher IFNγ production in NK cells that were exposed 30 days previously to HSV-2, compared to NK cells from naïve mice. More importantly, this increased production of IFNγ in NK cells was independent of B- and T- lymphocytes and specific for the HSV-2 Ags. We also showed that previously exposed NK cells in a B- and T-lymphocyte free environment mediate protection against HSV-2 infection and they are necessary for the protection of mice against HSV-2 infection. Collectively, NK cells remember prior HSV-2 encounters independent of B- and T- lymphocytes leading to protection against HSV-2 mediated morbidity and mortality upon re-exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2067224145,"Increasing evidence supports the contribution of local inflammation to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, although the precise mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory protein S100A9 interacts with the Aβ1-40 peptide and promotes the formation of fibrillar β-amyloid structures. This interaction also results in reduced S100A9 cytotoxicity by the binding of S100A9 toxic species to Aβ1-40 amyloid structures. These results suggest that secretion of S100A9 during inflammation promotes the formation of amyloid plaques. By acting as a sink for toxic species, plaque formation may be the result of a protective response within the brain of AD patients, in part mediated by S100A9."
https://openalex.org/W2014017757,"In addition to many important roles for Cdk5 in brain development and synaptic function, we reported previously that Cdk5 regulates inflammatory pain signaling, partly through phosphorylation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), an important Na(+)/Ca(2+) channel expressed in primary nociceptive afferent nerves. Because TGF-β regulates inflammatory processes and its receptor is expressed in TRPV1-positive afferents, we studied the cross-talk between these two pathways in sensory neurons during experimental peripheral inflammation. We demonstrate that TGF-β1 increases transcription and protein levels of the Cdk5 co-activator p35 through ERK1/2, resulting in an increase in Cdk5 activity in rat B104 neuroblastoma cells. Additionally, TGF-β1 enhances the capsaicin-induced Ca(2+) influx in cultured primary neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Importantly, Cdk5 activity was reduced in the trigeminal ganglia and DRG of 14-day-old TGF-β1 knock-out mice, resulting in reduced Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV1. The decreased Cdk5 activity is associated with attenuated thermal hyperalgesia in TGF-β1 receptor conditional knock-out mice, where TGF-β signaling is significantly reduced in trigeminal ganglia and DRG. Collectively, our results indicate that active cross-talk between the TGF-β and Cdk5 pathways contributes to inflammatory pain signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2053682552,"DNA topoisomerases are essential enzymes that can overwind, underwind, and disentangle double-helical DNA segments to maintain the topological state of chromosomes. Nearly all bacteria utilize a unique type II topoisomerase, gyrase, which actively adds negative supercoils to chromosomes using an ATP-dependent DNA strand passage mechanism; however, the specific activities of these enzymes can vary markedly from species to species. Escherichia coli gyrase is known to favor supercoiling over decatenation (Zechiedrich, E. L., Khodursky, A. B., and Cozzarelli, N. R. (1997) Genes Dev. 11, 2580-2592), whereas the opposite has been reported for Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrase (Aubry, A., Fisher, L. M., Jarlier, V., and Cambau, E. (2006) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 348, 158-165). Here, we set out to understand the molecular basis for these differences using structural and biochemical approaches. Contrary to expectations based on phylogenetic inferences, we find that the dedicated DNA wrapping domains (the C-terminal domains) of both gyrases are highly similar, both architecturally and in their ability to introduce writhe into DNA. However, the M. tuberculosis enzyme lacks a C-terminal control element recently uncovered in E. coli gyrase (see accompanying article (Tretter, E. M., and Berger, J. M. (2012) J. Biol. Chem. 287, 18636-18644)) and turns over ATP at a much slower rate. Together, these findings demonstrate that C-terminal domain shape is not the sole regulatory determinant of gyrase activity and instead indicate that an inability to tightly couple DNA wrapping to ATP turnover is why M. tuberculosis gyrase cannot supercoil DNA to the same extent as its γ-proteobacterial counterpart. Our observations demonstrate that gyrase has been modified in multiple ways throughout evolution to fine-tune its specific catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2046114826,"We studied two pathways that involve the transfer of persulfide sulfur in humans, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation. Investigations using human cells showed that the two-domain protein MOCS3 is shared between both pathways. MOCS3 has an N-terminal adenylation domain and a C-terminal rhodanese-like domain. We showed that MOCS3 activates both MOCS2A and URM1 by adenylation and a subsequent sulfur transfer step for the formation of the thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of each protein. MOCS2A and URM1 are β-grasp fold proteins that contain a highly conserved C-terminal double glycine motif. The role of the terminal glycine of MOCS2A and URM1 was examined for the interaction and the cellular localization with MOCS3. Deletion of the C-terminal glycine of either MOCS2A or URM1 resulted in a loss of interaction with MOCS3. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fusions of the proteins were constructed, and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency was determined by the decrease in the donor lifetime. The cellular localization results showed that extension of the C terminus with an additional glycine of MOCS2A and URM1 altered the localization of MOCS3 from the cytosol to the nucleus. We studied two pathways that involve the transfer of persulfide sulfur in humans, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and tRNA thiolation. Investigations using human cells showed that the two-domain protein MOCS3 is shared between both pathways. MOCS3 has an N-terminal adenylation domain and a C-terminal rhodanese-like domain. We showed that MOCS3 activates both MOCS2A and URM1 by adenylation and a subsequent sulfur transfer step for the formation of the thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of each protein. MOCS2A and URM1 are β-grasp fold proteins that contain a highly conserved C-terminal double glycine motif. The role of the terminal glycine of MOCS2A and URM1 was examined for the interaction and the cellular localization with MOCS3. Deletion of the C-terminal glycine of either MOCS2A or URM1 resulted in a loss of interaction with MOCS3. Enhanced cyan fluorescent protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein fusions of the proteins were constructed, and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency was determined by the decrease in the donor lifetime. The cellular localization results showed that extension of the C terminus with an additional glycine of MOCS2A and URM1 altered the localization of MOCS3 from the cytosol to the nucleus."

This loss of insulin-producing capacity is termed β-cell decompensation. Our work is focused on defining the role(s) of guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) signaling pathways in regulating β-cell decompensation. We have previously demonstrated that the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric Gz protein, Gαz, impairs insulin secretion by suppressing production of cAMP. Pancreatic islets from Gαz-null mice also exhibit constitutively increased cAMP production and augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, suggesting that Gαz is a tonic inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP to cAMP. In the present study, we show that mice genetically deficient for Gαz are protected from developing glucose intolerance when fed a high fat (45 kcal%) diet. In these mice, a robust increase in β-cell proliferation is correlated with significantly increased β-cell mass. Further, an endogenous Gαz signaling pathway, through circulating prostaglandin E activating the EP3 isoform of the E prostanoid receptor, appears to be up-regulated in insulin-resistant, glucose-intolerant mice. These results, along with those of our previous work, link signaling through Gαz to both major aspects of β-cell decompensation: insufficient β-cell function and mass.

Both insulin resistance and β-cell decompensation (i.e. the failure of β-cells to maintain sufficient insulin secretion to properly regulate blood glucose levels, because of β-cell dysfunction and/or loss of β-cell mass) are essential events in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 2The abbreviations used are: T2DMtype 2 diabetes mellitusT1DMtype 1 diabetes mellitusGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretionHFDhigh fat dietGPCRG protein-coupled receptorDIOdiet-induced obesityPGEprostaglandin EIP-GTTintraperitoneal glucose tolerance testANOVAanalysis of varianceSSTsomatostatin 28G proteinGuanine nucleotide binding proteinDAB3,3′-diaminobenzidine.

The regulation of insulin secretion has been studied intensively for more than three decades, yet much is left to learn about this process. We have previously shown that the heterotrimeric Gi protein α-subunit, Gαz, modulates an endogenous signaling pathway that is inhibitory to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in a rat β-cell-derived cell line (7Kimple M.E.

The mechanism for Gαz action appears to be a tonic negative regulation of adenylate cyclase, which when lost leads to constitutively increased cyclic AMP production (7Kimple M.E. Nixon A.B. Kelly P.

This work was among the first to define a physiologic role for endogenous Gαz, a protein that was first described in 1988 (9Fong H.K. Yoshimoto K.K. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I.

The availability of Gαz-null mouse lines provided the opportunity to study the role of this G protein in normal tissue function and in disease pathophysiology. In our initial experiments with young, lean Balb/c mice, Gαz-null mice secreted more insulin in response to glucose and had more rapid glucose clearance (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as might be predicted from the loss of an inhibitor of GSIS. This effect was cell autonomous, because islets isolated from Gαz-null mice had an increased response to stimulatory glucose (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The in vivo and in vitro phenotypes of Gαz-null islets fit with the loss of a negative regulator of cAMP production, because cAMP is a ubiquitous second messenger involved in the glucose-dependent potentiation of GSIS. Taken together, these results suggested that deletion or suppression of Gαz might be protective against the development of β-cell dysfunction. C57Bl/6 mice are susceptible to the development of obesity and metabolic derangements after high fat diet (HFD) feeding, resulting in the development of glucose intolerance (13Winzell M.S. Magnusson C. Ahrén B. Temporal and dietary fat content-dependent islet adaptation to high-fat feeding-induced glucose intolerance in mice.Metab. Clin. Exp. 2007; 56: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas Balb/c mice are less susceptible. Because our prior work on Gαz-null mice was performed in the Balb/c background, we utilized the Gαz-null mice in a C57Bl/6 background for the current studies (14Kelleher K.L. Matthaei K.I. Hendry I.A. Targeted disruption of the mouse Gz-α gene. A role for Gz in platelet function?.Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Gαz-null C57Bl/6 mice were challenged with HFD feeding for up to 30 weeks and then phenotyped for insulin and glucose tolerance. HFD-fed Gαz-null mice were completely protected from fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, even though they were equally insulin resistant as wild-type HFD-fed mice. This impact on glucose tolerance was largely independent of protection of β-cell function but was instead associated with a dramatic and somewhat unexpected impact of Gαz loss on β-cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67 immunofluorescence of fixed pancreas sections. This increased proliferation correlated positively with increased islet volume and β-cell mass. Selective G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists were utilized to delineate the signaling pathway(s) linked specifically to Gαz. Similar to our previous work with a rat β-cell line (7Kimple M.E. Nixon A.B. Kelly P. Bailey C.L. Young K.H. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. A role for Gz in pancreatic islet β-cell biology.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31708-31713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in C57Bl/6 islets we confirmed a role for the E prostanoid receptor in transmitting signals to Gαz. Further, we suggest a link between the pathophysiology of glucose intolerance and a constitutively activated prostaglandin E2 signaling pathway in the β-cell, which is relieved in the absence of Gαz protein. The results of this study, along with those of our previous works (7Kimple M.E. Nixon A.B. Kelly P. Bailey C.L. Young K.H. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. A role for Gz in pancreatic islet β-cell biology.J.

C57Bl/6 mice containing a genomic insertion of a pGKneor cassette 160 base pairs downstream of the translation start site of the Gαz gene (gene symbol: gnaz) were developed by the Ian Hendry lab at Australian National University and shown to be completely deficient in Gαz protein expression as compared with wild-type controls in numerous tissues (15Hendry I.A.

Straws containing frozen sperm from confirmed Gαz-null C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from the Australian National University Phenomics Facility (Canberra, Australia) (14Kelleher K.L. Matthaei K.I.

The C57Bl/6 Gαz-null line was regenerated at Duke University using in vitro fertilization and intrauterine implantation into wild-type C57Bl/6 females (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Adult mice were placed into breeding triads on a 12-h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to breeder chow (5058 PicoLab Mouse Diet 20; LabDiet, Brentwood, MO). Gαz-null and wild-type control mice were generated by heterozygous matings to produce littermate pairs. Upon weaning, the male mice were housed five or fewer per cage with ad libitum access to low fat control chow (5053 PicoLab Rodent Diet 20, LabDiet). Before sexual maturity, the mice were placed by pairs of the same genotype into a new cage. At 8 (pilot study) or 11 weeks of age (full study), the chow was changed to a diet containing 45 kcal% fat (D12451; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) or the appropriate low fat control diet (D12450B; Research Diets; 10 kcal% fat). Food was weighed weekly during the pilot study and replaced weekly for both the pilot and full study. Experimental parameters recorded were: initial glucose tolerance, weight change, final insulin tolerance, final glucose tolerance, final adiposity, and final pancreas weight (wet). Adiposity was determined from dual emission x-ray absorptiometry scanning and/or subgonadal fat pad weight (wet). Dual emission x-ray absorptiometry scans were performed and analyzed on ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized mice using a Lunar PIXImus II and associated software (GE Healthcare Lunar, Madison, WI). Gonadal fat pad weights were either recorded as the sum of both fat pads combined or just a single fat pad; therefore, in each instance, the weights were normalized to those of the mean of the wild-type control diet-fed mice to obtain meaningful comparisons for the whole set. Not all parameters were recorded for all mice. The animals were handled in accordance with the principles and guidelines established by the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee. Guinea pig anti-insulin (1:500), rabbit anti-glucagon (1:300), mouse anti-Ki67 (1:100), antibody diluent, citrate pH 6 target retrieval solution, Protein Block, and 10× wash buffer were purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Highly cross-absorbed Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG, Alexa Fluor® 680 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor® 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG, ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI, and sterile d-glucose in PBS were from Invitrogen. Insulin (Humulin® R) and sterile insulin diluent were from Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Superfrost® Plus microscope slides were from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH), and fluorescence quality 1.5-mm coverslips were from Corning Life Sciences (Lowell, MA). The rat/mouse insulin ELISA kit was from Crystal Chem Inc. (Downers Grove, IL). The prostaglandin E (PGE) metabolite kit was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). The cAMP Biotrak® enzyme immunoassay kit was from GE Healthcare. CGS-12066A, BW-72386, sulprostone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, pertussis toxin from Bordetella pertussis (buffered aqueous glycerol solution), and Cellytic® M cell lysis buffer were from Sigma-Aldrich. Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Sciences (Indianapolis, IN). The BCA protein assay was from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Indianapolis, IN). The mice were fasted for 4–6 h, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IP-GTTs) were performed before the administration of the high fat or control diet (11 weeks of age) and after 21–25 weeks on the high fat or control diet (32–36 weeks of age). Glucose readings were taken from tail blood using an Ascensia Breeze 2 meter (Bayer Diabetes Care, Tarrytown, NY) before glucose injection (t = 0) and 25, 60, 120, and 180 min after glucose injection. The glucose readings were averaged within genotypes at each time point, giving the means ± S.E. (n = 17–25 mice for each group). During the IP-GTTs, blood samples were collected at 0 and 10 min into EDTA-coated tubes to generate plasma samples for insulin ELISA conducted as previously described (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One to three replicates of each plasma sample were performed depending on the total sample volume available; the insulin values for all of the replicates of a single sample were averaged, and the averages for all mice of the same treatment group were used to calculate the means ± S.E. PGE metabolite levels were measured in plasma samples collected at t = 0 of the IP-GTTs using a specific ELISA kit and manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemical). Derivatized samples were diluted 1:50 into assay buffer to obtain readings in the linear range of the assay. The samples were run in duplicate, the PGE metabolite values were averaged, and the averages for all mice of the same treatment group were used to calculate the means ± S.E. Insulin tolerance tests were performed essentially as described for the IP-GTTs, but instead of injecting glucose, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.75 units/kg regular insulin in sterile insulin diluent. Glucose readings were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 90 min postinjection. Insulin tolerance tests were performed at least 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the IP-GTTs. The results for each mouse were averaged to give as close a picture of insulin tolerance at the time of the IP-GTT as possible. These averaged glucose readings were averaged within groups at each time point, giving the means ± S.E. Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated essentially as previously described (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine islet volume, isolated islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 with 8.4 mm glucose and penicillin/streptomycin to recover from the isolation procedure. Islets were swirled to the middle of the culture dish for imaging, the image calibrated by taking a picture of a ruler, and the diameter of every islet in the culture was measured to calculate the islet volume. To determine islet protein content, islets were cultured overnight as described. The entire islet culture was hand-picked into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 1 ml of sterile PBS in batches of 50–100/tube. The islets were pelleted two times by pulsing to 10,000 × g, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and resuspended in Cellytic® M lysis reagent containing protease inhibitors. The protein content was determined by BCA assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. GSIS assays and cAMP production assays were performed essentially as previously described (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). With both GSIS and cAMP production, the islets were cultured overnight in RPMI medium containing submaximal stimulatory glucose (8.4 mm for insulin secretion and 11.1 mm for cAMP). On the day of the assays, the islets were washed once with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 1.7 mm glucose and then preincubated for 45 min in the same buffer before being transferred to the desired stimulatory buffer for 45 min. cAMP production assays were conducted in the presence of 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine to block cAMP degradation. The cAMP production for each sample was normalized to its protein content using BCA assay. Insulin secreted into the cAMP stimulation medium was also measured and normalized to protein content. For GSIS assays, the insulin secreted into the medium was normalized to the total insulin content. For each GSIS and cAMP assay, the normalized technical replicates were averaged, and the averages from all experiments were used to calculate the standard error. Pancreata were dissected, fixed, and sectioned as previously described, with minor modifications (7Kimple M.E. Nixon A.B. Kelly P. Bailey C.L. Young K.H. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. A role for Gz in pancreatic islet β-cell biology.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31708-31713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence experiments, the slides were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval. The slides were then washed and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. For fluorescence detection, a primary antibody mix (anti-insulin, anti-glucagon, and anti-Ki67) was added to the slide after blocking, covered, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed extensively and then incubated with secondary antibodies at 1:4000 for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan2 fluorescence microscope with a Qimaging Exi camera driven by Openlab software. Each channel was imaged separately, and the final images were overlaid in Photoshop. For insulin immunostaining, 5-micron sections 100 microns apart were stained using the EnVisionTM diaminobenzidine (DAB) reagents according to manufacturer's protocol (Dako), along with a 30-min room temperature incubation of 1:500 guinea pig anti-insulin primary antibody. The slides were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin, and six to eight independent sections from two or three mice of each group were processed. The slides were imaged using the Qimaging camera on color settings using a 1.25× lens. β-Cell fractional area was calculated by processing the resulting RGB images in open source National Institutes of Health ImageJ/64 software using shading correction and the H DAB color deconvolution vector. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v. 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). A t test or two-way ANOVA was used to determine the p value as indicated in the figure legends. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Male wild-type and Gαz-null C57Bl/6 mice were fed either a control diet containing 10% of calories as fat, or a diet composed of 45% of calories as fat (HFD). Male C57Bl/6 mice are known to respond to HFD feeding by becoming obese and insulin-resistant and developing glucose intolerance (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Gαz negatively regulates insulin secretion and glucose clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4560-4567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A pilot DIO study was conducted first with three groups of 8-week-old mice (wild type: control diet, n = 11; wild type: HFD, n = 11; Gαz-null: HFD, n = 12) to determine whether 1) there was a significant difference in food intake and/or weight gain based on genotype and 2) to design appropriate parameters for the full study. The results of this pilot study indicated that both the wild-type and Gαz-null mice became obese when fed on HFD compared with the wild-type control diet groups, with the Gαz-null HFD-fed mice exhibiting a greater initial weight gain that ultimately plateaued at the same level as the wild-type HFD mice (supplemental Fig. S1A). Of note, the Gαz-null HFD mice ate significantly more as normalized to body weight than either of the other two groups at week 1 and tended to eat more until week 6 of the pilot study, at which point there was no difference between the food eaten (kcal/g body weight; supplemental Fig. S1B). This increased food intake seemed to explain the increased initial rate of weight gain of the Gαz-null mice and suggested possible changes to the experimental protocol. Specifically, the Gαz-null mice are known to be runted because of a failure to thrive phenotype, with catch-up growth postweaning (15Hendry I.A. Kelleher K.L. Bartlett S.E. Leck K.J. Reynolds A.J. Heydon K. Mellick A. Megirian D. Matthaei K.I. Hypertolerance to morphine in G(z α)-deficient mice.Brain Res. 2000; 870: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the increased initial food intake of the Gαz-null mice was a compensation for a decreased body weight during a period where the mouse is still developing. Thus, for the full experimental set, 17–25 mice of each genotype were placed on the control or HFD at 11 weeks of age, when the Gαz-null mice are closer in weight to their wild-type littermates and are essentially fully developed (13Winzell M.S.

Exp. 2007; 56: 122-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Gαz-null mice at 11 weeks of age were still somewhat lighter than their wild-type littermates (24.14 ± 0.096 (wild type, n = 49) versus 21.64 ± 0.083 (Gαz-null, n = 34); p < 0.001), although dual emission x-ray absorptiometry scanning revealed no significant differences in their initial body composition (n = 4 mice of each genotype; p = 0.2073 (data not shown and Ref. 8Kimple M.E.

There were also no significant differences in the glucose tolerance of wild-type and Gαz-null C57Bl/6 mice at a dose of 1 g/kg glucose (Fig. 1A), although the glucose tolerance of the Gαz-null mice trended toward a lower area under the curve, consistent with our previous observations using 2 g/kg glucose in Balb/c mice (8Kimple M.E.

The lack of difference in glucose tolerance was also reflected in the lack of significant differences between the plasma insulin levels of the wild-type and Gαz-null mice at t = 0 or t = 10 min; both genotypes had similar and significant increases in plasma insulin at t = 10 min (Fig. 1B). After being placed on the appropriate diet at 11 weeks of age, the HFD-fed mice gained significantly more weight than the control diet-fed mice, and the weight gain did not vary by genotype (Fig. 1C). The insulin tolerance of obese HFD-fed mice, as recorded as the average insulin tolerance before and after the IP-GTT, was significantly worse than the control diet-fed mice and did not differ by genotype (Fig. 1D). This confirms that Gαz loss does not induce insulin resistance, which was not surprising based on our previous work (8Kimple M.E. Joseph J.W. Bailey C.L. Fueger P.T. Hendry I.A. Newgard C.B.

Furthermore, the adiposity of the Gαz-null mice did not differ from that of the wild-type mice in either treatment group, although gonadal fat pad mass measurements revealed that the HFD-fed mice had significantly increased adiposity as compared with the appropriate control mice (Fig. 1E). IP-GTTs (1 g/kg glucose) were performed 21–25 weeks after beginning the DIO study, when the mice were 32–36 weeks of age. As expected, HFD-fed wild-type C57Bl/6 mice exhibited impaired glucose clearance compared with wild-type mice fed on the control diet (Fig. 2A). The area under the curve for blood glucose was significantly elevated in HFD-fed wild-type mice versus control diet-fed mice, which in turn was significantly higher than that observed in the 11-week-old mice (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2009747800,"Phase variable restriction-modification (R-M) systems have been identified in a range of pathogenic bacteria. In some it has been demonstrated that the random switching of the mod (DNA methyltransferase) gene mediates the coordinated expression of multiple genes and constitutes a phasevarion (phase variable regulon). ModA of Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae contain a highly variable, DNA recognition domain (DRD) that defines the target sequence that is modified by methylation and is used to define modA alleles. 18 distinct modA alleles have been identified in H. influenzae and the pathogenic Neisseria. To determine the origin of DRD variability, the 18 modA DRDs were used to search the available databases for similar sequences. Significant matches were identified between several modA alleles and mod gene from distinct bacterial species, indicating one source of the DRD variability was via horizontal gene transfer. Comparison of DRD sequences revealed significant mosaicism, indicating exchange between the Neisseria and H. influenzae modA alleles. Regions of high inter- and intra-allele similarity indicate that some modA alleles had undergone recombination more frequently than others, generating further diversity. Furthermore, the DRD from some modA alleles, such as modA12, have been transferred en bloc to replace the DRD from different modA alleles."
https://openalex.org/W2027481001,"One of the earliest events in neural crest development takes place at the neural plate border and consists in the induction of Pax3 expression by posteriorizing Wnt·β-catenin signaling. The molecular mechanism of this regulation is not well understood, but several observations suggest a role for posteriorizing Cdx transcription factors (Cdx1/2/4) in this process. Cdx genes are known as integrators of posteriorizing signals from Wnt, retinoic acid, and FGF pathways. In this work, we report that Wnt-mediated regulation of murine Pax3 expression is indirect and involves Cdx proteins as intermediates. We show that Pax3 transcripts co-localize with Cdx proteins in the posterior neurectoderm and that neural Pax3 expression is reduced in Cdx1-null embryos. Using Wnt3a-treated P19 cells and neural crest-derived Neuro2a cells, we demonstrate that Pax3 expression is induced by the Wnt-Cdx pathway. Co-transfection analyses, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transgenic studies further indicate that Cdx proteins operate via direct binding to an evolutionarily conserved neural crest enhancer of the Pax3 proximal promoter. Taken together, these results suggest a novel neural function for Cdx proteins within the gene regulatory network controlling neural crest development."
https://openalex.org/W2143209732,"Understanding noncanonical mechanisms of platelet activation represents an important challenge for the identification of novel therapeutic targets in bleeding disorders, thrombosis, and cancer. We previously reported that galectin-1 (Gal-1), a β-galactoside-binding protein, triggers platelet activation in vitro. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this function and the physiological relevance of endogenous Gal-1 in hemostasis. Mass spectrometry analysis, as well as studies using blocking antibodies against the anti-αIIb subunit of αIIbβ3 integrin or platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia syndrome (αIIbβ3 deficiency), identified this integrin as a functional Gal-1 receptor in platelets. Binding of Gal-1 to platelets triggered the phosphorylation of β3-integrin, Syk, MAPKs, PI3K, PLCγ2, thromboxane (TXA2) release, and Ca2+ mobilization. Not only soluble but also immobilized Gal-1 promoted platelet activation. Gal-1-deficient (Lgals1–/–) mice showed increased bleeding time (P< 0.0002, knockout vs. wild type), which was not associated with an abnormal platelet count. Lgals1–/– platelets exhibited normal aggregation to PAR4, ADP, arachidonic acid, or collagen but abnormal ATP release at low collagen concentrations. Impaired spreading on fibrinogen and clot retraction with normal levels of αIIbβ3 was also observed in Lgals1–/– platelets, indicating a failure in the “outside-in” signaling through this integrin. This study identifies a noncanonical mechanism, based on galectin-integrin interactions, for regulating platelet activation.—Romaniuk, M. A., Croci, D. O., Lapponi, M. J., Tribulatti, M.

https://openalex.org/W2029696421,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing F4 fimbria is the major pathogenic bacteria causing diarrhoea in neonatal and post-weaning piglets. Previous studies have revealed that the susceptibility to ETEC F4ab/F4ac is an autosomal Mendelian dominant trait and the loci controlling the F4ab/F4ac receptor are located on SSC13q41, between markers SW207 and S0283. To pinpoint these loci and further validate previous findings, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a two generation family-based population, consisting of 301 piglets with phenotypes of susceptibility to ETEC F4ab/F4ac by the vitro adhesion test. The DNA of all piglets and their parents was genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip, and 50,972 and 50,483 SNPs were available for F4ab and F4ac susceptibility, respectively, in the association analysis after quality control. In summary, 28 and 18 significant SNPs (p<0.05) were detected associated with F4ab and F4ac susceptibility respectively at genome-wide significance level. From these significant findings, two novel candidate genes, HEG1 and ITGB5, were firstly identified as the most promising genes underlying F4ab/F4ac susceptibility in swine according to their functions and positions. Our findings herein provide a novel evidence for unravelling genetic mechanism of diarrhoea risk in piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2062622917,"GLUCOCORTICOIDS are steroid hormones that strongly influence intermediary carbohydrate metabolism by increasing the transcription rate of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, and suppress the immune system through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The liver X receptors (LXRs), on the other hand, bind to cholesterol metabolites, heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and regulate the cholesterol turnover, the hepatic glucose metabolism by decreasing the expression of G6Pase, and repress a set of inflammatory genes in immune cells. Since the actions of these receptors overlap with each other, we evaluated the crosstalk between the GR- and LXR-mediated signaling systems. Transient transfection-based reporter assays and gene silencing methods using siRNAs for LXRs showed that overexpression/ligand (GW3965) activation of LXRs/RXRs repressed GR-stimulated transactivation of certain glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven promoters in a gene-specific fashion. Activation of LXRs by GW3965 attenuated dexamethasone-stimulated elevation of circulating glucose in rats. It also suppressed dexamethasone-induced mRNA expression of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in rats, mice and human hepatoma HepG2 cells, whereas endogenous, unliganded LXRs were required for dexamethasone-induced mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. In microarray transcriptomic analysis of rat liver, GW3965 differentially regulated glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional activity of about 15% of endogenous glucocorticoid-responsive genes. To examine the mechanism through which activated LXRs attenuated GR transcriptional activity, we examined LXRα/RXRα binding to GREs. Endogenous LXRα/RXRα bound GREs and inhibited GR binding to these DNA sequences both in in vitro and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, while their recombinant proteins did so on classic or G6Pase GREs in gel mobility shift assays. We propose that administration of LXR agonists may be beneficial in glucocorticoid treatment- or stress-associated dysmetabolic states by directly and gene-specifically attenuating the transcriptional activity of the GR on glucose and/or lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2093342636,"Molecular mechanisms underlying Ca(2+) regulation by perinuclear endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) cisternae in cardiomyocytes remain obscure. To investigate the mechanisms of changes in cardiac calsequestrin (CSQ2) trafficking on perinuclear Ca(2+) signaling, we manipulated the subcellular distribution of CSQ2 by overexpression of CSQ2-DsRed, which specifically accumulates in the perinuclear rough ER. Adult ventricular myocytes were infected with adenoviruses expressing CSQ2-DsRed, CSQ2-WT, or empty vector. We found that perinuclear enriched CSQ2-DsRed, but not normally distributed CSQ2-WT, enhanced nuclear Ca(2+) transients more potently than cytosolic Ca(2+) transients. Overexpression of CSQ2-DsRed produced more actively propagating Ca(2+) waves from perinuclear regions than did CSQ2-WT. Activities of the SR/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase and ryanodine receptor type 2, but not inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2, were required for the generation of these perinuclear initiated Ca(2+) waves. In addition, CSQ2-DsRed was more potent than CSQ2-WT in inducing cellular hypertrophy in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrate for the first time that CSQ2 retention in the rough ER/perinuclear region promotes perinuclear Ca(2+) signaling and predisposes to ryanodine receptor type 2-mediated Ca(2+) waves from CSQ2-enriched perinuclear compartments and myocyte hypotrophy. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of CSQ2 in Ca(2+) homeostasis, suggesting that rough ER-localized Ca(2+) stores can operate independently in raising levels of cytosolic/nucleoplasmic Ca(2+) as a source of Ca(2+) for Ca(2+)-dependent signaling in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2156276156,"Trees in the beech or oak family (Fagaceae) have a mutualistic relationship with scatter-hoarding rodents. Rodents obtain nutrients and energy by consuming seeds, while providing seed dispersal for the tree by allowing some cached seeds to germinate. Seed predation and caching behavior of rodents is primarily affected by seed size, mechanical protection, macronutrient content, and chemical antifeedants. To enhance seed dispersal, trees must optimize trade-offs in investment between macronutrients and antifeedants. Here, we examine this important chemical balance in the seeds of tropical stone oak species with two substantially different fruit morphologies. These two distinct fruit morphologies in Lithocarpus differ in the degree of mechanical protection of the seed. For ‘acorn’ fruit, a thin exocarp forms a shell around the seed while for ‘enclosed receptacle’ (ER) fruit, the seed is embedded in a woody receptacle. We compared the chemical composition of numerous macronutrient and antifeedant in seeds from several Lithocarpus species, focusing on two pairs of sympatric species with different fruit morphologies. We found that macronutrients, particularly total non-structural carbohydrate, was more concentrated in seeds of ER fruits while antifeedants, primarily fibers, were more concentrated in seeds of acorn fruits. The trade-off in these two major chemical components was more evident between the two sympatric lowland species than between two highland species. Surprisingly, no significant difference in overall tannin concentrations in the seeds was observed between the two fruit morphologies. Instead, the major trade-off between macronutrients and antifeedants involved indigestible fibers. Future studies of this complex mutualism should carefully consider the role of indigestible fibers in the foraging behavior of scatter-hoarding rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2070256252,"The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been linked to Kaposi sarcoma, body cavity-based lymphoma, and Castleman disease. vIRF-3 is a KSHV latent gene that is critical for proliferation of KSHV-positive lymphoid cells. Furthermore, vIRF-3 contributes to KSHV-associated pathogenesis by stimulating c-Myc transcription activity. Here we show that vIRF-3 can associate with Skp2, a key component of the SCF(skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex. Skp2 is a transcriptional co-factor for c-Myc that was shown to regulate the stability of c-Myc protein as well as c-Myc-dependent transcription. In this study, we show that vIRF-3 binds to the F-box of Skp2 and recruits it to c-Myc-regulated promoters to activate c-Myc-dependent transcription. Additionally, cells overexpressing vIRF-3 exhibit higher levels of c-Myc ubiquitylation, suggesting that ubiquitylation is necessary for c-Myc-mediated transcription. Moreover, vIRF-3 can stabilize the c-Myc protein by increasing its half-life. Collectively, these results indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively manipulate c-Myc stability and function and thus contribute to c-Myc-induced KSHV-associated lymphomagenesis."

We investigated what regulates this process utilizing a slow-release NO donor (NOC-18) and studying changes in cellular SNO-GAPDH levels during and after NO exposure. Culturing macrophage-like cells with NOC-18 during cytokine activation caused buildup of heme-free (apo) iNOS and SNO-GAPDH. Upon NOC-18 removal, the cells quickly recovered their heme insertion capacity in association with rapid SNO-GAPDH denitrosation, implying that these processes are linked. We then altered cell expression of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) or S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, both of which can function as a protein denitrosylase. Trx1 knockdown increased SNO-GAPDH levels in cells, made heme insertion hypersensitive to NO, and increased the recovery time, whereas Trx1 overexpression greatly diminished SNO-GAPDH buildup and protected heme insertion from NO inhibition. In contrast, knockdown of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase expression had little effect on these parameters. Experiments utilizing C152S GAPDH confirmed that the NO effects are all linked to S-nitrosation of GAPDH at Cys-152. We conclude (i) that NO inhibition of heme insertion and its recovery can be rapid and dynamic processes and are inversely linked to the S-nitrosation of GAPDH and (ii) that the NO sensitivity of heme insertion can vary depending on the Trx1 expression level due to Trx1 acting as an SNO-GAPDH denitrosylase.

To address this question, we investigated how a cell's capacity to drive heme insertion into apo-iNOS is related to the buildup and disappearance of SNO-GAPDH in cells during and after NO exposure and examined how altering the Trx1 or GSNOR expression levels would impact these processes. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. The sequences used to silence Trx1 (GAGACAAGCTTGTCGTGGTGGACTT, CATTCCCTCTGTGACAAGTATTCCA, and CAGGATGTTGCTGCAGACTGTGAAG) and GSNOR (CUGGAAUUGUGGAAAGUGUtt and ACACUUUCCACAAUUCCAGca) and their respective negative controls were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies were purchased from the indicated companies: mouse anti-GAPDH (Fitzgerald Industries International, Acton, MA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Trx1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA), anti-GSNOR (Proteintech Group, Inc., Chicago, IL), and mouse anti-iNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories). NOC-18 was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). IFN-γ was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). HA-tagged wild-type and C152S GAPDH genes in the pRK5 expression vector were gifts from Dr. Solomon H. Snyder (John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as described (29.Panda K. Chawla-Sarkar M. Santos C. Koeck T. Erzurum S.C. Parkinson J.F. Stuehr D.J.

Cells were activated by 25 μg/ml LPS and 10 units/ml IFN-γ for 17 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. For generation of apo-iNOS, 250 μm NOC-18 was included during the induction period. After induction, cells were quickly washed with PBS and either harvested directly (see below) or further cultured for various times with fresh medium containing NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 3 mm) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). In the dose-response experiments, cells were induced for iNOS expression in the presence 3 mm l-NAME and various NOC-18 concentrations as indicated. To harvest, cells were quickly washed with PBS and immediately frozen on a sheet of dry ice for 5 min. Later, cells were thawed on ice, and supernatants were prepared as described (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Silencing of Trx1 or GSNOR in RAW 264.7 cells was done by transfecting 5 nm Trx1 or GSNOR and the respective control siRNA with siPORT transfection reagent (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's directions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were induced with LPS, IFN-γ, and l-NAME. Human Trx1 cDNA (IMAGE Consortium) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cloned into the pLVX-ZS-IRES vector (Clontech). Cloned Trx1 was used to generate lentivirus with HEK cells as approved by the Lerner Research Institute Institutional Review Board. RAW 264.7 cells were infected with lentivirus containing the Trx1 gene, and expression was monitored by Western blotting. The biotin switch assay was performed as described (30.Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. The biotin switch method for the detection of S-nitrosylated proteins.Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: pl1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the pulldowns from NeutrAvidinTM resin (Pierce) were probed by Western blotting. Cell supernatants were processed as described (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J.

All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the average of independent experiments is shown. Activities in cell supernatants were determined in a spectrophotometer by monitoring the disappearance of NADH at 340 nm (31.Molina y Vedia L. McDonald B. Reep B. Brüne B. Di Silvio M. Billiar T.R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24929-24932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We began by investigating how cellular heme insertion would recover from NO-mediated inhibition once we removed the NO source, which, in our case, was the slow-release NO donor NOC-18, with a half-life in solution of 20 h (32.Mooradian D.L. Hutsell T.C. Keefer L.K. Nitric oxide (NO) donor molecules: effect of NO release rate on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro.J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 25: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We induced RAW 264.7 cells to express apo-iNOS by treating them with cytokines for 17 h in the presence of 250 μm NOC-18, which was shown previously to block heme insertion into iNOS (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After this period, the NOC-18-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium that was free of NOC-18 but contained 3 mm l-NAME to prevent any NO production from iNOS, and we monitored the cells' capacity to insert endogenous heme into the apo-iNOS versus time. As shown in Fig. 1A, the presence of NOC-18 during the induction period did not diminish iNOS protein expression but did prevent heme incorporation into iNOS (time = 0 min) (Fig. 1, A and C). Once the NO donor was removed, the cells quickly initiated heme insertion into apo-iNOS as judged by three independent measures (gain in P450 heme content, iNOS NO synthesis activity, and iNOS in-gel heme staining) (Fig. 1, A–C). Most of the heme insertion took place within the first 30 min of the recovery period. By 40–60 min, the cells had restored an amount of heme-replete iNOS that was comparable with the amount contained in cells that had been similarly induced in the absence of the NO donor. This implies that by 60 min of recovery, the NOC-18-treated cells had inserted heme into most or all of their apo-iNOS. Excluding l-NAME during the recovery phase resulted in the cells achieving a lower extent of heme insertion (supplemental Fig. S1), probably due to this condition allowing NO generation from newly formed heme-replete iNOS, which can actively inhibit subsequent heme insertion into apo-iNOS (16.Waheed S.M.

S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), and previously, we showed that NO inhibits cellular heme insertion through a mechanism involving SNO-GAPDH formation (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined if the recovery of heme insertion after NOC-18 removal would be related to changes in the SNO-GAPDH level in the cells. We confirmed that the NOC-18 treatment increased the buildup of SNO-GAPDH (supplemental Fig. S2) (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J.

S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). After removing NOC-18 from the cultures, we observed that SNO-GAPDH was rapidly denitrosated such that its level decreased by 80% within 20 min (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2). Somewhat less SNO-GAPDH denitrosation occurred in recovering cultures in the absence of l-NAME (supplemental Fig. S2), consistent with some NO being made by iNOS during the recovery period. Denitrosation of SNO-GAPDH occurred without any change in the total GAPDH protein level (supplemental Fig. S2) and was inversely correlated with a 10-fold gain in the cellular GAPDH enzymatic activity (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that a majority of the cellular GAPDH had become S-nitrosated during the NOC-18 treatment, primarily at the catalytically essential Cys-152 residue (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Snyder S.H. Sawa A. S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The rate of SNO-GAPDH denitrosation correlated well with the recovery of heme insertion capacity during the same time period (Fig. 1, compare D with A–C). Thus, NO inhibition of cellular heme insertion is accompanied by significant SNO-GAPDH formation (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and recovery of cellular heme insertion correlates with SNO-GAPDH denitrosation. If SNO-GAPDH denitrosation is required for cells to recover their heme insertion, then cellular denitrosylases might be able to modulate the NO sensitivity. Trx1 functions as a protein denitrosylase enzyme in several cell models (8.Sengupta R. Holmgren A. The role of thioredoxin in the regulation of cellular processes by S-nitrosylation.Biochim. Biophys.

We therefore examined how modulating the Trx1 expression level would impact heme insertion into apo-iNOS, hypothesizing that lower Trx1 expression would sensitize the process to NO inhibition, whereas higher Trx1 expression would be protective and increase resistance to NO. In our experiments, we manipulated cellular Trx1 expression levels and then induced iNOS expression in the cells during exposure to different concentrations of NOC-18 for 17 h. We measured iNOS protein expression and heme content immediately following NOC-18 exposure or at various times during a recovery period that started after removing NOC-18. As shown in Fig. 2A, Trx1 knockdown using siRNA reduced the level of Trx1 expression without affecting the expression of iNOS or GAPDH proteins. However, it increased SNO-GAPDH levels in both cytokine-induced and non-induced cells cultured in the absence of NOC-18 (supplemental Fig. S3A). The Trx1 knockdown sensitized cellular heme insertion to NO inhibition, as judged by its shifting the NOC-18 dose-response curve toward the left compared with control cells that were treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2B). It also greatly diminished the cells' ability to recover their heme insertion capacity after NOC-18 removal (Fig. 2C), and the poor recovery was associated with a defect in SNO-GAPDH denitrosation during the recovery period (Fig. 2D). We next examined the effect of Trx1 overexpression using lentiviral transduction. The transfected cells had increased Trx1 protein expression and maintained normal iNOS protein expression (Fig. 3A). The sensitivity of their heme insertion reaction to NO inhibition was shifted to the right compared with the vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This is consistent with the higher Trx1 expression protecting heme insertion from NO inhibition. To understand the mechanism, we checked if Trx1 overexpression affected the cellular SNO-GAPDH levels. Fig. 3D shows that the transfected control cells increased their SNO-GAPDH level in response to NOC-18 in a dose-dependent manner, as expected. In comparison, the Trx1-overexpressing cells had much lower levels of SNO-GAPDH buildup across the entire range of NOC-18 concentrations. Together, our results show that altering Trx1 expression is a powerful means to control the NO sensitivity of heme insertion and suggest that it is linked to an SNO-GAPDH denitrosylase activity of Trx1. It is conceivable that GSNOR could similarly function like Trx1 to limit SNO-GAPDH buildup and protect heme insertion against NO inhibition. To investigate this possibility, we examined if knockdown of GSNOR expression would impact these parameters. Knockdown of GSNOR lowered its protein expression level in the cells without altering iNOS protein expression (Fig. 4A). However, the lower GSNOR expression did not dampen recovery of iNOS heme insertion from NO inhibition and only slightly retarded the SNO-GAPDH denitrosation that occurred during the recovery period (Fig. 4, A and B). It also did not increase the sensitivity of iNOS heme insertion to NOC-18, as judged by its not shifting the NOC-18 dose curve to the left relative to the control (Fig. 4C). These results imply that GSNOR operates distinctly from Trx1 and plays, at most, a minor role in controlling SNO-GAPDH levels in our system. To confirm that reducing the SNO-GAPDH level is the mechanism that allowed Trx1 to protect heme insertion from NO, we performed similar experiments using cells that stably express C152S GAPDH, which is a variant that cannot become nitrosated at Cys-152 (33.Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y. Takahashi M. Cheah J.H. Tankou S.K. Hester L.D. Ferris C.D. Hayward S.D. Snyder S.H. Sawa A. S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In our previous study, heme insertion in these cells was resistant to NO inhibition in a 3-h NO exposure assay (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we found that insertion of endogenous heme into apo-iNOS by these cells was also resistant to the NOC-18 inhibition, particularly in the range from 0 to 225 μm (Fig. 5, A and B). This is consistent with SNO-GAPDH inhibiting heme insertion in our study and with Trx1 controlling the process by determining the buildup of SNO-GAPDH in the cells. Heme insertion is a key step in heme protein maturation. We know that NO generated by cells (or provided to cells by an NO donor) can inhibit maturation of iNOS through its causing SNO-GAPDH formation in cells, which in turn inhibits the insertion of heme into the apoenzyme (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we studied how heme insertion recovers from NO inhibition and what might regulate the process, specifically examining what controls SNO-GAPDH buildup in cells and how the SNO-GAPDH level may relate to a cell's capacity to drive heme insertion both during and after NO exposure. Cells quickly recovered their heme insertion capacity upon removal of the NO donor, with measurable heme incorporation into apo-iNOS observed as early as 5 min into the recovery. Remarkably, this took place after the cells had been exposed continuously to the NO donor for 17 h. This implies that the NO-treated cells still had enough of their endogenous heme available to allow for heme insertion to begin almost immediately. NO can also inhibit cellular heme insertion fairly quickly (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition of heme insertion by NO and the reversal of this inhibition can be a rapid and dynamic process in cells. SNO-GAPDH builds up rapidly in cells exposed to NO (18.Chakravarti R. Aulak K.S. Fox P.L. Stuehr D.J. GAPDH regulates cellular heme insertion into inducible nitric-oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18004-18009Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and here, we found that the cells could rapidly denitrosate their SNO-GAPDH once the NO source was removed. A similar time course for SNO-GAPDH denitrosation was observed in endothelial cells after removing the NO source (22.Padgett C.M. Whorton A.R. Glutathione redox cycle regulates nitric oxide-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibition.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C99-C108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, both the buildup and denitrosation of SNO-GAPDH occurred fast enough in our system to be kinetically linked to the inhibition and recovery of the cells' capacity for heme insertion. Such similarity in the kinetic profiles for the two processes is compelling evidence that NO inhibits cellular heme insertion by causing buildup of SNO-GAPDH and that SNO-GAPDH denitrosation allows heme insertion to recover. Our experiments using a cell line that stably expresses C152S GAPDH lend further support to the above concepts and confirm that Cys-152 is the critical site of NO-based modification in GAPDH (6.Kornberg M.D. Sen N. Hara M.R. Juluri K.R. Nguyen J.V. Snowman A.M. Law L. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. GAPDH mediates nitrosylation of nuclear proteins.Nat.

S-Nitrosylated GAPDH initiates apoptotic cell death by nuclear translocation following Siah1 binding.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Our results with this cell line (Fig. 5) also suggest that there is a range of NO exposure (between 0 to 200 μm NOC-18 in our case) at which inhibition of heme insertion is predominantly linked to S-nitrosation of GAPDH at Cys-152. However, at higher NO exposures (beyond 200 μm NOC-18 in our case), NO appeared to inhibit heme insertion by additional mechanisms that are independent of SNO-GAPDH. Although potentially interesting, we did not pursue these mechanisms because at the lower and more physiologic NO range, it is clear that heme insertion is predominantly inhibited by the SNO-GAPDH mechanism. Manipulating the Trx1 expression level in the cells had remarkably strong and reciprocal influences on the SNO-GAPDH buildup and on the sensitivity of heme insertion to NO. Trx1 overexpression almost eliminated SNO-GAPDH buildup and made heme insertion immune to NO within the probable physiologic range (0–200 μm NOC-18). In contrast, Trx1 knockdown caused cellular heme insertion to be NO-hypersensitive such that >80% inhibition was seen even at the lowest NOC-18 dose we tested (50 μm). This effect was also manifested in the Trx1 knockdown cells not being able to recover their heme insertion following NO exposure or to denitrosate their SNO-GAPDH. The apparent strong role for Trx1 as we have seen adds to the body of evidence that Trx1-mediated denitrosation or transnitrosation reactions can impact diverse cellular functions, including apoptosis, host immune response, and gene expression (5.Foster M.W.

On the other hand, GSNOR silencing did not affect the NO sensitivity or recovery of heme insertion into apo-iNOS. This is in accordance with a previous published study showing that GSNOR knock-out mice have similar iNOS activity compared with wild-type control mice (35.Que L.G. Liu L. Yan Y. Whitehead G.S.

In our cell culture system, Trx1 appeared to act through its denitrosylase activity, as seen before in several cell types (10.Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S.

The molecular mechanisms by which Trx1 may alter SNO-GAPDH content or cause protein denitrosation in general are still unclear (1.Benhar M. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S.

Whether Trx1 acts through a direct protein-protein interaction with SNO-GAPDH or, alternatively, acts through an intermediary protein or through a more global effect are interesting questions for further study. Most physiologic effects of NO are concentration-dependent (4.Thomas D.D. Ridnour L.A. Isenberg J.S. Flores-Santana W. Switzer C.H. Donzelli S. Hussain P. Vecoli C. Paolocci N. Ambs S. Colton C.A. Harris C.C. Roberts D.D. Wink D.A. The chemical biology of nitric oxide: implications in cellular signaling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and this is also true for how NO affects heme insertion (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We previously calculated that the concentrations of NOC-18 required to inhibit heme insertion (50–100 μm) result in NO release that approximates the NO flux (50–100 nm/min) measured in cultures of immunoactivated cells that express iNOS to generate NO (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 48: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Within this context, it is now clear that a cell's Trx1 expression level can greatly influence the NO sensitivity of its heme insertion. This is important because it implies that heme protein maturation in cells or tissues could vary broadly in their NO sensitivity, depending on the level of Trx1 expression and its inherent capacity to control buildup of SNO-GAPDH. In this way, Trx1 may help to regulate a cell's behavior during and after NO exposure. For example, a high Trx1 expression level could allow cells to maintain high levels of active heme-replete iNOS for sustained constitutive NO release, a situation that apparently exists in the lung epithelium (37.Xu W. Zheng S. Dweik R.A. Erzurum S.C. Role of epithelial nitric oxide in airway viral infection.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). During an inflammatory immune response, a cell might manipulate its Trx1 expression level to allow enough iNOS to mature and produce an NO flux sufficient to cause stasis or killing of pathogens while subsequently allowing enough SNO-GAPDH buildup to down-regulate continued high NO production that could damage host cells and tissues (38.Hara M.R. Thomas B. Cascio M.B. Bae B.I. Hester L.D. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Sawa A. Snyder S.H. Neuroprotection by pharmacologic blockade of the GAPDH death cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3887-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this way, Trx1 control of SNO-GAPDH level would be advantageous because it gives cells an additional, sensitive means to tune their iNOS activity at appropriate times during the inflammatory response. On a broader scope, we suspect that the level of Trx1 activity may also influence maturation of several other heme proteins whose heme insertion is known to be NO-sensitive, including neuronal NOS, endothelial NOS, hemoglobin, P450 cytochromes, and catalase (16.Waheed S.M. Ghosh A. Chakravarti R. Biswas A. Haque M.M. Panda K. Stuehr D.J. Nitric oxide blocks cellular heme insertion into a broad range of heme proteins.Free Radic. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1997887845,"The invasion and replication of Eimeria tenella in the chicken intestine is responsible for avian coccidiosis, a disease that has major economic impacts on poultry industries worldwide. E. tenella is transmitted to naïve animals via shed unsporulated oocysts that need contact with air and humidity to form the infectious sporulated oocysts, which contain the first invasive form of the parasite, the sporozoite. Cysteine proteases (CPs) are major virulence factors expressed by protozoa. In this study, we show that E. tenella expresses five transcriptionally regulated genes encoding one cathepsin L, one cathepsin B and three cathepsin Cs. Biot-LC-LVG-CHN₂, a cystatin derived probe, tagged eight polypeptides in unsporulated oocysts but only one in sporulated oocysts. CP-dependant activities were found against the fluorescent substrates, Z-FR-AMC and Z-LR-AMC, throughout the sporulation process. These activities corresponded to a cathepsin B-like enzyme since they were inhibited by CA-074, a specific cathepsin B inhibitor. A 3D model of the catalytic domain of the cathepsin B-like protease, based on its sequence homology with human cathepsin B, further confirmed its classification as a papain-like protease with similar characteristics to toxopain-1 from the related apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii; we have, therefore, named the E. tenella cathepsin B, eimeripain. Following stable transfection of E. tenella sporozoites with a plasmid allowing the expression of eimeripain fused to the fluorescent protein mCherry, we demonstrated that eimeripain is detected throughout sporulation and has a punctate distribution in the bodies of extra- and intracellular parasites. Furthermore, CA-074 Me, the membrane-permeable derivative of CA-074, impairs invasion of epithelial MDBK cells by E. tenella sporozoites. This study represents the first characterization of CPs expressed by a parasite from the Eimeria genus. Moreover, it emphasizes the role of CPs in transmission and dissemination of exogenous stages of apicomplexan parasites."

Endothelial cells in culture show that ET stimulates very rapid internalization of caveolae and cargo including caveolin, caveolae-targeting antibody, and itself.

It appears that endothelin can engage ET-B already highly concentrated in caveolae of endothelial cells to induce very rapid caveolae fission and endocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1976650197,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have found wide success in circuitry, photovoltaics, and other applications. In contrast, several hurdles exist in using CNTs towards applications in drug delivery. Raw, non-modified CNTs are widely known for their toxicity. As such, many have attempted to reduce CNT toxicity for intravenous drug delivery purposes by post-process surface modification. Alternatively, a novel sphere-like carbon nanocapsule (CNC) developed by the arc-discharge method holds similar electric and thermal conductivities, as well as high strength. This study investigated the systemic toxicity and biocompatibility of different non-surface modified carbon nanomaterials in mice, including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), carbon nanocapsules (CNCs), and C ₆₀ fullerene (C ₆₀). The retention of the nanomaterials and systemic effects after intravenous injections were studied.MWCNTs, SWCNTs, CNCs, and C ₆₀ were injected intravenously into FVB mice and then sacrificed for tissue section examination. Inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated with ELISA. Mice receiving injection of MWCNTs or SWCNTs at 50 µg/g b.w. died while C ₆₀ injected group survived at a 50% rate. Surprisingly, mortality rate of mice injected with CNCs was only at 10%. Tissue sections revealed that most carbon nanomaterials retained in the lung. Furthermore, serum and lung-tissue cytokine levels did not reveal any inflammatory response compared to those in mice receiving normal saline injection.Carbon nanocapsules are more biocompatible than other carbon nanomaterials and are more suitable for intravenous drug delivery. These results indicate potential biomedical use of non-surface modified carbon allotrope. Additionally, functionalization of the carbon nanocapsules could further enhance dispersion and biocompatibility for intravenous injection."
https://openalex.org/W1979640433,"A-to-I RNA editing is particularly common in coding regions of squid mRNAs. Previously, we isolated a squid editing enzyme (sqADAR2) that shows a unique structural feature when compared with other ADAR2 family members: an additional double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain (dsRBD). Alternative splicing includes or excludes this motif, generating a novel or a conventional variant termed sqADAR2a and sqADAR2b, respectively. The extra dsRBD of sqADAR2a increases its editing activity in vitro. We hypothesized that the high activity is due to an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for dsRNA. This may be important because protein-RNA interactions can be influenced by physical factors. We became particularly interested in analyzing the effects of salt on interactions between sqADAR2 and RNA because squid cells have a ∼3-fold higher ionic strength and proportionally more Cl− than vertebrate cells. To date, in vitro biochemical analyses of adenosine deamination have been conducted using vertebrate-like ionic strength buffers containing chloride as the major anion, although the vast majority of cellular anions are known to be organic. We found that squid-like salt conditions severely impair the binding affinity of conventional ADAR2s for dsRNA, leading to a decrease in nonspecific and site-specific editing activity. Inhibition of editing was mostly due to high Cl− levels and not to the high concentrations of K+, Na+, and organic anions like glutamate. Interestingly, the extra dsRBD in sqADAR2a conferred resistance to the high Cl− levels found in squid neurons. It does so by increasing the affinity of sqADAR2 for dsRNA by 30- or 100-fold in vertebrate-like or squid-like conditions, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2011657093,"AGAPs are a subtype of Arf GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) with 11 members in humans. In addition to the Arf GAP domain, the proteins contain a G-protein-like domain (GLD) with homology to Ras superfamily proteins and a PH domain. AGAPs bind to clathrin adaptors, function in post Golgi membrane traffic, and have been implicated in glioblastoma. The regulation of AGAPs is largely unexplored. Other enzymes containing GTP binding domains are regulated by nucleotide binding. However, nucleotide binding to AGAPs has not been detected. Here, we found that neither nucleotides nor deleting the GLD of AGAP1 affected catalysis, which led us to hypothesize that the GLD is a protein binding site that regulates GAP activity. Two-hybrid screens identified RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as potential binding partners. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that AGAP1 and AGAP2 can bind to RhoA. Binding was mediated by the C terminus of RhoA and was independent of nucleotide. RhoA and the C-terminal peptide from RhoA increased GAP activity specifically for the substrate Arf1. In contrast, a C-terminal peptide from Cdc42 neither bound nor activated AGAP1. Based on these results, we propose that AGAPs are allosterically regulated through protein binding to the GLD domain."
https://openalex.org/W2063418731,"The Levant is an important migration bridge, harboring border-zones between Afrotropical and palearctic species. Accordingly, Chameleo chameleon, a common species throughout the Mediterranean basin, is morphologically divided in the southern Levant (Israel) into two subspecies, Chamaeleo chamaeleon recticrista (CCR) and C. c. musae (CCM). CCR mostly inhabits the Mediterranean climate (northern Israel), while CCM inhabits the sands of the north-western Negev Desert (southern Israel). AFLP analysis of 94 geographically well dispersed specimens indicated moderate genetic differentiation (PhiPT = 0.097), consistent with the classical division into the two subspecies, CCR and CCM. In contrast, sequence analysis of a 637 bp coding mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment revealed two distinct phylogenetic clusters which were not consistent with the morphological division: one mtDNA cluster consisted of CCR specimens collected in regions northern of the Jezreel Valley and another mtDNA cluster harboring specimens pertaining to both the CCR and CCM subspecies but collected southern of the Jezreel Valley. AMOVA indicated clear mtDNA differentiation between specimens collected northern and southern to the Jezreel Valley (PhiPT = 0.79), which was further supported by a very low coalescent-based estimate of effective migration rates. Whole chameleon mtDNA sequencing (∼17,400 bp) generated from 11 well dispersed geographic locations revealed 325 mutations sharply differentiating the two mtDNA clusters, suggesting a long allopatric history further supported by BEAST. This separation correlated temporally with the existence of an at least 1 million year old marine barrier at the Jezreel Valley exactly where the mtDNA clusters meet. We discuss possible involvement of gender-dependent life history differences in maintaining such mtDNA genetic differentiation and suggest that it reflects (ancient) local adaptation to mitochondrial-related traits."
https://openalex.org/W2074807037,"NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is essential for the functioning of microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450) monooxygenases and heme oxygenases. The biological roles of the POR-dependent enzymes in the intestine have not been defined, despite the wealth of knowledge on the biochemical properties of the various oxygenases. In this study, cDNA microarray analysis revealed significant changes in gene expression in enterocytes isolated from the small intestine of intestinal epithelium-specific Por knock-out (named IE-Cpr-null) mice compared with that observed in wild-type (WT) littermates. Gene ontology analyses revealed significant changes in terms related to P450s, transporters, cholesterol biosynthesis, and, unexpectedly, antigen presentation/processing. The genomic changes were confirmed at either mRNA or protein level for selected genes, including those of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II). Cholesterol biosynthetic activity was greatly reduced in the enterocytes of the IE-Cpr-null mice, as evidenced by the accumulation of the lanosterol metabolite, 24-dihydrolanosterol. However, no differences in either circulating or enterocyte cholesterol levels were observed between IE-Cpr-null and WT mice. Interestingly, the levels of the cholesterol precursor farnesyl pyrophosphate and its derivative geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were also increased in the enterocytes of the IE-Cpr-null mice. Furthermore, the expression of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), a downstream target of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate signaling, was enhanced. STAT1 is an activator of CIITA, the class II transactivator for MHC II expression; CIITA expression was concomitantly increased in IE-Cpr-null mice. Overall, these findings provide a novel and mechanistic link between POR-dependent enzymes and the expression of MHC II genes in the small intestine."

Nascent transcript formation near the speckle compartment results in the recruitment of splicing factors from these nuclear bodies to the processing site, and this exchange rate might be regulated by continuous phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Thus, phosphorylation of SR proteins is necessary for their recruitment from nuclear speckles to sites of transcription in vivo (10.Misteli T. Cáceres J.F. Clement J.Q. Krainer A.R. Wilkinson M.F.

Although significant progress has been made on the role of speckles in gene expression, little is known about the sequence motifs responsible for the accumulation of splicing factors at the speckle region. In the case of the SR family of proteins, the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the RS domain direct these splicing factors to the nuclear speckles (11.Li H. Bingham P.M.

To date, no localization signal has been clearly defined to target proteins to the interface between speckles and surrounding transcription sites. TCERG1 participates in transcriptional elongation and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs, and a role for this protein in coordinating both processes has been proposed (20.Goldstrohm A.C.

However, accumulating evidence indicates a potential role of TCERG1 in splicing and, hence, in the coupling between transcription and splicing. TCERG1 affects the alternative pre-mRNA splicing of β-globin, β-tropomyosin, CD44, and fibronectin splicing reporters (24.Lin K.T. Lu R.M. Tarn W.Y.

Consistent with a potential role in the coupling of transcription and splicing, TCERG1 localizes at the interface of splicing factor-rich nuclear speckles and what are presumably nearby transcription sites (21.Sánchez-Alvarez M.

FF domains of CA150 bind transcription and splicing factors through multiple weak interactions.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 9274-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the FF4 and FF5 domains of TCERG1 as the region required to direct this protein to the periphery of nuclear speckles. We performed NMR-based analyses and observed that although the FF4 domain is folded and stable, the FF5 domain is not. However, when both domains are expressed as a pair, the folded properties of FF5 are improved. These observations suggest that both domains form a functional unit and provide insights into the nature of FF protein domains. Moreover, our data demonstrate that both of these FF domains specifically direct the localization of fused unrelated proteins to these nuclear regions. Therefore, we defined the FF4 and FF5 domains as novel targeting signals for the localization of proteins at the interface between speckles and what are presumably nearby transcription sites. Placing our data in a functional context, this “speckle periphery-targeting sequence” contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing decisions of a reporter pre-mRNA in vivo. The intermediate vector pEF-ECFP and eukaryotic expression plasmid pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1(1–1098) have been described previously (27.Sánchez-Alvarez M. Montes M. Sánchez-Hernández N. Hernández-Munain C. Suñé C. Differential effects of sumoylation on transcription and alternative splicing by transcription elongation regulator 1 (TCERG1).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 15220-15233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1(1–662) was generated using EcoRI fragments obtained from the pEFBOST7-TCERG1 parental vector (23.Suñé C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Transcriptional cofactor CA150 regulates RNA polymerase II elongation in a TATA-box-dependent manner.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by standard cloning procedures. pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1(1–662)-FF mutants were constructed by inserting appropriate FF repeat domain sequences into the BstBI-digested pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1(1–662) vector. The enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vectors pEGFP-FF5 and pEGFP-FF4/FF5 were obtained by inserting appropriate PCR-amplified products into the XhoI and XhoI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Invitrogen), respectively. pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1ΔFF4/FF5 was generated by cloning two PCR products encompassing FF1 to FF3 and FF6 sequences, respectively, into the pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1 (1–662) plasmid by standard cloning procedures. pEFBOS/GFP/T7-TCERG1ΔFF5 was kindly provided by Mariano Garcia-Blanco (Duke University Medical Centre, Durham, NC). The phenylalanine-to-alanine mutants (F903A, F961A, F903A,F961A, F946A, and F903A,F946A) were created by mutagenesis into pEFBOS/ECFP/T7-TCERG1(1–662)-FF4/FF5 vector. The wild-type and mutant SRSF1 expression vectors (SRSF1, RRM1, and RRM2) were described previously (14.Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. Role of the modular domains of SR proteins in subnuclear localization and alternative splicing specificity.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Javier F. Cáceres (MRC, Edinburgh). RRM1 and RRM2 fragments with XbaI and BamHI/XhoI sites were obtained by PCR and inserted into the same epitope-tagged expression vector as wild-type SRSF1 (pCGT7-SF2), yielding pCGT7-RRM1 and pCGT7RRM2 intermediate vectors. The RRM mutants containing FF repeat domains were created using appropriate XhoI/BglII fragments obtained by PCR from pEFBOS-ECFP-T7-TCERG1 (1–1098) and inserted into XhoI/BamHI-digested pCGT7-RRM vectors. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transformed into DH5α cells for selection. Constructs of the FF4 (878–956 fragment) and for the pair of FF4-FF5 domains (878–1022 fragment) of TCERG1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pETM-11 (a gift from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-Heidelberg Protein Expression Facility) using NcoI and HindIII sites. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Unlabeled, 15N-labeled, 13C, 15N and 2H, 13C, and 15N-labeled proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in Luria Broth medium or minimal medium (M9) using either H2O or D2O (99.89%, CortecNet) enriched with 15NH4Cl and/or D-[13C] glucose as the sole sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively (30.Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. A method for efficient isotopic labeling of recombinant proteins.J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). E. coli extracts were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) cell disrupter equipped with an in-house developed Peltier temperature controller system. Soluble fusion proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography (HiTrap chelating High Performance column, GE Healthcare), and samples were eluted using buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm Imidazol, 150 mm NaCl) with EDTA. After nickel affinity purification, the proteins were cut with the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and further purified by gel filtration on a HiLoadTM SuperdexTM 75 prepgrade (GE Healthcare). All samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NaN3 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O (pH 5.8). To avoid aggregation of the FF4-FF5 sample, the buffer was supplemented with 5% glycerol. Antibodies against the T7 tag were purchased from Bethyl and used at dilutions of 1:20,000 and 1:1000 for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Antibody against CDK9 (catalog no. sc-484, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a dilution of 1:500. Antibodies against U2AF65 were kindly provided by J. Valcárcel (CRG, Barcelona, Spain) and were used at a dilution of 1:500. Antibody against splicing factor SC35 (catalog no. S4045, Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:4000. For Western blot analysis, primary antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to rabbit and mouse (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). These were generally used at dilutions of 1:5000. For immunofluorescence, we used Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit from Molecular Probes and were generally used at dilutions of 1:500. HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown and maintained as described previously (27.Sánchez-Alvarez M. Montes M. Sánchez-Hernández N. Hernández-Munain C. Suñé C.

Cells were transfected by using calcium phosphate and/or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Empty vector was used to keep the total amount of nucleic acid constant. HeLa and HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with the constructs indicated in the legends to the figures. Approximately 24 h after transfection (50–60% confluence), cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and blocked in PBS containing 2.5% BSA overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature (humidity chamber) and subsequently washed extensively with 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies under the conditions described previously. After staining, cells were rinsed five times with 0.1% BSA in PBS and three more times with PBS. Coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired with an inverted Leica SP2 confocal microscope, using an HCX PL APO CS 40.0 × 1.25 OIL UV objective. In cases where double immunofluorescence was performed, images were all taken simultaneously. GFP, CFP, and Alexa Fluor 488 were excited with the 488-nm line of the argon laser, whereas Alexa Fluor 647 was excited with a 633-nm HeNe laser. The pinhole diameter was kept at 1 μm. Quantification analysis shown in Fig. 1B was performed by measuring and comparing the average pixel intensity of the ECFP at the nuclear speckle site and adjacent nucleoplasm of a region of interest scan for each TCERG1 mutant. Thirty-six regions of interest from three different experiments with 12 cells per experiment (72 and 108 measurements for the speckles and nucleoplasm, respectively) were quantified for each TCERG1 mutant. Statistical analysis was performed using a standard Student's t test. Acquisition software was LAS AF v2.3.6 Build 5381sps. All images were digitally processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop CS3 extended v10.0 software. All experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a z pulse field gradient unit and a triple (1H, 13C, 15N) resonance probe head. Double- and/or triple-labeled samples were prepared to obtain sequence-specific (HNCACB/HN(CO)CACB or CBCA(CO)NH/CBCANH) experiments. All spectra were processed with the NMRPipe/NMRDraw (31.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11517) Google Scholar) software and were analyzed with Computer Aided Resonance Assignment, CARA (32.Bartels C. Xia T-H. Billeter M. Güntert P.

The 15N-relaxation experiments were acquired for 15N-labeled samples of FF4+FF5 (0.5 mm) and FF4 (0.5 mm) essentially as described (33.Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Backbone dynamics of calmodulin studied by 15N relaxation using inverse detected two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The central helix is flexible.Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOE experiment was performed using standard 2D experiments, with the reference and proton saturated spectra collected in an interleaved fashion. The values of steady-state 1H-15N NOEs were determined from the ratios of the peak intensities measured in spectra recorded either with (Is) or without (Io) presaturation during the relaxation delay as described (34.Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E.

The standard deviation of the NOE was determined on the basis of measured background noise levels using the following relationship: σNOE/NOE=((σlsat/lsat)2+(σlunsat/lunsat)2)1/2(Eq. 1) T1 and T2 experiments were acquired with 135 (t1) × 2048 (t2) total real points. T1 data points were obtained with 12 different relaxation periods: 20.8, 52, 104, 156, 265, 424, 520, 676, 832, 1040, 1352, and 1664 ms. Ten delay times were also sampled in the T2 experiments: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 120, 144, and 168 ms. T1 and T2 values were determined by fitting the measured peak heights to a two-parameter function of the form: l(t)−l0exp(−t/T1,2)(Eq. 2) where I(t) is the intensity after a delay of time t and Io is the intensity at time t = 0. Minimization performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimum value of the I0 and T1,2 parameters by minimizing the χ2 goodness of fit parameter: χ2=∑(lc(t)−le(t))2/sl2(Eq. 3) where Ic(t) are the intensities calculated from the fitting parameters, Ie(t) are the experimental intensities, sI is the standard deviation of the experimental intensity measurements, and summation is performed over the number of time points recorded in each experiment. Thermal denaturation was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The experiments were performed using a VPTM DSC MicroCalorimeter (in the Polymorphism and Calorimetry Platform of the Scientific and Technical Services (SCT), Universitat de Barcelona) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 130 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NaN3 (pH 5.8). The protein solution was heated up at a constant rate of 1 °C/min from 10 to 80° and a constant pressure. The temperature dependence of the excess heat capacity was analyzed and plotted with Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). Approximately 2 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of Bcl-X2 minigene reporter (kindly provided by Benoit Chabot, University of Sherbrooke) and 1 μg of the TCERG1 derivative plasmids as indicated in the legend of Fig. 6. Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 μg of RNA was digested with 10 units of RNase-Free DNase (Roche). One-half of digested RNA was used for RT using the RT-Sveda primer and Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 10% of the RT reaction was used as template together with X34 and X-Agel-R primers. Reaction products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and quantified using Quantity One 4.5.0 software. The following primers were used: 5′-GGGAAGCTAGAGTAAGTAG-3′ (RT-Sveda1-Rev), 5′-AGGGAGGCAGGCGACGAGTTT-3′ (X34), and 5′-GTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCGAT-3′ (X-Agel-R). We reported previously that TCERG1 is present along the periphery of the speckles (21.Sánchez-Alvarez M. Goldstrohm A.C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Suñé C.

The shape of the food web organizes itself according to the spatial distribution of the individuals and of the stocks. To understand how the spatial organization of the food stocks changes with the colony needs, we monitored the flow of radiolabeled sugar solution inside an ant nest at different degrees of starvation. The spatial dynamics of the food flow revealed stable patterns and fine-tuning regulation of the feeding process. The complex collective regulatory stock management task can be reproduced by a surprising simple model that integrates a positive and a negative feedback proportional to the number of ants that already received food. Spatial analysis of the food distribution showed that sucrose is heterogeneously stocked among individuals and also heterogeneously consumed. Furthermore, we observed a regular spatial structure, leading to centralization of the stocks: heavily loaded individuals being at the center of the cluster and weakly loaded individuals at its periphery. The centralization of both resources and information in self-organized systems might be a widespread phenomenon that deserves further studies.—Buffin, A., Goldman, S., Deneubourg, J. L.

However, the evidence for the predictive effects of pulmonary function on respiratory health in children was still inconsistent.We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study among children in 14 Taiwanese communities. There were 3,160 children completed pulmonary function tests in 2007 and follow-up questionnaire in 2009. Poisson regression models were performed to estimate the effect of pulmonary function on the development of bronchitis and asthma.After adjustment for potential confounders, pulmonary function indices consistently showed protective effects on respiratory diseases in children. The incidence rate ratios of bronchitis and asthma were 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.95) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁). Similar adverse effects of maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF) were also observed on bronchitis (RR = 0.73, 95% CI 0.67-0.81) and asthma (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.93). We found significant decreasing trends in categorized FEV₁ (p for trend = 0.02) and categories of MMEF (p for trend = 0.01) for incident bronchitis. Significant modification effects of traffic-related air pollution were noted for FEV₁ and MMEF on bronchitis and also for MMEF on asthma.Children with high pulmonary function would have lower risks on the development of bronchitis and asthma. The protective effect of high pulmonary function would be modified by traffic-related air pollution exposure."

However, when the event is rare (low prevalence <0.1), and testing occurs sequentially, inverse (negative) binomial pooled sampling may be preferred.This research proposes three sample size procedures (two computational and one analytic) for estimating prevalence using group testing under inverse (negative) binomial sampling. These methods provide the required number of positive pools ([Formula: see text]), given a pool size (k), for estimating the proportion of AP plants using the Dorfman model and inverse (negative) binomial sampling. We give real and simulated examples to show how to apply these methods and the proposed sample-size formula. The Monte Carlo method was used to study the coverage and level of assurance achieved by the proposed sample sizes. An R program to create other scenarios is given in Appendix S2.The three methods ensure precision in the estimated proportion of AP because they guarantee that the width (W) of the confidence interval (CI) will be equal to, or narrower than, the desired width ([Formula: see text]), with a probability of [Formula: see text]. With the Monte Carlo study we found that the computational Wald procedure (method 2) produces the more precise sample size (with coverage and assurance levels very close to nominal values) and that the samples size based on the Clopper-Pearson CI (method 1) is conservative (overestimates the sample size); the analytic Wald sample size method we developed (method 3) sometimes underestimated the optimum number of pools."
https://openalex.org/W2027765809,"Membrane traffic is an essential process that allows protein and lipid exchange between the endocytic, lysosomal, and secretory compartments. Clathrin-mediated traffic between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes mediates responses to the environment through the sorting of biosynthetic and endocytic protein cargo. Traffic through this pathway is initiated by the controlled assembly of a clathrin-adaptor protein coat on the cytosolic surface of the originating organelle. In this process, clathrin is recruited by different adaptor proteins that act as a bridge between clathrin and the transmembrane cargo proteins to be transported. Interactions between adaptors and clathrin and between different types of adaptors lead to the formation of a densely packed protein network within the coat. A key unresolved issue is how the highly complex adaptor-clathrin interaction and adaptor-adaptor interaction landscape lead to the correct spatiotemporal assembly of the clathrin coat. Here we report the discovery of a new autoregulatory motif within the clathrin adaptor Gga2 that drives synergistic binding of Gga2 to clathrin and the adaptor Ent5. This autoregulation influences the temporal and/or spatial location of the Gga2-Ent5 interaction. We propose that this synergistic binding provides built-in regulation to ensure the correct assembly of clathrin coats."
https://openalex.org/W2072536165,"Protein-protein interactions play an essential role in cellular processes. Certain proteins form stable complexes with their partner proteins, whereas others function by forming transient complexes. The conventional protein-protein interaction model describes an interaction between two proteins under the assumption that a protein binds to its partner protein through a single binding site. In this study, we improved the conventional interaction model by developing a Multiple-Site (MS) model in which a protein binds to its partner protein through closely located multiple binding sites on a surface of the partner protein by transiently docking at each binding site with individual binding free energies. To test this model, we used the protein-protein interaction mediated by Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. SH3 domains recognize their partners via a weak, transient interaction and are therefore promiscuous in nature. Because the MS model requires large amounts of data compared with the conventional interaction model, we used experimental data from the positionally addressable syntheses of peptides on cellulose membranes (SPOT-synthesis) technique. From the analysis of the experimental data, individual binding free energies for each binding site of peptides were extracted. A comparison of the individual binding free energies from the analysis with those from atomistic force fields gave a correlation coefficient of 0.66. Furthermore, application of the MS model to 10 SH3 domains lowers the prediction error by up to 9% compared with the conventional interaction model. This improvement in prediction originates from a more realistic description of complex formation than the conventional interaction model. The results suggested that, in many cases, SH3 domains increased the protein complex population through multiple binding sites of their partner proteins. Our study indicates that the consideration of general complex formation is important for the accurate description of protein complex formation, and especially for those of weak or transient protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2096987143,"In this study, through phenomenological comparison of the velocity-force data of processive motor proteins, including conventional kinesin, cytoplasmic dynein and myosin V, I found that, the ratio between motor velocities of two different ATP concentrations is almost invariant for any substall, superstall or negative external loads. Therefore, the velocity of motors can be well approximated by a Michaelis-Menten like formula , with the step size, and the external load dependent rate of one mechanochemical cycle of motor motion in saturated ATP solution. The difference of Michaelis-Menten constant for substall, superstall and negative external load indicates, the configurations at which ATP molecule can bind to motor heads for these three cases might be different, though the expression of as a function of might be unchanged for any external load . Verifications of this Michaelis-Menten like formula has also been done by fitting to the recent experimental data."
