https://openalex.org/W3047617722,"Land use change-for example, the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic, trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and 376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort, and show that land use has global and systematic effects on local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18-72% higher) and total abundance (21-144% higher) in sites under substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species, which may be one factor that underpins the global importance of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our results suggest that global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3035326193,"The precise mechanism by which oral infection contributes to the pathogenesis of extra-oral diseases remains unclear. Here, we report that periodontal inflammation exacerbates gut inflammation in vivo. Periodontitis leads to expansion of oral pathobionts, including Klebsiella and Enterobacter species, in the oral cavity. Amassed oral pathobionts are ingested and translocate to the gut, where they activate the inflammasome in colonic mononuclear phagocytes, triggering inflammation. In parallel, periodontitis results in generation of oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells in the oral cavity. Oral pathobiont-reactive Th17 cells are imprinted with gut tropism and migrate to the inflamed gut. When in the gut, Th17 cells of oral origin can be activated by translocated oral pathobionts and cause development of colitis, but they are not activated by gut-resident microbes. Thus, oral inflammation, such as periodontitis, exacerbates gut inflammation by supplying the gut with both colitogenic pathobionts and pathogenic T cells."
https://openalex.org/W3047325596,"Colonization by the microbiota causes a marked stimulation of B cells and induction of immunoglobulin, but mammals colonized with many taxa have highly complex and individualized immunoglobulin repertoires1,2. Here we use a simplified model of defined transient exposures to different microbial taxa in germ-free mice3 to deconstruct how the microbiota shapes the B cell pool and its functional responsiveness. We followed the development of the immunoglobulin repertoire in B cell populations, as well as single cells by deep sequencing. Microbial exposures at the intestinal mucosa generated oligoclonal responses that differed from those of germ-free mice, and from the diverse repertoire that was generated after intravenous systemic exposure to microbiota. The IgA repertoire—predominantly to cell-surface antigens—did not expand after dose escalation, whereas increased systemic exposure broadened the IgG repertoire to both microbial cytoplasmic and cell-surface antigens. These microbial exposures induced characteristic immunoglobulin heavy-chain repertoires in B cells, mainly at memory and plasma cell stages. Whereas sequential systemic exposure to different microbial taxa diversified the IgG repertoire and facilitated alternative specific responses, sequential mucosal exposure produced limited overlapping repertoires and the attrition of initial IgA binding specificities. This shows a contrast between a flexible response to systemic exposure with the need to avoid fatal sepsis, and a restricted response to mucosal exposure that reflects the generic nature of host–microbial mutualism in the mucosa. A mouse model of systemic versus mucosal exposure to microbial taxa reveals that the former provokes a flexible B cell response with a diverse immunoglobulin repertoire, whereas the latter generates a more-restricted response."
https://openalex.org/W3047173106,"Abstract The tuatara ( Sphenodon punctatus )—the only living member of the reptilian order Rhynchocephalia (Sphenodontia), once widespread across Gondwana 1,2 —is an iconic species that is endemic to New Zealand 2,3 . A key link to the now-extinct stem reptiles (from which dinosaurs, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved), the tuatara provides key insights into the ancestral amniotes 2,4 . Here we analyse the genome of the tuatara, which—at approximately 5 Gb—is among the largest of the vertebrate genomes yet assembled. Our analyses of this genome, along with comparisons with other vertebrate genomes, reinforce the uniqueness of the tuatara. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the tuatara lineage diverged from that of snakes and lizards around 250 million years ago. This lineage also shows moderate rates of molecular evolution, with instances of punctuated evolution. Our genome sequence analysis identifies expansions of proteins, non-protein-coding RNA families and repeat elements, the latter of which show an amalgam of reptilian and mammalian features. The sequencing of the tuatara genome provides a valuable resource for deep comparative analyses of tetrapods, as well as for tuatara biology and conservation. Our study also provides important insights into both the technical challenges and the cultural obligations that are associated with genome sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W3046934626,"Summary Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) grafts can integrate into sites of spinal cord injury (SCI) and generate neuronal relays across lesions that can provide functional benefit. To determine if and how grafts become synaptically organized and connect with host systems, we performed calcium imaging of NSPC grafts in SCI sites in vivo and in adult spinal cord slices. NSPC grafts organize into localized and spontaneously active synaptic networks. Optogenetic stimulation of host corticospinal tract axons regenerating into grafts elicited distinct and segregated neuronal network responses throughout the graft. Moreover, optogenetic stimulation of graft-derived axons extending from the graft into the denervated spinal cord also triggered local host neuronal network responses. In vivo imaging revealed that behavioral stimulation likewise elicited focal synaptic responses within grafts. Thus neural progenitor grafts can form functional synaptic subnetworks whose activity patterns resemble intact spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W3047544314,"A fundamental challenge in developing treatments for autism spectrum disorders is the heterogeneity of the condition. More than one hundred genetic mutations confer high risk for autism, with each individual mutation accounting for only a small fraction of cases1–3. Subsets of risk genes can be grouped into functionally related pathways, most prominently those involving synaptic proteins, translational regulation, and chromatin modifications. To attempt to minimize this genetic complexity, recent therapeutic strategies have focused on the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin4–6, which regulate aspects of social behaviour in mammals7. However, it is unclear whether genetic risk factors predispose individuals to autism as a result of modifications to oxytocinergic signalling. Here we report that an autism-associated mutation in the synaptic adhesion molecule Nlgn3 results in impaired oxytocin signalling in dopaminergic neurons and in altered behavioural responses to social novelty tests in mice. Notably, loss of Nlgn3 is accompanied by a disruption of translation homeostasis in the ventral tegmental area. Treatment of Nlgn3-knockout mice with a new, highly specific, brain-penetrant inhibitor of MAP kinase-interacting kinases resets the translation of mRNA and restores oxytocin signalling and social novelty responses. Thus, this work identifies a convergence between the genetic autism risk factor Nlgn3, regulation of translation, and oxytocinergic signalling. Focusing on such common core plasticity elements might provide a pragmatic approach to overcoming the heterogeneity of autism. Ultimately, this would enable mechanism-based stratification of patient populations to increase the success of therapeutic interventions. An autism-associated mutation in Nlgn3 results in impaired oxytocin signalling in dopaminergic neurons and altered social behavioural responses in mice, and treatment with an inhibitor of MAP kinase-interacting kinases rescues these phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3047311641,"The histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a superfamily of chromatin-modifying enzymes that silence transcription through the modification of histones. Among them, HDAC3 is unique in that interaction with nuclear receptor corepressors 1 and 2 (NCoR1/2) is required to engage its catalytic activity1-3. However, global loss of HDAC3 also results in the repression of transcription, the mechanism of which is currently unclear4-8. Here we report that, during the activation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharides, HDAC3 is recruited to activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)-bound sites without NCoR1/2 and activates the expression of inflammatory genes through a non-canonical mechanism. By contrast, the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 is selectively engaged at ATF3-bound sites that suppress Toll-like receptor signalling. Loss of HDAC3 in macrophages safeguards mice from lethal exposure to lipopolysaccharides, but this protection is not conferred upon genetic or pharmacological abolition of the catalytic activity of HDAC3. Our findings show that HDAC3 is a dichotomous transcriptional activator and repressor, with a non-canonical deacetylase-independent function that is vital for the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3047436341,"Background Options to increase the ease of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed. Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability after participants collect specimens. Methods 153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot (DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection, packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related laboratory testing. Results A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory analysis.There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and shipping, or confidence in samples, by gender, age, race/ethnicity, or educational level. Conclusions Self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing, and preparing and shipping specimens for analysis, were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for COVID-related testing is needed."

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that, when Notch signaling is blocked, astrocytes transition to a neural stem cell-like state. However, only after injury do a few of these primed astrocytes unfold a neurogenic program, including a self-amplifying progenitor-like state. Further, reconstruction of the trajectories of individual cells allowed us to uncouple astrocyte neurogenesis from reactive gliosis, which occur along independent branches.

Finally, we show that cortical neurogenesis molecularly recapitulates canonical subventricular zone neurogenesis with remarkable fidelity. Our study supports a widespread potential of parenchymal astrocytes to function as dormant neural stem cells. The adult mammalian brain has limited regenerative capacity after neuronal loss. Small populations of neural stem cells persist throughout life and can generate progeny that migrate to sites of damage, where they generate glia (Faiz et al., 2015Faiz M. Sachewsky N. Gascón S. Bang K.W. Morshead C.M. Nagy A. Adult Neural Stem Cells from the Subventricular Zone Give Rise to Reactive Astrocytes in the Cortex after Stroke.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 624-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or contribute to replacement of a minor portion of neurons lost to injury (Arvidsson et al., 2002Arvidsson A. Collin T. Kirik D. Kokaia Z. Lindvall O. Neuronal replacement from endogenous precursors in the adult brain after stroke.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar). In addition to these neural stem cells, astrocytes isolated from the injured cortex display neural stem cell properties in vitro (Sirko et al., 2013Sirko S. Behrendt G. Johansson P.A. Tripathi P. Costa M. Bek S. Heinrich C. Tiedt S. Colak D. Dichgans M. et al.Reactive glia in the injured brain acquire stem cell properties in response to sonic hedgehog.

Moreover, in mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (Magnusson et al., 2014Magnusson J.P. Göritz C. Tatarishvili J. Dias D.O. Smith E.M. Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Frisén J. A latent neurogenic program in astrocytes regulated by Notch signaling in the mouse.Science. 2014; 346: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or excitotoxic damage (Nato et al., 2015Nato G. Caramello A. Trova S. Avataneo V. Rolando C. Taylor V. Buffo A. Peretto P. Luzzati F. Striatal astrocytes produce neuroblasts in an excitotoxic model of Huntington’s disease.Development. 2015; 142: 840-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), astrocytes give rise to new neurons in vivo. Parenchymal astrocytes thus represent a potential novel source of latent neurogenic cells, but it is unknown whether this potential is conserved throughout the brain. In the striatum, astrocytes commit to the neuronal lineage through induction of neural stem cell-associated genes, such as Ascl1, followed by a transient phase of expansion before generating clusters of neuroblasts and, eventually, neurons (Magnusson et al., 2014Magnusson J.P. Göritz C. Tatarishvili J. Dias D.O. Smith E.M. Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Frisén J. A latent neurogenic program in astrocytes regulated by Notch signaling in the mouse.Science. 2014; 346: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes after stroke is triggered by reduced Notch signaling, and blocking Notch activity by conditional deletion of the key regulator Rbpj-κ is sufficient to activate this neurogenic program, even in the absence of injury (Magnusson et al., 2014Magnusson J.P. Göritz C. Tatarishvili J. Dias D.O. Smith E.M. Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Frisén J. A latent neurogenic program in astrocytes regulated by Notch signaling in the mouse.Science. 2014; 346: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The molecular cascade that drives the lineage fate transition is, however, unclear, and it remains to be determined whether the transcriptional programs required for parenchymal astrocytes to generate adult-born neurons share similarities with canonical neurogenic processes. Furthermore, only astrocytes in the striatum and medial cortex generate neurons when Rbpj-κ is depleted, raising questions about the extent of their neurogenic potential throughout the brain. We found that Rbpj-κ-depleted astrocytes from the cortex can mount a neurogenic response, when animals are subjected to an injury. The neurogenic potential was widespread throughout cortical regions and layers because upper- and deep-layer astrocytes from the somatosensory and visual cortices initiated neurogenesis upon Rbpj-κ depletion. Astrocytes close to the lesion form Ascl1-expressing transit-amplifying cells before generating proliferative clusters of doublecortin (Dcx)+ neuroblasts and mature neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that conditional knockout of Rbpj-κ drives induction of a neural stem cell program in cortical astrocytes that resembles canonical neurogenic processes, as observed in transcriptome analyses of the germinal niche (Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015Llorens-Bobadilla E.

However, only after a stab wound injury can the neurogenic program be instigated, and Notch-deficient cortical astrocytes are able to progress through amplifying cell divisions to generate GABAergic interneurons. Importantly, analyses of individual cell trajectories show that neurogenesis by astrocytes occurs independent of reactive gliosis, which is induced in parallel by a different subset of astrocytes. Altogether, our data suggest that cortical astrocytes should be viewed as a latent source of neural stem cells that can be recruited to propagate a neurogenic program with the potential to generate neurons that replace cells lost because of injury. To assess the neurogenic potential of cortical astrocytes in the injured adult brain, Cx30-CreER, Rbpj-κfl/fl mice (Slezak et al., 2007Slezak M. Göritz C. Niemiec A. Frisén J. Chambon P. Metzger D.

Biol. 2001; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar) received tamoxifen to induce selective ablation of Rbpj-κ and reporter expression in astrocytes and their progeny and were subjected to a stab wound injury (Figures 1A and 1B ). Although neurogenesis was not detected in uninjured Rbpj-κfl/fl mice (n = 4) or after stab wound injury without homozygous deletion of Rbpj-κ (n = 5), the combination of stimuli resulted in local parenchymal astrocytes initiating a neurogenic program (Figures 1C and 1D) through upregulation of Ascl1, followed by a transit-amplifying stage, before generating clusters of Dcx+ progenitors and postmitotic Dcx+ neuroblasts (Figure S1). These cells also carried a fluorescent reporter, confirming that they had originated from Cx30-expressing astrocytes. Transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts were predominantly found in close proximity to the edge of the lesion and first appeared 1 week post-injury (wpi, n = 4; Figure 1E). Production of neural progenitors peaked at 3 wpi, when we recorded the highest number of Ascl1+ and Dcx+ cells (n = 4, F(3) = 7.67, p < 0.01 for Ascl1+ cells and F(3) = 13.97, p < 0.001 for Dcx+ cells; Figure 1E). Transit-amplifying cells generated smaller clusters of dividing cells (4.35 ± 2.11 cells/cluster, mean ± SD), which subsequently underwent further expansion as mitotic neuroblasts (9.40 ± 6.59 cells/cluster, t(136) = 7.02, p < 0.001; Figure 1F). At 3 (n = 4) and 8 (n = 4) wpi, we recorded the co-occurrence of cells at different maturation stages (Figures 1G and S1). The proportions of neural progenitors found as single cells or in clusters changed with time after injury, with an increased probability of observing neuroblasts in clusters at 3 wpi and as single immature neurons at 8 wpi (χ2(3) = 55.43, p < 0.001; Figures 1G and S1). Nevertheless, we noted that S100+/Ascl1+ double positive astroglia still co-existed with transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts long after the injury had been inflicted, suggesting that astrocytes were continuously recruited to generate neuroblasts at the injury site, although their production markedly decreased at 8 wpi (n = 4; Figure 1E). Interestingly, Dcx-expressing cells recorded in the injured cortex of Rbpj-κ mice could develop complex morphologies with branched neurites (Figures 1K–1M and S1E). Notch signaling-deficient astrocytes finally gave rise to post-mitotic, mature neurons (Figures 1H–1J). Mice subjected to stab wound injury were given 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) starting after the surgical procedure, and EdU in YFP+/NeuN (Neuronal Nuclei)+ double positive cells indicated that the neurons were generated by astrocytes that had divided after injury (Figures 1I and 1J). Neuroblasts from the subventricular zone can migrate toward cortical sites of damage, where they commit to an astroglial lineage fate (Faiz et al., 2015Faiz M. Sachewsky N. Gascón S. Bang K.W. Morshead C.M. Nagy A. Adult Neural Stem Cells from the Subventricular Zone Give Rise to Reactive Astrocytes in the Cortex after Stroke.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 17: 624-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our transgenic mouse model labels not only parenchymal astrocytes but also Cx30-expressing neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (Magnusson et al., 2014Magnusson J.P. Göritz C. Tatarishvili J. Dias D.O. Smith E.M. Lindvall O. Kokaia Z. Frisén J. A latent neurogenic program in astrocytes regulated by Notch signaling in the mouse.Science. 2014; 346: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not exclude that the neuroblasts observed in the cortex had migrated from the subventricular zone. To assess the origin of the neurogenic cells, we used several more restricted recombination paradigms (Figure 2). To address whether transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts were produced locally, we achieved selective recombination of cortical cells through focal injection of an adeno-associated virus carrying Cre under the Gfap promoter in Rbpj-κfl/fl mice, and subjected the animals to stab wound injury (Figure 2A). YFP+/Dcx+ double positive cells were observed at the injury site after intracortical virus delivery, indicating the local cortical origin of the neural progenitors (Figures 2C–2F). Notably, the percentage of YFP+ cells expressing the neurogenic marker were comparable between local (i.e., virus-mediated, n = 7, 4.62% ± 2.54%) and systemic (i.e., tamoxifen-mediated, n = 5, 5.52% ± 4.75%) recombination (t(5.65) = −0.39, p = 0.71; Figure 2C). We next asked whether there may be additional contributions, such as by subventricular zone migratory neuroblasts or Cx30-expressing leptomeningeal cells, and turned to focal recombination using endoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen, in the same transgenic line to address this question (Figure 2B). We administered endoxifen through the lateral ventricle of Rbpj-κfl/fl mice. This resulted in recombination restricted to cells at and around the subventricular zone (Figures S2E–S2G) and did not reveal migration of neuroblasts to the injured cortex (n = 6; Figure 2G). Vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) are a population of fibroblast-like cells located at the interface between the endothelium and the astroglial endfoot layer surrounding the parenchyma and characterized by expression of Pdgfra along with collagen fiber crosslinking proteins, such as Dcn and Lum (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018Vanlandewijck M.

Like astrocytes, VLMCs express Cx30 (De Bock et al., 2014De Bock M. Vandenbroucke R.E. Decrock E. Culot M. Cecchelli R. Leybaert L. A new angle on blood-CNS interfaces: a role for connexins?.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 1259-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are thus recombined in our transgenic mouse line. We asked whether VLMCs may contribute to the observed cortical neurogenesis in injured Rbpj-κfl/fl mice. For this purpose, we achieved selective targeting of VLMCs through intracisternal delivery of endoxifen (Zamboni et al., 2020Zamboni M. Santopolo G. Frisén J. Induction of Leptomeningeal Cells Modification Via Intracisternal Injection.J. Vis. Exp. 2020; Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and subjected the mice to stab wound injury (Figures 2B and 2H–2J). The lesioned cortices of these animals were devoid of Ascl1+ or Dcx+ neural progenitor cells, suggesting that VLMCs do not have neurogenic potential (n = 5; Figure 2K). To address whether the possibility to induce cortical neurogenesis is applicable to other regions of the cerebral cortex, we subjected Rbpj-κfl/fl mice to stab wound injury directed to the occipital cortex (n = 4; Figures S2A–S2D). Generation of astrocyte-derived neural progenitors in the primary visual cortex (Figures S2B–S2D), a region distal from the subventricular zone, indicated that migratory neuroblasts are unlikely to contribute to the neurogenic phenomenon recorded in the cortex. It also revealed that the astroglial neurogenic potential is not restricted to astrocytes from the somatosensory cortex but extends instead over different cortical regions. Our initial investigation indicated that neurogenesis by astrocytes may proceed along developmental steps reminiscent of canonical neurogenesis (Figure S1). To investigate a more comprehensive transcriptional framework delineating the commitment of cortical astrocytes to a neuronal lineage fate, we carried out a scRNA-seq experiment. For this purpose, we dissected portions of the somatosensory cortex subjected to stab wound injury and healthy contralateral cortices of wild-type and Rbpj-κfl/fl mice (Figure S3A). Using flow cytometry, we then sorted tdTomato+ cells (Figures S3B–S3D) and analyzed their transcriptome. After removal of contaminating cells (i.e., oligodendrocytes, microglia, and VLMCs), low-quality cells, and possible doublets, we retained 4,627 cells for downstream analysis (Figures S3E–S3H). We performed graph-based clustering on shared nearest neighbors and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) using the top 15 principal components and 2,512 highly variable genes as input (Table S1). Our analysis unveiled the full architecture of the dataset and enabled us to detect molecular differences between wild-type and Rbpj-κ-depleted cells, which clustered separately from each other (Figure 3A). Transit-amplifying cells and neuroblasts from injured cortices of Rbpj-κfl/fl mice segregated away from astrocytes (Figure 3A), based on the expression of genes implicated in the cell cycle (e.g., Mki67, Ccnd2, and Ptma) and neuronal specification (e.g., Dcx, Sp9, and Igfbpl1; Figures 3B, 3C, and 3E; Table S2). Astrocyte cluster 1 (AC1, n = 1,978) was composed of cells enriched in genes such as Hes5, Ubc, and Nrarp, which are indicative of active Notch signaling (Figure 3B and 3C; Table S2). This cluster was composed of astrocytes with intact Rbpj-κ as well as some astroglia from animals carrying the Rbpj-κ null allele (Figure 3D). In contrast, Rbpj-κ-depleted astrocytes formed a separate category (AC2, n = 1,452) characterized by downregulation of Notch-related genes and concomitant induction of genes (e.g., Ascl1 and Hes6; Figures 3B and 3C; Table S2) typically expressed upon inhibition of Notch signaling (Fior and Henrique, 2005Fior R. Henrique D. A novel hes5/hes6 circuitry of negative regulation controls Notch activity during neurogenesis.Dev. Biol. 2005; 281: 318-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Notably, AC2 was composed of cells from injured and healthy tissue, although only astrocytes in the lesioned cortex mounted a neurogenic response to generate neuroblasts (Figure 3D). Finally, we were able to detect a small cluster of cells (AC3, n = 36) with a reactive profile, as suggested by enrichment in genes implicated in immune response, such as Ifitm3 and C4b (Figures 3B and 3C; Table S2). Notably, AC3 cells displayed activation of genes that are characteristic of type A1 reactive glia (i.e., Cxcl10, H2-T23, Iigp1, and Psmb9; Figure 3B), identified by Liddelow et al., 2017Liddelow S.A.

Peterson T.C. et al.Neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia.Nature. 2017; 541: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar. We next performed differential expression analysis to further investigate the transcriptional differences between AC1 and AC2 (Table S3). Rbpj-κ depletion in AC2 induced activation of transcription factors such as Ascl1, Neurog1, and Olig2 (Figures 3B and 3C), which promote neuronal specification during corticogenesis in the developing brain (Liu et al., 2015Liu Y. Miao Q. Yuan J. Han S. Zhang P. Li S. Rao Z. Zhao W. Ye Q. Geng J. et al.Ascl1 Converts Dorsal Midbrain Astrocytes into Functional Neurons In Vivo.J.

Proneural genes in neocortical development.Neuroscience. 2013; 253: 256-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). AC2 cells were enriched in genes that are direct targets of Ascl1, such as Hes6 and Gadd45 g (Figure 3B; Table S3), whose induction has been shown at early stages in the neurogenic program (Fior and Henrique, 2005Fior R.

Additionally, glia in AC2 expressed the anti-proliferative gene Btg2 (also known as Tis21; Figure 3C), which has been recognized as a marker for neuron-generating progenitors at the onset of neurogenesis during central nervous system development (Iacopetti et al., 1999Iacopetti P. Michelini M. Stuckmann I. Oback B. Aaku-Saraste E. Huttner W.B. Expression of the antiproliferative gene TIS21 at the onset of neurogenesis identifies single neuroepithelial cells that switch from proliferative to neuron-generating division.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 4639-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Similar to other studies (Attardo et al., 2008Attardo A. Calegari F. Haubensak W. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Huttner W.B. Live imaging at the onset of cortical neurogenesis reveals differential appearance of the neuronal phenotype in apical versus basal progenitor progeny.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Attardo et al., 2010Attardo A. Fabel K. Krebs J. Haubensak W. Huttner W.B. Kempermann G. Tis21 expression marks not only populations of neurogenic precursor cells but also new postmitotic neurons in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reporting its expression throughout the neurogenic program, Btg2 could be found in our dataset in AC2 and the neural progenitor cluster (Figure 3C). Moreover, conditional deletion of Rbpj-κ led to downregulation of genes that are typically associated with neural stem cell quiescence in the adult neurogenic niches (Figure 3B; Table S3). Among these, Hes5, Hey1, Hes1, and Id4 are transcription factors that exert negative regulation of neurogenesis. Notably, compared with AC2, AC1 was enriched in genes implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis (e.g., Gene Ontology term GO:006695, Cyp4f15, Fdps, and Hmgcs1; Figure 3B), a key function astrocytes undertake to sustain the brain’s metabolic requirements under physiological conditions (Ferris et al., 2017Ferris H.A. Perry R.J. Moreira G.V. Shulman G.I. Horton J.D. Kahn C.R. Loss of astrocyte cholesterol synthesis disrupts neuronal function and alters whole-body metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified transcriptional differences between subtypes of cortical astrocytes (Bayraktar et al., 2020Bayraktar O.A. Bartels T. Holmqvist S. Kleshchevnikov V. Martirosyan A. Polioudakis D. Ben Haim L. Young A.M.H. Batiuk M.Y. Prakash K. et al.Astrocyte layers in the mammalian cerebral cortex revealed by a single-cell in situ transcriptomic map.Nat.

Although our scRNA-seq dataset was not able to segregate astrocytes based on their origin within the cortical layers, we could observe cells enriched in surface (Gfap and Id3), upper-layer (Chrdl1), and deep-layer (Il33 and Id3) markers in the wild-type (i.e., AC1) and neurogenic (i.e., AC2) astrocyte clusters (Figure 3F). This indicated that initiation of the neurogenic program is not restricted to a subtype of cortical astrocytes but is widespread throughout the cortical layers. Taken together, our scRNA-seq analysis enabled us to distinguish clusters of cortical astrocytes and neural progenitors that originated from local astroglia. Furthermore, differential expression analysis revealed that AC2 cells downregulate genes related to astrocyte-specific metabolic functions while concomitantly acquiring a transcriptional profile reminiscent of primed but still quiescent neural stem cells. We performed pseudotemporal analysis to computationally resolve the neurogenic trajectory and capture the molecular dynamics that drive the lineage fate conversion from astrocyte to neuron (Figure 4). For this purpose, we ran diffusion map (destiny v.2.12), a non-linear dimensionality reduction approach that reconstructs dynamic transcriptional programs and orders data points along specific differentiation traces (Angerer et al., 2016Angerer P. Haghverdi L. Büttner M. Theis F.J. Marr C. Buettner F. destiny: diffusion maps for large-scale single-cell data in R.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Gene loadings from previously computed principal-component analyses were provided as input (Table S1) after removing transcripts implicated in the cell cycle, which would otherwise dominate and skew the resulting pseudotemporal trajectory. Visualization of the top five dimensions calculated with a diffusion map allowed us to draw a continuum that connected astrocytes to their neurogenic progeny (Figure 4A and S4A). Astrocytes with intact Notch signaling (AC1) were polarized at one end of the pseudotemporal scale. Conversely, some astrocytes entering the neurogenic program (AC2) progressed toward a neural progenitor state, spreading along the x axis. The compactness of astrocytes relative to the neuroblast cluster on the diffusion map likely reflected the increased transcriptional heterogeneity across states as cells transition toward the neuronal lineage (Figure 4A). Notably, the diffusion map revealed that AC3 reactive astrocytes formed a separate branch that did not feed into the main neurogenic path (Figure 4A). Accordingly, these astrocytes rarely expressed the proneural transcription factor Ascl1 (expressed at low levels in 8% of these cells compared with 38% of cells in AC2; Figures 3C, 4B, and 4C). Instead, they were highly enriched in inflammatory response-related genes (Figure 3B; Table S2) and displayed hypertrophic processes, indicative of a reactive glia phenotype (Figure 4B). We assigned a pseudotemporal score to cells ordered along the first diffusion map component, which recapitulated the neurogenic trajectory (Figure 4A), and used this to detect transcriptional changes driving the lineage fate transition. Differential expression analysis across pseudotime was performed with Monocle v.2.10 (Qiu et al., 2017Qiu X. Mao Q. Tang Y. Wang L. Chawla R. Pliner H.A. Trapnell C. Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) and revealed the presence of five transcriptional signatures that identify distinct cell states along the neurogenic path (Figure 4D; Table S4). Gene Ontology analysis performed on each gene expression module enabled us to gain functional insight into the transcriptional programs characterizing each state (Figure 4D; Table S4). Modules 1 and 2 encompassed genes activated during the initial pseudotemporal phases. These were functionally related to the astroglial physiological roles of lipid (e.g., Slc27a1 and Pcyt2) and carbohydrate (e.g., Chst1) biosynthesis along with glutamate (e.g., Slc1a2 and Slc1a3) and water (e.g., Aqp4) transport. Downregulation of these transcripts was followed by a surge in the expression of ribosomal genes (e.g., Rpls, module 3; Figures 4D and 4E), which reflects the need for neurogenic cells to initiate protein biosynthesis programs in preparation for the lineage transition (Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015Llorens-Bobadilla E. Zhao S. Baser A. Saiz-Castro G. Zwadlo K. Martin-Villalba A.

Of note, higher ribosomal content was already displayed in a small portion of astrocytes from AC2 (Figure 4E), denoting their early commitment to the lineage fate switch. Concomitantly, cells induced expression of genes implicated in chromatin modification (e.g., Hdac2) as well as genes implicated in neu"

Fundamental to the design of rapid state responses is the ability to perform epidemiological model parameter inference for localised trajectory predictions. In this work, we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W3047218600,"Compared to other types of social networks, criminal networks present hard challenges, due to their strong resilience to disruption, which poses severe hurdles to law-enforcement agencies. Herein, we borrow methods and tools from Social Network Analysis to (i) unveil the structure of Sicilian Mafia gangs, based on two real-world datasets, and (ii) gain insights as to how to efficiently disrupt them. Mafia networks have peculiar features, due to the links distribution and strength, which makes them very different from other social networks, and extremely robust to exogenous perturbations. Analysts are also faced with the difficulty in collecting reliable datasets that accurately describe the gangs' internal structure and their relationships with the external world, which is why earlier studies are largely qualitative, elusive and incomplete. An added value of our work is the generation of two real-world datasets, based on raw data derived from juridical acts, relating to a Mafia organization that operated in Sicily during the first decade of 2000s. We created two different networks, capturing phone calls and physical meetings, respectively. Our network disruption analysis simulated different intervention procedures: (i) arresting one criminal at a time (sequential node removal); and (ii) police raids (node block removal). We measured the effectiveness of each approach through a number of network centrality metrics. We found Betweeness Centrality to be the most effective metric, showing how, by neutralizing only the 5% of the affiliates, network connectivity dropped by 70%. We also identified that, due the peculiar type of interactions in criminal networks (namely, the distribution of the interactions frequency) no significant differences exist between weighted and unweighted network analysis. Our work has significant practical applications for tackling criminal and terrorist networks."
https://openalex.org/W3047576413,"<h2>Summary</h2> Rodent studies have demonstrated the role of the mesoaccumbal circuit in reinforcement-based learning. Importantly, however, while phasic activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to reinforcement learning, rodent evidence suggests that slow changes in tonic VTA activity and associated accumbal dopamine release help regulate motivational behavior. Nonetheless, the consequences of sustained blockage of the mesoaccumbal circuit for motivation and reinforcement learning have not yet been examined in primates. Using a double-infection viral vector technique, we demonstrate that selective, unidirectional, and reversible blockage of the primarily dopaminergic mesoaccumbal circuit in monkeys increased network-level functional connectivity, especially in fronto-temporal cortex. These global network changes were not associated with deficits in reinforcement learning during an object discrimination reversal task. In contrast, sustained mesoaccumbal inactivation greatly reduced motivation for performing a motivation-based decision-making task. Thus, the mesoaccumbal pathway in primates is critical for high-effort motivation but not for all forms of reinforcement-based learning."
https://openalex.org/W3047098525,"Procyandin A2 (PCA2) is a polyphenolic compound which is isolated from grape seeds. It has been reported that PCA2 exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, but its molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. This study tests the hypothesis that PCA2 suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and oxidative stress through targeting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways in RAW264.7 cells. PCA2 (20, 40, 80 μM) exhibited no significant cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 cells and showed an inhibitory effect on an LPS-induced nitrite level. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were suppressed by PCA2 with a concentration range of 0-80 μM. The mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were inhibited by PCA2 (80 μM). The hallmark-protein expression of the NF-κB (p-IKKα/β, p-IκBα, and p-p65) and MAPK (p-p38, p-JNK, and p-ERK) pathways were decreased by PCA2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. In addition, immunofluorescence results indicated that PCA2 (80 μM) promoted the translocation of NF-κB/p65 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. PCA2 upregulated the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 and downregulated the expression of Keap-1. Simultaneously, PCA2 (80 μM) reversed LPS-induced Nrf2 translocation from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Collectively, PCA2 protect cells against the damage from inflammation and oxidative injury, which suggest a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory and oxidative stress through targeting NF-κB, MAPK, and Nrf2 pathways in RAW264.7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3047287983,"Careful design of experiments using living organisms (e.g. mice) is of critical importance from both an ethical and a scientific standpoint. Randomization should, whenever possible, be an integral part of such experimental design to reduce bias thereby increasing its reliability and reproducibility. To keep the sample size as low as possible, one might take randomization one step further by controlling for baseline variations in the dependent variable(s) and/or certain known covariates. To give an example, in animal experiments aimed to study atherosclerosis development, one would want to control for baseline characteristics such as plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels and body weight. This can be done by first defining blocks to create balance among groups in terms of group size and baseline characteristics, followed by random assignment of the blocks to the various control and intervention groups. In the current study we developed a novel, user-friendly tool that allows users to easily randomize animals into blocks and identify random block divisions that are well-balanced based on given baseline characteristics, making randomization time-efficient and easy-to-use. Here, we present the resulting software tool that we have named RandoMice."
https://openalex.org/W3047558612,"Lightning flashes have been observed by a number of missions that visited or flew by Jupiter over the past several decades. Imagery led to a flash rate estimate of about 4 × 10−3 flashes per square kilometre per year (refs. 1,2). The spatial extent of Voyager flashes was estimated to be about 30 kilometres (half-width at half-maximum intensity, HWHM), but the camera was unlikely to have detected the dim outer edges of the flashes, given its weak response to the brightest spectral line of Jovian lightning emission, the 656.3-nanometre Hα line of atomic hydrogen1,3–6. The spatial resolution of some cameras allowed investigators to confirm 22 flashes with HWHM greater than 42 kilometres, and to estimate one with an HWHM of 37 to 45 kilometres (refs. 1,7–9). These flashes, with optical energies comparable to terrestrial ‘superbolts’—of (0.02–1.6) × 1010 joules—have been interpreted as tracers of moist convection originating near the 5-bar level of Jupiter’s atmosphere (assuming photon scattering from points beneath the clouds)1–3,7,8,10–12. Previous observations of lightning have been limited by camera sensitivity, distance from Jupiter and long exposures (about 680 milliseconds to 85 seconds), meaning that some measurements were probably superimposed flashes reported as one1,2,7,9,10,13. Here we report optical observations of lightning flashes by the Juno spacecraft with energies of approximately 105–108 joules, flash durations as short as 5.4 milliseconds and inter-flash separations of tens of milliseconds, with typical terrestrial energies. The flash rate is about 6.1 × 10−2 flashes per square kilometre per year, more than an order of magnitude greater than hitherto seen. Several flashes are of such small spatial extent that they must originate above the 2-bar level, where there is no liquid water14,15. This implies that multiple mechanisms for generating lightning on Jupiter need to be considered for a full understanding of the planet’s atmospheric convection and composition. Small lightning flashes detected on Jupiter by Juno have shallow origins above the 2-bar level of Jupiter’s atmosphere where temperatures are too low for liquid water to exist."

These methods, however, are not specific to cancer cells and instead attack every cell present, including normal cells. Personalized therapies provide more efficient treatment options as they target the individual’s genetic makeup. The goal of this study was to identify the frequency of causal genetic mutations across a variety of lung cancer subtypes in the earlier stages. 833 samples of non-small cell lung cancer from 799 patients who received resection of their lung cancer, were selected for molecular analysis of six known mutations, including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, HER2 and ALK. A SNaPshot assay was used for point mutations and fragment analysis searched for insertions and deletions. ALK was evaluated by IHC +/- FISH. Statistical analysis was performed to determine correlations between molecular and clinical/pathological patient data. None of the tested variants were identified in most (66.15%) of cases. The observed frequencies among the total samples vs. only the adenocarcinoma cases were notable different, with the highest frequency being the KRAS mutation (24.49% vs. 35.55%), followed by EGFR (6.96% vs. 10.23%), PIK3CA (1.20% vs. 0.9%), BRAF (1.08% vs. 1.62%), ALK (0.12% vs. 0.18%), while the lowest was the HER2 mutation (0% for both). The statistical analysis yielded correlations between presence of a mutation with gender, cancer type, vascular invasion and smoking history.

A role for infant vocalizations produced endogenously, potentially providing raw material for interaction and a basis for growth in the vocal capacity itself, has received less attention. We report that in laboratory recordings of infants and their parents, the bulk of infant speech-like vocalizations, or ""protophones"", were directed toward no one and instead appeared to be generated endogenously, mostly in exploration of vocal abilities. The tendency to predominantly produce protophones without directing them to others occurred both during periods when parents were instructed to interact with their infants and during periods when parents were occupied with an interviewer, with the infants in the room. The results emphasize the infant as an agent in vocal learning, even when not interacting socially and suggest an enhanced perspective on foundations for vocal language."

Occasionally, serine residues are also incorporated into the cross-bridges by enzymes that have heretofore not been identified. Here, we show that the FemA/FemB homologues FmhA and FmhC pair with FemA and FemB to incorporate Gly-Ser dipeptides into cross-bridges and to confer resistance to lysostaphin, a secreted bacteriocin that cleaves the pentaglycine cross-bridge. FmhA incorporates serine residues at positions 3 and 5 of the cross-bridge. In contrast, FmhC incorporates a single serine at position 5. Serine incorporation also lowers resistance toward oxacillin, an antibiotic that targets penicillin-binding proteins, in both methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. FmhC is encoded by a gene immediately adjacent to lytN, which specifies a hydrolase that cleaves the bond between the fifth glycine of cross-bridges and the alanine of the adjacent stem peptide.

The growth rates of these strains monitored as absorbance of cultures over time at 600 nm (A600) revealed no discernible difference between WT and fmhA, fmhC, or fmhA/fmhC mutants (Fig. 1B). Differences in cross-bridge structure led to lysostaphin resistance, i.e. reduced rates of bacterial lysis. This can be measured by monitoring the reduction in A600 over time following addition of lysostaphin to bacterial cultures. Inactivation of fmhC but not fmhA results in a small increase in lysostaphin-mediated lysis (Fig. 1C). To further investigate differences in the cell wall structure, murein sacculi of WT and mutant strains were isolated and subjected to acid and enzymatic treatments to remove teichoic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides.

https://openalex.org/W3047596589,"Few studies have explored the mechanisms coupling estrogen signals to metabolic demand in endothelial cells. We recently showed that 17β-estradiol (E2) triggers angiogenesis via the membrane G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and the key glycolytic protein PFKFB3 as a downstream effector. We herein investigated whether estrogenic agents regulate the stability and/or degradation of glycolytic proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Similarly to E2, the GPER selective agonist G1 rapidly increased PFKFB3 protein amounts, without affecting mRNA levels. In the presence of cycloheximide, E2 and G1 treatment counteracted PFKFB3 degradation over time, whereas E2-induced PFKFB3 stabilization was abolished by the GPER antagonist G15. Inhibitors of selective SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase (SMER-3) and proteasome (MG132) rapidly increased PFKFB3 protein levels. Accordingly, ubiquitin-bound PFKFB3 was lower in E2- or G1-treated HUVECs. Both agents increased deubiquitinase USP19 levels through GPER signaling. Notably, USP 19 siRNA decreased PFKFB3 levels and abolished E2- and G1-mediated HUVEC tubularization. Finally, E2 and G1 treatments rapidly enhanced glucose transporter GLUT1 levels via GPER independent of transcriptional activation. These findings provide new evidence on mechanisms coupling estrogen signals with the glycolytic program in endothelium and unravel the role of USP19 as a target of the pro-angiogenic effect of estrogenic agents."

We examined their associations with relapse-free survival and overall survival in combination with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in patients with colorectal liver metastases.Altogether 441 consecutive patients undergoing liver resection at Helsinki University Hospital between 1998 and 2013 were included in the study. Pre- and postoperative YKL-40 and IL-6 were determined from serum samples with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, and CRP, CEA, and CA19-9 by routine methods. Associations between these biomarkers and relapse-free and overall survival were examined using Cox regression analysis.Patients with 2-5 elevated biomarkers were at an increased risk of relapse compared to those with 0-1 elevated biomarkers, preoperatively (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.1-1.72) or postoperatively (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.23-1.92). Patients with 2-5 elevated biomarkers were also at an increased risk of death compared to those with 0-1 elevated biomarkers, preoperatively (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.39-2.24) or postoperatively (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.44-2.33).The results suggest that a protein panel of the inflammatory biomarkers YKL-40, IL-6, and CRP, and the cancer biomarkers CEA and CA19-9 might identify patients that benefit from more aggressive treatment and surveillance, although the additional value of IL-6 and CRP in this aspect is limited."
https://openalex.org/W3047565580,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a pleiotropic ciliopathy caused by dysfunction of primary cilia. More than half of BBS patients carry mutations in one of eight genes encoding for subunits of a protein complex, the BBSome, which mediates trafficking of ciliary cargoes. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of the BBSome assembly in living cells and how this process is spatially regulated. We generated a large library of human cell lines deficient in a particular BBSome subunit and expressing another subunit tagged with a fluorescent protein. We analyzed these cell lines utilizing biochemical assays, conventional and expansion microscopy, and quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Our data revealed that the BBSome formation is a sequential process. We show that the pre-BBSome is nucleated by BBS4 and assembled at pericentriolar satellites, followed by the translocation of the BBSome into the ciliary base mediated by BBS1. Our results provide a framework for elucidating how BBS-causative mutations interfere with the biogenesis of the BBSome."
https://openalex.org/W3047060857,"Country-level census data are typically collected once every 10 years. However, conflicts, migration, urbanization, and natural disasters can rapidly shift local population patterns. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a “bottom-up”-method to estimate local population density in the between-census years by combining household surveys with contemporaneous geo-spatial data, including village-area and satellite imagery-based indicators. We apply this technique to the case of Sri Lanka using Poisson regression models based on variables selected using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). The model is estimated in villages sampled in the 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, and is employed to obtain out-of-sample density estimates in the non-surveyed villages. These estimates approximate the census density accurately and are more precise than other bottom-up studies using similar geo-spatial data. While most open-source population products redistribute census population “top-down” from higher to lower spatial units using areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping techniques, these products become less accurate as the census itself ages. Our method circumvents the problem of the aging census by relying instead on more up-to-date household surveys. The collective evidence suggests that our method is cost effective in tracking local population density with greater frequency in the between-census years."
https://openalex.org/W3047226623,"Regular exercise is an effective strategy that is used to prevent and treat obesity as well as type 2 diabetes. Exercise-induced myokine secretion is considered a mechanism that coordinates communication between muscles and other organs. In order to examine the possibility of novel communications from muscle to adipose tissue mediated by myokines, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with C2C12 myotube electrical pulse stimulation-conditioned media (EPS-CM), using a C2C12 myotube contraction system stimulated by an electrical pulse. Continuous treatment with myotube EPS-CM promoted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes via the upregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) 2 and PPARγ-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, our results revealed that myotube EPS-CM induces lipolysis and secretion of adiponectin in mature adipocytes. EPS-CM obtained from a C2C12 myoblast culture did not induce such changes in these genes, suggesting that contraction-induced myokine(s) secretion occurs particularly in differentiated myotubes. Thus, contraction-induced secretion of myokine(s) promotes adipogenesis and lipid metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings suggest the possibility that skeletal muscle communicates to adipose tissues during exercise, probably by the intermediary of unidentified myokines."
https://openalex.org/W3048065557,"In tauopathies, forms pathogenic fibrils with distinct conformations (termed tau strains) and acts as an aggregation seed templating the conversion of normal into isomorphic fibrils. Previous research showed that the aggregation core of fibril covers the C-terminal region (243–406 amino acids (aa)) and differs among the diseases. However, the mechanisms by which distinct fibrous structures are formed and inherited via templated aggregation are still unknown. Here, we sought to identify the key sequences of seed-dependent aggregation. To identify sequences for which deletion reduces aggregation, SH-SY5Y cells expressing a series of 10 partial deletion (Del 1–10, covering 244–400 aa) mutants of tau-CTF24 (243–441 aa) were treated with seeds prepared from a different tauopathy patient's brain (Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration) or recombinant tau, and then seed-dependent aggregation was assessed biochemically. We found that the Del 8 mutant lacking 353–368 aa showed significantly decreased aggregation in both cellular and in vitro models. Furthermore, to identify the minimum sequence responsible for aggregation, we systematically repeated cellular aggregation assays for the delineation of shorter deletion sites and revealed that Asn-368 mutation suppressed aggregation triggered by an AD seed, but not using other tauopathy seeds. Our study suggested that 353–368 aa is a novel aggregation-responsible sequence other than PHF6 and PHF6*, and within this sequence, the Asn-368 residue plays a role in strain-specific aggregation in different tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3047202792,"MicroRNAs have been recently shown to be important regulators of lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms of microRNA-mediated regulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) biosynthesis in vertebrates remain largely unknown. Herein, we for the first time addressed the role of miR-26a in LC-PUFA biosynthesis in the marine rabbitfish Siganus canaliculatus. The results showed that miR-26a was significantly down-regulated in liver of rabbitfish reared in brackish water and in S. canaliculatus hepatocyte line (SCHL) incubated with the LC-PUFA precursor α-linolenic acid, suggesting that miR-26a may be involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis because of its abundance being regulated by factors affecting LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Opposite patterns were observed in the expression of liver X receptor α (lxrα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (srebp1), as well as the LC-PUFA biosynthesis–related genes (Δ4 fads2, Δ6Δ5 fads2, and elovl5) in SCHL cells incubated with α-linolenic acid. Luciferase reporter assays revealed rabbitfish lxrα as a target of miR-26a, and overexpression of miR-26a in SCHL cells markedly reduced protein levels of Lxrα, Srebp1, and Δ6Δ5 Fads2 induced by the agonist T0901317. Moreover, increasing endogenous Lxrα by knockdown of miR-26a facilitated Srebp1 activation and concomitant increased expression of genes involved in LC-PUFA biosynthesis and consequently promoted LC-PUFA biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate a critical role of miR-26a in regulating LC-PUFA biosynthesis through targeting the Lxrα–Srebp1 pathway and provide new insights into the regulatory network controlling LC-PUFA biosynthesis and accumulation in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W3047317722,"The study aimed at determining the EEG correlates of concentration on either low or high-distressed tinnitus.Sixty-seven patients (36 women, mean age = 50.34 ± 12.94 years) with chronic tinnitus were assigned to either a high (HD) or low (LD) tinnitus-related distress group based on THI results. All participants took part in the EEG study comprising two 3-4 min blocks of focusing on either tinnitus (Tinnitus Focus Condition, TFC) or the sensations from one's own body (Body Focus Condition, BFC). The absolute power and current density of 8 frequency bands in 7 clusters were compared between conditions and groups.The most pronounced differences were found in the HD patients in the TFC, relative to the BFC, i.e. reduced power of frontally distributed low alpha (8-10 Hz) and posterior high alpha (10-12 Hz) as well as lower current density of 8-10 Hz rhythm over the right frontal/anterior cingulate cortex and higher middle beta (15-18 Hz) density in the precuneus. The HD, relative to LD patients, in both conditions, exhibited increased low beta (12-15 Hz) power over the left middle area and greater higher beta (15-25 Hz) power in the left posterior region.The present study contrasted bioelectrical activity, acquired when concentrating on tinnitus with EEG data collected whilst patients focused on their body. Decreased alpha power and current density in the frontal/cingulate cortex when listening to bothersome tinnitus might reflect greater cortical arousal whereas increased beta power and density in the precuneus/posterior cingulate activity in this condition could be indicative for elevated tension or augmented cognitive/emotional processing of tinnitus sound. Enhanced beta rhythm in patients with high versus low tinnitus distress, observed independently of the study condition, may be due to greater self-focused attention or more active processing of sensations derived from the own body."
https://openalex.org/W3047374524,"Background The global pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has resulted in unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems. One barrier to widespread testing has been a paucity of traditional respiratory viral swab collection kits relative to the demand. Whether other sample collection kits, such as widely available MRSA nasal swabs can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. Methods We compared simultaneous nasal MRSA swabs (COPAN ESwabs ® 480C flocked nasal swab in 1mL of liquid Amies medium) and virals wabs (BD H192(07) flexible mini-tip flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in 3mL Universal Transport Medium) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing using Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay on patients over a 4-day period. When the results were discordant, the viral swab sample was run again on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress ® SARS-CoV-2 assay. Results Of the 81 included samples, there were 19 positives and 62 negatives in viral media and 18 positives and 63 negative in the MRSA swabs. Amongst all included samples, there was concordance between the COPAN ESwabs ® 480C and the viral swabs in 78 (96.3%). Conclusion We found a high rate of concordance in test results between COPAN ESwabs ® 480C in Amies solution and BD H192(07) nasopharyngeal swabs in in 3 mL of Universal Viral Transport medium viral media. Clinicians and laboratories should feel better informed and assured using COPAN ESwabs ® 480C to help in the diagnosis of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3047266351,"Background Despite the use of high-sensitive cardiac troponin there remains a group of high-sensitive cardiac troponin negative patients with unstable angina with a non-neglectable risk for future adverse cardiovascular events, emphasising the need for additional risk stratification. Plasma extracellular vesicles are small bilayer membrane vesicles known for their potential role as biomarker source. Their role in unstable angina remains unexplored. We investigate if extracellular vesicle proteins are associated with unstable angina in patients with chest pain and low high-sensitive cardiac troponin. Methods The MINERVA study included patients presenting with acute chest pain but no acute coronary syndrome. We performed an exploratory retrospective case-control analysis among 269 patients. Cases were defined as patients with low high-sensitive cardiac troponin and proven ischemia. Patients without ischemia were selected as controls. Blood samples were fractionated to analyse the EV proteins in three plasma-subfractions: TEX, HDL and LDL. Protein levels were quantified using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Results Lower levels of (adjusted) EV cystatin c in the TEX subfraction were associated with having unstable angina (OR 0.93 95% CI 0.88–0.99). Conclusion In patients with acute chest pain but low high-sensitive cardiac troponin, lower levels of plasma extracellular vesicle cystatin c are associated with having unstable angina. This finding is hypothesis generating only considering the small sample size and needs to be confirmed in larger cohort studies, but still identifies extracellular vesicle proteins as source for additional risk stratification."

The objective of this study was to assess the environmental risk factors inside and outside CPFs. We monitored the temperature, humidity, particle number, colony number of microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects in and around our CPF monthly over one year. The temperature in the CPF was constant but the humidity fluctuated depending on the humidity outside. The particle number correlated with the number of entries to the room. Except for winter, colonies of microorganisms and harmful insects were detected depending on the cleanliness of the room. Seven bacterial and two fungal species were identified by PCR analyses. Psocoptera and Acari each accounted for 41% of the total trapped insects. These results provide useful data for taking the appropriate steps to keep entire CPFs clean."
https://openalex.org/W3047460916,"The global energy system changes towards renewables-dominated and liberalized markets. This requires making novel trade-offs between the profitable development of hydropower and its environmental effects on the natural flow regime. Here, we used a pristine river as a model for how these future changes will affect the natural flow regime and identify future changes on previously overlooked levels. We found that damming and discharging based on market prices leads to first- and second-level deviation from natural flows. Beyond these effects, we identified a third level of distance from natural flow. This third level is created by the transition towards a renewables-dominated energy system. The volatile energy input from renewables incentivizes hydropower plant operators to discharge based on more flexible trading behavior. We conclude that novel economic models be combined with tailored implementations of environmental flows. This will allow to find novel solutions for the trade-off between market liberalization and sustainable hydropower development."
https://openalex.org/W3047502640,"Aquatic weeds such as muskgrass (Chara spp.), water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillate), filamentous algae (Lyngbya wollei), and duckweed (Lemna minor) thrive in farm canals within the Everglades Agricultural Area of South Florida. Their presence, particularly during the summer months is an environmental concern with regards to water quality, in addition to being a nuisance because of their ability to multiply and spread rapidly in open waters causing restricted drainage/irrigation flow and low dissolved oxygen levels. Chemical control is effective but can have undesirable off-target effects, so reduced herbicide use is desirable. Hence, need exists to discover ways in which these weeds could be best managed or utilized. The objective of this research was to evaluate the allelopathic effect of these weeds to determine their use as potential biopesticides. Six aqueous extracts were tested against 100 bacterial strains isolated from plants and soil to evaluate their antimicrobial activity. These extracts were also used to determine their insecticidal and antifeedant effects on fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda). Both extracts and powder form of the aquatic weeds were tested for their herbicidal activity towards seed germination and growth of three common terrestrial weed species. At a dilution of 1:100 and 1:1,000, none of the aquatic weeds inhibited in-vitro growth of the bacterial strains, with one exception (filamentous algae extract at 1:100 reduced growth of one bacterial isolate by 54%). Water lettuce reduced the survival rate of FAW by 14% while hydrilla and duckweed caused 11% and 9% reduction of FAW growth, respectively. Powdered duckweed inhibited the growth of nutsedge by 41%, whereas filamentous algae powder and extract reduced germination of amaranth by 20% and 28%, respectively. Harvesting these weeds and converting them into useable compounds could not only eliminate the in situ farm canal and water quality problems but also result in development of new soil amendments or biopesticides."

Xiang Q. Dong S. Cordycepin inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy of mesenchymal stem cells through PI3K/Bapx1 and Notch signaling pathway.BMB Rep. 2016; 49 (27439604): 548-55310.5483/bmbrep.2016.49.10.071Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SOX9 is also expressed on astrocyte progenitor cells. Conditional deletion of SOX9 prolongs neurogenesis and delays gliogenesis (19Stolt C.C. Lommes P. Sock E. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. Wegner M. The Sox9 transcription factor determines glial fate choice in the developing spinal cord.Genes Dev. 2003; 17 (12842915): 1677-168910.1101/gad.259003Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). A complex of SOX9 and NFIA co-regulates genes induced after glial initiation (20Kang P. Lee H.K. Glasgow S.M. Finley M. Donti T. Gaber Z.B. Graham B.H. Foster A.E. Novitch B.G. Gronostajski R.M. Deneen B. Sox9 and NFIA coordinate a transcriptional regulatory cascade during the initiation of gliogenesis.Neuron. 2012; 74 (22500632): 79-9410.1016/j.neuron.2012.01.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To date, no studies have examined the functions of PITX1 in astrocyte differentiation or function. In this study, we demonstrate that PITX1 expression increased during human astrocyte differentiation and that activation of the SOX9 promoter induced by PITX1 is critical for this process. We obtained mature astrocytes from hESCs using the multistep differentiation method developed in our laboratory (21Shaltouki A. Peng J. Liu Q. Rao M.S. Zeng X. Efficient generation of astrocytes from human pluripotent stem cells in defined conditions.Stem Cells. 2013; 31 (23341249): 941-95210.1002/stem.1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Swistowski A.

Briefly, NPCs were derived from hESCs through sequential formation of embryonic bodies, rosettes, and neurospheres (Fig. 1A, panels a–e), which finally differentiated into star-shaped astrocytes (Fig. 1A, panels f–h). Astrocyte differentiation was confirmed by immunostaining for GFAP (Fig. 1A, panels i and j), an intermediate filament protein that helps to maintain the mechanical strength of astrocytes (23Eng L.F. Ghirnikar R.S. GFAP and astrogliosis.Brain Pathol. 1994; 4 (7952264): 229-23710.1111/j.1750-3639.1994.tb00838.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) and is highly expressed on reactive astrocytes (24Pekny M.

We examined changes in the expression levels of differentiation-associated genes during astrocyte differentiation using microarrays. These analyses identified 243 genes showing a more than 10-fold change between the NPC and mature astrocyte stages (days 21 and 28). Among these genes, we focused on 76 genes encoding transcriptional factors. Heat maps (Fig. S2A) showed clustering between NPC and mature astrocyte expression groups. Among these genes, 13 up-regulated genes were selected for confirmation by real-time PCR, none of which have been studied for association with astrocyte differentiation or function (Fig. S2B). Finally, we selected the PITX1 gene because it was markedly up-regulated at both mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein levels (Fig. 1C). We also examined CD44 and GFAP protein expression levels by Western blotting to confirm astrocyte differentiation. Sequential Western blotting during differentiation revealed CD44 expression prior to detectable GFAP expression, indicating that CD44 is expressed by astrocyte precursors, consistent with the findings of previous studies (28Cai N. Kurachi M. Shibasaki K. Okano-Uchida T. Ishizaki Y. CD44-positive cells are candidates for astrocyte precursor cells in developing mouse cerebellum.Cerebellum. 2012; 11 (21732075): 181-19310.1007/s12311-011-0294-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y.

Biol. 2004; 276 (15531362): 31-4610.1016/j.ydbio.2004.08.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Specifically, differentiating astrocytes expressed CD44 on day 14, and expression levels of both GFAP and CD44 gradually increased from days 21 to 28. Therefore, we used CD44 as an astrocyte precursor marker and GFAP as a mature astrocyte marker. Next, to confirm this expression pattern in vivo, we examined PITX1 expression levels at different stages of astrocyte differentiation in rat embryonic brain. During rat brain development, cell layers are distinguishable on embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). In this process, the single cortical ventricular zone (VZ) is divided into the subventricular zone (SVZ), intermediate zone (IZ), subplate, cortical plate (CP), and marginal zone (30Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 (17514196): 427-43710.1038/nrn2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). On E18.5, most of these layers are clearly distinguished as in the adult brain (31Del Río J.A. Martínez A. Auladell C. Soriano E. Developmental history of the subplate and developing white matter in the murine neocortex: neuronal organization and relationship with the main afferent systems at embryonic and perinatal stages.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10 (10920050): 784-80110.1093/cercor/10.8.784Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Astrocyte development begins with the emergence of radial glial cells in VZ on E12.5. As brain development progresses and distinct layers form, radial glial cells migrate from VZ to SVZ and IZ and concomitantly differentiate into glial progenitor cells before finally differentiating into mature astrocytes in the cerebral cortex (32Tabata H. Diverse subtypes of astrocytes and their development during corticogenesis.Front. Neurosci. 2015; 9 (25904839): 11410.3389/fnins.2015.00114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To examine the temporal and spatial profiles of PITX1 expression in differentiating astrocytes, we prepared sections of rat embryonic brain and conducted co-immunofluorescence staining for S100β as an astrocyte progenitor marker and GFAP as a mature astrocyte marker. S100β expression was previously demonstrated in mouse astrocyte progenitor cells in VZ (33Zhao X. Chen Y. Zhu Q. Huang H. Teng P. Zheng K. Hu X. Xie B. Zhang Z. Sander M. Qiu M. Control of astrocyte progenitor specification, migration and maturation by Nkx6.1 homeodomain transcription factor.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (25285789): e10917110.1371/journal.pone.0109171Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, PITX1 was weakly expressed in the innermost VZ on E14.5, but little GFAP expression was detected. On E16.5, VZ was divided into layers as revealed by the S100β staining pattern, and S100β-positive cells in VZ, SVZ, and IZ co-expressed both PITX1 and GFAP, indicating that astrocyte progenitor cells and mature astrocytes co-exist in these regions. On E18.5, as brain development progressed, layer size further increased, and the expression of PITX1 disappeared completely, whereas the expression of S100β weakened. Conversely, GFAP was robustly expressed in SP and CP, indicating that mature astrocytes had migrated to the upper part of the brain. In summary, we confirmed that PITX1 is expressed by astrocyte progenitor cells in the early stages of glial cell development (E14.5–16.5) but is lost in mature astrocyte at E18.5, suggesting PITX1 plays an essential role in the early stages of astrocyte differentiation during brain development. To directly examine if PITX1 regulates astrocyte differentiation, we generated stably YFP-PITX1–overexpressing NPC lines using pLV-Venus-PITX1 lentivirus and compared astrocyte marker patterns and morphology during astrocyte differentiation to YFP-Vector–overexpressing NPC lines. First, human hESCs overexpressing YFP-PITX1 or YFP-Vector were selected using FACS. The fluorescence of sorted cells expressing YFP-PITX1 was weaker than those of sorted cells expressing YFP-Vector alone, but only cells with weak YFP-PITX1 fluorescence could survive and differentiate into NPCs (Fig. S3). The derived NPCs were checked for expression of the neural pluripotency marker Nestin and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (34Park D. Xiang A.P. Mao F.F. Zhang L. Di C.G. Liu X.M. Shao Y. Ma B.F. Lee J.H. Ha K.S. Walton N. Lahn B.T. Nestin is required for the proper self-renewal of neural stem cells.Stem Cells. 2010; 28 (20963821): 2162-217110.1002/stem.541Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 35Marinaro C. Butti E.

In addition, PITX1 overexpression was confirmed through immunofluorescence staining with anti-PITX1 antibodies (Fig. S4). These stable NPC lines expressing YFP-Vec (YFP-vector stable cells) or YFP-PITX1 (YFP-PITX1 stable cells) were subjected to our astrocyte differentiation protocol over 28 days, and we monitored YFP fluorescence and morphology throughout this process (Fig. 2A and Fig. S5). In addition, the expression levels of GFAP and PITX1 were monitored by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Western blotting confirmed that GFAP protein appeared earlier in the YFP-PITX1 line compared with the YFP-Vector line. Expression of GFAP appeared on day 14 in the YFP-PITX1 line cells and was greater than that in YFP-Vector line on day 21 (Fig. 2. B and C). Next, using immunofluorescence, we counted the number of GFAP-positive cells (red) of the total population of cells (stained with DAPI, blue). In accordance with the Western blotting results, the number of GFAP-positive cells increased rapidly in the YFP-PITX1 line compared with control the YFP-Vector line, again with GFAP-positive cells first appearing on day 14, reaching higher numbers than in the YFP-Vector line on day 21 (Fig. 2, D and E). To provide further evidence that PITX1 promotes astrocyte differentiation, we prepared PITX1-knockdown NPCs using a lentiviral vector encoding a targeted shRNA and compared astrocyte marker expression and morphology with those of NPCs expressing a scrambled shRNA. Astrocytes expressing scrambled shRNA had long and thin bodies, whereas PITX1-knockdown cells had wide and flat bodies on day 28 (the final day of astrocyte differentiation) (Fig. 3A). Western blotting indicated that GFAP expression was eliminated in PITX1-knockdown cells but was up-regulated in cells transfected with scrambled shRNA during astrocyte differentiation (Fig. 3, B and C). Immunofluorescence staining revealed reduced GFAP-positive cell numbers (red) among all DAPI-stained cells (blue) in PITX1 knockdown cells compared with scrambled shRNA-infected cells on days 21 and 28 (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, these findings of PITX1-overxpressing and PITX1-knockdown cells demonstrate that PITX1 is essential for astrocyte differentiation from NPCs. The level of PITX1 protein gradually increased during astrocyte differentiation (Fig. 1, B and C), and knockdown of PITX1 completely blocked astrocyte differentiation (Fig. 3, B and D), strongly suggesting that PITX1 is involved in the initiation of astrocyte differentiation. To identify the downstream of PITX1 for astrocyte differentiation, we selected several known targets and examined whether expression levels were altered by stable PITX1 overexpression (Fig. S6). We focused specifically on the relationship between PITX1 and SOX9 because SOX9 is an important transcription factor in gliogenesis and is a key factor governing the neuron–glial switch during brain development (19Stolt C.C. Lommes P. Sock E. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. Wegner M. The Sox9 transcription factor determines glial fate choice in the developing spinal cord.Genes Dev. 2003; 17 (12842915): 1677-168910.1101/gad.259003Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 20Kang P.

Consistent with PITX1-dependent regulation, YFP-PITX1 NPCs resulted in earlier expression pattern of SOX9 mRNA (days 7–14) compared with in YFP-Vector NPCs (days 14–21) (Fig. 4A). Next, we examined the protein levels of PITX1 and SOX9 during astrocyte differentiation. Expression of PITX1 protein gradually increased from the beginning of differentiation, whereas that of SOX9 increased markedly from day 7 to 14, after which it decreased (Fig. 4B). Further, in accord with real-time PCR results, SOX9 protein increased faster in YFP-PITX1-NPCs compared with in YFP-Vector NPCs (Fig. 4C). SOX9 protein level peaked at day 14 in YFP-Vector NPCs but was highest at day 0 (before differentiation) in YFP-PITX1-NPCs. Next, we investigated whether SOX9 and PITX1 expression levels were associated during early astrocyte differentiation following PIXT1 overexpression or knockdown. Differentiating astrocytes were infected with lentivirus on day 6 and harvested on day 9 for the measurement of protein expression by Western blotting. In addition, the influence of PITX1 on SOX9 expression was examined by controlling the transfection multiplicity of infection (MOI). Overexpression of PITX1 increased SOX9 expression during early astrocyte differentiation (Fig. 4D), whereas its knockdown reduced the levels of SOX9 protein compared with in control. Moreover, we demonstrated this association more precisely by manipulating the magnitude of transfection (2 or 4 MOI). Again, reduction in SOX9 expression paralleled the reduction in PITX1 protein expression (Fig. 4E). Therefore, we conclude that PITX1 induces SOX9 protein expression during early astrocyte differentiation. PITX1 activates transcription of genes by binding to the sequence TAATCC within the promoter (11Prince K.L. Walvoord E.C. Rhodes S.J. The role of homeodomain transcription factors in heritable pituitary disease.Nat. Rev.

Therefore, we investigated the SOX9 promoter to determine whether it contains this PITX1-binding motif. The SOX9 promoter contains binding sites for multiple transcription factors, most of which are located in the proximal promoter region within 300 bp of the transcription start site (TSS). The proximal promoter region was highly conserved among chicks, mice, and humans (37Ushita M. Saito T. Ikeda T. Yano F. Higashikawa A. Ogata N. Chung U. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Transcriptional induction of SOX9 by NF-κB family member RelA in chondrogenic cells.Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2009; 17 (19254740): 1065-107510.1016/j.joca.2009.02.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The SOX9 promoter has two expected PITX1-binding motifs between −1015 bp and TSS, a TAATCC sequence at −578 bp, and a CAATCC sequence (similar to the PITX1 motif) at −129 bp. We first conducted luciferase assay to confirm that PITX1 regulates the SOX9 promoter directly. The luciferase reporter gene was inserted after the SOX9 promoter (−1015 bp to +14 bp) and co-transfected with PITX1 into BE(2)C cells. Luciferase activity was found to increase in parallel with PITX1 concentration (Fig. 5A), consistent with direct induction of SOX9 by PIXT1 binding to the SOX9 promoter. We next identified the SOX9 promoter-binding site by serial deletion of promoter sequences. A series of 5′-deletions of the −1015 to +14-bp fragments were created in the luciferase reporter gene, and BE(2)C cells were co-transfected with these reporter constructs along with the PITX1 gene. Luciferase activity was greatly reduced by removing a region including the predicted PITX1-binding CAATCC motif at −129 bp, but it was not changed by deleting a region including the other tentative PITX1-binding motif TAATCC at −578 bp (Fig. 5C). The PITX1-binding sequence in the SOX9 promoter is shown in Fig. 5B. Compared with the full-length SOX9 promoter (−1015 bp to +14 bp), luciferase activity was decreased by half when the predicted PITX1-binding motif CAATCC at −129 bp was removed (Fig. 5D). These findings indicate that PITX1 activates the SOX9 promoter via a unique PITX1-binding motif CAATCC at −"

Since signal processing of assistive hearing devices often modifies or masks the peripheral binaural head-shadow or better-ear effects, central binaural processing should be measured separately. In a prospective study, 10 listeners with normal hearing were tested with the German matrix sentence test in a set-up with two loudspeakers located at opposite angles in the horizontal plane with respect to S0N0. The speech reception threshold (SRT) was investigated depending on the separation angle between speech and noise. The lowest (best) SRT was obtained for a separation of target and interfering source from S0N0 at an angle of about S±60°N∓60°. The derived normative curve was comparable to SRTs predicted by the binaural-speech-intelligibility-model. The systematic separation of signal and noise showed a significant improvement in speech intelligibility for normal-hearing people even for small separation angles. This experimental setting was verified. This study aimed to assess the effect of small sound source separation on binaural hearing and speech perception."

To address these problems, we aimed to map the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to CBSD foliar and root necrosis symptoms, foliar CMD and CGM symptoms in a full-sib mapping population derived from the genotypes AR40-6 and Albert. A high-density linkage map was constructed with 2,125 SNP markers using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach. For phenotyping, clonal evaluation trials were conducted with 120 F1 individuals for two consecutive field seasons using an alpha-lattice design at Chambezi and Naliendele, Tanzania. Previously identified QTL for resistance to CBSD foliar symptoms were corroborated, and a new putative QTL for CBSD root necrosis identified (qCBSDRNc14AR) from AR40-6. Two QTL were identified within the region of the previously recognized CMD2 locus from this population in which both parents are thought to possess the CMD2 locus. Interestingly, a minor but consistent QTL, qCGM18AR, for CGM resistance at 3 months after planting stage was also detected and co-localized with a previously identified SSR marker, NS346, linked with CGM resistance. Markers underlying these QTL may be used to increase efficiencies in cassava breeding programs."

Random forest and k-nearest neighbors algorithms were used, and the proposed system was compared with previous algorithms.Random forest exhibited good performance for TNM staging (recall value: 76.98%), while k-nearest neighbors exhibited good performance for extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node metastasis (80.24%, 98.67%, and 95.45%, respectively). The Dr. Answer AI software consisted of three primary service structures: 1) patient information, 2) clinical outcome prediction, and outcomes according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline.The proposed clinical outcome prediction model could function as an effective CDSS, supporting the decisions of the physicians, while enabling the patients to understand their treatment outcomes.

Laser irradiation triggers various effects, including bio-stimulation, which can induce beneficial therapeutic effects and biological responses. Originally, we performed in vivo experiments to clarify the mechanism of better bone healing in laser-ablated bone. Here, we evaluated comprehensive and sequential gene expression in Er:YAG laser-ablated, bur-drilled, and nontreated control bones, and found laser irradiation suppressed Sost (coding protein: sclerostin) expression in the bone, possibly via stimulation of mechanotransducers. Surprisingly, bio-stimulation effect of laser suppressed Sost expression in the primary osteogenic cells. Decreased sclerostin expression after laser irradiation was also validated both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, sequential microarray analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern was clearly different at 24 hours after bone ablation between bur-drilled and laser-ablated bones. The Hippo signaling pathway was significantly enriched, whereas inflammation-related pathways were not affected at 6 hours after the laser ablation, indicating that laser irradiation caused mechanical stimulation. Only bur-drilled bone showed enriched inflammation-related gene sets and pathways at 24 hours, not in the laser-ablated bone. Our study suggests that laser irradiation may become a new treatment modality for osteoporosis, by inhibiting sclerostin expression without inducing inflammation."

However, the proportion of mefloquine binding to feline plasma proteins has not been reported. The proportion of drug bound to plasma protein binding is an important concept when developing drug dosing regimens.

However, as an important parameter for the geometric design, signal timing, and operation evaluation, the saturation flow rate at CFI has not been carefully examined. In this paper, a saturation flow rate adjustment model for CFI intersections is established based on field data under the calculation framework of the HCM2016. Four movements related with CFI, namely the left-turn at the CFI approach, through movement at the CFI approach, left-turn at the pre-signal, and exit movement at the pre-signal, are discussed. The proposed model is validated and the relative error is less than 10%. The treatments to mitigate the negative impact on the saturation flow rate at the CFI are also recommended. The results show the saturation flow rate of the first three movements are decreased due to the CFI control. For the left-turn, through movement, and left-turn at the pre-signal, the degree of the reduction of the saturation flow rate are mainly related to the heavy vehicle ratio, the proportion of lane changing vehicles, and the length of displaced left-turn lanes, respectively."

This study aims to identify the normative values of handgrip strength for Portuguese workers in the automotive industry.About 1225 employees were invited to participate in the study. The final sample consisted of 656 employees in the assembly area. The handgrip strength was measured in kilograms (kg) using the Jamar digital dynamometer. Sex-specific profiles of handgrip strength were designed by the Ordinary Least Square regression (OLS) analysis, where height, age, age squared, and height squared are entered into the models as determining factors of the maximum grip strength in both female and male groups.The peak mean values of handgrip strength in the group of women was 34 kg in the age group of 35-39 years, and in the group of men the peak mean was 52 kg in the age group of 25-34 years. The most pronounced decline in the female group appears in the age of 30-34 years of about 4 kg and the male group the decline occurs at 2kg below the peak force, in the age group of 40-57 year-olds. This study used a cut-off at 2 SD below by the sex-specific peak mean.Normative values can help delineate the career path of workers because they portray risk values according to age, height, and gender. The normative values assist health and engineering professionals and ergonomists in adjusting task demands to the morphological and strength characteristics of the workers."

Instead, a relational scientific methodology is wanted, accompanied by a dialogic mode of conversation between the disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W3047072883,"This paper investigates event extraction and early event classification in contiguous spatio-temporal data streams, where events need to be classified using partial information, i.e. while the event is ongoing. The framework incorporates an event extraction algorithm and an early event classification algorithm. We apply this framework to synthetic and real problems and demonstrate its reliability and broad applicability. The algorithms and data are available in the R package eventstream, and other code in the supplementary material."
https://openalex.org/W3047251642,"Introduction The long-term prognosis of HIV-2-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is still challenging, due to the intrinsic resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and the suboptimal response to some protease inhibitors (PI). The objective was to describe the 5-years outcomes among HIV-2 patients harboring drug-resistant viruses. Methods A clinic-based cohort of HIV-2-patients experiencing virologic failure, with at least one drug resistance mutation was followed from January 2012 to August 2017 in Côte d’Ivoire. Follow-up data included death, lost to follow-up (LTFU), immuno-virological responses. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate survival rates. Results A total of 31 HIV-2 patients with virologic failure and with at least one drug resistance mutation were included. Two-third of them were men, 28(90.3%) were on PI-based ART-regimen at enrolment and the median age was 50 years (IQR = 46–54). The median baseline CD4 count and viral load were 456 cells/mm3 and 3.7 log10 c/mL respectively, and the participants have been followed-up in median 57 months (IQR = 24–60). During this period, 21 (67.7%) patients switched at least one antiretroviral drug, including two (6.5%) and three (9.7%) who switched to a PI-based and an integrase inhibitor-based regimen respectively. A total of 10(32.3%) patients died and 4(12.9%) were LTFU. The 36 and 60-months survival rates were 68.5% and 64.9%, respectively. Among the 17 patients remaining in care, six(35.3%) had an undetectable viral load (<50 c/mL) and for the 11 others, the viral load ranged from 2.8 to 5.6 log10 c/mL. Twelve patients were receiving lopinavir at the time of first genotype, five(42%) had a genotypic susceptibility score (GSS) ≤1 and 4(33%) a GSS >2. Conclusions The 36-months survival rate among ART-experienced HIV-2 patients with drug-resistant viruses is below 70%,lower than in HIV-1. There is urgent need to improve access to second-line ART for patients living with HIV-2 in West Africa"
