https://openalex.org/W2885747263,"Ferroptosis is a form of programmed cell death associated with inflammation, neurodegeneration, and ischemia. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) has been reported to prevent ferroptosis, but the mechanism by which this occurs is controversial. To elucidate the biochemical mechanism of vitamin E activity, we systematically investigated the effects of its major vitamers and metabolites on lipid oxidation and ferroptosis in a striatal cell model. We found that a specific endogenous metabolite of vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol hydroquinone, was a dramatically more potent inhibitor of ferroptosis than its parent compound, and inhibits 15-lipoxygenase via reduction of the enzyme's non-heme iron from its active Fe3+ state to an inactive Fe2+ state. Furthermore, a non-metabolizable isosteric analog of vitamin E which retains antioxidant activity neither inhibited 15-lipoxygenase nor prevented ferroptosis. These results call into question the prevailing model that vitamin E acts predominantly as a non-specific lipophilic antioxidant. We propose that, similar to the other lipophilic vitamins A, D and K, vitamin E is instead a pro-vitamin, with its quinone/hydroquinone metabolites responsible for its anti-ferroptotic cytoprotective activity."
https://openalex.org/W2885496387,"Feeding a Bones and Raw Food (BARF) diet has become an increasing trend in canine nutrition. Bones and Raw Food diets contain a high amount of animal components like meat, offal, and raw meaty bones, combined with comparatively small amounts of plant ingredients like vegetables and fruits as well as different sorts of oil and supplements. While many studies have focused on transmission of pathogens via contaminated meat and on nutritional imbalances, only few studies have evaluated the effect of BARF diets on the fecal microbiome and metabolome. The aim of the study was to investigate differences in the fecal microbiome and the metabolome between dogs on a BARF diet and dogs on a commercial diet (canned and dry dog food).Naturally passed fecal samples were obtained from 27 BARF and 19 commercially fed dogs. Differences in crude protein, fat, fiber, and NFE (Nitrogen-Free Extract) between diets were calculated with a scientific nutrient database. The fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR assays. The fecal metabolome was analyzed in 10 BARF and 9 commercially fed dogs via untargeted metabolomics approach.Dogs in the BARF group were fed a significantly higher amount of protein and fat and significantly lower amount of NFE and fiber. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity measures between diet groups. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed a significant difference in beta-diversity (p < 0.01) between both groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) showed a higher abundance of Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacterium and, Clostridium in the BARF group while conventionally fed dogs had a higher abundance of Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. The qPCR assays revealed significantly higher abundance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Clostridium (C.). perfringens and an increased Dysbiosis Index in the BARF group. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of metabolomics data showed clustering between diet groups. Random forest analysis showed differences in the abundance of various components, including increased 4-hydroxybutryric acid (GBH) and 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the BARF group. Based on univariate statistics, several metabolites were significantly different between diet groups, but lost significance after adjusting for multiple comparison. No differences were found in fecal bile acid concentrations, but the BARF group had a higher fecal concentration of cholesterol in their feces compared to conventionally fed dogs.Microbial communities and metabolome vary significantly between BARF and commercially fed dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2886648645,"Emojis are ideograms that are becoming ubiquitous in digital communication. However, no research has yet investigated how humans process semantic and pragmatic content of emojis in real time. We investigated neural responses to irony-producing emojis, the question being whether emoji-generated irony is processed similarly to word-generated irony. Previous ERP studies have routinely found P600 effects to verbal irony. Our research sought to identify whether the same neural responses could also be elicited by emoji-induced irony. In three experiments, participants read sentences that ended in either a congruent, incongruent, or ironic (wink) emoji. Results across all three experiments demonstrated clear P600 effects, the amplitudes of which were correlated with participants’ tendency to treat the emoji as a marker of irony, as indicated by behavioral comprehension question responses. These ironic wink emojis also elicited a strong P200 effect, also found in studies of verbal irony processing. Moreover, unexpected emojis (both mismatch and ironic emoji) also elicited late frontal positivities, which have been implicated processing unpredicted words in context. These results are the first to identify how linguistically-relevant ideograms are processed in real-time at the neural level, and specifically draw parallels between the processing of word- and emoji-induced irony."
https://openalex.org/W2885134687,"The Journal of Physiology and British Journal of Pharmacology jointly published an editorial series in 2011 to improve standards in statistical reporting and data analysis. It is not known whether reporting practices changed in response to the editorial advice. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of reporting practices in a random sample of research papers published in these journals before (n = 202) and after (n = 199) publication of the editorial advice. Descriptive data are presented. There was no evidence that reporting practices improved following publication of the editorial advice. Overall, 76-84% of papers with written measures that summarized data variability used standard errors of the mean, and 90-96% of papers did not report exact p-values for primary analyses and post-hoc tests. 76-84% of papers that plotted measures to summarize data variability used standard errors of the mean, and only 2-4% of papers plotted raw data used to calculate variability. Of papers that reported p-values between 0.05 and 0.1, 56-63% interpreted these as trends or statistically significant. Implied or gross spin was noted incidentally in papers before (n = 10) and after (n = 9) the editorial advice was published. Overall, poor statistical reporting, inadequate data presentation and spin were present before and after the editorial advice was published. While the scientific community continues to implement strategies for improving reporting practices, our results indicate stronger incentives or enforcements are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2887628808,"The high global prevalence of school violence underlines the need for prevention. However, there are few scientifically evaluated intervention approaches that aim at preventing violence by teachers. We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of the preventative intervention Interaction Competencies with Children for Teachers (ICC-T). In a cluster randomized controlled trial we assessed attitudes towards and use of violence by teachers (self-reported and reported by students) at eight schools in four regions in Tanzania. Two regions were randomly assigned as intervention regions. Data were assessed in the months before and three months after intervention. In total, 158 teachers (58% females; age: 32.08 years, SD = 5.65) and 486 students (54% females; age: 15.61 years, SD = 0.89) participated in this study. The feasibility was very good: Participants’ acceptance was high and they reported a good integration of the core elements in their working routine. The significantly stronger decrease in the use of emotional and physical violence reported both by teachers and students as well as the stronger decrease in positive attitudes of teachers towards physical and emotional violence in the intervention schools at follow-up provide initial evidence of the efficacy. However, further evidence for the sustainability of its effect is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2886380577,"Supplier selection is one of the critical processes in supplier chain management which is associated with the flow of goods and services from the supplier of raw material to the final consumer. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel approach and improves the supplier selection in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment, and provide the importance and the reliability of the criteria by handling vagueness and imperfection of information in decision making process. First, principal component analysis (PCA) method is used to reduce the number of supplier selection criteria in pharmaceutical companies. Next, using the most important criteria resulted from the PCA method, the importance and the reliability of the selected criteria are assessed by a group of decision-maker (DM). Then, the importance value of each supplier with respect to each product is obtained via the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) based on the concept of Z-numbers called Z-TOPSIS. Finally, these values are used as inputs in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to determine the suppliers and the amount of the products provided from the related suppliers. To validate the proposed methodology, an application is performed in a pharmaceutical company. The results show that the proposed method could provide promising results in decision making process more appropriately."
https://openalex.org/W2885623777,"For over 50 years instructor humor has been recognized as a way to positively impact student cognitive and affective learning. However, no study has explored humor exclusively in the context of college science courses, which have the reputation of being difficult and boring. The majority of studies that explore humor have assumed that students perceive instructor humor to be funny, yet students likely perceive some instructor humor as unfunny or offensive. Further, evidence suggests that women perceive certain subjects to be more offensive than men, yet we do not know what impact this may have on the experience of women in the classroom. To address these gaps in the literature, we surveyed students across 25 different college science courses about their perceptions of instructor humor in college science classes, which yielded 1637 student responses. Open-coding methods were used to analyze student responses to a question about why students appreciate humor. Multinomial regression was used to identify whether there are gender differences in the extent to which funny, unfunny, and offensive humor influenced student attention to course content, instructor relatability, and student sense of belonging. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in what subjects students find funny and offensive when joked about by college science instructors. Nearly 99% of students reported that they appreciate instructor humor and reported that it positively changes the classroom atmosphere, improves student experiences during class, and enhances the student-instructor relationship. We found that funny humor tends to increase student attention to course content, instructor relatability, and student sense of belonging. Conversely, offensive humor tends to decrease instructor relatability and student sense of belonging. Lastly, we identified subjects that males were more likely to find funny and females were more likely to find offensive if a college science instructor were to joke about them."
https://openalex.org/W2885738080,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) associated with Escherichia coli are a growing threat with an increase in the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains, particularly ß-lactamase producers, occurring globally. We investigated the presence of carbapenem-resistant uropathogenic E. coli clones in community-acquired UTIs in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to identify the virulence and resistance structures of the resistant clones and relate the isolates to those circulating globally. A combination of comparative genomics and phenotypic approaches were used to characterize ten MDR-uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates recovered from UTI patients in Riyadh between November 2014 and January 2015. We report the presence of NDM-1 and 5, and OXA-181 in carbapenem-resistant UPEC strains from Riyadh, KSA. Single nucleotide polymorphism analyses demonstrated that these ten isolates fell into four phylogenetically distinct clades within the UPEC phylogeny. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that these diverse clones could be distinguished according to their multilocus sequencing type (MLST), serology, and virulence and antimicrobial gene architectures. These clones include the blaNDM-1 carrying isolates of the globally predominant MDR ST131 and ST69 types, previously identified as one of the most common UPEC strains in KSA. This is in addition to clones of ST23Cplx (ST410) and ST448Cplx (ST448) that have likely evolved from common intestinal strains, carrying copies of ß-lactamase genes including blaNDM-5, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, blaCMY-42, blaOXA-1 and blaOXA-181. These data have identified an emerging public health concern and highlight the need to use comprehensive approaches to detect the structure of MDR E. coli populations associated with community-acquired UTIs in KSA."
https://openalex.org/W2886762340,"In previous studies, children with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have been found to have more difficulties with processing speed, working memory, and attentional tasks. The present study aimed to compare the cognitive variables (working memory and processing speed) and the attentional profiles of a sample of students with and without ADHD, using scales from the WISC-IV, and the virtual reality-based attentional test known as ‘Aula Nesplora’; and determine the extent to which the aforementioned variables may predict student group membership. A total of 88 students took part in this study (66 males and 22 females), aged from 6 to 16 years (M = 10.20; SD = 2.79). The sample was divided into two groups: an ADHD group (n = 50) and a Control group (n = 38). Students in the ADHD group obtained lower scores in working memory and in processing speed, as well as demonstrating poorer performance in Aula Nesplora than did their peers. Working memory, and the number of omissions, were both shown to be reliable predictors of group membership. This study revealed the importance of obtaining data from attentional variables differentiated by modality when considering cognitive variables, in order to better characterize the difficulties experienced by individuals diagnosed with ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2885168818,"Animal use in biomedical research is generally justified by its potential benefits to the health of humans, or other animals, or the environment. However, ethical acceptability also requires scientists to limit harm to animals in their research. Training in laboratory animal science (LAS) helps scientists to do this by promoting best practice and the 3Rs. This study evaluated scientists’ awareness and application of the 3Rs, and their approach to other ethical issues in animal research. It was based on an online survey of participants in LAS courses held in eight venues in four European countries: Portugal (Porto, Braga), Germany (Munich, Heidelberg), Switzerland (Basel, Lausanne, Zurich), and Denmark (Copenhagen). The survey questions were designed to assess general attitudes to animal use in biomedical research, Replacement alternatives, Reduction and Refinement conflicts, and harm-benefit analysis. The survey was conducted twice: immediately before the course (‘BC’, N = 310) and as a follow-up six months after the course (‘AC’, N = 127). While courses do appear to raise awareness of the 3Rs, they had no measurable effect on the existing low level of belief that animal experimentation can be fully replaced by non-animal methods. Most researchers acknowledged ethical issues with their work and reported that they discussed these with their peers. The level of an animal’s welfare, and especially the prevention of pain, was regarded as the most pressing ethical issue, and as more important than the number of animals used or the use of animals as such. Refinement was considered more feasible than Replacement, as well as more urgent, and was also favoured over Reduction. Respondents in the survey reversed the ‘hierarchy’ of the 3Rs proposed by their architects, Russell and Burch, prioritizing Refinement over Reduction, and Reduction over Replacement. This ordering may conflict with the expectations of the public and regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2887013135,"To better understand the detraining effects in soccer, the purpose of the study was to analyse if performance level of soccer players modulate repeated-sprint ability (RSA) and intermittent endurance changes during 2-weeks of detraining (i.e., in-season break). Seventeen professional and sixteen young elite soccer players of two different teams performed, before and after 2-weeks of detraining, the RSA test and the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test, level 1 (YYIR1). Before detraining, professional players perform better (p < 0.05) RSA best time (RSAbest) than young players. A decrease (p < 0.05) in RSAbest, RSA total time (RSAtotal) and mean time (RSAmean) performance was observed in both teams, without changes in RSA fatigue index (Sdec). No significant changes in distance covered during YYIR1 was observed in any team. Before detraining, faster players from both teams (FG) (following the median split technique, soccer players with RSAbest ≤ 3.95 s) performed better (p < 0.01) in RSAtotal, RSAmean and RSAbest, but worse (p < 0.01) in Sdec. Although FG and the slower players (SG, RSAbest > 3.95 s) showed a worse (p < 0.05) RSAtotal, RSAbest and RSAmean performance after detraining (ES = 1.5, 1.4 and 2.9; ES = 0.6, 1.2 and 0.6; for FG and SG, respectively), the deterioration was greater in the FG for RSAbest (p < 0.05) and RSAtotal (ES = 1.46). After detraining, FG improved (p < 0.05) Sdec performance. In conclusion, a 2-week in-season break (detraining) period induced a worse RSA, with no effect on intermittent endurance in professional and elite young soccer players, with greater detrimental effects on RSAtotal and RSAbest in FG. In addition, Sdec does not seem to be sensitive to changes in RSA after a 2-week in-season break."
https://openalex.org/W2887061466,"The current study aimed to examine the reliability of the conventional and functional ratios derived from peak torques (PTs) and those obtained from the combination of knee flexors torque at the angle of knee extensors PT. Twenty-six male athletes (mean of 24.0±0.7 years) from different sports completed a test-to-test variation in isokinetic strength (Biodex, System 3) within a period of one week. Anthropometry and body composition assessed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry were also measured. The proposed isokinetic strength ratio measurements appeared to be highly reliable: conventional ratio at PT angle (intra-class correlation, ICC = 0.98; 95% confidence interval; 95%CI: 0.95 to 0.99); functional extension ratio at PT angle (ICC = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96 to 0.99); and, functional flexion ratio at PT angle (ICC = 0.95; 95%CI: 0.89 to 0.98). Technical error of measurement (TEM) and associated percentage of the coefficient of variation (%CV) were as follows: conventional ratio at PT angle (TEM = 0.02; %CV = 4.1); functional extension ratio at PT angle (TEM = 0.02; %CV = 3.8); and, functional flexion ratio at PT angle (TEM = 0.03; %CV = 3.6). The current study demonstrated that the traditional and new obtained simple and combined isokinetic indicators seem highly reliable to assess muscle strength and function in adult male athletes. A single testing session seems to be sufficiently to obtain these isokinetic strength indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2886263563,"Few studies have examined the effects of feeding total mixed ration (TMR) versus roughage and concentrate separately (SF) on ruminant methane production. Therefore, this study compared differences in methane production, ruminal characteristics, total tract digestibility of nutrients, and rumen microbiome between the two feeding methods in Holstein steers. A total six Holstein steers of initial bodyweights 540 ± 34 kg were divided into two groups and assigned to a same experimental diet with two different feeding systems (TMR or SF) in a crossover design with 21 d periods. The experimental diet contained 73% concentrate and 27% forage and were fed twice a day. The total tract digestibility of crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, and organic matter were not affected by the two different feeding systems. Steers fed TMR emitted more methane (138.5 vs. 118.2 L/d; P < 0.05) and lost more gross energy as methane energy (4.0 vs. 3.5% gross energy intake; P = 0.005) compared to those fed SF. Steers fed TMR had greater (P < 0.05) total volatile fatty acid (VFA), ammonia-N concentrations and propionate proportion of total VFA at 1.5 h, whereas lower after that compared to steers fed SF. The greater (P < 0.05) acetate: propionate ratio at 4.5 h for steers fed TMR reflected the shift of H2 sink from propionate towards acetate synthesis. The lower (P < 0.05) isobutyrate and isovalerate proportions of total VFA observed in steers fed TMR implies decrease in net consumption of H2 for microbial protein synthesis compared to SF. There were no differences in both major bacterial and archaeal diversity between TMR and SF, unlike several minor bacterial abundances. The minor groups such as Coprococcus, Succiniclasticum, Butyrivibrio, and Succinivibrio were associated with the changes in ruminal VFA profiles or methanogenesis indirectly. Overall, these results indicate that SF reduces methane emissions from ruminants and increases propionate proportion of total VFA without affecting total tract digestion compared to TMR. There were no evidences that the response differed due to different major underlying microbial population."
https://openalex.org/W2887473767,"Objective This study was conducted to analyze recent trends of multiple birth rates (MBR) and fetal/neonatal/infant mortalities according to the number of gestations in Korea. Methods Data from 2009 to 2015 of live births, infant deaths and stillbirths were obtained from the Korean Vital Statistics. Neonatal mortality rate (NMR), infant mortality rate (IMR), and fetal mortality rate (FMR) in singleton, twin and triplet pregnancies were analyzed according to gestational period (GP; ≤ 23, 24–27, 28–31, and 32–36 weeks). Results From 2009 to 2015, twin and triplet birth rates increased 34.5% and 154.3%, respectively. In twin births, NMR and FMR have been decreased significantly (from 10.92 to 8.62, p = 0.034 and from 41.00 to 30.55, p< 0.001, respectively), but IMR did not show significant decrease. There was no significant change of NMR, IMR, and FMR, in triplet births. Overall, in singleton, twin, and triplet births, NMR was 1.26 ± 0.09, 10.6 ± 1.12, and 34.32 ± 11.72, respectively, and IMR was 2.38 ± 0.26, 14.52 ± 1.38, and 41.13 ± 12.2, respectively. FMRs were 12 ± 1.73, 35.99 ± 3.55, and 88.85 ± 16.55, respectively, in singleton, twin, and triplet pregnancies. In spite of decreasing trends in overall mortalities, the odds ratios of NMRs and IMRs in 2015 were approximately 9-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, in twin births, and approximately 37-fold and 20-fold higher, respectively, in triplet births, than those in singleton births. There were no significant differences in odds ratios of NMRs and IMRs at GP 32–36 among single, twin, and triplet births, although the odds ratios of FMR at GP 32–36 in triplet gestation was significantly higher than those in singleton and twin gestation. Conclusion Neonatal/infant mortality in multiple births is still significantly high, which is mainly related with preterm birth. Close fetal monitoring is needed to prevent fetal death in triplet pregnancies, after 32 gestational weeks."

Previous studies have demonstrated that incremental implicit theories contributed to better academic achievement and positive youth development. Our study aimed to examine whether incremental implicit theories of morality significantly influenced change in students' engagement in voluntary service activities. In our study, 54 Korean college students for Study 1 and 180 Korean 8th graders for Study 2 were recruited to conduct two two-wave studies. We surveyed participants' implicit theories of morality and participation in voluntary service activities. The effect of implicit theories of morality on change in service engagement was analyzed through regression analysis. In Study 1, the moral growth mindset significantly moderated longitudinal change in service engagement. In Study 2, the moral growth mindset significantly influenced engagement in art-related activities, while it significantly moderated change in engagement in youth-related activities."
https://openalex.org/W2885496932,"We screened a library of botanical compounds purified from plants of Vietnam for modulators of the activity of a two-pore domain K+ channel, TREK-1, and we identified a hydroxycoumarin-related compound, ostruthin, as an activator of this channel. Ostruthin increased whole-cell TREK-1 channel currents in 293T cells at a low concentration (EC50 = 5.3 μM), and also activity of the TREK-2 channel (EC50 = 3.7 mM). In contrast, ostruthin inhibited other K+ channels, e.g. human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG1), inward-rectifier (Kir2.1), voltage-gated (Kv1.4), and two-pore domain (TASK-1) at higher concentrations, without affecting voltage-gated potassium channel (KCNQ1 and 3). We tested the effect of this compound on mouse anxiety- and depression-like behaviors and found anxiolytic activity in the open-field, elevated plus maze, and light/dark box tests. Of note, ostruthin also showed antidepressive effects in the forced swim and tail suspension tests, although previous studies reported that inhibition of TREK-1 channels resulted in an antidepressive effect. The anxiolytic and antidepressive effect was diminished by co-administration of a TREK-1 blocker, amlodipine, indicating the involvement of TREK-1 channels. Administration of ostruthin suppressed the stress-induced increase in anti-c-Fos immunoreactivity in the lateral septum, without affecting immunoreactivity in other mood disorder-related nuclei, e.g. the amygdala, paraventricular nuclei, and dorsal raphe nucleus. Ostruthin may exert its anxiolytic and antidepressive effects through a different mechanism from current drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2885376756,"The etiology of metabolic syndrome involves several complicated factors. One of the main factors contributing to metabolic syndrome has been proposed to be excessive intake of sucrose, which disturbs hepatic lipid metabolism, resulting in fatty liver. However, the mechanism by which sucrose induces fatty liver remains to be elucidated. Considering feeding behavior important for metabolism, we investigated whether time-restricted feeding of high sucrose diet (HSD), only in the active phase (the dark phase of the daily light/dark cycle), would ameliorate adverse effects of sucrose on lipid homeostasis in rats. Male Wistar rats, fed either an ad libitum (ad lib.) or time-restricted control starch diet (CD) or HSD were investigated. Rats fed ad lib. (CD and HSD) completed approximately 20% of food intake in the daytime. Time-restricted feeding did not significantly suppress total food intake of rats. However, time-restricted feeding of HSD significantly suppressed the increased plasma triglyceride levels. Moreover, time-restricted feeding also ameliorated HSD-induced liver lipid accumulation, whereas circadian oscillations of liver clock gene or transcriptional factor gene expression for lipid metabolism were not altered significantly. These results demonstrated that restricting sucrose intake only during the active phase in rats ameliorates the abnormal lipid metabolism caused by excess sucrose intake."

Low income LGBTQ respondents saw more mental health professionals and had more unmet need for care than all other LGBTQ/income groups. Narrative analysis illustrated the work required to take care of oneself in the context of extreme financial constraints.

We demonstrate the use of cellular reagents in a variety of molecular diagnostics, such as TaqMan qPCR with no diminution in sensitivity, and in synthetic biology cornerstones such as the Gibson assembly of DNA fragments, where new plasmids can be constructed solely based on adding cellular reagents. Cellular reagents have significantly reduced complexity and cost of production, storage and implementation, features that should facilitate accessibility and use in resource-poor conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2886759308,"Annexin A6 (AnxA6) controls cholesterol and membrane transport in endo- and exocytosis, and modulates triglyceride accumulation and storage. In addition, AnxA6 acts as a scaffolding protein for negative regulators of growth factor receptors and their effector pathways in many different cell types. Here we investigated the role of AnxA6 in the regulation of whole body lipid metabolism and insulin-regulated glucose homeostasis. Therefore, wildtype (WT) and AnxA6-knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 17 weeks. During the course of HFD feeding, AnxA6-KO mice gained less weight compared to controls, which correlated with reduced adiposity. Systemic triglyceride and cholesterol levels of HFD-fed control and AnxA6-KO mice were comparable, with slightly elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) and reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) levels in AnxA6-KO mice. AnxA6-KO mice displayed a trend towards improved insulin sensitivity in oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests (OGTT, ITT), which correlated with increased insulin-inducible phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6) in liver extracts. However, HFD-fed AnxA6-KO mice failed to downregulate hepatic gluconeogenesis, despite similar insulin levels and insulin signaling activity, as well as expression profiles of insulin-sensitive transcription factors to controls. In addition, increased glycogen storage in livers of HFD- and chow-fed AnxA6-KO animals was observed. Together with an inability to reduce glucose production upon insulin exposure in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 hepatocytes, this implicates AnxA6 contributing to the fine-tuning of hepatic glucose metabolism with potential consequences for the systemic control of glucose in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2885592682,"Studies of the fate and toxicity of nanoparticles, including nanosilver (AgNPs), have been primarily conducted using bench scale studies over relatively short periods of time. To better understand the fate of AgNPs in natural aquatic ecosystems over longer time scales and ecological settings, we released suspensions of AgNPs (30–50 nm, capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone) into a boreal lake at the Experimental Lakes Area in Canada. Approximately 9 kg of silver was added from a shoreline point source from June to October 2014, which resulted in total Ag (TAg) concentrations of about 10 μg L-1 or less. In addition, dissolved Ag concentrations (DAg) were typically very low. Using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) analysis of grab samples, we found that the nanoparticles typically ranged in the 40–60 nm size class and were widely distributed throughout the lake, while larger aggregates (i.e. >100 nm) were infrequently detected. The highest occurrence of aggregates was found near the addition site; however, size distributions did not vary significantly among spatial locations or time suggesting rapid dispersal upon entry into the lake. Lake stratification at the thermocline was not a barrier to mobility of the AgNPs, as the particles were also detected in the hypolimnion. Environmental factors influenced Ag size distributions over sampling locations and time. Total dissolved phosphorus, bacterioplankton chlorophyll-a, and sampling time strongly correlated with aggregation and dissolution dynamics. AgNPs thus appear to be relatively mobile and persistent over the growing season in lake ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2887813640,"Previous studies have demonstrated the genetic correlations between type 2 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia, and indicated that many genes have pleiotropic effects on them. However, these pleiotropic genes have not been well-defined. It is essential to identify pleiotropic genes using systematic approaches because systematically analyzing correlated traits is an effective way to enhance their statistical power. To identify potential pleiotropic genes for these three disorders, we performed a systematic analysis by incorporating GWAS (genome-wide associated study) datasets of six correlated traits related to type 2 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia using Meta-CCA (meta-analysis using canonical correlation analysis). Meta-CCA is an emerging method to systematically identify potential pleiotropic genes using GWAS summary statistics of multiple correlated traits. 2,720 genes were identified as significant genes after multiple testing (Bonferroni corrected p value < 0.05). Further, to refine the identified genes, we tested their relationship to the six correlated traits using VEGAS-2 (versatile gene-based association study-2). Only the genes significantly associated (Bonferroni corrected p value < 0.05) with more than one trait were kept. Finally, 25 genes (including two confirmed pleiotropic genes and eleven novel pleiotropic genes) were identified as potential pleiotropic genes. They were enriched in 5 pathways including the statin pathway and the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) Alpha pathway. In summary, our study identified potential pleiotropic genes and pathways of type 2 diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia, which may shed light on the common biological etiology and pathogenesis of these three disorders and provide promising insights for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2886965470,"Grandiose narcissism has been associated with poor ability to understand one's own mental states and the mental states of others. In particular, two manifestations of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) can be explained by poor mindreading abilities: absence of symptomatic subjective distress and lack of empathy.We conducted two studies to investigate the relationships between mindreading capacity, symptomatic subjective distress and narcissistic personality. In the first study (N = 246), we compared mindreading capacities and symptomatic distress in three outpatient samples: narcissistic patients (NPD); patients with other Personality Disorders (PD); patients without PD. In the second study (N = 1357), we explored the relationships between symptomatic distress, mindreading and specific NPD criteria.In the first study, the NPD patients showed poorer mindreading than the patients without PD and comparable to patients with other PDs. Symptomatic subjective distress in the narcissistic group was less severe than in the other PDs group and comparable to the group without PDs. However, no relationship emerged between mindreading and symptomatic subjective distress. In the second study, taking the clinical sample as a whole, symptomatic distress appeared negatively linked to grandiosity traits, while mindreading scores were negatively linked to empathy.NPD showed specific mindreading impairments. However, mindreading capacity did not appear to be directly connected with subjective distress, but did appear to be connected with specific aspects of narcissistic pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2887479262,"Arctic fjords feature among some of the most climate-sensitive regions on the planet. The site of this study–Kongsfjorden–is one such fjord in which sedimentation and sediment geochemistry reflect climate-mediated changes in glacial melt and marine primary productivity. Here, we have shown that the fjord is particularly sensitive to the changing melt dynamics of the surrounding glaciers which are a direct consequence of warming/cooling in the region and is reflected in the productivity at the fjord. Warming increases meltwater influx into the fjord leading to enhanced turbidity which results in lower productivity. A multi-proxy study (sedimentary organic matter content, carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios, and microfossil abundance) using a 21 cm long sediment core from the Kongsfjorden helped us reconstruct warming driven melt-dynamics history for the past two centuries. Proxy data show a general decreasing trend in productivity along with a few excursions over the last two centuries. Warming driven glacial-melt dynamics appears to be the dominant control on productivity throughout the span of the core."
https://openalex.org/W2886262927,"Despite the prevalence and high heritability of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), genetic etiology remains elusive. Clinical evidence points in part to reduced function of the striatum, but which specific genes are differentially expressed and how they sculpt striatal physiology to predispose ADHD are not well understood. As an exploratory tool, a polygenic mouse model of ADHD was recently developed through selective breeding for high home cage activity. Relative to the Control line, the High-Active line displays hyperactivity and motor impulsivity which are ameliorated with amphetamine. This study compared gene expression in the striatum between Control and High-Active mice to develop a coherent hypothesis for how genes might affect striatal physiology and predispose ADHD-like symptoms. To this end, striatal transcriptomes of High-Active and Control mice were analyzed after mice were treated with saline or amphetamines. The pseudogene Gm6180 for n-cofilin (Cfl1) displayed 20-fold higher expression in High-Active mice corresponding with reduced Cfl1 expression suggesting synaptic actin dysregulation. Latrophilin 3 (Lphn3), which is associated with ADHD in human populations and is involved in synapse structure, and its ligand fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3 (Flrt3), were downregulated in High-Active mice. Multiple genes were altered in High-Active mice in a manner predicted to downregulate the canonical Wnt pathway. A smaller and different set of genes including glyoxalase (Glo1) were differentially regulated in High-Active as compared to Control in response to amphetamine. Together, results suggest genes involved in excitatory synapse regulation and maintenance are downregulated in ADHD-like mice. Consistent with the molecular prediction, stereological analysis of the striatum from a separate set of mice processed for imunohistochemical detection of synaptophysin revealed approximately a 46% reduction in synaptophysin immunoreactivity in High-Active relative to Control. Results provide a new set of molecular targets related to synapse maintenance for the next generation of ADHD medicines."

https://openalex.org/W2885325155,"Objectives Detrusor overactivity (DO) is characterized by non-voiding detrusor smooth muscle contractions during the bladder filling phase and often contributes to overactive bladder. In some patients DO is observed as isolated or sporadic contractions, while in others DO is manifested as low amplitude rhythmic contractions (LARC). The aim of this study was to develop an objective method to quantify LARC frequencies and amplitudes in urodynamic studies (UDS) and identify a subgroup DO of patients with LARC. Methods An automated Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was developed to analyze a 205-second region of interest of retrospectively collected “real-world” UDS ending 30 seconds before voiding. The algorithm was designed to identify the three largest rhythmic amplitude peaks in vesical pressure (Pves) in the 1.75–6 cycle/minute frequency range. These peak Pves amplitudes were analyzed to determine whether they were 1) significant (above baseline Pves activity) and 2) independent (distinct from any in abdominal pressure (Pabd) rhythm). Results 95 UDS met criteria for inclusion and were analyzed with the FFT algorithm. During a blinded visual analysis, a neurourologist/urodynamicist identified 52/95 (55%) patients as having DO. The FFT algorithm identified significant and independent (S&I) LARC in 14/52 (27%) patients with DO and 0/43 patients (0%) without DO, resulting in 100% specificity and a significant association (Fischer’s exact test, p<0.0001). The average slowest S&I LARC frequency in this DO subgroup was 3.20±0.34 cycles/min with an amplitude of 8.40±1.30 cm-H2O. This algorithm can analyze individual UDS in under 5 seconds, allowing real-time interpretation. Conclusions An FFT algorithm can be applied to “real-world” UDS to automatically characterize the frequency and amplitude of underlying LARC. This algorithm identified a potential subgroup of DO patients with LARC."
https://openalex.org/W2885341492,"Critical medium column theory has typically been used to predict the scope of caved rock zone (CRZ) caused by caving mining method. It is essential to understand the distribution laws of lateral pressure induced by caving mining method with different dipping angles. In this study, a self-designed scaled physical model was used to investigate the distribution laws with angles ranging from 80° to 90°, and ore drawing was employed in experiments to simulate caving mining method. The experimental results indicated that the distribution laws were divided into the reductive region and the extensive region during ore drawing. The reductive region was close to the drawing hole, and its scope was smaller than the other part. Moreover, decreasing the dipping angle was an effective way of controlling the maximum reduction rates and the scope of reductive region. By varying laws of lateral pressure, the predictive model of CRZs’ scope was established. Additionally, the rock mass located outside the predictive CRZs’ scope did not rupture based on the monitoring of Digital Optical Televiewing (OPTV), which was verified by the field test in Dabeishan Iron Mine, China. The results of the field test demonstrated that the prediction method used in this study was valid and could be used in practice."
https://openalex.org/W2886081145,"Risk-taking behaviour and onset of mental illness peak in adolescence and young adulthood. This study evaluated the interconnectedness of the domains of risk-taking behaviour, mental health (symptoms of depression and social anxiety), psychosocial maturity, risk perception, age, and gender in a sample of 306 adolescents and young adults. Participants between the ages of 16 and 35 completed online self-report measures assessing risk-taking behaviour, depressive symptoms, socially anxious symptoms, psychosocial maturity and risk perception. Socially anxious symptoms, psychosocial maturity, and risk perception were directly associated with risk-taking behaviour. Correlations between depressive symptoms, socially anxious symptoms, and psychosocial maturity were found. Psychosocial maturity proved a better predictor of risk-taking behaviour than age in this cohort. The findings indicate that mental health impacts upon risk-taking behaviour and that consideration should be given to psychosocial maturity in attempts to reduce adolescent and young adult risk-taking behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2887793693,"Aetosauria, which includes 30 species, is a diverse group of armored pseudosuchian archosaurs restricted to Upper Triassic beds. Three species occur in Brazil, and one of these, Aetosauroides scagliai Casamiquela, 1960, also occurs in Argentina. The specimen UFSM 11505, found at Faixa Nova–Cerrito I Outcrop, Santa Maria Formation (Hyperodapedon Assemblage Zone), Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, is here referred to as Aetosauroides scagliai. This specimen preserves most of the skull with both hemimandibles in association with most of the postcranium, thus representing one of the most complete aetosaur skeletons found in Brazil. The premaxilla, one of the key elements of the cranial morphology of aetosaurs, along with the posterior portion of the mandible, was not described until now for A. scagliai. In contrast to the typothoracinae aetosaurs, the premaxilla of UFSM 11505 presents a shovel-shaped tip, but it is not as prominent as the lateral expansion of desmatosuchian aetosaurs, including both species of Stagonolepis, S. robertsoni Agassiz, 1844 and S. olenkae Sulej, 2010. The retroarticular process of the mandible is elongate and not tall, as in Stenomity huangae Small & Martz, 2013 and other typothoracinae aetosaurs. Unlike previous descriptions of A. scagliai, the maxillary teeth are recurved ziphodont-like with serrations on the entire length of both margins. Premaxillary teeth are also present, being less recurved than the maxillary teeth and cylindrical. We recovered Aetosauroides scagliai as the most basal taxon within Aetosauria, like previous phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, our analyses reinforce that recurved and unconstricted maxillary teeth, the shovel-shaped premaxilla and the presence of a tuber on the surangular are plesiomorphic features of Aetosauria."
https://openalex.org/W2885967323,"The aim of this study was to clarify the topographical relationships between the greater occipital nerve and the trapezius muscle and between the greater occipital nerve and the occipital artery in the occiput in order to increase the success rate of greater occipital nerve blockade. Fifty-six halved heads of 28 cadavers were used in this study. The piercing points and the courses of the greater occipital nerve and occipital artery were analyzed by dividing a line connecting between the external occipital protuberance and mastoid process into three equal parts. A circle with a radius of 2 cm drawn at the medial trisection point of this line was divided into four equal sectors. The greater occipital nerve simply passed the lateral border of the trapezius muscle and then pierced the fascia connecting the cranial attachment of the trapezius muscle with the sternocleidomastoid muscle in 62.5% of the specimens, whereas it pierced the muscle itself in the other 37.5%. The greater occipital nerve and occipital artery pierced the fascia within the 2-cm-radius circle in 85.7% and 98.2% of the specimens, respectively. The piercing points of the greater occipital nerve and occipital artery were observed most frequently in the inferomedial (42.9%) and inferolateral (37.5%) sectors of the circle, respectively. The greater occipital nerve and occipital artery pierced the same sector of the circle and accompanied each other in 51.8% of the specimens. These results are expected to improve the understanding of the topographical relationships between the greater occipital nerve and trapezius muscle and between the greater occipital nerve and occipital artery in the occiput, and thus provide helpful information for the management of occipital neuralgia."
https://openalex.org/W2886120597,"Background Data on nursing home admission after myocardial infarction (MI) in the elderly are scarce. We investigated nursing home admission within 6 months and 2 years after MI including predictors for nursing home admission in a nationwide cohort of elderly patients. Methods Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified all subjects 65 years or older residing at home who were discharged following first-time MI in the period 2008–2015. We determined sex- and age-stratified incidence rates per 1000 person years (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of nursing home admissions using Poisson regression models compared to the Danish population 65 years or older with no prior MI. Poisson regression models were also applied to identify predictors of nursing home admission. Results The 26,539 patients who were discharged after MI had a median age of 76 (quartile 1-quartile 3: 70–83) years. The IRs of nursing home admission after MI increased with increasing age and for 80-84-year-old women IRs after 6 months and 2 years were 113.9 and 62.9, respectively, compared to 29.4 for women of the same age with no prior MI. The IRs for 80-84-year-old men after MI were 56.0 and 36.2, respectively, compared to 24.3 for men of the same age with no prior MI. In adjusted analyses the 6 months and 2 years IRRs for 80-84-year-old subjects were 2.56 (95% CI 2.11–3.10) and 1.41 (95% CI 1.22–1.65) for women and 1.74 (95% CI 1.34–2.25) and 1.05 (95% CI 0.88–1.26) for men, respectively. Predictors were advanced age, dementia, home care, Parkinson’s disease, cerebrovascular disease, living alone, depression, and arrhythmia. Conclusion In elderly patients discharged following first-time MI, the risk of subsequent nursing home admission within 6 months was 2-fold higher compared to an age-stratified population with no prior MI. After 2 years this risk remained higher in women."
https://openalex.org/W2887473960,"Infants with HIV infection, particularly those infected in utero, who do not receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) have high mortality in the first year of life. Virologic diagnostic testing is recommended by the World Health Organization between ages 4 and 6 weeks after birth. However, adding very early infant diagnosis (VEID) testing at birth has been suggested to enable earlier diagnosis and rapid treatment of in utero infection. We assessed the costs of adding VEID to the standard 6-week testing in Lesotho where coverage of PMTCT services is nearly universal.Retrospective cost data were collected at eight health-care facilities in three districts participating in an observational prospective study that included birth testing as well as at the National Reference Laboratory in Lesotho, to investigate the cost-per-infection identified. Extrapolating to the national level, it was possible to estimate the impact of VEID on the identification of HIV-infected infants.The unit cost-per-VEID test in Lesotho in 2015 was $40.50. Major cost drivers were supplies/commodities (46%) and clinical labor (22%). In 2015, 66.3% of cohort study infants born at study facilities underwent VEID; one out of 199 infants had a positive HIV DNA PCR test at birth (0.5% potential in utero infection), yielding a cost of $8,060 per HIV-positive infant identified. Sensitivity analysis showed costs based on Lesotho costing data ranged from $810 to $16,194 per-infected child with varying in utero infection rates from 5% and 0.25%, respectively. With 11,157 HIV-exposed births nationally from pregnant women on PMTCT, 66.3% VEID coverage, and 0.5% in utero infection, 37 infants infected with HIV could have been identified at birth in 2015 and 8 early infant deaths potentially averted with immediate ART compared with waiting for 6-week testing.If Lesotho costing data from this pilot study were applied to different epidemic circumstances, the cost-per-infected child identified by adding VEID birth testing to standard 6-week testing was lowest when in utero infection rates were high (when HIV prevalence is high and PMTCT coverage is low)."
https://openalex.org/W2887086888,"Though Ethiopia has shown a considerable improvement in reducing under-five mortality rate since 1990, many children still continue to die prematurely. Mixed results have been reported about determinants of under-five mortality. Besides, there is paucity of mortality studies in the current study site. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess maternal and child health related predictors of under-five mortality in Southern Ethiopia.A matched case control study was conducted in 2014 in Arba Minch Town and Arba Minch Zuria District of Gamo Gofa Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Conditional logistic regression was employed to identify the predictors of under-five mortality. Sampling weight was applied to account for the non-proportional allocation of sample to different clusters. Based on the Mosley & Chen's analytical framework for under-five and infant mortalities, the predictors were organized in to three groups: 1) personal illness control, 2) child feeding and newborn care and 3) other maternal and child related factors.Among personal illness control related factors: lack of post-natal care, immunization status of the child and lack of Vitamin A supplementation were significantly associated with higher rate of under-five mortality. Not breastfeeding and delaying first bath at least for 24 hours were child feeding and newborn care related factors which were found to be significantly associated with under-five mortality. Among other maternal and child related factors, shorter previous birth interval, history of death of index child's older sibling, being multiple birth and live birth after the index child were significantly associated with under-five mortality.In order to maintain reduction of under-five mortality during the Sustainable Development Goals era, strengthening of maternal and child health interventions, such as post-natal care, family planning, immunization, supplementation of Vitamin A for children older than six months, breastfeeding and delaying of first bath after delivery at least for 24 hours are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2886371982,"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are frequent causes of pneumonia and death among children at Sibu and Kapit Hospitals in Sarawak, Malaysia. Objectives To determine the prevalence and risk factors for RSV subtypes A and B and PIV types 1–4 among patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Methods In a cross-sectional, pilot study nasopharyngeal swabs were studied with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Concurrently, we helped Sibu and Kapit Hospitals adapt their first molecular diagnostics for RSV and PIV. Results Of 129 specimens collected (June to July 2017), 39 tested positive for RSV-A (30.2%), two were positive for RSV B (1.6%), one was positive for PIV-3 (0.8%) and one was positive for PIV-4 (0.8%). No samples were positive for PIV-1 or PIV-2. Of the 39 RSV-A positive specimens, 46.2% were collected from children under one year of age and only 5.1% were from patients over the age of 18. A multivariable analysis found the odds of children <1 year of age testing positive for RSV-A were 32.7 (95% CI: 3.9, 276.2) times larger than >18 years of age, and the odds of patients hospitalized at Kapit Hospital testing positive for RSV-A were 3.2 (95% CI: 1.3, 7.8) times larger than patients hospitalized at Sibu Hospital. Conclusion This study found an unusually high prevalence of RSV-A among pneumonia patients admitted to the two hospitals. Subsequently, Sibu Hospital adapted the molecular assays with the goal of providing more directed care for such pneumonia patients."
https://openalex.org/W2887903426,"In this paper, we establish a statistically important relationship between household agricultural income and women’s BMI using a five-year panel dataset of rural households drawn from 18 villages across five Indian states. Using within household variation over time, we estimate both the extent to which short-term changes in agricultural income are associated with short-term changes in BMI, and the effect of agricultural income growth on BMI growth over a longer term. Over the longer term, and for the group of households that regularly farm, we find a 10 percentage point agricultural income growth to be associated with a 0.10 percentage point growth in BMI. Consistent with the literature, this effect is economically modest, but important considering that we do not find a corresponding effect for growth in non-agricultural income. We show that both the own-production and market purchase of food are associated with nutritional improvements. While women’s BMI is associated with an increase in the consumption of own-produced cereals, the market plays an important role in facilitating access to more nutritious foods like pulses. Lastly, we also find that effects of agricultural income are driven by younger women, in the age-group 15-25 years, who face a particularly strong nutritional disadvantage in India."

To assess the effectiveness of this platform, a study was carried out at four primary schools located near the Thai northern border with 244 students and 8 teachers. Participants were asked to carry out three science-based learning activities and were measured for improvements in learning outcome and learning engagement. Overall, the results showed that students in the IoET group who had used OBSY to learn showed significantly higher learning outcome and had better learning engagement than those in the control condition. In addition, for those in the IoET group, there was no significant effect regarding gender, home location (Urban or Rural), age, prior experience with technology and ethnicity on learning outcome. For learning engagement, only age was found to influence interest/enjoyment. The study demonstrated the potential of IoET technologies in underprivileged area, through a co-design approach with teachers and students, taking into account the local contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2885740183,"Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the United States and alcohol abuse can lead to alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is a persistent condition and relapse rates following successful remission are high. Many factors have been associated with relapse for alcohol use disorder, but identification of these factors has not been well translated into preventative utility. One potentially important factor, concurrent nicotine use, has not been well investigated as a causal factor in relapse for alcohol use disorder. Nicotine increases the value of other stimuli in the environment and may increase the value of alcohol. If nicotine increases the value of alcohol, then nicotine use during and after treatment may make relapse more probable. In the current study, we investigated the effect of continuous nicotine exposure (using osmotic minipumps to deliver nicotine or saline, depending on group, at a constant rate for 28 days) on resurgence of alcohol seeking in rats. Resurgence is a type of relapse preparation that consists of three phases: Baseline, Alternative Reinforcement, and Resurgence Testing. During Baseline, target responses produced a dipper of alcohol. During Alternative Reinforcement, target responses were extinguished and responses on a chain produced a chocolate pellet. During Resurgence Testing, responses on the chain were also extinguished and a return to responding on the target lever was indicative of resurgence. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the effect of nicotine on resurgence. Both the nicotine and saline group showed resurgence of alcohol seeking, but there was no difference in the degree of resurgence across groups. Future directions could involve testing alternative drug delivery techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2885026227,"The binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to lysine 9–methylated histone H3 (H3K9me) is an essential step in heterochromatin assembly. Chp2, an HP1-family protein in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is required for heterochromatic silencing. Chp2 recruits SHREC, a multifunctional protein complex containing the nucleosome remodeler Mit1 and the histone deacetylase Clr3. Although the targeting of SHREC to chromatin is thought to occur via two distinct modules regulated by the SHREC components Chp2 and Clr2, it is not clear how Chp2’s chromatin binding regulates SHREC function. Here, we show that H3K9me binding by Chp2’s chromodomain (CD) is essential for Chp2’s silencing function and for SHREC’s targeting to chromatin. Cells expressing a Chp2 mutant with defective H3K9me binding (Chp2-W199A) have a silencing defect, with a phenotype similar to that of chp2-null cells. Genetic analysis using a synthetic silencing system revealed that a Chp2 mutant and SHREC-component mutants had similar phenotypes, suggesting that Chp2’s function also affects SHREC’s chromatin binding. Size-exclusion chromatography of native protein complexes showed that Chp2-CD’s binding of H3K9me3 ensures Clr3’s chromatin binding, and suggested that SHREC’s chromatin binding is mediated by separable functional modules. Interestingly, we found that the stability of the Chp2 protein depended on the Clr3 protein’s histone deacetylase activity. Our findings demonstrate that Chp2’s H3K9me binding is critical for SHREC function and that the two modules within the SHREC complex are interdependent."
https://openalex.org/W2885407028,"Many virulence factors have been described for opportunistic pathogens within the genus Aeromonas. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs) are commonly used in population studies of aeromonads to detect virulence-associated genes in order to better understand the epidemiology and emergence of Aeromonas from the environment to host, but their performances have never been thoroughly evaluated. We aimed to determine diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays for the detection of virulence-associated genes in a collection of Aeromonas isolates representative for the genetic diversity in the genus. Thirty-nine Aeromonas strains belonging to 27 recognized species were screened by published PCR assays for virulence-associated genes (act, aerA, aexT, alt, ascFG, ascV, ast, lafA, lip, ser, stx1, stx2A). In parallel, homologues of the 12 putative virulence genes were searched from the genomes of the 39 strains. Of the 12 published PCR assays for virulence factors, the comparison of PCR results and genome analysis estimated diagnostic sensitivities ranging from 34% to 100% and diagnostic specificities ranged from 71% to 100% depending upon the gene. To improve the detection of virulence-associated genes in aeromonads, we have designed new primer pairs for aerA/act, ser, lafA, ascFG and ascV, which showed excellent diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Altogether, the analysis of high quality genomic data, which are more and more easy to obtain, provides significant improvements in the genetic detection of virulence factors in bacterial strains."
https://openalex.org/W2885983023,"During the last two decades, Haemophilus influenzae serotype a (Hia) emerged as an important cause of invasive disease in Canadian First Nations and Inuit, and Alaskan Native populations, with the highest rates reported in young children. Immunocompetent adults, in contrast to children, do not typically develop invasive Hia disease. To clarify factors responsible for an increased burden of invasive Hia disease in certain population groups we studied serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against Hia and quantified IgG and IgM specific to Hia capsular polysaccharide in healthy adult members of two First Nations communities: 1) with reported cases of invasive Hia disease (Northern Ontario, NO), and 2) without reported cases (Southern Ontario, SO), in comparison to non-First Nations living in proximity to the NO First Nations community, and non-First Nations elderly non-frail Canadians from across the country (total of 110 First Nations and 76 non-First Nations). To elucidate the specificity of bactericidal antibodies, sera were absorbed with various Hia antigens. Naturally acquired SBA against Hia was detected at higher rates in First Nations (NO, 80%; SO, 96%) than non-First Nations elderly Canadians (64%); the SBA titres in First Nations were higher than in non-First Nations elderly Canadians (P<0.001) and NO non-First Nations adults (P>0.05). Among First Nations, SBA was mediated predominantly by IgM, and by both antibodies specific to Hia capsular polysaccharide and lipooligosaccharide. Conclusions: The SBA against Hia is frequently present in sera of First Nations adults regardless of the burden of Hia disease observed in their community; it may represent part of the natural antibody repertoire, which is potentially formed in this population under the influence of certain epigenetic factors. Although the nature of these antibodies deserves further studies to understand their origin, the data suggest that they may represent important protective mechanism against invasive Hia disease."
https://openalex.org/W2886000476,"Invasive predators can profoundly impact native communities, especially in insular ecosystems where functionally equivalent predators were evolutionarily absent. Beyond direct consumption, predators can affect communities indirectly by creating or altering food web linkages among existing species. Where invasive predators consume prey from multiple distinct resource channels, novel links may couple the dynamics of disjunct modules and create indirect interactions between them. Our study focuses on invasive populations of Eleutherodactylus coqui (Anura: Leptodactylidae) on Hawaii Island. Coqui actively forage in the understory and lower canopy at night but return to the forest floor and belowground retreats by day. Recent dietary studies using gut contents and naturally occurring stable isotopes indicate higher than expected consumption of litter arthropods, which in these Hawaiian forests are primarily non-native species. We used laboratory studies to observe diurnal and nocturnal foraging behavior, and experimental field additions of C4 vegetation as a litter tracer to distinguish epigaeic sources from food web pools in the C3 canopy. Lab trials revealed that prey consumption during diurnal foraging was half that consumed during nocturnal foraging. Analysis of δ13C isotopes showed incorporation of C4 carbon into litter arthropods within one month, and Bayesian mixing models estimated that 15–25% of the carbon in coqui tissue was derived from litter sources. These results support recent findings that E. coqui are not quiescent diurnally but instead actively forage. Such activity by a mobile invasive predator may introduce a novel linkage that integrates detrital and foliar resource pools, potentially distributing influences of invasive litter arthropods through the broader system to amplify impacts on native species."
https://openalex.org/W2887247375,"Introduction Postprandial hyperglycemia plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease. However, few studies have investigated associations between the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and postprandial glucose levels in angina patients without known diabetes before coronary angiography. Methods Subjects who were admitted for coronary angiography due to angina and were in stable condition after discharge were recruited. A standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at outpatient visits approximately 2–4 weeks after hospital discharge, and fasting and post-challenge blood glucose were measured. Twenty-six volunteers in our hospital staff served as the healthy group. CAD severity was graded using the SYNTAX and Jeopardy scoring systems. Results The subjects in the angina group had a higher body mass index, higher fasting glucose, and higher 2-h postprandial glucose than those in the healthy group. The SYNTAX and Jeopardy scores were significantly associated with 2-h postprandial blood glucose (correlation coefficients = 0.164 and 0.187, respectively) but not with fasting glucose. Linear regression analyses revealed that SYNTAX and Jeopardy scores were independently associated with glucose levels at 120 min after OGTT (SYNTAX 95%CI = 0.003–0.103; Jeopardy score 0.002–0.027) but not with fasting glucose. Conclusion CAD severity is associated with blood glucose levels after oral glucose challenge in patients without known diabetes before coronary angiography, suggesting that CAD patients should be routinely screened for post-challenge blood glucose."

We retrieved records for 8,533 patients who started ART between January 2006 and December 2012. Their data had been collected and stored as part of the larger International Epidemiological Database for the Evaluation of AIDS (IeDEA). Age was stratified into three categories namely; 18-34 (young adults), 35-49 (mid-age) and 50 years or older (older adults). Survival analysis procedures with Kaplan-Meier's plots were used to calculate the survival probability with mortality as the endpoint and Poisson regression analysis used to determine the adjusted relative risks (RR) of mortality.The proportion of young adults and patients at WHO stage I initiating ART increased steadily over the 7-year period. Older age at ART initiation (> = 50 years) was associated with a higher risk of mortality with adjusted relative risk (RR) at 1.63, (95% CI 1.26-2.11) compared to younger age. Male gender, WHO stages III and IV, lower CD4 count and lower body mass index were also all independently and significantly associated with higher risk for mortality. Older adults also had a poorer immunological response RR = 1.79 (95% CI 0.89-3.58) but was not statistically significant.Following ART initiation, older adults compared to the young, have a higher risk of mortality. This age group should be targeted first for 'screen and treat' approach. Optimization of ART treatment regimens for this age group is also required to reduce mortality and improve immunological response."

Epidemiological investigation was carried out among HIV-infected individuals. Blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV were tracked for the date of transfusion, reason for transfusion, hospital where transfusion was received, source of blood, components of transfusion, number of transfusions, and transfusion volume. A total of 285 blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV-1 were detected in Hebei over the study period, with 42.81% (122/285) detected through clinical diagnostic testing. These cases showed a concentrated distribution in southern Hebei, with local outbreak characteristics. A census of the population in Shahe County, which had a high concentration of cases, revealed that recipients of blood transfusions had an HIV infection rate of 15.54% (92/592). Post-transfusion infection frequently occurred among blood transfusion recipients at township medical institutions, with a peak in 1995. Owing to late detection of HIV infection among blood transfusion recipients, the rates of spousal transmission and mother-to-child transmission reached 20.87% and 28.05%, respectively. Around 1995, community medical institutions did not screen for HIV antibodies among paid blood donors, which was an important cause of the outbreak of HIV-1 infection among blood transfusion recipients. Our findings indicate that cases of blood transfusion-related infection decreased rapidly with gradual improvement in the HIV screening system for blood donors that began in 1995, particularly after full implementation of HIV nucleic acid testing of volunteer blood donors was begun in 2015."
https://openalex.org/W2886145298,"Type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) seldom receive a kidney transplant, which is partly due to age and comorbidities. Adjusting for case mix, we investigated whether T2DM patients have equal opportunity for renal transplantation compared to other patients on dialysis, and whether survival after transplantation is comparable.Patients who entered RRT in Finland in 2000-2010 (n = 5419) were identified from the Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases and followed until the end of 2012. Of these, 20% had T2DM, 14% type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and 66% other than diabetes as the cause of ESRD. Uni-/multivariate survival analysis techniques were employed to assess the probability of kidney transplantation after the start of dialysis and survival after transplantation.T2DM patients had a relative probability of renal transplantation of 0.18 (95% CI 0.15-0.22, P<0.001) compared to T1DM patients: this increased to 0.51 (95% CI 0.36-0.72, P<0.001) after adjustment for case mix (age, gender, laboratory values and comorbidities). When T2DM patients were compared to non-diabetic patients, the corresponding relative probabilities were 0.25 (95% CI 0.20-0.30, P<0.001) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.43-0.83, P = 0.002). After renal transplantation when adjusted for age and gender, relative risk of death was 1.25 (95% CI 0.64-2.44, P = 0.518) for T1DM patients and 0.72 (0.43-1.22, P = 0.227) for other patients compared to T2DM patients.T2DM patients had a considerably lower probability of receiving a kidney transplant, which could not be fully explained by differences in the patient characteristics. Survival within 5 years after transplantation is comparably good in T2DM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2949825846,"Recombineering has transformed functional genomic analysis. Genome modification by recombineering using the phage lambda Red homologous recombination protein Beta in Escherichia coli has approached 100% efficiency. While highly efficient in E. coli, recombineering using the Red Synaptase/Exonuclease pair (SynExo) in other organisms declines in efficiency roughly correlating with phylogenetic distance from E. coli. SynExo recombinases are common to double-stranded DNA viruses infecting a variety of organisms, including humans. Human Herpes virus 1 (HHV1) encodes a SynExo comprised of ICP8 synaptase and UL12 exonuclease. In a previous study, the Herpes SynExo was reconstituted in vitro and shown to catalyze a model recombination reaction. Here we describe stimulation of gene targeting to edit a novel fluorescent protein gene in the human genome using ICP8 and compared its efficiency to that of a “humanized” version of Beta protein from phage λ. ICP8 significantly enhanced gene targeting rates in HEK 293T cells while Beta was not only unable to catalyze recombineering but inhibited gene targeting using endogenous recombination functions, despite both synaptases being well-expressed and localized to the nucleus. This proof of concept encourages developing species-specific SynExo recombinases for genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2887152759,"To perform a validation of DIABSCORE in a sample of Tunisian adults and find out the optimal cut-off point for screening of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes.225 adults 18-75 years and a subgroup of 138 adults (18-54 years), with undiagnosed T2D from the region of Cap-Bon, Tunisia were included in the present study. The DIABSCORE was calculated based on: age, waist/height ratio, family history of T2D and gestational diabetes. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and areas under curve (AUC) were obtained. The T2D and prediabetes prevalences odds ratios (OR) between patients exposed and not exposed to DIABSCORE≥90 and DIABSCORE≥80, respectively were calculated in both age ranges.For screening of T2D the best value was DIABSCORE = 90 with a highest sensitivity (Se), negative predictive value (NPV) and lower negative likelihood ratio in participants aged 18-75 yr (Se = 97%; NPV = 97%) when compared to participants aged 18-54 yr (Se = 95%; NPV = 97%); for prediabetes, the best Se and NPV were for DIABSCORE = 80 in both age groups, but it showed a disbalanced sensitivity-specificity. The ROC curves for T2D showed a similar AUC in both age ranges (AUC = 0.62 and AUC = 0.61 respectively). The ROC curves for prediabetes showed a highest AUC in those aged 18-54 years than the older ones (AUC = 0.62 and AUC = 0.57, respectively). The prevalences OR of T2D for DIABSCORE≥90 was higher than for DIABSCORE≥80 in both age ranges. Nevertheless, the prevalences OR of prediabetes for DIABSCORE≥90 was half of the detected for DIABSCORE≥80 in both age ranges.The DIABSCORE is a simple clinical tool and accurate method in screening for T2D and prediabetes in the adult Tunisian population."
