We have isolated exosomes from neuroblastoma cells and investigated their influence on the aggregation of α-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson disease pathology. Using cryo-transmission electron microscopy of exosomes, we found spherical unilamellar vesicles with a significant protein content, and Western blot analysis revealed that they contain, as expected, the proteins Flotillin-1 and Alix. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to monitor aggregation kinetics, we found that exosomes catalyze the process in a similar manner as a low concentration of preformed α-synuclein fibrils. The exosomes reduce the lag time indicating that they provide catalytic environments for nucleation. The catalytic effects of exosomes derived from naive cells and cells that overexpress α-synuclein do not differ.

In recent years, research into these vesicles has expanded considerably with a major focus on exosomes, defined by their size and the presence of proteins such as Alix and Flotillin-1. These small vesicles of ∼100 nm in diameter are used for intercellular communication. Exosomes are found in most body fluids and contain lipid, protein, and RNA. In vitro experiments suggest that exosomal release by neurons depends on synaptic activity and that released exosomes are taken up by other neurons (1Chivet M. Hemming F. Pernet-Gallay K.

The 140-amino acid-long α-syn is expressed at high levels in the brain and accounts for about 1% of the total protein content in the neuronal cytosol (4Cremades N. Cohen S.I. Deas E. Abramov A.Y.

One neuropathological hallmark of PD is Lewy bodies in which the main component is aggregated α-syn, but other proteins and lipids are also present (7Halliday G.M. Holton J.L. Revesz T. Dickson D.W.

The nature of the toxic species is debated; both the smaller aggregates formed during the aggregation process or the process per se have been suggested to be toxic (9Harrower T.P. Michell A.W.

Compelling genetic evidence supports that α-syn plays a crucial role in PD pathogenesis.

Secreted and lipid-associated α-syn is resistant to proteolysis by the KLK6 peptidase, found in the central nervous system and cerebrospinal fluid, and is co-localized with α-syn in Lewy bodies (26Ximerakis M.

Cellular dysfunction is also proposed to increase the transfer of α-syn via exosomes (33Alvarez-Erviti L. Seow Y. Schapira A.H. Gardiner C. Sargent I.L. Wood M.J. Cooper J.M.

Environmental toxins trigger PD-like progression via increased α-synuclein release from enteric neurons in mice.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2: 898Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, the details regarding the interactions between α-syn and exosomes are not understood, and whether exosomes play an important role in PD pathogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we use a continuous thioflavin T fluorescence assay to investigate the influence of exosomes on α-syn amyloid formation. We find that exosomes accelerate the conversion of monomeric protein to fibrillar aggregates and seek a molecular explanation for this catalysis. In an attempt to explain the acceleration of the process, we determine the molecular composition of isolated exosomes using mass spectrometry, gel electrophoresis, and Western blot, and we investigate the size, charge, and morphology of the exosomes using cryo-electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and ζ potential measurements. We then use this information to design simplified model systems that mimic different aspects of the exosomes, and we explore how they impact α-syn aggregation kinetics. Thus, we examine α-syn aggregation in the presence of exosomes from cells without or with overexpressed α-syn, either wild-type or disease-related mutant protein. We also investigate α-syn aggregation in the presence of artificial vesicles composed of exosome lipid extracts or models composed of biologically relevant lipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), anionic phosphatidylserine (PS, common lipid in outer leaflet of the cell plasma membranes), cardiolipin (CL, common in mitochondria), as well as neuro-specific GM1 and GM3 gangliosides and cationic sphingosine. Furthermore, we study the seeding effect by adding small amounts of α-syn fibril seeds. Most experiments are performed at mildly acidic pH to mimic the conditions in endosomes and lysosomes. Under these conditions, the aggregates seem to multiply due to secondary nucleation of monomers on fibrils, a process that is not detected at neutral pH (35Buell A.K. Galvagnion C. Gaspar R. Sparr E. Vendruscolo M. Knowles T.P. Linse S. Dobson C.M. Solution conditions determine the relative importance of nucleation and growth processes in α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 7671-7676Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The following lyophilized lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster AL): 1′,3′-bis(1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-sn-glycerol sodium salt (cardiolipin, CL); 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine sodium salt (DOPS); 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC); d-erythrosphingosine; and GM1 and GM3 ganglioside from ovine brain and milk, respectively. Buffer chemicals MES, NaCl, and ThT were of analytical grade, and the water used was ultrapure (<18.2 megohms·cm at 25 °C, MilliQ grade). Human α-syn was expressed in Escherichia coli from the aS-pT7-7 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. H. Lashuel) and the monomer purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, as described previously (36Grey M. Linse S. Nilsson H. Brundin P. Sparr E. Membrane interaction of α-synuclein in different aggregation states.J. Parkinsons Dis. 2011; 1: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in buffer (10 mm MES, pH 5.5, with 140 mm NaCl, unless otherwise stated) just prior to setting up the kinetic measurements. The protein concentration was determined from the integrated area under the collected peak using the extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 5800 liters·mol−1·cm−1 or by measuring a UV absorbance spectrum from 350 to 220 nm, followed by baseline correction for light scattering effects to obtain the absorbance at 280 nm. The samples were prepared on ice, and 30 μm α-syn (0.4 mg/ml) was supplemented with 20 μm ThT to follow the fibrillation process. α-Syn was also studied in the absence and presence of 0.25 mg/ml exosomes (based on protein content) or 0.1–0.5 mm lipid in the form of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). The samples were aliquoted in 96-well plates (nontreated black polystyrene, full volume plates, 3631 Costar) and sealed with a plastic film to avoid evaporation. The pH was measured for all samples and found not to change due to the additions. For seeding experiments, 30 μm α-syn monomer was supplemented with 0.03 or 0.3 μm sonicated fibrils (i.e. 0.1 and 1%) counted as monomer equivalents. These fibrils were formed from 30 μm α-syn, collected directly after reaching the final ThT plateau, and sonicated briefly in a sonicator bath to disperse lumped fibrils. Experiments aimed at comparing the seeding efficiency between preformed seeds made in the absence and presence of 0.25 mg/ml exosomes were performed in 96-well plates with a nonbinding surface (black polystyrene plates treated with a pegylated surface, half-area, 3881 Corning Glass). These nonbinding plates were also used to explore the catalytic effect of SUVs composed with ganglioside lipids. Plates were incubated at 37 °C up to 144 h in a FLUOstar Omega or Galaxy plate reader under quiescent conditions or with shaking at 100 rpm between readings. Samples at different time points were aliquoted and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The concentration of monomeric α-syn was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm for each supernatant, performing at least three measurements per sample, using the Thermo Scientific Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer. Specific time points during the lag phase, exponential growth phase, and at the plateau were selected for analysis. These time points were easily pinpointed by following in parallel well controlled and reproducible ThT aggregation kinetics. Mouse neuroblastoma cells (N2a) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator set at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Plasmids used for α-syn overexpressing lines were described previously (37Hansen C. Angot E. Bergström A.L. Steiner J.A. Pieri L. Paul G. Outeiro T.F. Melki R. Kallunki P. Fog K. Li J.Y. Brundin P. α-Synuclein propagates from mouse brain to grafted dopaminergic neurons and seeds aggregation in cultured human cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) with the exception that α-syn was tagged at the C-terminal end with an HA tag. Mutant lines were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. For plasmid transfection, cells were transfected using TurboFect according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Fisher), and stable lines were generated by growing and then maintaining cells in the presence of G418 at concentrations of 200 and 80 μg/ml, respectively. Exosomes were isolated from cell culture medium as described previously (38Théry C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; (2006 Chapter 3, Unit 3.22)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, N2a cells were cultured for 48 h in serum-free DMEM. Collected medium was then depleted of cells and cellular debris by sequential low speed centrifugation. Exosomes were then isolated by centrifugation of the collected supernatant at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 90 min. The resultant pellet was then washed in PBS and centrifuged for 70 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Exosomes were analyzed for size using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and for purity by Western blotting. The concentration based on protein content was estimated by recording a UV absorbance spectrum from 350 to 220 nm, followed by baseline correction for light scattering effects to obtain the absorbance at 280 nm, and using an approximate absorbance coefficient of 1 liter g−1 cm−1. The digestion of exosomes was performed as described previously (32Danzer K.M. Kranich L.R. Ruf W.P. Cagsal-Getkin O. Winslow A.R. Zhu L. Vanderburg C.R. McLean P.J. Exosomal cell-to-cell transmission of α synuclein oligomers.Mol. Neurodegener. 2012; 7: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), followed by Western blot analysis. Cell or exosome pellets were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min before samples were applied to 10–20% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and subsequent transfer to PVDF membrane using Transblot Turbo transfer packs (Bio-Rad). Membranes were fixed in 0.4% paraformaldehyde (39Lee B.R. Kamitani T. Improved immunodetection of endogenous α-synuclein.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23939Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) before blocking in 5% skim milk powder. The membranes were incubated in primary antibody (HA and Alix (Cell Signaling Technologies), Flotillin-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), calnexin and GAPDH (Abcam)) solutions overnight. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Protein bands were detected using Signal Fire ECL reagent (Cell Signaling Technologies) and imaged on Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+. SUVs were prepared by sonication using a probe sonicator (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). Lipids were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH 2:1 (v/v), and a thin film was formed by air-drying. Any residual solvent was evaporated in a vacuum chamber for at least 12 h. After adding buffer to a final concentration of 1 mm lipid, the samples were vortexed and then sonicated for 10 min using a pulsed sequence (10 s on and 10 s off at 70% amplitude) on ice. Any particulate matter from the probe was removed by 3 min of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. Exosome lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method (40Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar), and the SUVs were prepared as above. DLS and ζ potential measurements were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) at 25 °C. NTA, monitoring the Brownian motion of vesicles, was performed at room temperature using a NanoSight instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). To ensure a stable temperature and avoiding loss of solution during sample preparation, a controlled environment vitrification system was used. Samples were prepared as thin liquid films (<300 nm thick) on glow discharge-treated lacey carbon film-coated copper grids and plunged into liquid ethane at −180 °C. In this way, the original microstructures are preserved so that we can avoid component segmentation and rearrangement in addition to water crystallization as the samples are vitrified. Samples were stored under liquid N2 until measured and then transferred using an Oxford CT3500 cryoholder and its workstation into the electron microscope (Philips CM120 Biotwin Cryo) equipped with a post-column energy filter (Gatan GIF100). An acceleration voltage of 120 kV was used, and images were recorded digitally with a CCD camera under low electron dose conditions. Extraction of the lipids from the isolated N2a exosomes was carried out by mixing 100 μl of the exosome suspension with 1 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1) for 3 h at room temperature. The water phase was removed, and the organic phase was dried in a desiccator. Before being subjected to MS analysis, the dried samples were dissolved in 100 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:2) and mixed (1:1) with MeOH containing either 10 mm ammonium acetate or 0.4 mm methylamine, reaching a final concentration of either 5 mm ammonium acetate or 0.2 mm methylamine in CHCl3/MeOH (1:5). Samples were analyzed using a nano-electrospray ionizer connected to an Orbitrap-Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples (∼2 μl) were loaded in disposable emitters and sprayed using negative ionization. Data were collected using data-dependent acquisition performing full scan experiments as well as untargeted MS/MS using higher energy collisional dissociation fragmentation. Relative intensities were calculated within each lipid class by averaging full scan spectra and for each lipid species using the isotope compositions yielding the three lowest masses. The intensities of closely adjacent lipids were compensated according to the theoretical isotopic distributions. Western blot analysis of the exosome preparations revealed that they were enriched for the exosomal proteins Flotillin"

In this study, expression profiles of 11 candidate reference genes, including actin (Actin), elongation factor 1 α (EF1A), TATA-box-binding protein (TATA), ribosomal protein L12 (RPL12), β-tubulin (Tubulin), NADH dehydrogenase (NADH), vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S), 16S ribosomal RNA (16S), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) from the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, under different developmental stages and temperature conditions, were investigated. A total of four analytical tools, geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the ΔCt method, were used to evaluate the suitability of these genes as endogenous controls. According to RefFinder, a web-based software tool which integrates all four above-mentioned algorithms to compare and rank the reference genes, SDHB, 16S, and NADH were the three most stable house-keeping genes under different developmental stages and temperatures. This work is intended to establish a standardized qRT-PCR protocol in pea aphid and serves as a starting point for the genomics and functional genomics research in this emerging insect model."
https://openalex.org/W2122285835,"The world's governments have committed to preventing the extinction of threatened species and improving their conservation status by 2020. However, biodiversity is not evenly distributed across space, and neither are the drivers of its decline, and so different regions face very different challenges. Here, we quantify the contribution of regions and countries towards recent global trends in vertebrate conservation status (as measured by the Red List Index), to guide action towards the 2020 target. We found that>50% of the global deterioration in the conservation status of birds, mammals and amphibians is concentrated in <1% of the surface area, 39/1098 ecoregions (4%) and eight/195 countries (4%) - Australia, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States. These countries hold a third of global diversity in these vertebrate groups, partially explaining why they concentrate most of the losses. Yet, other megadiverse countries - most notably Brazil (responsible for 10% of species but just 1% of deterioration), plus India and Madagascar - performed better in conserving their share of global vertebrate diversity. Very few countries, mostly island nations (e.g. Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Tonga), have achieved net improvements. Per capita wealth does not explain these patterns, with two of the richest countries - United States and Australia - fairing conspicuously poorly. Different countries were affected by different combinations of threats. Reducing global rates of biodiversity loss will require investment in the regions and countries with the highest responsibility for the world's biodiversity, focusing on conserving those species and areas most in peril and on reducing the drivers with the highest impacts."

At 24 months, children are assessed for neurodevelopmental outcomes with the INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Package. This paper describes neurodevelopment tools for preschoolers and the systematic approach leading to the development of the Package.An advisory panel shortlisted project-specific criteria (such as multi-dimensional assessments and suitability for international populations) to be fulfilled by a neurodevelopment instrument. A literature review of well-established tools for preschoolers revealed 47 candidates, none of which fulfilled all the project's criteria. A multi-dimensional assessment was, therefore, compiled using a package-based approach by: (i) categorizing desired outcomes into domains, (ii) devising domain-specific criteria for tool selection, and (iii) selecting the most appropriate measure for each domain.The Package measures vision (Cardiff tests); cortical auditory processing (auditory evoked potentials to a novelty oddball paradigm); and cognition, language skills, behavior, motor skills and attention (the INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Assessment) in 35-45 minutes. Sleep-wake patterns (actigraphy) are also assessed. Tablet-based applications with integrated quality checks and automated, wireless electroencephalography make the Package easy to administer in the field by non-specialist staff. The Package is in use in Brazil, India, Italy, Kenya and the United Kingdom.The INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Package is a multi-dimensional instrument measuring early child development (ECD). Its developmental approach may be useful to those involved in large-scale ECD research and surveillance efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2030665240,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) has been recognized as an important activator of certain transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. More specifically, TRPV1 is a pain receptor activated by a wide range of stimuli. However, whether or not PI(4,5)P2 is a TRPV1 agonist remains open to debate. Utilizing a combined approach of mutagenesis and molecular modeling, we identified a PI(4,5)P2 binding site located between the TRP box and the S4-S5 linker. At this site, PI(4,5)P2 interacts with the amino acid residues Arg-575 and Arg-579 in the S4-S5 linker and with Lys-694 in the TRP box. We confirmed that PI(4,5)P2 behaves as a channel agonist and found that Arg-575, Arg-579, and Lys-694 mutations to alanine reduce PI(4,5)P2 binding affinity. Additionally, in silico mutations R575A, R579A, and K694A showed that the reduction in binding affinity results from the delocalization of PI(4,5)P2 in the binding pocket. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that PI(4,5)P2 binding induces conformational rearrangements of the structure formed by S6 and the TRP domain, which cause an opening of the lower TRPV1 channel gate."
https://openalex.org/W1964262871,"The molecular pathogenesis of autism is complex and involves numerous genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolic, and physiological alterations. Elucidating and understanding the molecular processes underlying the pathogenesis of autism is critical for effective clinical management and prevention of this disorder. The goal of this study is to investigate key molecular alterations postulated to play a role in autism and their role in the pathophysiology of autism. In this study we demonstrate that DNA isolated from the cerebellum of BTBR T+tf/J mice, a relevant mouse model of autism, and from human post-mortem cerebellum of individuals with autism, are both characterized by an increased levels of 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The increase in 8-oxodG and 5mC content was associated with a markedly reduced expression of the 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (Ogg1) and increased expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases 3a and 3b (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b). Interestingly, a rise in the level of 5hmC occurred without changes in the expression of ten-eleven translocation expression 1 (Tet1) and Tet2 genes, but significantly correlated with the presence of 8-oxodG in DNA. This finding and similar elevation in 8-oxodG in cerebellum of individuals with autism and in the BTBR T+tf/J mouse model warrant future large-scale studies to specifically address the role of OGG1 alterations in pathogenesis of autism."

In the current study, we manipulate, in a single task, both reactive and proactive inhibition mechanisms, and we investigate the within-subjects effect of increasing, by means of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the involvement of the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). Our results show a simultaneous enhancement of these two cognitive mechanisms when modulating the neural activity of rIFC. Thus, the application of anodal tDCS increased reaction times on Go trials, indicating a possible increase in proactive inhibition. Concurrently, the stop-signal reaction time, as a covert index of the inhibitory process, was reduced, demonstrating an improvement in reactive inhibition. In summary, the current pattern of results validates the engagement of the rIFC in these two forms of inhibitory processes, proactive and reactive inhibition and it provides evidence that both processes can operate concurrently in the brain."

In this study, UV-visible absorption, circular dichroism, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and enzyme kinetics were used to study the impact of pH on aromatase structure and androstenedione binding. Spectroscopic studies demonstrate that androstenedione binding is pH-dependent, whereas, in contrast, the D309N mutant retains its ability to bind to androstenedione across the entire pH range studied. Neither pH nor mutation perturbed the secondary structure or heme environment. The origin of the observed pH dependence was further narrowed to the protonation equilibria of Asp309 with a parallel set of spectroscopic studies using exemestane and anastrozole.

https://openalex.org/W2038667705,"While the fundamental trade-off in leaf traits related to carbon capture as described by the leaf economics spectrum is well-established among plant species, the relationship of the leaf economics spectrum to stem hydraulics is much less known. Since carbon capture and transpiration are coupled, a close connection between leaf traits and stem hydraulics should be expected. We thus asked whether xylem traits that describe drought tolerance and vulnerability to cavitation are linked to particular leaf traits. We assessed xylem vulnerability, using the pressure sleeve technique, and anatomical xylem characteristics in 39 subtropical tree species grown under common garden conditions in the BEF-China experiment and tested for correlations with traits related to the leaf economics spectrum as well as to stomatal control, including maximum stomatal conductance, vapor pressure deficit at maximum stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit at which stomatal conductance is down-regulated. Our results revealed that specific xylem hydraulic conductivity and cavitation resistance were closely linked to traits represented in the leaf economic spectrum, in particular to leaf nitrogen concentration, as well as to log leaf area and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio but not to any parameter of stomatal conductance. The study highlights the potential use of well-known leaf traits from the leaf economics spectrum to predict plant species' drought resistance."

In this study, static scanning technology was used to collect images of a rice sample's fully expanded top three leaves and corresponding sheathes. From these images, 32 spectral and shape characteristic parameters were extracted using an RGB mean value function and using the Regionprops function in MATLAB. Hierarchical identification was used to identify NPK deficiencies. First, the normal samples and non-normal (NPK deficiencies) samples were identified. Then, N deficiency and PK deficiencies were identified. Finally, P deficiency and K deficiency were identified. In the identification of every hierarchy, SVFS was used to select the optimal characteristic set for different deficiencies in a targeted manner, and Fisher discriminant analysis was used to build the diagnosis model. In the first hierarchy, the selected characteristics were the leaf sheath R, leaf sheath G, leaf sheath B, leaf sheath length, leaf tip R, leaf tip G, leaf area and leaf G. In the second hierarchy, the selected characteristics were the leaf sheath G, leaf sheath B, white region of the leaf sheath, leaf B, and leaf G. In the third hierarchy the selected characteristics were the leaf G, leaf sheath length, leaf area/leaf length, leaf tip G, difference between the 2nd and 3rd leaf lengths, leaf sheath G, and leaf lightness. The results showed that the overall identification accuracies of NPK deficiencies were 86.15, 87.69, 90.00 and 89.23% for the four growth stages. Data from multiple years were used for validation, and the identification accuracies were 83.08, 83.08, 89.23 and 90.77%."

However, current recombinant vaccines fail to sufficiently stimulate protective adaptive immunity against a wide range of pathogens while remaining a cost effective solution to global health challenges. Taking an unorthodox approach to this fundamental immunological challenge, we isolated the TLR-targeting capability of the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 bacteria (EcN) by engineering bionanoparticlate antigen carriers derived from EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Exogenous model antigens expressed by these modified bacteria as protein fusions with the bacterial enterotoxin ClyA resulted in their display on the surface of the carrier OMVs. Vaccination with the engineered EcN OMVs in a BALB/c mouse model, and subsequent mechanism of action analysis, established the EcN OMV’s ability to induce self-adjuvanted robust and protective humoral and TH1-biased cellular immunity to model antigens. This finding appears to be strain-dependent, as OMV antigen carriers similarly engineered from a standard K12 E. coli strain derivative failed to generate a comparably robust antigen-specific TH1 bias. The results demonstrate that unlike traditional subunit vaccines, these biomolecularly engineered “pathogen-like particles” derived from traditionally overlooked, naturally potent immunomodulators have the potential to effectively couple recombinant antigens with meaningful immunity in a broadly applicable fashion."

Compared to these four Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (P<0.001). Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and sequence comparison, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 was identified as either Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus. To further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the L-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (L-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. pentosus IG1, respectively, suggesting that Lactobacillu sp.

Using a high-throughput, random mutagenesis-based variomics screen, we generated and functionally characterized ∼6000 ANO1 mutants and identified novel mutations that affected channel activity, intracellular trafficking, or localization of ANO1. Mutations such as S741T increased ANO1 calcium sensitivity and rendered ANO1 calcium gating voltage-independent, demonstrating a critical role of the re-entrant loop in coupling calcium and voltage sensitivity of ANO1 and hence in regulating ANO1 activation. Our data present the first unbiased and comprehensive study of the structure-function relationship of ANO1.

https://openalex.org/W2122055917,"Introduction Non-Hispanic (nH) Black and Hispanic women are disproportionately affected by early onset disease, later stage, and with more aggressive, higher grade and ER/PR negative breast cancers. The purpose of this analysis was to examine whether genetic ancestry could account for these variation in breast cancer characteristics, once data were stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity and adjusted for potential confounding by social and behavioral factors. Methods We used a panel of 100 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) to estimate individual genetic ancestry in 656 women from the “Breast Cancer Care in Chicago” study, a multi-ethnic cohort of breast cancer patients to examine the association between individual genetic ancestry and breast cancer characteristics. In addition we examined the association of individual AIMs and breast cancer to identify genes/regions that may potentially play a role in breast cancer disease disparities. Results As expected, nH Black and Hispanic patients were more likely than nH White patients to be diagnosed at later stages, with higher grade, and with ER/PR negative tumors. Higher European genetic ancestry was protective against later stage at diagnosis (OR 0.7 95%CI: 0.54–0.92) among Hispanic patients, and higher grade (OR 0.73, 95%CI: 0.56–0.95) among nH Black patients. After adjustment for multiple social and behavioral risk factors, the association with later stage remained, while the association with grade was not significant. We also found that the AIM SNP rs10954631 on chromosome 7 was associated with later stage (p = 0.02) and higher grade (p = 0.012) in nH Whites and later stage (p = 0.03) in nH Blacks. Conclusion Non-European genetic ancestry was associated with later stage at diagnosis in ethnic minorities. The relation between genetic ancestry and stage at diagnosis may be due to genetic factors and/or unmeasured environmental factors that are overrepresented within certain racial/ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W1986090248,"The earliest direct evidence for tool-use by our ancestors are 2.6 million year old stone tools from Africa. These earliest artifacts show that, already, early hominins had developed the required advanced movement skills and cognitive capacities to manufacture stone tools. Currently, it is not well understood, however, which specific movement skills are required for successful stone knapping and accordingly it is unknown how these skills emerged during early hominin evolution. In particular, it is not clear which striking movements are indicative of skilled performance, how striking movement patterns vary with task and environmental constraints, and how movement patterns are passed on within social groups. The present study addresses these questions by investigating striking movement patterns and striking variability in 18 modern stone knappers (nine experienced and nine novices). The results suggest that no single movement pattern characterizes successful stone knapping. Participants showed large inter-individual movement variability of the elementary knapping action irrespective of knapping experience and knapping performance. Changes in task- and environmental constraints led knappers to adapt their elementary striking actions using a combination of individual and common strategies. Investigation of striking pattern similarities within social groups showed only partial overlap of striking patterns across related individuals. The results therefore suggest that striking movement patterns in modern stone knappers are largely specific to the individual and movement variability is not indicative of knapping performance. The implications of these results for the development of percussive traditions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2030518926,"Background The seagrass Zostera marina is a monocotyledonous angiosperm belonging to a polyphyletic group of plants that can live submerged in marine habitats. Zostera marina L. is one of the most common seagrasses and is considered a cornerstone of marine plant molecular ecology research and comparative studies. However, the mechanisms underlying its adaptation to the marine environment still remain poorly understood due to limited transcriptomic and genomic data. Principal Findings Here we explored the transcriptome of Z. marina leaves under different environmental conditions using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 55 million sequencing reads were obtained, representing 58,457 transcripts that correspond to 24,216 unigenes. A total of 14,389 (59.41%) unigenes were annotated by blast searches against the NCBI non-redundant protein database. 45.18% and 46.91% of the unigenes had significant similarity with proteins in the Swiss-Prot database and Pfam database, respectively. Among these, 13,897 unigenes were assigned to 57 Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 4,745 unigenes were identified and mapped to 233 pathways via functional annotation against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database (KEGG). We compared the orthologous gene family of the Z. marina transcriptome to Oryza sativa and Pyropia yezoensis and 11,667 orthologous gene families are specific to Z. marina. Furthermore, we identified the photoreceptors sensing red/far-red light and blue light. Also, we identified a large number of genes that are involved in ion transporters and channels including Na+ efflux, K+ uptake, Cl− channels, and H+ pumping. Conclusions Our study contains an extensive sequencing and gene-annotation analysis of Z. marina. This information represents a genetic resource for the discovery of genes related to light sensing and salt tolerance in this species. Our transcriptome can be further utilized in future studies on molecular adaptation to abiotic stress in Z. marina."
https://openalex.org/W2111377561,"Insertions and deletions (indels) are important types of structural variations. Obtaining accurate genotypes of indels may facilitate further genetic study. There are a few existing methods for calling indel genotypes from sequence reads. However, none of these tools can accurately call indel genotypes for indels of all lengths, especially for low coverage sequence data. In this paper, we present GINDEL, an approach for calling genotypes of both insertions and deletions from sequence reads. GINDEL uses a machine learning approach which combines multiple features extracted from next generation sequencing data. We test our approach on both simulated and real data and compare with existing tools, including Genome STRiP, Pindel and Clever-sv. Results show that GINDEL works well for deletions larger than 50 bp on both high and low coverage data. Also, GINDEL performs well for insertion genotyping on both simulated and real data. For comparison, Genome STRiP performs less well for shorter deletions (50–200 bp) on both simulated and real sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Clever-sv performs well for intermediate deletions (200–1500 bp) but is less accurate when coverage is low. Pindel only works well for high coverage data, but does not perform well at low coverage. To summarize, we show that GINDEL not only can call genotypes of insertions and deletions (both short and long) for high and low coverage population sequence data, but also is more accurate and efficient than other approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2038167739,"Trinucleotide repeats can be highly unstable, mutating far more frequently than point mutations. Repeats typically mutate by addition or loss of units of the repeat. CAG repeat expansions in humans trigger neurological diseases that include myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and several spinocerebellar ataxias. In human cells, diverse mechanisms promote CAG repeat instability, and in mice, the mechanisms of instability are varied and tissue-dependent. Dissection of mechanistic complexity and discovery of potential therapeutics necessitates quantitative and scalable screens for repeat mutation. We describe a GFP-based assay for screening modifiers of CAG repeat instability in human cells. The assay exploits an engineered intronic CAG repeat tract that interferes with expression of an inducible GFP minigene. Like the phenotypes of many trinucleotide repeat disorders, we find that GFP function is impaired by repeat expansion, in a length-dependent manner. The intensity of fluorescence varies inversely with repeat length, allowing estimates of repeat tract changes in live cells. We validate the assay using transcription through the repeat and engineered CAG-specific nucleases, which have previously been reported to induce CAG repeat instability. The assay is relatively fast and should be adaptable to large-scale screens of chemical and shRNA libraries."

Herein, we investigate the interaction between the peptide-functionalized dendrimer and liposomes composed of PC/Chol using fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance to get insights into the mechanism of internalization. The affinity for the membrane bilayer is very high and the interaction between the peptide-dendrimer and liposomes took place without evidence of pore formation. These results suggest that the presented peptidodendrimeric scaffold may be a promising material for efficient drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2069795343,"To investigate if magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the best Magnetic Resonance (MR)-based method when compared to gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection and quantification of liver steatosis in diabetic patients in the clinical practice using liver biopsy as the reference standard, and to assess the influence of steatohepatitis and fibrosis on liver fat quantification.Institutional approval and patient consent were obtained for this prospective study. Seventy-three patients with type 2 diabetes (60 women and 13 men; mean age, 54 ± 9 years) underwent MRI and MRS at 3.0 T. The liver fat fraction was calculated from triple- and multi-echo gradient-echo sequences, and MRS data. Liver specimens were obtained in all patients. The accuracy for liver fat detection was estimated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the correlation between fat quantification by imaging and histolopathology was analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficients.The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was 92%. All gradient-echo MRI and MRS findings strongly correlated with biopsy findings (triple-echo, rho = 0.819; multi-echo, rho = 0.773; MRS, rho = 0.767). Areas under the ROC curves to detect mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were: triple-echo sequences, 0.961, 0.975, and 0.962; multi-echo sequences, 0.878, 0.979, and 0.961; and MRS, 0.981, 0.980, and 0.954. The thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe steatosis were: triple-echo sequences, 4.09, 9.34, and 12.34, multi-echo sequences, 7.53, 11.75, and 15.08, and MRS, 1.71, 11.69, and 14.91. Quantification was not significantly influenced by steatohepatitis or fibrosis.Liver fat quantification by MR methods strongly correlates with histopathology. Due to the wide availability and easier post-processing, gradient-echo sequences may represent the best imaging method for the detection and quantification of liver fat fraction in diabetic patients in the clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2012900153,"The present study investigates whether producing gestures would facilitate route learning in a navigation task and whether its facilitation effect is comparable to that of hand movements that leave physical visible traces. In two experiments, we focused on gestures produced without accompanying speech, i.e., co-thought gestures (e.g., an index finger traces the spatial sequence of a route in the air). Adult participants were asked to study routes shown in four diagrams, one at a time. Participants reproduced the routes (verbally in Experiment 1 and non-verbally in Experiment 2) without rehearsal or after rehearsal by mentally simulating the route, by drawing it, or by gesturing (either in the air or on paper). Participants who moved their hands (either in the form of gestures or drawing) recalled better than those who mentally simulated the routes and those who did not rehearse, suggesting that hand movements produced during rehearsal facilitate route learning. Interestingly, participants who gestured the routes in the air or on paper recalled better than those who drew them on paper in both experiments, suggesting that the facilitation effect of co-thought gesture holds for both verbal and nonverbal recall modalities. It is possibly because, co-thought gesture, as a kind of representational action, consolidates spatial sequence better than drawing and thus exerting more powerful influence on spatial representation."
https://openalex.org/W2016960817,"A critical question among the researchers working on fungal lipid biology is whether the use of an enriched growth medium can affect the lipid composition of a cell and, therefore, contribute to the observed phenotypes. One presumption is that enriched medias, such as YPD (yeast extract, peptone and dextrose), are likely to contain lipids, which may homogenize with the yeast lipids and play a role in masking the actual differences in the observed phenotypes or lead to an altered phenotype altogether. To address this issue, we compared the lipids of Candida albicans, our fungus of interest, grown in YPD or in a defined media such as YNB (yeast nitrogen base). Mass spectrometry-based lipid analyses showed differences in the levels of phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, lyso-phospholipids; sphingolipids, such as mannosyldiinositolphosphorylceramide; and sterols, such as ergostatetraenol. Significant differences were observed in 70 lipid species between the cells grown in the two media, but the two growth conditions did not affect the morphological characteristics of C. albicans. The lipid profiles of the YNB- and YPD-grown C. albicans cells did vary, but these differences did not influence their response to the majority of the tested agents. Rather, the observed differences could be attributed to the slow growth rate of the Candida cells in YNB compared to YPD. Notably, the altered lipid changes between the two media did impact the susceptibility to some drugs. This data provided evidence that changes in media can lead to certain lipid alterations, which may affect specific pathways but, in general, do not affect the majority of the phenotypic properties of C. albicans. It was determined that either YNB or YPD may be suitable for the growth and lipid analysis of C. albicans, depending upon the experimental requirements, but additional precautions are necessary when correlating the phenotypes with the lipids."
https://openalex.org/W2003392799,"Coral reef calcification is predicted to decline as a result of ocean acidification and other anthropogenic stressors. The majority of studies predicting declines based on in situ relationships between environmental parameters and net community calcification rate have been location-specific, preventing accurate predictions for coral reefs globally. In this study, net community calcification and production were measured on a coral reef flat at One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, using Lagrangian flow respirometry and slack water methods. Net community calcification, daytime net photosynthesis and nighttime respiration were higher under the flow respirometry method, likely due to increased water flow relative to the slack water method. The two methods also varied in the degrees to which they were influenced by potential measurement uncertainties. The difference in the results from these two commonly used methods implies that some of the location-specific differences in coral reef community metabolism may be due to differences in measurement methods."
https://openalex.org/W2014115466,"Tyrosinase is the key enzyme involved in the human pigmentation process, as well as the undesired browning of fruits and vegetables. Compounds inhibiting tyrosinase catalytic activity are an important class of cosmetic and dermatological agents which show high potential as depigmentation agents used for skin lightening. The multi-step protocol employed for the identification of novel tyrosinase inhibitors incorporated the Shape Signatures computational algorithm for rapid screening of chemical libraries. This algorithm converts the size and shape of a molecule, as well its surface charge distribution and other bio-relevant properties, into compact histograms (signatures) that lend themselves to rapid comparison between molecules. Shape Signatures excels at scaffold hopping across different chemical families, which enables identification of new actives whose molecular structure is distinct from other known actives. Using this approach, we identified a novel class of depigmentation agents that demonstrated promise for skin lightening product development."
https://openalex.org/W2067172889,"Background In 2011–2012 a large pertussis outbreak occurred in England. This provided an opportunity to estimate the disease burden in those aged 5 years and over. As pertussis is likely to be under reported both laboratory-confirmed and non-confirmed cases were included. Methods Laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis, as well as their coughing but non-confirmed household members, were sent a questionnaire that collected information on clinical features and quality of life for the most severe day of disease and the day the patient filled in the questionnaire. The EuroQol-5 dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to evaluate quality of life. The duration of symptoms was obtained by contacting the patient every two weeks until symptoms stopped. Results Data for 535 (out of 1262) laboratory confirmed pertussis patients and 44 (out of 140) coughing household contacts was available for analysis. On the most severe day, 56% of laboratory-confirmed cases reported they had 20+ more paroxysms, 58% reported they had a severe cough and 46% reported disruption of sleep for more than 4 hours. For non-confirmed coughing household contacts there were a similar number of coughing spells per day at the height, though the cough was reported to be less severe and to cause less sleep disruption. The main clinical symptoms on the worst day for both were shortness of breath, tiredness, sore ribs and vomiting. The duration of symptoms for both patient groups was around 160 days (162 and 168 days). Under base case assumptions the overall loss of quality of life was 0.097 QALY (0.089–0.106) for confirmed pertussis cases and 0.0365 QALY (0.023–0.054) for coughing household contacts. Conclusion Pertussis is a serious disease in those aged 5 years and over, causing disruption of sleep and daily activities over long period of time. The burden of illness due to undiagnosed pertussis is also considerable."

Based on morphologic Top-Hat transform, the uneven illumination normalization algorithm has been carried out, and typically verified by three procedures. The first procedure employs the information from opening based Top-Hat operator, which is a classical method. In order to optimize and perfect the classical Top-Hat transform, the second procedure, featuring the definition of multi direction illumination notion, utilizes opening by reconstruction and closing by reconstruction based on multi direction structuring elements. Finally, multi direction images are merged to the final even illumination image. The performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated and verified through the processing of different ideal synthetic and camera collected images, with backgrounds characterized by poor lighting conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2139652011,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is associated with several extra-articular manifestations. Nephrolithiasis (NL) has not been recognized as one of those, however, several factors known to increase the risk of NL are at play in AS patients. The objective was to estimate rates and predictors of NL in Swedish patients with AS compared to the general population.We performed a prospective population-based nationwide cohort study based on linkage of data from Swedish registries. 8,572 AS patients were followed for 49,258 person-years (py) and 39,639 matched general population comparators were followed for 223,985 py. Patients were followed prospectively together with comparator subjects from January 2001 through December 2009. The first occurrence of NL during follow-up was the primary outcome. Hazard Ratios (HR) were used to compare these rates adjusting for comorbidities and treatment, and to assess predictors for NL. Mean age at study entry was 46 years (inter quartile range 36-56 years), 65% were males. Based on 250 vs. 466 NL events, the adjusted HR of NL in AS patients was 2.1 (95%CI 1.8 to 2.4). Predictors of NL within the AS group included prior diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (HR 2.3; 95%CI 1.7 to 3.3), prior diagnosis of NL (HR 16.4; 95%CI 11.5 to 23.4), and patients receiving anti-TNF treatment (HR 1.6; 95%CI 1.2 to 2.1). Male sex was a risk factor for NL both in AS patients and in the general population.The risk for residual confounding and inability to study the chemical nature of NL were considered the main limitations of the study.Patients with AS are at increased risk of NL, which may be considered a novel extra-articular manifestation. Previous history of NL, IBD, AS disease severity and male sex were identified as predictors of NL in AS."
https://openalex.org/W2155850500,"Social insect colonies can provide homeostatic conditions that buffer the incidence of environmental fluctuations on individuals, which have contributed to their ecological success. Coptotermes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) is a highly invasive termite genus and several species have important economic impact in many areas of the world. Mature Coptotermes colonies with millions of individuals can provide optimal environmental condition and nurturing capacity for the developing brood. However, it was previously suggested that contrary to mature colonies, incipient colonies may be exposed to critical stress, which may explain for the low success rate of establishment within the first year of the life of a termite colony. We here investigated the stress imposed on individuals of incipient colonies by comparing the developmental instability of individuals between incipient and mature colonies of two Coptotermes species, C. formosanus Shiraki and C. gestroi (Wasmann). We assessed the developmental instability by measuring the asymmetry of morphological traits from the head capsule of the soldier caste. Soldiers from incipient colonies of both species displayed strong asymmetrical traits in comparison to soldiers from mature colonies. We suggest that homeostatic conditions for optimal development are reached as the colony matures, and confirmed that the incipient colony remains a critical bottleneck where individuals are exposed to high developmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W1992056392,"We here propose a new model assembly for estimating the surviving fraction of cells irradiated with various types of ionizing radiation, considering both targeted and nontargeted effects in the same framework. The probability densities of specific energies in two scales, which are the cell nucleus and its substructure called a domain, were employed as the physical index for characterizing the radiation fields. In the model assembly, our previously established double stochastic microdosimetric kinetic (DSMK) model was used to express the targeted effect, whereas a newly developed model was used to express the nontargeted effect. The radioresistance caused by overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 known to frequently occur in human cancer was also considered by introducing the concept of the adaptive response in the DSMK model. The accuracy of the model assembly was examined by comparing the computationally and experimentally determined surviving fraction of Bcl-2 cells (Bcl-2 overexpressing HeLa cells) and Neo cells (neomycin resistant gene-expressing HeLa cells) irradiated with microbeam or broadbeam of energetic heavy ions, as well as the WI-38 normal human fibroblasts irradiated with X-ray microbeam. The model assembly reproduced very well the experimentally determined surviving fraction over a wide range of dose and linear energy transfer (LET) values. Our newly established model assembly will be worth being incorporated into treatment planning systems for heavy-ion therapy, brachytherapy, and boron neutron capture therapy, given critical roles of the frequent Bcl-2 overexpression and the nontargeted effect in estimating therapeutic outcomes and harmful effects of such advanced therapeutic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2019076610,"Atmospheric pollution is a major public health concern. It can affect placental function and restricts fetal growth. However, scientific knowledge remains too limited to make inferences regarding causal associations between maternal exposure to air pollution and adverse effects on pregnancy. This study evaluated the association between low birth weight (LBW) and maternal exposure during pregnancy to traffic related air pollutants (TRAP) in São Paulo, Brazil.Analysis included 5,772 cases of term-LBW (<2,500 g) and 5,814 controls matched by sex and month of birth selected from the birth registration system. Mothers' addresses were geocoded to estimate exposure according to 3 indicators: distance from home to heavy traffic roads, distance-weighted traffic density (DWTD) and levels of particulate matter ≤10 µg/m3 estimated through land use regression (LUR-PM10). Final models were evaluated using multiple logistic regression adjusting for birth, maternal and pregnancy characteristics. We found decreased odds in the risk of LBW associated with DWTD and LUR-PM10 in the highest quartiles of exposure with a significant linear trend of decrease in risk. The analysis with distance from heavy traffic roads was less consistent. It was also observed that mothers with higher education and neighborhood-level income were potentially more exposed to TRAP.This study found an unexpected decreased risk of LBW associated with traffic related air pollution. Mothers with advantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) although residing in areas of higher vehicular traffic might not in fact be more expose to air pollution. It can also be that the protection against LBW arising from a better SEP is stronger than the effect of exposure to air pollution, and this exposure may not be sufficient to increase the risk of LBW for these mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2070297574,"Background ERCP has a complication rate ranging between 4% and 16% such as post-ERCP pancreatitis, hemorrhage, cholangitis and perforation. Perforation rate was reported as 0.08% to 1% and mortality rate up to 1.5%. Besides, injury related death rate is 16% to 18%. In this study we aimed to present a retrospective review of our experience with post ERCP-related perforations, reveal the type of injuries and management recommendations with the minimally invasive approaches. Methods Medical records of 28 patients treated for ERCP-related perforations in Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital between March 2007 and March 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Patient age, gender, comorbidities, ERCP indication, ERCP findings and details were analyzed. All previous and current clinical history, laboratory and radiological findings were used to assess the evaluation of perforations. Results Between March 2007 and March 2013, 2972 ERCPs were performed, 28 (0.94%) of which resulted in ERCP-related perforations. 10 of them were men (35.8%) and 18 women (64.2%). Mean age was 53.36±14.12 years with a range of 28 to 78 years. 14 (50%) patients were managed conservatively, while 14 (50%) were managed surgically. In 6 patients, laparoscopic exploration was performed due to the failure of non-surgical management. In 6 of the patients that ERCP-related perforation was suspected during or within 2 hours after ERCP, underwent to surgery primarily. There were two mortalities. The mean length of hospitalization stay was 10.46±2.83 days. The overall mortality rate was 7.1%. Conclusion Successful management of ERCP-related perforation requires immediate diagnosis and early decision to decide whether to manage conservatively or surgically. Although traditionally conventional surgical approaches have been suggested for the treatment of perforations, laparoscopic techniques may be used in well-chosen cases especially in type II, III and IV perforations."
https://openalex.org/W2081283341,"N-acylethanolamines are an important class of lipid signaling molecules found in many species, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) where they are involved in development and adult lifespan. In mammals, the relative activity of the biosynthetic enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase-D and the hydrolytic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase determine N-acylethanolamine levels. C. elegans has two N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase-D orthologs, nape-1 and nape-2, that are likely to have arisen from a gene duplication event. Here, we find that recombinant C. elegans NAPE-1 and NAPE-2 are capable of generating N-acylethanolamines in vitro, confirming their functional conservation. In vivo, they exhibit overlapping expression in the pharynx and the nervous system, but are also expressed discretely in these and other tissues, suggesting divergent roles. Indeed, nape-1 over-expression results in delayed growth and shortened lifespan only at 25°C, while nape-2 over-expression results in significant larval arrest and increased adult lifespan at 15°C. Interestingly, deletion of the N-acylethanolamine degradation enzyme faah-1 exacerbates nape-1 over-expression phenotypes, but suppresses the larval arrest phenotype of nape-2 over-expression, suggesting that faah-1 is coupled to nape-2, but not nape-1, in a negative feedback loop. We also find that over-expression of either nape-1 or nape-2 significantly enhances recovery from the dauer larval stage in the insulin signaling mutant daf-2(e1368), but only nape-1 over-expression reduces daf-2 adult lifespan, consistent with increased levels of the N-acylethanolamine eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine. These results provide evidence that N-acylethanolamine biosynthetic enzymes in C. elegans have conserved function and suggest a temperature-dependent, functional divergence between the two isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1989061225,"The aquatic communities found within the water filled leaves of the pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, have a simple trophic structure providing an ideal system to study microscale interactions between protozoan predators and their bacterial prey. In this study, replicate communities were maintained with and without the presence of the bactivorous protozoan, Colpoda steinii, to determine the effects of grazing on microbial communities. Changes in microbial (Archaea and Bacteria) community structure were assessed using iTag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The microbial communities were similar with and without the protozoan predator, with>1000 species. Of these species, Archaea were negligible, with Bacteria comprising 99.99% of the microbial community. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla. The addition of a protozoan predator did not have a significant effect on microbial evenness nor richness. However, the presence of the protozoan did cause a significant shift in the relative abundances of a number of bacterial species. This suggested that bactivorous protozoan may target specific bacterial species and/or that certain bacterial species have innate mechanisms by which they evade predators. These findings help to elucidate the effect that trophic structure perturbations have on predator prey interactions in microbial systems."
https://openalex.org/W2094538388,"In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, protein substrates are degraded via covalent modification by a polyubiquitin chain. The polyubiquitin chain must be assembled rapidly in cells, because a chain of at least four ubiquitins is required to signal for degradation, and chain-editing enzymes in the cell may cleave premature polyubiquitin chains before achieving this critical length. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 and ubiquitin ligase SCF are capable of building polyubiquitin chains onto protein substrates both rapidly and processively; this may be explained at least in part by the atypically fast rate of Cdc34 and SCF association. This rapid association has been attributed to electrostatic interactions between the acidic C-terminal tail of Cdc34 and a feature on SCF called the basic canyon. However, the structural aspects of the Cdc34-SCF interaction and how they permit rapid complex formation remain elusive. Here, we use protein cross-linking to demonstrate that the Cdc34-SCF interaction occurs in multiple conformations, where several residues from the Cdc34 acidic tail are capable of contacting a broad region of the SCF basic canyon. Similar patterns of cross-linking are also observed between Cdc34 and the Cul1 paralog Cul2, implicating the same mechanism for the Cdc34-SCF interaction in other members of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. We discuss how these results can explain the rapid association of Cdc34 and SCF.The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 rapidly associates with ubiquitin ligase SCF to achieve processive ubiquitination.ResultsProtein cross-linking was used to capture native Cdc34-SCF complexes.ConclusionThe acidic tail domain of Cdc34 interacts with the basic canyon region on SCF in multiple conformations.SignificanceMultiple conformations between Cdc34 and SCF enable their rapid association. In the ubiquitin-proteasome system, protein substrates are degraded via covalent modification by a polyubiquitin chain.

The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 and ubiquitin ligase SCF are capable of building polyubiquitin chains onto protein substrates both rapidly and processively; this may be explained at least in part by the atypically fast rate of Cdc34 and SCF association. This rapid association has been attributed to electrostatic interactions between the acidic C-terminal tail of Cdc34 and a feature on SCF called the basic canyon. However, the structural aspects of the Cdc34-SCF interaction and how they permit rapid complex formation remain elusive. Here, we use protein cross-linking to demonstrate that the Cdc34-SCF interaction occurs in multiple conformations, where several residues from the Cdc34 acidic tail are capable of contacting a broad region of the SCF basic canyon. Similar patterns of cross-linking are also observed between Cdc34 and the Cul1 paralog Cul2, implicating the same mechanism for the Cdc34-SCF interaction in other members of the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. We discuss how these results can explain the rapid association of Cdc34 and SCF.The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 rapidly associates with ubiquitin ligase SCF to achieve processive ubiquitination. Protein cross-linking was used to capture native Cdc34-SCF complexes. The acidic tail domain of Cdc34 interacts with the basic canyon region on SCF in multiple conformations."
https://openalex.org/W2046782880,"During insect oogenesis, the follicular epithelium undergoes both cell proliferation and apoptosis, thus modulating ovarian follicle growth. The Hippo pathway is key in these processes, and has been thoroughly studied in the meroistic ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. However, nothing is known about the role of the Hippo pathway in primitive panoistic ovaries. This work examines the mRNA expression levels of the main components of the Hippo pathway in the panoistic ovary of the basal insect species Blattella germanica, and demonstrates the function of Hippo through RNAi. In Hippo-depleted specimens, the follicular cells of the basal ovarian follicles proliferate without arresting cytokinesis; the epithelium therefore becomes bilayered, impairing ovarian follicle growth. This phenotype is accompanied by long stalks between the ovarian follicles. In D. melanogaster loss of function of Notch determines that the stalk is not developed. With this in mind, we tested whether Hippo and Notch pathways are related in B. germanica. In Notch (only)-depleted females, no stalks were formed between the ovarian follicles. Simultaneous depletion of Hippo and Notch rescued partially the stalk to wild-type. Unlike in the meroistic ovaries of D. melanogaster, in panoistic ovaries the Hippo pathway appears to regulate follicular cell proliferation by acting as a repressor of Notch, triggering the switch from mitosis to the endocycle in the follicular cells. The phylogenetically basal position of B. germanica suggests that this might be the ancestral function of Hippo in insect ovaries."

Bovine β-arrestin 2 has been shown to be SUMOylated on the lysine 400 residue, which links it to the endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Here we identify a major SUMOylation site, lysine 295, on human β-arrestin 2.

https://openalex.org/W2006177838,"Background New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be considered a good use of limited health resources. Methods and Findings The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4,560 per additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of £71,757 and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of £7,935 and a probability of 0.91. Conclusions Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom acupuncture is unavailable or perhaps inappropriate, counselling has an ICER less than most cost-effectiveness thresholds. However, further research is needed to determine the most cost-effective treatment pathways for depressed patients when the full range of available interventions is considered."
https://openalex.org/W2044502936,"Background Localized hypersensitivity reaction, delayed arterial healing, and neoatherosclerosis inside the stent have been suggested as the underlying pathologic mechanisms of very late stent thrombosis (VLST) of drug-eluting stent (DES). The present study sought to explore the prevalence of inflammatory cell infiltrates and evidence for fragments of atherosclerotic plaques in the aspirated thrombi in patients with DES VLST. Methods and Results From April 2004 to September 2012, 48 patients with stent thrombosis (ST) of DES underwent thrombus aspiration with retrieved material sufficient for the histopathologic analysis; early ST (EST, within 30 days): N = 17, late ST (LST, between 31 and 365 days): N = 7, and very late ST (VLST, >1 year): N = 24. Eosinophil fraction in the aspirated thrombi was significantly higher in patients with VLST (8.2±5.7%) as compared with those with EST (4.3±3.0%) and LST (5.5±3.8%) (P = 0.03). Eosinophil fraction in the aspirated thrombi was significantly higher in 12 VLST patients with angiographic peri-stent contrast staining (PSS) and/or incomplete stent apposition (ISA) by intravascular ultrasound than in 12 VLST patients without PSS or ISA (10.6±6.1% versus 5.8±4.1%, P = 0.03). Evidences for fragments of atherosclerotic plaques in the aspirated thrombi were observed only in 3 (13%) out of 24 patients with DES VLST. Conclusions Eosinophil fraction in the aspirated thrombi was significantly higher in patients with DES VLST as compared with those with EST and LST. Evidences for fragments of atherosclerotic plaques were relatively uncommon in patients with DES VLST."
https://openalex.org/W2071799313,"Abstract Miniature chromosome maintenance 7 (MCM7) is an essential component of DNA replication licensing complex. Recent studies indicate that MCM7 is amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. In this report, we show that MCM7 binds SF3B3. The binding motif is located in the N terminus (amino acids 221–248) of MCM7. Knockdown of MCM7 or SF3B3 significantly increased unspliced RNA of epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and c-Met. A dramatic drop of reporter gene expression of the oxytocin exon 1-intron-exon 2-EGFP construct was also identified in SF3B3 and MCM7 knockdown PC3 and DU145 cells. The MCM7 or SF3B3 depleted cell extract failed to splice reporter RNA in in vitro RNA splicing analyses. Knockdown of SF3B3 and MCM7 leads to an increase of cell death of both PC3 and DU145 cells. Such cell death induction is partially rescued by expressing spliced c-Met. To our knowledge, this is the first report suggesting that MCM7 is a critical RNA splicing factor, thus giving significant new insight into the oncogenic activity of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2030996297,"Background The value of family history as a risk factor for kidney failure has not been determined in a nationwide setting. Aim This nationwide family study aimed to determine familial risks for kidney failure in Sweden. Methods The Swedish multi-generation register on 0–78-year-old subjects were linked to the Swedish patient register and the Cause of death register for 1987–2010. Individuals diagnosed with acute kidney failure (n = 10063), chronic kidney failure (n = 18668), or unspecified kidney failure (n = 3731) were included. Kidney failure patients with cystic kidney disease, congenital kidney and urinary tract malformations, urolithiasis, and rare inherited kidney syndromes, and hyperoxaluria were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for individuals whose parents/siblings were diagnosed with kidney failure compared to those whose parents or siblings were not. Results The concordant (same disease) familial risks (sibling/parent history) were increased for chronic kidney failure SIR = 2.02 (95% confidence interval, CI 1.90–2.14) but not for acute kidney failure SIR = 1.08 (95% CI 0.94–1.22) and for unspecified kidney failure SIR = 1.25 (95% CI 0.94–1.63). However, the discordant (different disease) familial risk for acute kidney failure SIR = 1.19 (95% CI 1.06–1.32) and unspecified kidney failure SIR = 1.63 (95% CI 1.40–1.90) was significantly increased in individuals with a family history of chronic kidney failure. The familial risk for chronic kidney failure was similar for males SIR = 2.04 (95% CI 1.90–2.20) and females SIR = 1.97 (95% CI 1.78–2.17). Familial risks for chronic kidney failure were highest at age of 10–19 years SIR = 6.33 (95% CI 4.16–9.22). Conclusions The present study shows that family history is an important risk factor for chronic kidney failure but to a lower degree for acute kidney failure and unspecified kidney failure."
https://openalex.org/W2111821454,"Xylella fastidiosa is a gram-negative, xylem-limited plant pathogenic bacterium that causes disease in a variety of economically important agricultural crops including Pierce's disease of grapevines. Xylella fastidiosa biofilms formed in the xylem vessels of plants play a key role in early colonization and pathogenicity by providing a protected niche and enhanced cell survival. Here we investigate the role of Xylella fastidiosa PD1063, the predicted ortholog of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO_03968, which encodes an outer membrane protein. To assess the function of the Xylella fastidiosa ortholog, we created Xylella fastidiosa mutants deleted for PD1063 and then assessed biofilm formation, cell-cell aggregation and cell growth in vitro. We also assessed disease severity and pathogen titers in grapevines mechanically inoculated with the Xylella fastidiosa PD1063 mutant. We found a significant decrease in cell-cell aggregation among PD1063 mutants but no differences in cell growth, biofilm formation, disease severity or titers in planta. Based on the demonstration that Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae PXO_03968 encodes an outer membrane protein, secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles, we predicted that PD1063 would also be secreted in a similar manner. Using anti-PD1063 antibodies, we found PD1063 in the supernatant and secreted in association with outer membrane vesicles. PD1063 purified from the supernatant, outer membrane fractions and outer membrane vesicles was 19.2 kD, corresponding to the predicted size of the processed protein. Our findings suggest Xylella fastidiosa PD1063 is not essential for development of Pierce's disease in Vitis vinifera grapevines although further research is required to determine the function of the PD1063 outer membrane protein in Xylella fastidiosa."
https://openalex.org/W1970889384,"The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in rat anaphylactic hypotension. It is well known that sympathetic nerve activity and cardiovascular function are affected by anesthetics. However, the effects of different types of anesthesia on the efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) during anaphylactic hypotension remain unknown. Therefore, we determined the renal sympathetic responses to anaphylactic hypotension in anesthetized and conscious rats and the roles of baroreceptors in these responses. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to anesthetic groups that were given pentobarbital, urethane, or ketamine-xylazine and to a conscious group. The rats were sensitized using subcutaneously injected ovalbumin. The systemic arterial pressure (SAP), RSNA and heart rate (HR) were measured. The effects of sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation on RSNA during anaphylaxis were determined in pentobarbital-anesthetized and conscious rats. In all of the sensitized rats, the RSNA increased and SAP decreased after antigen injection. At the early phase within 35 min of the antigen injection, the antigen-induced sympathoexcitation in the conscious rats was significantly greater than that in the anesthetized rats. Anaphylactic hypotension was attenuated in the conscious rats compared to the anesthetized rats. The anesthetic-induced suppression of SAP and RSNA was greater in the order ketamine-xylazine >urethane = pentobarbital. Indeed, in the rats treated with ketamine-xylazine, RSNA did not increase until 40 min, and SAP remained at low levels after the antigen injection. The baroreceptor reflex, as evaluated by increases in RSNA and HR in response to the decrease in SAP induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP), was suppressed in the anesthetized rats compared with the conscious rats. Consistent with this finding, baroreceptor denervation attenuated the excitatory responses of RSNA to anaphylaxis in the conscious rats but not in the pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. RSNA was increased markedly in conscious rats during anaphylactic hypotension. Anesthetics attenuated this antigen-induced renal sympathoexcitation through the suppression of baroreceptor function."

https://openalex.org/W2065691363,"Through thermal expansion of oceans and melting of land-based ice, global warming is very likely contributing to the sea level rise observed during the 20th century. The amount by which further increases in global average temperature could affect sea level is only known with large uncertainties due to the limited capacity of physics-based models to predict sea levels from global surface temperatures. Semi-empirical approaches have been implemented to estimate the statistical relationship between these two variables providing an alternative measure on which to base potentially disrupting impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. However, only a few of these semi-empirical applications had addressed the spurious inference that is likely to be drawn when one nonstationary process is regressed on another. Furthermore, it has been shown that spurious effects are not eliminated by stationary processes when these possess strong long memory. Our results indicate that both global temperature and sea level indeed present the characteristics of long memory processes. Nevertheless, we find that these variables are fractionally cointegrated when sea-ice extent is incorporated as an instrumental variable for temperature which in our estimations has a statistically significant positive impact on global sea level."
https://openalex.org/W2079725795,"Circulating blood microparticles are submicron vesicles released primarily by megakaryocytes and platelets that act as transcellular communicators. Inflammatory conditions exhibit elevated blood microparticle numbers compared to healthy conditions. Direct functional consequences of microparticle composition, especially internal composition, on recipient cells are poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate if microparticle composition could impact the function of recipient cells, particularly during inflammatory provocation. We therefore engineered the composition of megakaryocyte culture-derived microparticles to generate distinct microparticle populations that were given to human monocytes to assay for influences recipient cell function. Herein, we tested the responses of monocytes exposed to either control microparticles or microparticles that contain the anti-inflammatory transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). In order to normalize relative microparticle abundance from two microparticle populations, we implemented a novel approach that utilizes a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer to assay for microparticle density rather than concentration. We found that when given to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, microparticles were preferentially internalized by CD11b+ cells, and furthermore, microparticle composition had a profound functional impact on recipient monocytes. Specifically, microparticles containing PPARγ reduced activated monocyte production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 compared to activated monocytes exposed to control microparticles. Additionally, treatment with PPARγ microparticles greatly increased monocyte cell adherence. This change in morphology occurred simultaneously with increased production of the key extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin and increased expression of the fibronectin-binding integrin, ITGA5. PPARγ microparticles also changed monocyte mRNA levels of several genes including those under PPARγ control. Overall, the delivery of PPARγ from microparticles to human monocytes influenced gene expression, decreased inflammatory mediator production and increased monocyte adherence. These results support the concept that the composition of blood microparticles has a profound impact on the function of cells with which they interact, and likely plays a role in vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1974433830,"Classical decision theory predicts that people should be indifferent to information that is not useful for making decisions, but this model often fails to describe human behavior. Here we investigate one such scenario, where people desire information about whether an event (the gain/loss of money) will occur even though there is no obvious decision to be made on the basis of this information. We find a curious dual trend: if information is costless, as the probability of the event increases people want the information more; if information is not costless, people's desire for the information peaks at an intermediate probability. People also want information more as the importance of the event increases, and less as the cost of the information increases. We propose a model that explains these results, based on the assumption that people have limited cognitive resources and obtain information about which events will occur so they can determine whether to expend effort planning for them."
