However, the association between prematurity and advanced maternal age remains controversial. Objective To evaluate the impact of maternal age on the occurrence of preterm birth after controlling for multiple known confounders in a large birth cohort. Study design Retrospective cohort study using data from the QUARISMA study, a large Canadian randomized controlled trial, which collected data from 184,000 births in 32 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were maternal age over 20 years. Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancy, fetal malformation and intra-uterine fetal death. Five maternal age categories were defined and compared for maternal characteristics, gestational and obstetric complications, and risk factors for prematurity. Risk factors for preterm birth <37 weeks, either spontaneous or iatrogenic, were evaluated for different age groups using multivariate logistic regression. Results 165,282 births were included in the study. Chronic hypertension, assisted reproduction techniques, pre-gestational diabetes, invasive procedure in pregnancy, gestational diabetes and placenta praevia were linearly associated with increasing maternal age whereas hypertensive disorders of pregnancy followed a “U” shaped distribution according to maternal age. Crude rates of preterm birth before 37 weeks followed a “U” shaped curve with a nadir at 5.7% for the group of 30–34 years. In multivariate analysis, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of prematurity stratified by age group followed a “U” shaped distribution with an aOR of 1.08 (95%CI; 1.01–1.15) for 20–24 years, and 1.20 (95% CI; 1.06–1.36) for 40 years and older. Confounders found to have the greatest impact were placenta praevia, hypertensive complications, and maternal medical history. Conclusion Even after adjustment for confounders, advanced maternal age (40 years and over) was associated with preterm birth. A maternal age of 30–34 years was associated with the lowest risk of prematurity."

In the current study, we sought to identify genetic factors related to the development of NAFLD, NASH, and NASH-HCC, and to establish risk-estimation models for them. For these purposes, 936 histologically proven NAFLD patients were recruited, and genome-wide association (GWA) studies were conducted for 902, including 476 NASH and 58 NASH-HCC patients, against 7,672 general-population controls. Risk estimations for NAFLD and NASH were then performed using the SNPs identified as having significant associations in the GWA studies. We found that rs2896019 in PNPLA3 [p = 2.3x10-31, OR (95%CI) = 1.85 (1.67-2.05)], rs1260326 in GCKR [p = 9.6x10-10, OR (95%CI) = 1.38(1.25-1.53)], and rs4808199 in GATAD2A [p = 2.3x10-8, OR (95%CI) = 1.37 (1.23-1.53)] were significantly associated with NAFLD. Notably, the number of risk alleles in PNPLA3 and GATAD2A was much higher in Matteoni type 4 (NASH) patients than in type 1, type 2, and type 3 NAFLD patients. In addition, we newly identified rs17007417 in DYSF [p = 5.2x10-7, OR (95%CI) = 2.74 (1.84-4.06)] as a SNP associated with NASH-HCC. Rs641738 in TMC4, which showed association with NAFLD in patients of European descent, was not replicated in our study (p = 0.73), although the complicated LD pattern in the region suggests the necessity for further investigation. The genetic variants of PNPLA3, GCKR, and GATAD2A were then used to estimate the risk for NAFLD. The obtained Polygenic Risk Scores showed that the risk for NAFLD increased with the accumulation of risk alleles [AUC (95%CI) = 0.65 (0.63-0.67)].We demonstrated that NASH is genetically and clinically different from the other NAFLD subgroups. We also established risk-estimation models for NAFLD and NASH using multiple genetic markers. These models can be used to improve the accuracy of NAFLD diagnosis and to guide treatment decisions for patients."

Given recent results of our labs' pre-clinical animal SCI LT studies and existing overlap of lumbosacral spinal circuitries controlling pelvic-visceral and locomotor functions, we addressed whether LT can improve bladder, bowel and sexual function in humans at chronic SCI time-points (> two years post-injury). Study design Prospective cohort study; pilot trial with small sample size. Methods Eight SCI research participants who were undergoing 80 daily one-hour sessions of LT on a treadmill using body-weight support, or one-hour of LT and stand training on alternate days, as part of another research study conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center, University of Louisville, were enrolled in this pilot trial. Urodynamic assessments were performed and International Data Set questionnaire forms completed for bladder, bowel and sexual functions at pre-and post-training time points. Four usual care (non-trained; regular at-home routine) research participants were also enrolled in this study and had the same assessments collected twice, at least 3 months apart. Results Filling cystometry documented significant increases in bladder capacity, voiding efficiency and detrusor contraction time as well as significant decreases in voiding pressure post-training relative to baseline. Questionnaires revealed a decrease in the frequency of nocturia and urinary incontinence for several research participants as well as a significant decrease in time required for defecation and a significant increase in sexual desire post-training. No significant differences were found for usual care research participants. Conclusions These results suggest that an appropriate level of sensory information provided to the spinal cord, generated through task-specific stepping and/or loading, can positively benefit the neural circuitries controlling urogenital and bowel functions.

https://openalex.org/W2785581868,"Proteostasis, or protein homeostasis, encompasses the maintenance of the conformational and functional integrity of the proteome and involves an integrated network of cellular pathways. Molecular chaperones, such as the small heat shock proteins (sHsps), are key elements of the proteostasis network that have crucial roles in inhibiting the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Failure of the proteostasis network can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins into intracellular and extracellular deposits. Deposits containing fibrillar forms of α-synuclein (α-syn) are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Here we show that the sHsp Hsp27 (HSPB1) binds to α-syn fibrils, inhibiting fibril growth by preventing elongation. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)–based imaging methods, we show that Hsp27 binds along the surface of α-syn fibrils, decreasing their hydrophobicity. Binding of Hsp27 also inhibits cytotoxicity of α-syn fibrils. Our results demonstrate that the ability of sHsps, such as Hsp27, to bind fibrils represents an important mechanism through which they may mitigate cellular toxicity associated with aberrant protein aggregation. Fibril binding may represent a generic mechanism by which chaperone-active sHsps interact with aggregation-prone proteins, highlighting the potential to target sHsp activity to prevent or disrupt the onset and progression of α-syn aggregation associated with α-synucleinopathies.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that some sHsps can prevent protein aggregation without the need to form stable, high-molecular mass complexes containing the aggregation-prone protein (11Kulig M. Ecroyd H. The small heat-shock protein alphaB-crystallin uses different mechanisms of chaperone action to prevent the amorphous versus fibrillar aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin.Biochem.

Instead, interactions with aggregation-prone proteins can be weak and transient, and do not result in stable complexes. Thus, rather than solely acting as holdases, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between sHsps and aggregating target proteins are multifaceted and are likely to depend on the stability of the target protein (10Ecroyd H.

The failure of the proteostasis network to prevent protein aggregation can lead to the deposition of insoluble proteins, often in the form of amyloid fibrils, into intracellular inclusions and extracellular plaques. These deposits are hallmarks of a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease (20Irvine G.B. El-Agnaf O.M. Shankar G.M. Walsh D.M.

In particular, inclusions, known as Lewy bodies, are detected within the neuronal tissue of patients with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These inclusions are composed primarily of the intrinsically disordered protein, α-synuclein (α-syn) (22Martí M.J. Tolosa E. Campdelacreu J. Clinical overview of the synucleinopathies.Mov.

The initial step is the formation of oligomers in a primary nucleation process, followed by growth and elongation of these species by the addition of monomers. It is increasingly evident that other secondary processes exist, including fragmentation and secondary nucleation on the surface of aggregates as they are formed (24Knowles T.P.J. Waudby C.A.

Understanding the pathogenesis of α-syn requires detailed knowledge of the fundamental nature of each of the steps within the aggregation pathway, including primary and secondary nucleation processes. The soluble oligomer model of amyloid cytotoxicity suggests that mature fibrils are relatively inert end products of aggregation (21Chiti F Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, amyloid formation, and human disease: a summary of progress over the last decade.Annu. Rev.

Thus, secondary processes such as catalysis of nucleation at the fibril surface and fibril fragmentation not only increase fibrillar load but can also directly increase the abundance of potentially cytotoxic oligomers (27Cohen S.I.A.

As such, the formation of amyloid-rich inclusions in cells has been postulated to be a protective mechanism (31Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B.

There remains debate as to whether these proteins are sequestered as a consequence of aggregation or if there is a physiological role for their presence. The recently described ability of the Hsp70 chaperone complex to bind and facilitate disassembly of α-syn fibrils (35Gao X. Carroni M. Nussbaum-Krammer C. Mogk A. Nillegoda N.B. Szlachcic A.

The presence of sHsps in Lewy bodies has often been regarded to be a consequence of their inability to prevent α-syn aggregation, because their chaperone activity may be overwhelmed when the rate of aggregation exceeds the capacity of the sHsps to supply chaperone-active subunits (15Cox D.

Moreover, αB-c can interact with mature amyloid fibrils (41Waudby C.A. Knowles T.P.J. Devlin G.L. Skepper J.N. Ecroyd H. Carver J.A. Welland M.E. Christodoulou J. Dobson C.M. Meehan S.

For example, by binding to fibrils formed by apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), αB-c has been shown to induce dissociation of monomeric units from fibril ends, inhibit fibril elongation and fragmentation, and cause the fibrils to entangle into larger deposits (43Binger K.J. Ecroyd H. Yang S. Carver J.A. Howlett G.J. Griffin M.D.W. Avoiding the oligomeric state: αB-crystallin inhibits fragmentation and induces dissociation of apolipoprotein C-II amyloid fibrils.FASEB J. 2013; 27 (23159935): 1214-122210.1096/fj.12-220657Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this interaction and whether or not it provides a protective effect by inhibiting the cytotoxicity of the fibrils themselves is not yet known. Furthermore, it remains to be established if other sHsps, such as Hsp27, can bind fibrils, and thus whether fibril binding is likely to be a generic property of chaperone-active sHsps. In this work, we specifically address these issues by examining the ability of Hsp27 to interact with fibrillar forms of α-syn. Using a variety of techniques, including single aggregate visualization by enhancement (SAVE) imaging (45Horrocks M.H. Lee S.F. Gandhi S. Magdalinou N.K. Chen S.W. Devine M.J. Tosatto L. Kjaergaard M. Beckwith J.S. Zetterberg H. Iljina M. Cremades N. Dobson C.M. Wood N.W. Klenerman D. Single-molecule imaging of individual amyloid protein aggregates in human biofluids.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2016; 7 (26800462): 399-40610.1021/acschemneuro.5b00324Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we show that Hsp27 binds to α-syn fibrils and, in doing so, decreases their overall hydrophobicity and the cellular toxicity of exogenous, fibrillar α-syn. To enable direct measurement of the elongation rate of small amyloid fibril fragments (seeds) (Fig. 1A), seeded aggregation assays were performed. Under these conditions, aggregation occurs primarily through monomer addition at fibril ends, as primary nucleation processes do not contribute significantly to the observed aggregation kinetics (46Buell A.K. Galvagnion C. Gaspar R. Sparr E. Vendruscolo M. Knowles T.P. Linse S. Dobson C.M. Solution conditions determine the relative importance of nucleation and growth processes in α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24817693): 7671-767610.1073/pnas.1315346111Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Indeed, incubation of monomeric α-syn in the presence of 5% (w/w) seeds did not result in an observable lag phase typical of non-seeded aggregation (in which nucleation processes also occur), and was best described by a one-phase association function (Fig. 1B). Elongation was inhibited by the addition of Hsp27 and this effect was specific to the chaperone as no inhibition was seen when a non-chaperone control protein (BSA) was used at the same concentration (Fig. 1B). When the concentration of monomeric α-syn was increased in the presence of a constant concentration of seed fibrils (i.e. 2.5 μm), the rate of elongation and total fibril formation increased (Fig. 1C). By considering the linear portion of the elongation phase during which the increase in thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence is directly proportional to fibril growth (in this case at times between 1 and 3 h) (Fig. 1D), the relationship between the concentration of monomeric α-syn and elongation rate was best described by two-step Michaelis-Menten behavior, as found previously (46Buell A.K. Galvagnion C. Gaspar R. Sparr E. Vendruscolo M. Knowles T.P. Linse S. Dobson C.M. Solution conditions determine the relative importance of nucleation and growth processes in α-synuclein aggregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24817693): 7671-767610.1073/pnas.1315346111Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1G). However, the increase in the rate of elongation and total fibril formation was inhibited by the presence of Hsp27 (Fig. 1, E and F). In the presence of Hsp27 (50 μm), there was no significant increase in the rate of elongation at low concentrations of monomeric α-syn (up to 50 μm) (Fig. 1G). However, as the concentration of monomeric α-syn was increased (to 75 and 100 μm), such that the molar ratio of monomeric α-syn:Hsp27 exceeded 1:1, a small but significant increase in the rate of α-syn aggregation was observed. Importantly, in the presence of Hsp27, the elongation rate of the α-syn fibrils was found to no longer follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1G). Together, these data suggest that the interaction between Hsp27 and monomeric α-syn is dependent on the rate of fibril elongation. However, these findings may also reflect an interaction between Hsp27 and the fibrillar seeds of α-syn, whereby Hsp27 is in direct competition with monomeric α-syn for access to fibril ends, thus inhibiting elongation of the fibril seeds. As the concentration of monomeric α-syn increases, it may outcompete Hsp27 for binding to fibril ends leading to the observed increase in the rate of elongation. To explore further the possible interaction of Hsp27 with α-syn seed fibrils, the ratio of fibril seeds to monomeric α-syn was varied and Hsp27 added to the samples at a range of concentrations (Fig. 2). As expected, incubation of monomeric α-syn in the presence of 2.5% (w/w) α-syn seeds resulted in a characteristic aggregation profile with no observable lag phase (Fig. 2A). Addition of Hsp27 inhibited this aggregation, such that there was a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate and total amount of α-syn aggregation as the concentration of Hsp27 was increased (Fig. 2, A and B). By repeating this experiment using different concentrations of α-syn fibril seeds (from 1 to 10% (w/w) of the monomeric α-syn concentration) the relationship between the concentration of Hsp27 and subsequent α-syn fibril elongation rate was established (Fig. 2C). This relationship is best described by the single exponential decay function (Fig. 2C) whereby the half-maximal inhibition from this fit provides a measure of the ability of Hsp27 to inhibit fibril elongation at each ratio of seed to monomeric α-syn (Fig. 2D). There was a strong exponential correlation between the concentration of seed fibrils and the ability of Hsp27 to inhibit elongation, i.e. as the concentration of α-syn seed increased, more Hsp27 was required to inhibit fibril elongation. Taken together, these data therefore provide evidence that Hsp27 interacts directly with fibrillar α-syn. Altho"
https://openalex.org/W2781575554,"Forty million adults in the US suffer from anxiety disorders, making these the most common forms of mental illness. Transient receptor potential channel canonical subfamily (TRPC) members 4 and 5 are non-selective cation channels highly expressed in regions of the cortex and amygdala, areas thought to be important in regulating anxiety. Previous work with null mice suggests that inhibition of TRPC4 and TRPC5 may have anxiolytic effects.To assess the potential of TRPC4/5 inhibitors as an avenue for treatment, we invented a highly potent, small molecule antagonist of TRPC4 and TRPC5 which we call HC-070. HC-070 inhibits recombinant TRPC4 and TRPC5 homomultimers in heterologous expression systems with nanomolar potency. It also inhibits TRPC1/5 and TRPC1/4 heteromultimers with similar potency and reduces responses evoked by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) in the amygdala. The compound is >400-fold selective over a wide range of molecular targets including ion channels, receptors, and kinases.Upon oral dosing in mice, HC-070 achieves exposure levels in the brain and plasma deemed sufficient to test behavioral activity. Treatment with HC-070 attenuates the anxiogenic effect of CCK-4 in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The compound recapitulates the phenotype observed in both null TRPC4 and TRPC5 mice in a standard EPM. Anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects of HC-070 are also observed in pharmacological in vivo tests including marble burying, tail suspension and forced swim. Furthermore, HC-070 ameliorates the increased fear memory induced by chronic social stress. A careful evaluation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship reveals that substantial efficacy is observed at unbound brain levels similar to, or even lower than, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) recorded in vitro, increasing confidence that the observed effects are indeed mediated by TRPC4 and/or TRPC5 inhibition. Together, this experimental data set introduces a novel, high quality, small molecule antagonist of TRPC4 and TRPC5 containing channels and supports the targeting of TRPC4 and TRPC5 channels as a new mechanism of action for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms."

Here, we assessed in a pilot study the tolerability and safety of self-titrated nabiximols vs. placebo among 40 treatment-seeking cannabis-dependent participants.Subjects participated in a double blind randomized clinical trial, with as-needed nabiximols up to 113.4 mg THC/105 mg CBD or placebo daily for 12 weeks, concurrently with Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT). Primary outcome measures were tolerability and abstinence, secondary outcome measures were days and amount of cannabis use, withdrawal, and craving scores. Participants received up to CDN$ 855 in compensation for their time.Medication was well tolerated and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed. Rates of adverse events did not differ between treatment arms (F1,39 = 0.205, NS). There was no significant change in abstinence rates at trial end. Participants were not able to differentiate between subjective effects associated with nabiximols or placebo treatments (F1,40 = 0.585, NS). Cannabis use was reduced in the nabiximols (70.5%) and placebo groups (42.6%). Nabiximols reduced cannabis craving but no significant differences between the nabiximols and placebo groups were observed on withdrawal scores.Nabiximols in combination with MET/CBT was well tolerated and allowed for reduction of cannabis use. Future clinical trials should explore the potential of high doses of nabiximols for cannabis dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2787483021,"Climate change is a threat to marine ecosystems and the services they provide, and reducing fishing pressure is one option for mitigating the overall consequences for marine biota. We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a ≥40% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future."

Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare the rate of receiving joint replacement surgery during 10 years of follow-up.At the end of follow-up, 438 of all enrolled subjects (15.08%) had received the joint replacement surgery, including 124 in the case group (12.81%) and 314 in the control group (16.22%). The case group tended to be associated with lower rate of receiving the joint replacement surgery at the end of follow-up than the control group (p = 0.003). Cox proportional hazards regression (HR) analysis revealed that study subjects under combination therapy with metformin had lower rate of joint replacement surgery (adjusted HR 0.742 (95% CI = 0.601-0.915, p = 0.005)). In the subgroups, study subjects in the combination metformin therapy who were female, good adherence (>80%), lived in the highest urbanization levels of residence, treatment in the hospital center and lower monthly insurance premiums were associated with a lower risk of joint replacement surgery than those without.Patients who have OA and T2DM receiving combination COX-2 inhibitors and metformin therapy associated with lower joint replacement surgery rates than those without and this may be attributable to combination therapy much more decrease pro-inflammatory factors associated than those without metformin therapy."

A potential role of CTRP9 for regulation of endothelium function has been suggested by previous studies. However, no studies have examined the relation between serum CTRP9 levels and adhesion molecules in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD). The present study was conducted on 337 subjects who underwent coronary angiography and were categorized into four groups according to the presence of CAD and T2DM (control, CAD, T2DM and CAD+T2DM). Serum levels of CTRP9, adiponectin, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sE-Selectin, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured. It was found that the circulating CTRP9 levels were independently associated with increased risk of CAD and T2DM in addition to elevated levels of serum CTRP9 in CAD, T2DM and CAD+T2DM groups. A significant association of serum CTRP9 levels with adhesion molecules in CAD and T2DM patients as well as serum TNF-α levels in CAD individuals was noted. A significant relation between the circulating levels of CTRP9 and HOMA-IR in T2DM subjects was also observed. The results revealed increased circulating levels of CTRP9 in T2DM and CAD individuals which suggests a compensatory response to insulin resistance, inflammatory milieu and endothelial dysfunction; however, more studies are needed to confirm this."

DEPTOR, also known as DEPDC6, plays an important role in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways. DEPTOR was degraded rapidly and promoted the activity of mTOR kinase when cells were shifted from unfavorable to favorable environments (4Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A.

It was also found that DEPTOR suppressed mTOR activity by interacting with the FAT domain of mTOR via its C-terminal PDZ domain. The N terminus of DEPTOR contains two DEP domains with largely unknown function. Moreover, DEPTOR is an unstable protein and can be rapidly degraded under growth factor stimulation (4Peterson T.R.

Ubiquitination is an essential modification during the post-translational process (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759494): 425-47910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.425Crossref PubMed Scopus (6894) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small polypeptide and is attached to the amino group of an acceptor, which is usually on the lysine residues of substrates (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759494): 425-47910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.425Crossref PubMed Scopus (6894) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is initiated by the E1 enzyme–dependent activation of ubiquitin followed by its transfer to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The resultant thioester linkage of Ub to E2 enzyme acts in concert with a ubiquitin ligase (E3) to conjugate ubiquitin on substrates (17Rajalingam K. Dikic I. SnapShot: expanding the ubiquitin code.Cell. 2016; 164 (26919436): 1074-1074.e110.1016/j.cell.2016.02.019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Schulman B.A. Harper J.W.

This cycle can be repeated to form various ubiquitin chains (Lys-48, Lys-63, Lys-33, Lys-29, Lys-27, Lys-6, or Lys-11) (19Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J.

The type of ubiquitin chain linkage determines the destination of the corresponding ubiquitination. For example, Lys-48–linked Ub chains usually target proteins for proteasome degradation. In contrast, Lys-63–linked Ub chains are non-degradable and often orchestrate protein complex in signaling pathways (20Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Polyubiquitin chains: polymeric protein signals.Curr.

Selection of the substrate is dependent on the E3, whereas the E2 can determine the specific type of ubiquitin chain (23Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev.

Based on the structure of the active site and the mechanism of catalysis, DUBs are divided into five groups: UCHs, USPs, MJDs, OTUs, and JAMMs (24Nijman S.M. Luna-Vargas M.P. Velds A.

The release of Ub is achieved either by the removal of the entire Ub chain from the protein or by the removal of individual or multiple ubiquitins from the chain. Conversely, different DUBs exhibit specific preferences for mono-/poly-Ub chains (28Kim J.H. Park K.C. Chung S.S. Bang O. Chung C.H. Deubiquitinating enzymes as cellular regulators.J. Biochem. 2003; 134 (12944365): 9-1810.1093/jb/mvg107Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are also some DUBs that target a wide range of distinct ubiquitinated proteins and display a diverse array of biological functions (29Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D.

In this study, we identified OTUB1 as a DEPTOR-interacting protein that deubiquitinates and stabilizes DEPTOR in an Asp-88–dependent manner. Moreover, OTUB1 also negatively regulates the activation of mTORC1 by stabilizing DEPTOR protein under the changing conditions of nutrient cues, which ultimately involves in cellular autophagy, cell size alteration, and tumor growth. mTORC1 signaling is activated by short-term amino acid treatment (44Jin G. Lee S.W. Zhang X. Cai Z. Gao Y. Chou P.C. Rezaeian A.H. Han F. Wang C.Y. Yao J.C. Gong Z. Chan C.H. Huang C.Y. Tsai F.J.

We were interested in studying whether and how mTORC1 activation is shut off by long-term amino acid treatment. Consistent with a previous study, treatment with amino acids results in mTORC1 activation in 1 h as determined by pS6K and pS6 (44Jin G. Lee S.W. Zhang X. Cai Z. Gao Y. Chou P.C. Rezaeian A.H. Han F. Wang C.Y. Yao J.C. Gong Z. Chan C.H. Huang C.Y. Tsai F.J.

Interestingly, we found that under long-term amino acid stimulation up to 6 h, the activation of mTORC1 signaling was significantly decreased (Fig. 1A), suggesting that a negative feedback might be operating to control such amino acid–dependent mTORC1 signaling pathway. To uncover the mechanism by which mTORC1 is inactivated under long-term amino acid treatment, we examined the expression levels of the corresponding mTORC1 components in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Interestingly, we found that the protein levels of DEPTOR, but not other proteins, were increased in response to long-term amino acid stimulation (Fig. 1A). However, we did not detect up-regulation of DEPTOR at the mRNA level (Fig. 1B), suggesting that DEPTOR levels may be regulated at the post-translational level. It has been reported that SCFβTrCP targets DEPTOR for ubiquitination-dependent degradation (4Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M.

However, it is not clear whether DEPTOR is regulated by deubiquitination as well. To explore the potential relevance of DUBs for DEPTOR stability, we screened a library of different DUBs by examining the ubiquitination levels of DEPTOR. Our data showed that OTUB1, OTUB2, OTUD5, UCHL1, and JOSD2, but not other DUBs, significantly removed the ubiquitination chain from DEPTOR (Fig. 1, C and D). To further identify which DUB is involved in the DEPTOR deubiquitination, we examined the interaction between the above-mentioned DUBs and DEPTOR by a coimmunoprecipitation assay. Our data showed that OTUB1, OTUB2, OTUD5, UCHL1, and JOSD2, but not other DUBs, could interact with DEPTOR (Fig. 2, A and B). The interaction between exogenous or endogenous DEPTOR and OTUB1 was further confirmed by a coimmunoprecipitation assay in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, C–E). These data suggest that OTUB1 may directly interact with DEPTOR. OTUB1 differs from OTUB2 primarily by an N-terminal extension of 46 amino acid residues that is absent from OTUB2 (Fig. 2F). We therefore tested whether the interaction between DEPTOR and OTUB1 depends on the N terminus of OTUB1. DEPTOR was coexpressed with the wildtype or a mutant of HA-OTUB1 lacking its N-terminal extension (HA-OTUB1ΔN). As shown in Fig. 2G, our data showed that the mutant, HA-OTUB1ΔN, lost the ability to interact with DEPTOR, indicating an important role of the N terminus of OTUB1 in its interaction with DEPTOR. To further confirm this finding, we generated an OTUB1-(N-term)-OTUB2 (N+OTUB2) chimera construct and examined its interaction with DEPTOR. We found that the binding of DEPTOR was rescued by the fusion of the N terminus of OTUB1 to OTUB2 (Fig. 2H). These results together indicate that OTUB1 requires its N terminus to interact with DEPTOR. Because the cellular protein levels of DEPTOR were increased in response to long-term amino acid stimulation as shown in Fig. 1, we hypothesized that the binding of OTUB1 and DEPTOR is mediated by amino acid signals. To this end, we examined whether the interaction between DEPTOR and OTUB1 is regulated by amino acid stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2I, the binding of OTUB1 to DEPTOR was markedly increased under amino acid treatment. The interaction between endogenous DEPTOR and OTUB1 was also strengthened under amino acid treatment (Fig. 2J), suggesting that OTUB1 may be involved in the modulation of DEPTOR stability induced by amino acid signaling. We next examined whether OTUB1 is involved in DEPTOR stabilization. Our data showed that protein levels of DEPTOR were dramatically increased by coexpression of OTUB1 (Fig. 3A). We also examined whether OTUB1 affects the stability of DEPTOR using a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay. To this end, FLAG-DEPTOR was coexpressed with or without FLAG-OTUB1 in HEK293T cells. The half-life time of FLAG-DEPTOR was analyzed. Our data showed that OTUB1 significantly prolonged the half-life of FLAG-DEPTOR (Fig. 3, B and C). The E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFβTrCP has been reported to induce DEPTOR degradation (49Chen L. Liu T. Tu Y. Rong D. Cao Y.

https://openalex.org/W2785979835,"Sound is a potent elicitor of emotions. Auditory core, belt and parabelt regions have anatomical connections to a large array of limbic and paralimbic structures which are involved in the generation of affective activity. However, little is known about the functional role of auditory cortical regions in emotion processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and music stimuli that evoke joy or fear, our study reveals that anterior and posterior regions of auditory association cortex have emotion-characteristic functional connectivity with limbic/paralimbic (insula, cingulate cortex, and striatum), somatosensory, visual, motor-related, and attentional structures. We found that these regions have remarkably high emotion-characteristic eigenvector centrality, revealing that they have influential positions within emotion-processing brain networks with “small-world” properties. By contrast, primary auditory fields showed surprisingly strong emotion-characteristic functional connectivity with intra-auditory regions. Our findings demonstrate that the auditory cortex hosts regions that are influential within networks underlying the affective processing of auditory information. We anticipate our results to incite research specifying the role of the auditory cortex—and sensory systems in general—in emotion processing, beyond the traditional view that sensory cortices have merely perceptual functions."

We investigated the interest of exploring biological parameters and sleep disturbances in relation to burnout symptoms among white-collar workers. Fifty-four participants with burnout were compared to 86 healthy control participants in terms of professional rank level, sleep, job strain (Karasek questionnaire), social support, anxiety and depression (HAD scale). Fasting concentrations of glycaemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), and white blood cell (WBC) counts were assessed. Analysis of variance and a forward Stepwise Multiple Logistic Regression were made to identify predictive factors of burnout. Besides reporting more job strain (in particular job control p = 0.02), higher levels of anxiety (p<0.001), and sleep disorders related to insomnia (OR = 21.5, 95%CI = 8.8-52.3), participants with burnout presented higher levels of HbA1C, glycaemia, CRP, lower levels of 25(OH)D, higher number of leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (P<0.001 for all) and higher total-cholesterol (P = 0.01). In particular, when HbA1c is > 3.5%, the prevalence of burnout increases from 16.6% to 60.0% (OR = 4.3, 95%CI = 2.8-6.9). Strong significant positive correlation existed between HbA1C and the two dimensions (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization (r = 0.79 and r = 0.71, p<0.01)) of burnout. Models including job strain, job satisfaction, anxiety and insomnia did not predict burnout (p = 0.30 and p = 0.50). However, when HbA1C levels is included, the prediction of burnout became significant (P = 0.03). Our findings demonstrated the interest of sleep and biological parameters, in particular HbA1C levels, in the characterization of professional burnout."

We hypothesized that radiologic images could be an alternative method for identification of tumor heterogeneity. We tested heterogeneity textural parameters on pretreatment FDG-PET/CT in order to assess the predictive value of target therapy. Recurred or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects with an activating EGFR mutation treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib were reviewed. An exploratory data set (n = 161) and a validation data set (n = 21) were evaluated, and eight parameters were selected for survival analysis. The optimal cutoff value was determined by the recursive partitioning method, and the predictive value was calculated using Harrell’s C-index. Univariate analysis revealed that all eight parameters showed an increased hazard ratio (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS). The highest HR was 6.41 (P<0.01) with co-occurrence (Co) entropy. Increased risk remained present after adjusting for initial stage, performance status (PS), and metabolic volume (MV) (aHR: 4.86, P<0.01). Textural parameters were found to have an incremental predictive value of early EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) failure compared to that of the base model of the stage and PS (C-index 0.596 vs. 0.662, P = 0.02, by Co entropy). Heterogeneity textural parameters acquired from pretreatment FDG-PET/CT are highly predictive factors for PFS of EGFR TKI in EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. These parameters are easily applicable to the identification of a subpopulation at increased risk of early EGFR TKI failure. Correlation to genomic alteration should be determined in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2785854876,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a critical role in intercellular communication by transferring microRNAs, lipids, and proteins to neighboring cells. Sortilin, a sorting receptor that directs target proteins to the secretory or endocytic compartments of cells, is found in both EVs and cells. In many human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disorders, sortilin expression levels are atypically high. To elucidate the relationship between cardiovascular disease, particularly vascular calcification, and sortilin expression levels, we explored the trafficking of sortilin in both the intracellular and extracellular milieu. We previously demonstrated that sortilin promotes vascular calcification via its trafficking of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase to EVs. Although recent reports have noted that sortilin is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, the precise mechanisms of sortilin trafficking still need to be determined. Here, we show that sortilin forms homodimers with an intermolecular disulfide bond at the cysteine 783 (Cys783) residue, and because Cys783 can be palmitoylated, it could be shared via palmitoylation and an intermolecular disulfide bond. Formation of this intermolecular disulfide bond leads to trafficking of sortilin to EVs by preventing palmitoylation, which further promotes sortilin trafficking to the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, we found that sortilin-derived propeptide decreased sortilin homodimers within EVs. In conclusion, sortilin is transported to EVs via the formation of homodimers with an intermolecular disulfide bond, which is endogenously regulated by its own propeptide. Therefore, we propose that inhibiting dimerization of sortilin acts as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EV-associated diseases, including vascular calcification and cancer.

Strategies for restoring normal p53 function are complicated by the oncogenic properties of mutant p53 and have not met with clinical success. To counteract mutant p53 activity, a variety of drugs with the potential to reconvert mutant p53 to an active wildtype form have been developed. However, these drugs are associated with various negative effects such as cellular toxicity, nonspecific binding to other proteins, and inability to induce a wildtype p53 response in cancer tissue. Here, we report on the effects of a curcumin analog, HO-3867, on p53 activity in cancer cells from different origins. We found that HO-3867 covalently binds to mutant p53, initiates a wildtype p53-like anticancer genetic response, is exclusively cytotoxic toward cancer cells, and exhibits high anticancer efficacy in tumor models. In conclusion, HO-3867 is a p53 mutant–reactivating drug with high clinical anticancer potential."
https://openalex.org/W2792554237,"The global lion (Panthera leo) population decline is partly a result of retaliatory killing in response to livestock depredation. Nairobi National Park (NNP) is a small protected area in Kenya surrounded by a human-dominated landscape. Communities around the park use flashlights to deter lions from their livestock bomas. We investigated the response by lions to the installation of a LED flashlight technique during 2007–2016.We interviewed 80 owners of livestock bomas with flashlights (n = 43) and without (n = 37) flashlights in the surroundings of NNP and verified reported attacks on bomas against predation data over10 years. The frequency of attacks on bomas equipped with flashlights was significantly lower compared to bomas without flashlights. We also found that after flashlight installation at livestock bomas, lion attacks took place further away from the park edge, towards areas where bomas without flashlights were still present. With increased numbers of flashlight installations at bomas in recent years, we further noticed a shift from nocturnal to more diurnal predation incidences. Our study shows that the LED flashlight technique is effective in reducing nocturnal livestock predation at bomas by lions. Long term studies on the effects as well as expansion of this technique into other communities around NNP are recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2791343295,"Studies of colonoscopic fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in patients with recurrent CDI, indicate that this is a very effective treatment for preventing further relapses. In order to provide this service at Stony Brook University Hospital, we initiated an open-label prospective study of single colonoscopic FMT among patients with ≥ 2 recurrences of CDI, with the intention of monitoring microbial composition in the recipient before and after FMT, as compared with their respective donor. We also initiated a concurrent open label prospective trial of single colonoscopic FMT of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) not responsive to therapy, after obtaining an IND permit (IND 15642). To characterize how FMT alters the fecal microbiota in patients with recurrent Clostridia difficile infections (CDI) and/or UC, we report the results of a pilot microbiome analysis of 11 recipients with a history of 2 or more recurrences of C. difficile infections without inflammatory bowel disease (CDI-only), 3 UC recipients with recurrent C. difficile infections (CDI + UC), and 5 UC recipients without a history of C. difficile infections (UC-only).V3V4 Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed on the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient fecal samples along with those collected from the healthy donors. Fitted linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of Group (CDI-only, CDI + UC, UC-only), timing of FMT (Donor, pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, 3-months post-FMT) and first order Group*FMT interactions on the diversity and composition of fecal microbiota. Pairwise comparisons were then carried out on the recipient vs. donor and between the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient samples within each group.Significant effects of FMT on overall microbiota composition (e.g., beta diversity) were observed for the CDI-only and CDI + UC groups. Marked decreases in the relative abundances of the strictly anaerobic Bacteroidetes phylum, and two Firmicutes sub-phyla associated with butyrate production (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were observed between the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. There were corresponding increases in the microaerophilic Proteobacteria phylum and the Firmicutes/Bacilli group in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. At a more granular level, significant effects of FMT were observed for 81 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in at least one of the three recipient groups (p<0.00016 with Bonferroni correction). Pairwise comparisons of the estimated pre-FMT recipient/donor relative abundance ratios identified 6 Gammaproteobacteria OTUs, including the Escherichia-Shigella genus, and 2 Fusobacteria OTUs with significantly increased relative abundance in the pre-FMT samples of all three recipient groups (FDR < 0.05), however the magnitude of the fold change was much larger in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients than in the UC-only recipients. Depletion of butyrate producing OTUs, such as Faecalibacterium, in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients, were restored after FMT.The results from this pilot study suggest that the microbial imbalances in the CDI + UC recipients more closely resemble those of the CDI-only recipients than the UC-only recipients."
https://openalex.org/W2786118451,"A growing body of research indicates that gamblers develop an attentional bias for gambling-related stimuli. Compared to research on substance use, however, few studies have examined attentional biases in gamblers using eye-gaze tracking, which has many advantages over other measures of attention. In addition, previous studies of attentional biases in gamblers have not directly matched type of gambler with personally-relevant gambling cues. The present study investigated the specificity of attentional biases for individual types of gambling using an eye-gaze tracking paradigm. Three groups of participants (poker players, video lottery terminal/slot machine players, and non-gambling controls) took part in one test session in which they viewed 25 sets of four images (poker, VLTs/slot machines, bingo, and board games). Participants' eye fixations were recorded throughout each 8-second presentation of the four images. The results indicated that, as predicted, the two gambling groups preferentially attended to their primary form of gambling, whereas control participants attended to board games more than gambling images. The findings have clinical implications for the treatment of individuals with gambling disorder. Understanding the importance of personally-salient gambling cues will inform the development of effective attentional bias modification treatments for problem gamblers."
https://openalex.org/W2792738650,"Mammalian testis undergoes deep changes in their architecture and function during photoregression conditions in seasonal breeders. Particularly, the testicular mechanisms that regulate the transition between the active (functional) and inactive (regression) stage vary between species. The aim of the present study was to analyze the incidence of proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy in the testicular seminiferous ephitelium of a seasonal breeder, Lagostomus maximus, during the annual reproductive cycle. We observed that proliferating spermatogonia increased from the active testis until reaching the maximum peak in the activating testis. During the annual reproductive cycle, the quantity of apoptotic-TUNEL positive spermatogonia and meiotic germ cells was constant and this might be regulated by the members of the BCL2 family. Only in the activating testis, apoptosis of germ cells was almost undetectable. The analysis of the autophagic-related proteins BECN1 and LC3 showed their localization in Leydig cells and the germ cells in the active and activating testis. In the inactive testis, BECN1 and LC3 ceased to be immunolocalized within the seminiferous tubules and the mRNA expression of both regulators decreased. Moreover, the expression of BECN1 and LC3 and also the apoptotic index were up regulated in testicular cultures subjected to nutritional stress. These results suggest a possible interaction between apoptosis and autophagy in the active and activating testis (characterized by high metabolic requirement and nutrient), where autophagy could promote survival over cell death. In the inactive testis, the absence of autophagic-related proteins might explain the massive loss of germ cells, suggesting that autophagy plays new and key role in the alterations of the seminiferous epithelium during photoregression."
https://openalex.org/W2793732250,"Body size misperception-the belief that one is larger or smaller than reality-affects a large and growing segment of the population. Recently, studies have shown that exposure to extreme body stimuli results in a shift in the point of subjective normality, suggesting that visual adaptation may be a mechanism by which body size misperception occurs. Yet, despite being exposed to a similar set of bodies, some individuals within a given geographical area will develop body size misperception and others will not. The reason for these individual difference is currently unknown. One possible explanation stems from the observation that women with lower levels of body satisfaction have been found to pay more attention to images of thin bodies. However, while attention has been shown to enhance visual adaptation effects in low (e.g. rotational and linear motion) and high level stimuli (e.g., facial gender), it is not known whether this effect exists in visual adaptation to body size. Here, we test the hypothesis that there is an indirect effect of body satisfaction on the direction and magnitude of the body fat adaptation effect, mediated via visual attention (i.e., selectively attending to images of thin over fat bodies or vice versa). Significant mediation effects were found in both men and women, suggesting that observers' level of body satisfaction may influence selective visual attention to thin or fat bodies, which in turn influences the magnitude and direction of visual adaptation to body size. This may provide a potential mechanism by which some individuals develop body size misperception-a risk factor for eating disorders, compulsive exercise behaviour and steroid abuse-while others do not."

Several of the putative ulvan lyase genes have been recombinantly expressed and partially characterized (15Kopel M. Helbert W. Belnik Y. Buravenkov V. Herman A. Banin E.

LOR_107 from Alteromonas sp. strain LOR was confirmed as an ulvan lyase, leading to the establishment of a new polysaccharide lyase family PL24 in the CAZy database (8Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24270786): D490-D49510.1093/nar/gkt1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (4110) Google Scholar), which presently contains 29 identified homologs. We have recently characterized the structure and catalytic mechanism of an ulvan lyase from Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain PLSV, called PLSV_3936. This enzyme belongs to another new polysaccharide lyase family, PL25 (16Ulaganathan T. Boniecki M.T. Foran E. Buravenkov V. Mizrachi N. Banin E. Helbert W. Cygler M. New ulvan-degrading polysaccharide lyase family: structure and catalytic mechanism suggests convergent evolution of active site architecture.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 (28290654): 1269-128010.1021/acschembio.7b00126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PLSV_3936 is folded into a seven-bladed β-propeller and utilizes the His/Tyr-mediated elimination mechanism for catalysis. Moreover, we have described the polysaccharide utilization locus in Alteromonas genome and identified LOR_29 as an ulvan lyase also belonging to the PL25 family (17Foran E. Buravenkov V. Kopel M. Mizrahi N. Shoshani S. Helbert W. Banin E. Functional characterization of a novel “ulvan utilization loci” found in Alteromonas sp. LOR genome.Algal Res. 2017; 25: 39-4610.1016/j.algal.2017.04.036Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we report our investigation of ulvan lyase LOR_107 from Alteromonas (PL24 family). Initial characterization of LOR_107 showed that it preferentially cleaves the bond adjacent to glucuronic acid but has very low or no activity for ulvan segments containing iduronic acid (15Kopel M. Helbert W. Belnik Y. Buravenkov V. Herman A. Banin E. New family of ulvan lyases identified in three isolates from the Alteromonadales order.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26763234): 5871-587810.1074/jbc.M115.673947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We report the crystal structure of LOR_107 at 1.9-Å resolution. LOR_107 displays a seven-bladed β-propeller fold. The putative active site of LOR_107 was deduced from the structure and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of these residues and measurements of their enzymatic activity. The structure of two inactive mutants (R259N and R320N) with a tetrasaccharide substrate soaked into the crystals identified the location of the substrate-binding site and suggested a two-stage substrate binding mechanism. LOR_107 follows the His/Tyr mechanism with some modifications. LOR_107 is a founding member of the PL24 polysaccharide lyase family. The secondary structure predictions with PsiPred (18Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED protein analysis workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23748958): W349-W35710.1093/nar/gkt381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar) indicate an all β-strand-containing fold, which suggested a possible similarity to lyases from PL11, PL22, or PL25 families. The protein crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which are virtually identical and superimpose with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) of 0.29 Å for all Cα atoms. The molecule adopts the fold of a seven-bladed β-propeller (Fig. 1A, B). Each propeller consists of four antiparallel β-strands. Blades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are formed by residues 90–133, 148–208, 240–286, 299–369, 382–434, and 444–478. The 7th blade is formed from three C-terminal β-strands, 483–518, and the 4th β-strands is provided by the N-terminal residues 43–56. The fourth strand in blade 2 is distorted, forming fewer inter-chain hydrogen bonds. This strand is followed by a long loop that is stabilized by a metal ion (see below). The loops joining β-strands extend on either side of the propeller formed by the blades. The loops on one side of the propeller are rather short (bottom of the propeller), whereas the loops on the opposite end are of varied length, with some extending high above the ends of the β-sheets (top of the propeller). Especially, loops within blades 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 are especially long, whereas those within blades 3 and 6 are much shorter. These long loops delineate a deep canyon on the top surface of the propeller, with high walls on two sides and a lower “neck” located between blades 2 and 4 over the short loops within blade 3 (Fig. 1C). The opposite end of the canyon also has a lower wall formed by blade 6. This canyon is lined with a cluster of highly conserved surface-exposed residues, indicating that this surface defines the substrate-binding site of LOR_107. The presence of metal ions in the structure was indicated by four very strong peaks in the difference electron density map, much larger than what is expected for solvent molecules. Two metal ions are present in each independent molecule at identical positions. We identified these ions as Ca2+ based on their coordination geometry. The Ca2+ ions are located at the periphery of the propeller. Ca2+(1) in site 1 stabilizes the long and winding loop leading from blade 2 to blade 3 and abutting the long loop between distorted strand β4 of blade 2 and β1 of blade 3 (Fig. 1B). This Ca2+ ion is surrounded by seven ligands in a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. The equatorial ligands are provided by OD1 and OD2 of Asp222, the carbonyl oxygen of Lys224 and two water molecules, whereas the axial ligands are OD2 of Asp212 and another water molecule (Fig. 1D). Ca2+(2) in site 2 is located in blade 4 and stabilizes a long loop between strands β2 and β3. The loop connecting blades 4 and 5 is leaning onto this loop (Fig. 1B). The coordination of this Ca2+ is also pentagonal bipyramidal, with equatorial ligands being OD2 of Asp326 and four water molecules, whereas the axial ligands are carbonyl oxygens of Asn323 and Phe328 (Fig. 1D). Both sites are distant from the conserved residue cluster in the canyon and appear to play a strictly structural role. In addition to the metal ions, we have identified several sulfate ions in our structure. In particular, two sulfates occupy similar positions in both molecules at the canyon on the top of the propeller. They are surrounded by polar and basic amino acids. We have investigated the evolutionary conservation of residues in the LOR_107 sequence using the program ConSurf (19Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. ConSurf 2005: the projection of evolutionary conservation scores of residues on protein structures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 (15980475): W299-W30210.1093/nar/gki370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). This led to the identification of highly conserved residues on the protein surface that are solvent accessible (Fig. 2A). Two clusters of conserved residues are located on the top side of the propeller and on the sides of the canyon, and contain polar and charged residues that could constitute the active site. Residues His146, His167, Thr242, Tyr243, and Arg259 belong to cluster I and are located on one side of the canyon at the inner edges of blades 2 and 3. Asn263, Tyr303, Arg320, and Tyr330 belong to cluster II and are on the opposite side of the canyon on the edge of blade 4 (Fig. 2B). These residues are absolutely or highly conserved among PL24 sequences. The two clusters are separated by ∼8–10 Å and define the width of the canyon, which is sufficient to accommodate a linear ulvan polysaccharide. We have investigated the contribution of these amino acids to the enzyme activity of LOR_107 by site-directed mutagenesis. The variants containing single mutations, in which each of the above-mentioned residues were changed to an alanine (except Tyr, which was mutated to Phe), were expressed and purified and their activity on the ulvan substrate was measured. The enzyme activity on the ulvan substrate was monitored as a function of time by following the appearance of unsaturated sugar products with a characteristic absorbance at 232 nm (Fig. 2C). The H146A, H167A, R259A, and R320A mutants exhibited a complete loss of activity against the substrate. Conversely, the Y243F mutant showed very low but measurable activity, whereas N263A and Y330F show reduced but readily measurable activity (Fig. 2C). Mutating Thr242 to an alanine led to a very small decrease in activity, whereas the Y303F mutant showed, rather unexpectedly, a small increase in activity relative to the wildtype LOR_107. Together, these data suggested that His146, His167, Arg259, and Arg320 play essential roles in catalysis. Tyr243 is also important in catalysis, because the Y243F mutant showed only residual activity. The remaining investigated side chains most likely affect the organization of the active site or binding of the ulvan substrate. To capture the substrate within the enzyme we have made several single mutants in which His146, His167, Tyr243, Arg259, and Arg320 were exchanged for other amino acids. Of these, we successfully crystallized R259N and R320N. We introduced the substrate into these crystals through soaking. We have used two tetrasaccharides, 1) the substrate DP4-1, which contains a mixture of ΔUA-Rha3S-GlcA-Rha3Sα/β and ΔUA-Rha3S-IdoA-Rha3Sα/β, and 2) DP4-2 ΔUA-Rha3S-Xyl-Rha3Sα/β, which is a substrate analog that is not cleaved by the enzyme. Of these two tetrasaccharides only DP4-1 was found specifically bound to the enzyme. Following the nomenclature introduced by Davies et al. (20Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Nomenclature for sugar-binding subsites in glycosyl hydrolases.Biochem. J. 1997; 321 (9020895): 557-55910.1042/bj3210557Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), the sugars on the reducing side of the bond to be cleaved are in positions +1, +2, etc., whereas those on the non-reducing side are in positions −1, −2, etc. The difference electron density map calculated for the R259N mutant showed an elongated blob of positive density located within the canyon on the top of LOR_107 in proximity to the two clusters of conserved residues. We could fit the entire DP4-1 tetrasaccharide into this electron density (Fig. 3A). The GlcA could be fitted in the +1 position in a chair conformation, whereas IdoA fitted only in a high energy boat conformation. In addition, because LOR_107 shows specificity for cleavage next to GlcA (15Kopel M. Helbert W. Belnik Y. Buravenkov V. Herman A. Banin E. New family of ulvan lyases identified in three isolates from the Alteromonadales order.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 (26763234): 5871-587810.1074/jbc.M115.673947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) we have modeled GlcA in the +1 position. The substrate is located close to, and makes contacts with, Arg320, Tyr303, and Asn263 (cluster II). Arg320 is in the center of this cluster and its side chain makes hydrogen bonds to O3GlcA at the +1 position and to O5Rha3S at the −1 position. Arg320 is sandwiched between two tyrosine side chains conserved among PL24 sequences, Tyr303 and Tyr330, with the C6Rha3S methyl group abutting the face of Tyr330 aromatic ring. Asn263, located next to Arg320, forms a H-bonds to NH1Arg-320. Asn263 extends over the +1 GlcA, contacting the C2 proton through the aliphatic part of the side chain (Fig. 3A, right panel). In addition, Tyr303 is hydrogen-bonded to the +1 O6BGlcA of the acidic group and the carboxylic O6AGlcA is ∼5 Å from Tyr243. Finally, His384 hydrogen bonds to O6AΔUA in the −2 position and Val386 faces the hydrophobic side of Rha3S at the −1 position. The closest distance of the tetrasaccharide to cluster I residues is to His146 and Tyr243 that are ∼4–5Å from O6AGlcA at the +1 position. Additionally, Arg177 H-bonds to O2Rha3S at the +2 position (Fig. 3A, right panel). The mutated side chain, now Asn259 is rather far from the tetrasaccharide but when this structure is superimposed on the native LOR_107, the side chain of Arg259 extends toward the carboxylic group of GlcA at the +1 position and could form a salt bridge with it. The tetrasaccharide in the complex described above is somewhat distant from His146, His167, and Tyr243, which are important for catalysis, suggesting that this binding site is not catalytically competent. We therefore investigated the R320N mutant where the key cluster II contact residue has been changed. In this complex, the substrate is positioned close to cluster I residues (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, the Arg259 side chain assumes two conformations in monomer chain A. The minor conformer (occupancy 0.4) corresponds to that in the wildtype enzyme and forms a salt bridge with the acidic group of GlcA at the +1 position, whereas the major conformer (occupancy 0.6, present as the only observed conformation in chain B) points away from GlcA and is directed toward the backbone of Gly262–Asn263. His146 points toward H5GlcA of +1 GlcA and the NE2His-146 is only ∼2 Å away from this proton (∼3 Å from C5GlcA). In addition, this NE2 nitrogen forms a H-bond with the bridging O4 between +1 and −1 sugars. Tyr243 also points toward C5 of GlcA and the bridging O4 but the distances are ∼4 Å, too long for a direct participation in proton transfer. The SO3 of Rha3S at the −1 position fills a hydrophilic pocket made by Ser145, Tyr243, and His146 side chains. Similarly, the SO3 of Rha3S at the +2 position fits into a depression formed by Arg137, Arg177, His167, and the Phe137 side chains. Moreover, Asn263 clamps the tetrasaccharide from the opposite side by H-bonding to the oxygen atom that bridges +1 and +2 sugars. The unsaturated sugar in the −2 position is located near the main chain of Phe80 and Gly81 and makes only van der Waals interactions with the protein (Fig. 3B, right panel). The R259N and R320N mutations had minimal effect on the overall structure of the protein. However, there is a significant difference in the way the tetrasaccharide substrate binds to these mutants. In the R259N complex the tetrasaccharide substrate binds cluster II side chains, interacting largely with Arg320, and is located at the upper part of the canyon, somewhat distant from the residues affecting catalysis. Nearby Asn263 is H-bonded to Arg320 and directed toward the top of the canyon. In the R320N complex the tetrasaccharide binds deeper in the canyon and approaches the cluster I side chains. The Asn263 changes conformation and extends toward the other wall of the canyon making it narrower and pinning the substrate to the active site. The importance of Arg320 in cluster II for bond cleavage, combined with the structure of the LOR_107(R259N)–tetrasaccharide complex, suggests that the initial binding of the substrate in the canyon is coordinated by Arg320. This binding site is near the top of the canyon and somewhat distant from the residues essential for catalysis. We postulate that upon initial binding the Arg259 side chain extends toward the acidic group on GlcA in the +1 position and promotes movement of the substrate deeper into the canyon toward cluster I residues. The associated movement of the Asn263 side chain narrows the canyon and locks the substrate in the active site. Indeed, Asn263 side chain plays a role in the catalytic mechanism because its mutation to alanine has a detrimental effect on activity (Fig. 2C). In the R259N mutant, the Arg259 side chain is absent and thus the substrate remains in the initial binding site. However, when the Arg320 side chain is missing but Arg259 is present (i.e. the R320N mutant), the substrate goes directly to the final destination site near the bottom of the canyon. This binding site is largely preformed when compared with the native LOR_107 structure. In the absence of Arg320 the tetrasaccharide substrate binds in what appears to be a catalytically competent or nearly competent conformation. We postulate that in the wildtype LOR_107 the movement of substrate deeper into the canyon pulls on Arg320 and causes change of the conformation of Asn263, narrowing of the canyon and forcing the substrate into the catalytically competent conformation. The catalytic mechanism of the polysaccharide lyase family enzyme follows three steps (7Gacesa P. Alginate-modifying enzymes: a proposed unified mechanism of action for the lyases and epimerases.FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-20210.1016/0014-5793(87)81344-3Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar): 1) neutralization of the negative charge on carboxylic acid of the uronic acid sugar; this reduces the pKa of the C5 proton; 2) abstraction of the C5 proton by a base; and 3) donation of proton to the leaving group by an acid. A comparison of the native and R320N structures indicates that the role of the neutralizer is performed by Arg259 with the help of His167 (Fig. 4A). We suggest that the presence of His167 is essential for correctly orienting the acidic group on GlcA for the interaction with Arg259. The role of proton abstraction is likely performed by His146, which is properly oriented by stacking with His167 and interaction with Tyr243. The ND2His-146 atom becomes close to both H5GlcA of +1 GlcA and to the bridging O4 (to Rha3S), suggesting that His146 might shuttle the proton directly to the bridging O4 (Fig. 4B). The fact that the Y243F mutant displays residual activity indicates that Tyr243 plays a supporting role but is not directly involved in proton transfer. Therefore, LOR_107 possesses an active site consistent with the His/Tyr mechanism, one of the two mechanisms identified so far in polysaccharide lyases (21Garron M.L. Cygler M. Uronic polysaccharide degrading enzymes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 28 (25156747): 87-9510.1016/j.sbi.2014.07.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Garron M.L. Cygler M. Structural and mechanistic classification of uronic acid-containing polysaccharide lyases.Glycobiology. 2010; 20 (20805221): 1547-157310.1093/glycob/cwq122Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) but applies a modification to this mechanism, in which the tyrosine plays a supporting rather than a direct role in proton shuffling (Fig. 4B). Why then is the R320N mutant inactive? It must reflect the fact that either the substrate position observed in the R320N mutant or the arrangement of catalytic site residues are not fully compatible with catalysis. In this mutant, the Arg259 side chain is predominantly directed away from the substrate and toward the backbone of Gly262–Asn263, likely due to a small rearrangement of a neighboring segment near Asn263. Therefore, Arg259 cannot neutralize the acidic group of +1 GlcA, which in turn, prevents the C5 proton abstraction. PLSV_3936 belongs to the PL25 family and displays the same seven-bladed β-propeller fold as LOR_107. They can be superimposed with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.7 Å for 186 Cα atoms (of ∼440 common) (Swiss-PDBViewer) (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18 (9504803): 2714-272310.1002/elps.1150181505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar). The strands of the blades superpose well, whereas the loops diverge, particularly the loops at the top of the propeller (Fig. 5A). The canyon on the top of the propeller is somewhat wider in LOR_107 than in PLSV_3936. Both enzymes harbor bound ions, Ca2+ in the case of LOR_107 and Zn2+ for PLSV_3936. The Ca2+ ions in LOR_107 play strictly structural roles and are distant from the active site, whereas the Zn2+ ion in PLSV_3936 is located much closer to the active site and likely contributes not only to the stabilization of one of the loops but also rigidifies the active site area (16Ulaganathan T. Boniecki M.T. Foran E. Buravenkov V. Mizrachi N. Banin E. Helbert W. Cygler M. New ulvan-degrading polysaccharide lyase family: structure and catalytic mechanism suggests convergent evolution of active site architecture.ACS Chem. Biol. 2017; 12 (28290654): 1269-128010.1021/acschembio.7b00126Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). What is most interesting and unexpected is that the active site residues of LOR_107 are overlapping in this superposition with the active site residues of PLSV_3936 (Fig. 5B). Thus, cluster I residues His146, Tyr243, and Arg259 of LOR_107 correspond to His123, Tyr188, and Arg204 in PLSV_3936, respectively. Moreover, cluster I His167 and Thr242 of LOR_107 superimpose on His143 and Thr187 of PLSV_3936. In this superposition, blades 1–3 and 7 of both proteins superimpose well, whereas blades 4 and 5 in LOR_107 are shifted away from the center of the propeller, widening somewhat the substrate-binding canyon. As a result, cluster II residues in LOR_107 (Asn263, Tyr303, Arg320, and Tyr330) are shifted outside by ∼3 Å with respect to cluster I residues. Moreover, only Tyr303 has a conserved counterpart in the Tyr246 of PLSV_3936. The residue that corresponds spatially to Arg320 in LOR_107 is His264 in PLSV_3936. His264 mediates the Zn2+ binding in PLSV_3936 and mutating this residue leads to precipitation of the protein. But Arg320 is not involved in any metal coordination in LOR_107. Another notable difference is the essential role of His167 in catalysis in LOR_107, whereas mutation of the corresponding His143 in PLSV_3936 does not affect activity. Structural comparison of substrate binding in PLSV_3936 and R320N shows that the tetrasaccharide binds in a similar region relative to the catalytic residues. The −2 and −1 sugars assume the same conformations. However, there are differences in the +1 and +2 sugars. They assume a different chair pucker, and differ in torsion angles around bonds linking +1 and +2 sugars. This results in the sulfate of the +2 Rha3S sugar pointing in opposite directions in these two binding sites and in somewhat different orientation of +1 GlcA relative to the active site residues (Fig. 5B). It appears that the His/Tyr active site can adjust the function of these two side chains to some changes in substrate orientation and maintain efficient bond cleavage. There are two other PL families with a β-propeller fold, namely seven-bladed PL22 containing oligogalacturonan lyase and eight-bladed PL11. The superposition of LOR_107 with the PL22 family lyase, oligogalacturonate lyase (PDB code 3PE7 (24Abbott D.W. Gilbert H.J. Boraston A.B. The active site of oligogalacturonate lyase provides unique insights into cytoplasmic oligogalacturonate β-elimination.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20851883): 39029-3903810.1074/jbc.M110.153981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), is less satisfactory (Fig. S1). The best superposition overlaps only 95 Cα atoms with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.7 Å (Swiss-PDBViewer (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. SWISS-MODEL and the Swiss-PdbViewer: an environment for comparative protein modeling.Electrophoresis. 1997; 18 (9504803): 2714-272310.1002/elps.1150181505Crossref PubMed Scopus (9558) Google Scholar)), and encompasses only four blades. In addition, the orientation of the β-strands relative to the central axis of the propeller differs somewhat between these two structures leading to differences in the diameters of the propellers. Importantly, these two lyases appear to use different catalytic mechanisms; the PL22 family utilizes most likely a metal ion-mediated β elimination reaction mechanism (24Abbott D.W. Gilbert H.J. Boraston A.B. The active site of oligogalacturonate lyase provides unique insights into cytoplasmic oligogalacturonate β-elimination.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20851883): 39029-3903810.1074/jbc.M110.153981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The putative active site residues in these two lyases are in a different structural context. A comparison with the eight-bladed propeller from the PL11 family shows that although the radii of the two barrels are similar, there is only overlap of four blades. Only 92 Cα atoms overlap with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.9 Å. LOR_107 is representative of the PL24 family. It folds into a seven-bladed β-propeller with an extended and deep substrate-binding canyon located on the top of the propeller. Arg259 and His167 participate in neutralizing the acidic group of the substrate’s uronic acid and His146 plays the role of general base and/or general acid. Unlike in other lyases displaying the His/Tyr mechanism, it appears that LOR_107 binds the substrate in a two-stage process with the initial binding coordinated by Arg320. In the final stage, the substrate binds in an atypical way allowing only His146 to form a productive contact with H5GlcA, whereas Tyr243 helps to orient the histidine but is not absolutely essential for activity."
https://openalex.org/W2787878472,"Marine predators, such as seabirds, are useful indicators of marine ecosystem functioning. In particular, seabird diet may reflect variability in food-web composition due to natural or human-induced environmental change. Diet monitoring programmes, which sample diet non-invasively, are valuable aids to conservation and management decision-making. We investigated the diet of an increasing population of greater crested terns Thalasseus bergii in the Western Cape, South Africa, during three successive breeding seasons (2013 to 2015), when populations of other seabirds feeding on small pelagic schooling fish in the region were decreasing. Breeding greater crested terns carry prey in their bills, so we used an intensive photo-sampling method to record their diet with little disturbance. We identified 24,607 prey items from at least 47 different families, with 34 new prey species recorded. Fish dominated the diet, constituting 94% of prey by number, followed by cephalopods (3%), crustaceans (2%) and insects (1%). The terns mainly targeted surface-schooling Clupeiformes, with anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus the most abundant prey in all three breeding seasons (65% overall). Prey composition differed significantly between breeding stages and years, with anchovy most abundant at the start of the breeding season, becoming less frequent as the season progressed. The proportion of anchovy in the diet also was influenced by environmental factors; anchovy occurred more frequently with increasing wind speeds and was scarce on foggy days, presumably because terns rely in part on social facilitation to locate anchovy schools. The application of this intensive and non-invasive photo-sampling method revealed an important degree of foraging plasticity for this seabird within a context of locally reduced food availability, suggesting that, unlike species that specialise on a few high-quality prey, opportunistic seabirds may be better able to cope with reductions in the abundance of their preferred prey."
https://openalex.org/W2789942745,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive bone and soft tissue malignancy that predominantly affects children and adolescents. CD99 is a cell surface protein that is highly expressed on ES cells and is required to maintain their malignancy. We screened small molecule libraries for binding to extracellular domain of recombinant CD99 and subsequent inhibition of ES cell growth. We identified two structurally similar FDA-approved compounds, clofarabine and cladribine that selectively inhibited the growth of ES cells in a panel of 14 ES vs. 28 non-ES cell lines. Both drugs inhibited CD99 dimerization and its interaction with downstream signaling components. A membrane-impermeable analog of clofarabine showed similar cytotoxicity in culture, suggesting that it can function through inhibiting CD99 independent of DNA metabolism. Both drugs drastically inhibited anchorage-independent growth of ES cells, but clofarabine was more effective in inhibiting growth of three different ES xenografts. Our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for clofarabine that involves direct binding to a cell surface receptor CD99 and inhibiting its biological activities."

There have been some reports on this from Sub-Saharan African and from Nepal but none from India. India has implemented the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), a large national conditional cash transfer program which has successfully increased the number of institutional births in India. This paper aims to study the extent of bypassing the nearest health facility offering intrapartum care in three districts of Madhya Pradesh, India, and to identify individual and facility determinants of bypassing in the context of the JSY program. Our results provide information to support the optimal utilization of facilities at different levels of the healthcare system for childbirth. Data was collected from 96 facilities (74 public) and 720 rural mothers who delivered at these facilities were interviewed. Multilevel logistic regression was used to analyze the data. Facility obstetric care functionality was assessed by the number of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) signal functions performed in the last three months. Thirty eighth percent of the mothers bypassed the nearest public facility for their current delivery. Primiparity, higher education, arriving by hired transport and a longer distance from home to the nearest facility increased the odds of bypassing a public facility for childbirth. The variance partition coefficient showed that 37% of the variation in bypassing the nearest public facility can be attributed to difference between facilities. The number of basic emergency obstetric care signal functions (AOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.93), and the availability of free transportation at the nearest facility (AOR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.31) were protective factors against bypassing. The variation between facilities (MOR = 3.85) was more important than an individual's characteristics to explain bypassing in MP. This multilevel study indicates that in this setting, a focus on increasing the level of emergency obstetric care functionality in public obstetric care facilities will allow more optimal utilization of facilities for childbirth under the JSY program thereby leading to better outcomes for mothers."

In the plant heterotrimeric GTPase cycle, GTP hydrolysis, rather than nucleotide exchange, is the rate-limiting reaction and is accelerated by a receptor-like regulator of G signaling (RGS) protein. We hypothesized that posttranslational modification of the Gα subunit in the G protein complex regulates the RGS-dependent GTPase cycle. Our structural analyses identified an invariant phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Tyr166 in the Arabidopsis Gα subunit AtGPA1) located in the intramolecular domain interface where nucleotide binding and hydrolysis occur. We also identified a receptor-like kinase that phosphorylates AtGPA1 in a Tyr166-dependent manner. Discrete molecular dynamics simulations predicted that phosphorylated Tyr166 forms a salt bridge in this interface and potentially affects the RGS protein–accelerated GTPase cycle. Using a Tyr166 phosphomimetic substitution, we found that the cognate RGS protein binds more tightly to the GDP-bound Gα substrate, consequently reducing its ability to accelerate GTPase activity. In conclusion, we propose that phosphorylation of Tyr166 in AtGPA1 changes the binding pattern with AtRGS1 and thereby attenuates the steady-state rate of the GTPase cycle.

There is currently a limited understanding of how these two recombinases are organized within the meiotic presynaptic filament. Here, we used single molecule imaging to examine the properties of presynaptic complexes composed of both Rad51 and Dmc1. We demonstrate that Rad51 and Dmc1 have an intrinsic ability to self-segregate, even in the absence of any other recombination accessory proteins. Moreover, we found that the presence of Dmc1 stabilizes the adjacent Rad51 filaments, suggesting that cross-talk between these two recombinases may affect their biochemical properties. Based upon these findings, we describe a model for the organization of Rad51 and Dmc1 within the meiotic presynaptic complex, which is also consistent with in vivo observations, genetic findings, and biochemical expectations. This model argues against the existence of extensively intermixed filaments, and we propose that Rad51 and Dmc1 have intrinsic capacities to form spatially distinct filaments, suggesting that additional recombination cofactors are not required to segregate the Rad51 and Dmc1 filaments.

https://openalex.org/W2793733313,"The coexistence of different types of poultry operations such as free range and backyard flocks, large commercial indoor farms and live bird markets, as well as the presence of many areas where wild and domestic birds co-exist, make California susceptible to avian influenza outbreaks. The 2014–2015 highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks affecting California and other states in the United States have underscored the need for solutions to protect the US poultry industry against this devastating disease. We applied disease distribution models to predict where Avian influenza is likely to occur and the risk for HPAI outbreaks is highest. We used observations on the presence of Low Pathogenic Avian influenza virus (LPAI) in waterfowl or water samples at 355 locations throughout the state and environmental variables relevant to the disease epidemiology. We used two algorithms, Random Forest and MaxEnt, and two data-sets Presence-Background and Presence-Absence data. The models performed well (AUCc > 0.7 for testing data), particularly those using Presence-Background data (AUCc > 0.85). Spatial predictions were similar between algorithms, but there were large differences between the predictions with Presence-Absence and Presence-Background data. Overall, predictors that contributed most to the models included land cover, distance to coast, and broiler farm density. Models successfully identified several counties as high-to-intermediate risk out of the 8 counties with observed outbreaks during the 2014–2015 HPAI epizootics. This study provides further insights into the spatial epidemiology of AI in California, and the high spatial resolution maps may be useful to guide risk-based surveillance and outreach efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2791640201,"Dental biofilm bacteria can bind calcium ions and release them during a pH drop, which could decrease the driving force for dental demineralization (i.e. hydroxyapatite dissolution) occurring at reduced pHs. However, the kinetics of this binding and release is not completely understood. Here we validated a method to evaluate the kinetics of calcium binding and release to/from Streptococcus mutans, and estimated the importance of this reservoir as a source of ions. The kinetics of calcium binding was assessed by measuring the amount of bound calcium in S. mutans Ingbrit 1600 pellets treated with PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 or 10 mM Ca; for the release kinetics, bacterial pellets previously treated with 1 mM or 10 mM Ca were exposed to the calcium-free or 1 mM Ca PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, for up to 60 min. Binding and release curves were constructed and parameters of kinetics were calculated. Also, calcium release was assessed by exposing pellets previously treated with calcium to a pH 5.0 buffer for 10 min. Calcium binding to bacteria was concentration-dependent and rapid, with maximum binding reached at 5 min. On the other hand, calcium release was slower, and according to the calculations, would never be complete in the groups pretreated with 10 mM Ca. Decreasing pH from 7.0 to 5.0 caused a release of calcium able to increase the surrounding fluid calcium concentration in 2 mM. The results suggest that dental biofilm bacteria may act as a calcium reservoir, rapidly binding ions from surrounding fluids, releasing them slowly at neutral pH and promptly during a pH drop."

The activity and substrate selectivity of HBO1 is dependent on the proteins within the HBO1 HAT complex, which also have other functions in various cellular proliferation and tumor suppression pathways. For example, JADE1 was initially identified as a protein partner of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor to regulate cellular oxygen sensing (23Zhou M.I. Wang H. Ross J.J. Kuzmin I. Xu C. Cohen H.T. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor stabilizes novel plant homeodomain protein Jade-1.J. Biol.

A recent study demonstrated that an HBO1 complex containing the BRPF1 protein in place of JADE1 has specificity toward H3 tail acetylation rather than the H4 tail acetylation preferred by the JADE1-containing complex. This suggests that JADE1 contributes specifically toward H4 tail acetylation by the HBO1 complex (5Havasi A. Haegele J.A. Gall J.M. Blackmon S. Ichimura T. Bonegio R.G. Panchenko M.V.

The HBO1–HAT complex contains three PHD fingers responsible for recognizing various methylated states of H3K4. JADE1 contains two of these motifs (termed PZP), which cooperate to enable acetylation of nucleosome particles and recognition of unmethylated H3K4 (11Lalonde M.E. Avvakumov N. Glass K.C. Joncas F.H.

Through its recognition of H3K4me3, ING4 has been proposed to play a lynchpin role in the acetylation process. Thus, ING can link its aforementioned tumor suppressor function with chromatin binding, transcriptional activity, and cellular proliferation by nucleating the complex recruitment process (15Avvakumov N.

This is further substantiated by the activity of JADE1 spliced variants. Specifically, although the longer JADE1L form harbors tumor suppressor activity, the shorter JADE1 variant that lacks the ING4 binding domain but still binds to HBO1, called JADE1S, does not function as a tumor suppressor (15Avvakumov N.

JADE1 in the HBO1–HAT complex has been proposed to function as an intermediary to link HBO1–HAT catalytic activity to ING tumor suppressor activity through cross-talk between two different epigenetic modifications of methylation and acetylation (16Saksouk N.

JADE1 has been demonstrated to act as a platform to assemble the tetrameric HBO1–HAT complex for histone H4 acetylation, with a region of JADE1 N-terminal to the JADE1-PHD fingers (called region I) shown to recruit HBO1 and a region of JADE1 C-terminal to the JADE1-PHD fingers (called region II) shown to recruit the ING–MEAF6 subcomplex (15Avvakumov N.

It has also been shown that a modified tetrameric complex in which BRPF replaces JADE has specificity for H3K14 acetylation (11Lalonde M.E. Avvakumov N. Glass K.C. Joncas F.H. Saksouk N. Holliday M.

These studies highlight the importance of BRPF and JADE subunits in dictating histone substrate specificity. Although a recent study has revealed the molecular basis for how BRPF mediates H3K14-specific acetylation by HBO1 (26Tao Y. Zhong C. Zhu J. Xu S. Ding J. Structural and mechanistic insights into regulation of HBO1 histone acetyltransferase activity by BRPF2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28334966): 5707-571910.1093/nar/gkx142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for how JADE potentiates the H4-specific activity of HBO1 is not known. Given this gap in knowledge, we set out to dissect the specific regions and activities of JADE1 that mediate histone H4 acetylation by the HBO1–HAT complex. We found that JADE1 contains specific HBO1 and histone binding regions that serve to increase the catalytic efficiency of HBO1 acetylation of histone H4. The implications of these studies for the differential regulation of HBO1 by JADE1 and BRPF1 paralogs are discussed. It was previously demonstrated that an N-terminal region of JADE1 between residues 90–199 participated in HBO1 catalytic activity (15Avvakumov N. Lalonde M.E. Saksouk N. Paquet E. Glass K.C.

We also noted an additional region of sequence conservation among the JADE proteins just N-terminal to this region (Fig. 1A). To map the region of the JADE1 N terminus that directly interacts with the HBO1-HAT domain, we used pulldown experiments with the HBO1-HAT and N-terminal truncation constructs of JADE1 (Fig. 1B). These experiments revealed that MBP-JADE1 (1–188) and MBP-JADE1 (60–188) were able to pull down the HBO1-HAT complex whereas MBP-JADE1 (80–188) was not. These data revealed the importance of residues 60–80 of JADE1 for the direct interaction with the HBO1-HAT complex. To further narrow down the key residue(s) within this 21-residue segment critical for the interaction with the HBO1-HAT domain, we introduced triple alanine mutations spanning residues 60 to 80 within the context of MBP-JADE1 (1–188).

Here, we investigated the in vitro kinetics of a microbial intramembrane aspartyl protease (mIAP) fortuitously acting on the renin substrate angiotensinogen and the C-terminal transmembrane segment of amyloid precursor protein (C100), which is cleaved by the presenilin subunit of γ-secretase, an Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated IAP. mIAP variants with substitutions in active-site and putative substrate-gating residues generally exhibit impaired, but not abolished, activity toward angiotensinogen and retain the predominant cleavage site (His–Thr). The aromatic ring, but not the hydroxyl substituent, within Tyr of the catalytic Tyr–Asp (YD) motif plays a catalytic role, and the hydrolysis reaction incorporates bulk water as in soluble aspartyl proteases. mIAP hydrolyzes the transmembrane region of C100 at two major presenilin cleavage sites, one corresponding to the AD-associated Aβ42 peptide (Ala–Thr) and the other to the non-pathogenic Aβ48 (Thr–Leu). For the former site, we observed more favorable kinetics in lipid bilayer–mimicking bicelles than in detergent solution, indicating that substrate–lipid and substrate–enzyme interactions both contribute to catalytic rates. High-resolution MS analyses across four substrates support a preference for threonine at the scissile bond. However, results from threonine-scanning mutagenesis of angiotensinogen demonstrate a competing positional preference for cleavage. Our results indicate that IAP cleavage is controlled by both positional and chemical factors, opening up new avenues for selective IAP inhibition for therapeutic interventions.

Podocin belongs to the stomatin and prohibitin homology domain (PHB) protein family and is specifically expressed in podocytes. It has been proposed that podocin acts as a molecular scaffold for other SD proteins in lipid raft membrane subdomains. For example, podocin interacts with both nephrin and CD2AP through its carboxyl terminus, and participates in various signaling events at the SD (8Huber T.B. Kottgen M. Schilling B. Walz G.

Podocin has a predicted hairpin-loop topology, with both the N and C termini facing the cytoplasm, and its hydrophobic domain anchored either to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM) or to the outer leaflet of the ER-membrane (7Roselli S.

However, an alternative transmembrane topology has been described for stomatin and podocin, particularly when a conserved proline residue, critical for the kink of the hairpin topology, found at position 118 in podocin, is mutated, and has been linked to N-glycosylated forms of these proteins (11Kadurin I.

In addition, although the stability and degradation of podocin has been associated with a short internalization motif located in its C terminus and to an interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Ubr4 (13Gödel M.

In this study, we report the degradation pathways followed by PodR138Q, which might aid to establish new therapeutic strategies. We generated two cell lines stably expressing two human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tags at the N terminus of wildtype (WT) podocin (Podwt) and PodR138Q by lentiviral transduction of a human podocyte cell line. Although both cell lines expressed comparable levels of podocin mRNA (Fig. 1A), we found significantly higher levels of Podwt protein in comparison to PodR138Q (Fig. 1B). We then confirmed by immunofluorescence the expected subcellular localization at the PM for Podwt (co-localization with the wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) and at the ER for PodR138Q (a reticular pattern staining partially colocalizing with calnexin) (Fig. 1C) (7Roselli S.

We demonstrated that neither Podwt nor PodR138Q stable overexpression caused ER stress as evidenced by the lack of up-regulated levels of BiP protein (GRP78), an ER-chaperone widely used as an ER-stress indicator (Fig. S1) (15Li W.W.

As positive controls of ER stress induction caused by misfolded mutant proteins, we generated human podocyte cell lines stably expressing V5-tagged nephrinwt (Nephwt) or nephrinS366R (NephS366R), because this latter mutant has been previously shown to induce ER stress (Fig. S1A) (18Drozdova T. Papillon J. Cybulsky A.V. Nephrin missense mutations: induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell surface rescue by reduction in chaperone interactions.Physiol. Rep. 2013; 1 (24303155)e00086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed three specific bands for both Podwt and PodR138Q on podocin immunoblots. The fastest migrating band (lower band) was predominantly observed in Podwt protein extracts, whereas the slowest migrating band (upper band) was predominantly found in PodR138Q extracts (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the upper bands in the WT and mutant podocin triplets were N-glycosylated forms, we either inhibited N-glycosylation by treating cells with tunicamycin, or treated cell lysates with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to digest N-glycan groups. Upper and middle bands of the podocin triplets disappeared using both strategies (Fig. 1D) allowing us to define the upper, middle, and lower bands of the podocin triplets as double-glycosylated (dg), monoglycosylated (mg), and non-glycosylated (ng) podocin. To test whether the difference in protein levels of Podwt and PodR138Q was due to these differential glycosylation patterns, we also created podocyte cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged Podwt and PodR138Q bearing mutations in the amino acid residues required for N-glycosylation, Asn199 and Asn355 (Podwt(N199Q,N355S) and PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S)). Immunoblots of protein extracts from these cells revealed that although the podocin triplet disappears with mutation of residues Asn199 and Asn355 (Fig. S1B), glycosylation alone does not account for the differences in protein levels of Podwt and PodR138Q, as there remains increased amounts of Podwt(N199Q,N355S) compared with PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S). Our results showed that the mutant PodR138Q was predominantly N-glycosylated, similarly to PodP118L (12Schurek E.M. Völker L.A. Tax J. Lamkemeyer T. Rinschen M.M. Ungrue D. Kratz 3rd, J.E.

However, a small part of the Podwt pool was also glycosylated, consistent with the observations of WT podocin and stomatin by other authors (11Kadurin I. Huber S. Gründer S. A single conserved proline residue determines the membrane topology of stomatin.Biochem. J. 2009; 418 (19032151): 587-59410.1042/BJ20081662Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Schurek E.M.

We tested by immunoblot the protein expression pattern of a series of podocin mutants that present different subcellular localizations, confirming that only ER-retained mutants, such as PodR168C, were enriched in N-glycosylated forms (Fig. 1E). To investigate whether the difference in protein levels of Podwt and PodR138Q was due to a higher degradation rate of the mutant protein, we determined the half-life (t½) of both proteins using a cycloheximide time course experiment, quantifying separately the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms (Fig. 2). No differences were observed between the t½ of the three Podwt forms, whereas a drastically reduced t½ was detected for ng-PodR138Q when compared with Podwt (7-fold). Consistent with this finding, we also demonstrated that the t½ of the glycosylation mutant PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S) was also reduced around 7-fold compared with Podwt(N199Q,N355S) (Fig. S2). Interestingly, ng-PodR138Q (i.e. hairpin-like topology) appeared to be degraded faster than the N-glycosylated forms of PodR138Q (i.e. those with transmembrane topology), implying that the hairpin-like structure is more exposed to the intracellular degradative machinery (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). Because ng-PodR138Q is degraded very quickly, we hypothesized that the proteasome was mediating its clearance. We therefore used the reversible proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Bz) to perform dose-response and time course experiments (Fig. 3). We observed that ng-PodR138Q accumulated in a dose-dependent manner, whereas levels of ng-Podwt increased significantly only at the highest Bz dose of 1 μm (Fig. 3A). Consistent with their longer t½, both glycosylated Podwt and glycosylated PodR138Q were not increased at any dose of Bz after 2 h (Fig. 3A). Thus, we next performed an overnight time course (16 h) using the lowest effective dose of Bz (0.1 μm) (Fig. 3B). We found that only ng-PodR138Q accumulated with time, and, most interestingly, the balance between ng- and dg-PodR138Q was inverted, thus after 16 h the proportions of each PodR138Q band resembled the proportions of each Podwt band in podocin immunoblots (Fig. 3B, colored graph). Levels of all forms of Podwt were increased only at the longest time points. Similar findings were observed when we performed an overnight Bz time course on cells expressing the glycosylation mutants Podwt(N199Q,N355S) and PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S), with protein levels of the WT protein only significantly increased at the longest time point of 16 h, and a trend for levels of PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S) to accumulate in the presence of 0.1 μm Bz (Fig. S3A). The increased amount of Podwt and PodR138Q after an overnight treatment with 0.1 μm Bz was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3C). As expected, a sustained exposure to Bz led to ER stress, as indicated by BiP induction (Fig. 3C), but to a higher extent in cells expressing PodR138Q (Fig. S3). Therefore, we concluded that the proteasome contributes to the degradation of both Podwt and PodR138Q, but more actively for ng-PodR138Q. Because protein degradation proceeds via two major routes: the proteasomal and the autophagic-lysosomal pathways, we investigated whether lysosomal degradation contributes to Podwt and PodR138Q proteolysis. We therefore treated the cells with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), a weak base known to inhibit lysosomal proteases. NH4Cl treatment significantly increased levels of the ng-Podwt protein fraction and levels of Podwt(N199Q,N355S), implying that the lysosomal machinery is involved in Podwt degradation but not in PodR138Q proteolysis; indeed, we observed levels of both PodR138Q and PodR138Q(N199S,N355S) to fall after a 16-h NH4Cl treatment (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4B). Then, by confocal microscopy, we confirmed the absence of PodR138Q in the late endosome/lysosome compartment labeled with CD63 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, Podwt is predominantly present in this compartment, as already described (13Gödel M. Ostendorf B.N. Baumer J. Weber K. Huber T.B. A novel domain regulating degradation of the glomerular slit diaphragm protein podocin in cell culture systems.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (23437316)e5707810.1371/journal.pone.0057078Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that Podwt is mainly degraded in lysosomes, in contrast to PodR138Q, which is exclusively degraded by the proteasome. Misfolded N-glycosylated proteins located in the ER membrane are submitted to a strict quality control (QC) by the so-called calnexin (Cnx) cycle, being retained by the 90-kDa chaperone Cnx until they reach their native conformation or are otherwise sent for ER-associated degradation (ERAD). We hypothesized that if PodR138Q is mostly N-glycosylated and possesses a transmembrane topology, interaction with Cnx may be a mechanism of PodR138Q ER retention, as has already been described for some nephrin mutants (18Drozdova T. Papillon J. Cybulsky A.V. Nephrin missense mutations: induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell surface rescue by reduction in chaperone interactions.Physiol. Rep. 2013; 1 (24303155)e00086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots of HEK293T cells transfected with HA-tagged WT podocin and the two ER-retained mutants, PodR138Q and PodR168C (7Roselli S. Moutkine I. Gribouval O. Benmerah A. Antignac C. Plasma membrane targeting of podocin through the classical exocytic pathway: effect of NPHS2 mutations.Traffic. 2004; 5 (14675423): 37-4410.1046/j.1600-0854.2003.00148.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), showed that similarly to our findings from podocyte cell lines stably expressing Podwt and PodR138Q podocin was present as three differentially glycosylated species (Fig. 5A). Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed an interaction between Cnx and both WT and mutant podocin, with the mutant proteins interacting to a greater extent compared with the WT protein (Fig. 5A). That we found Cnx also interacted with Podwt was not surprising, because HA immunoprecipitation enriched a certain proportion of N-glycosylated Podwt (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Surprisingly, ng-podocin, WT, and mutants, also co-immunoprecipitated with Cnx, suggesting that hairpin podocin might interact with Cnx either indirectly, perhaps through oligomerization with the podocin transmembrane fraction via its N terminus (19Huber T.B. Simons M. Hartleben B. Sernetz L. Schmidts M. Gundlach E. Saleem M.A. Walz G. Benzing T. Molecular basis of the functional podocin-nephrin complex: mutations in the NPHS2 gene disrupt nephrin targeting to lipid raft microdomains.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12 (14570703): 3397-340510.1093/hmg/ddg360Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), or directly, through membrane or cytosolic domains. To test whether impairing the interaction of PodR138Q with Cnx would allow its ER exit and promote membrane localization, we first treated the cells with castanospermine (Cst), a specific inhibitor of glucosidases I and II that prevents the sugar trimming necessary for the recognition of the substrate protein N-glycan groups by the lectin domain of Cnx. Cst decreased Cnx interaction with Podwt, but not with PodR138Q (Fig. 5B), suggesting that PodR138Q interaction with Cnx is N-glycan independent. Similar results were obtained when these experiments were performed using cells expressing glycosylation mutants Podwt(N199Q,N355S) and PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S) (Fig. 5C), supporting the idea that the interaction with Cnx is more lectin dependent for Podwt than for PodR138Q. Finally, we found that introduction of p.N199Q and p.N355S substitutions into the PodR138Q mutant in podocytes did not prevent its ER retention, implying that suppression of the N-glycan-dependent interaction with Cnx is not sufficient to bring PodR138Q to the PM (Fig. S4A), and supporting the idea that podocin is capable of lectin-dependent binding to Cnx. Because we observed PodR138Q(N199Q,N355S) is still able to interact with Cnx, we next knocked-down Cnx in the two stable podocyte cell lines using siRNA (Fig. 6A and Fig. S5A). Interestingly, we observed that levels of N-glycosylated forms of PodR138Q were decreased upon Cnx knockdown, in contrast to levels of ng-PodR138Q, which were significantly increased (Fig. 6A, colored graph), suggesting that Cnx may play a role in stabilization of the transmembrane form of N-glycosylated PodR138Q, or indeed, that interaction with Cnx promotes glycosylation of PodR138Q. However, in support of the former statement, the total amount of PodR138Q was slightly decreased after Cnx knockdown, suggesting that interaction with Cnx might delay PodR138Q degradation (Fig. 6A, lower graph). Next, we treated cells with kifunensine (Kif), a drug that inhibits the activity of α-mannosidase I, and thus the mannose trimming that tags Cnx substrates for ERAD (Fig. 6B). Here, our results were precisely the opposite to those obtained upon Cnx knockdown, that is, levels of ng-PodR138Q were significantly reduced, whereas levels of dg-PodR138Q were increased (Fig. 6B, colored graph). Furthermore, the total amount of PodR138Q was augmented after 4 h of treatment (Fig. 6B, lower graph), demonstrating that Kif treatment partially prevented PodR138Qdegradation. These last data support the idea that only N-glycosylated, and thus transmembrane PodR138Q, enters the Cnx cycle before being directed to ERAD. Finally, we observed by immunofluorescence that neither knockdown of Cnx nor blocking entry into the ERAD pathway with Kif were sufficient to target PodR138Q to the PM (data not shown). No significant changes on Podwt levels were observed upon Cnx knockdown, but 4 h of Kif treatment did increase the levels of dg-Podwt, suggesting that glycosylated Podwt may also enter the Cnx cycle (Fig. S5B). While studying the proteasomal degradation of PodR138Q, we observed by immunofluorescence that a fraction of PodR138Q was localized, after Bz exposure, to thin filopodia PM protrusions, similarly to Podwt in untreated cells, whereas PodR138Q was completely absent from these structures before treatment (Fig. 7A). Targeting of PodR138Q to filopodia, quantified as the percentage of WGA-positive filopodia that were also positive for podocin, revealed that Bz treatment increased plasma membrane targeting of PodR138Q, as soon as 2 h after Bz treatment, although levels did not reach those of Podwt (Fig. 7A, graph). We also observed a decreased interaction of PodR138Q with Cnx in HEK293T cells treated with Bz, which may serve as an indicator of PodR138Q accumulation outside the ER (Fig. 7B). Because we do not see PodR138Q at the PM (Fig. 7A) and the glycosylated forms of PodR138Q seem to be insensitive to Bz (Fig. 3), we hypothesize that only ng-PodR138Q is reaching the PM upon Bz treatment. Taking into account all our data we propose a scheme depicting a dynamic interchange between the hairpin and the transmembrane topology at the different steps of ER QC and subsequent ERAD (Fig. 7C). Briefly, hairpin PodR138Q is detected by the cytoplasmic QC machinery and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In the meantime, N-glycosylated transmembrane PodR138Q enters the Cnx cycle to be eventually sent for ERAD. Because proteasomal degradation takes place in the cytosol, transmembrane PodR138Q would lose its N-glycan groups at some point between retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation (20Hirsch C.

https://openalex.org/W2792765460,"In soybean, triterpenoid saponin is one of the major secondary metabolites and is further classified into group A and DDMP saponins. Although they have known health benefits for humans and animals, acetylation of group A saponins causes bitterness and gives an astringent taste to soy products. Therefore, several studies are being conducted to eliminate acetylated group A saponins. Previous studies have isolated and characterized the Sg-5 (Glyma.15g243300) gene, which encodes the cytochrome P450 72A69 enzyme and is responsible for soyasapogenol A biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated the molecular identity of a novel mutant of Glycine soja, ′CWS5095′. Phenotypic analysis using TLC and LC-PDA/MS/MS showed that the mutant ′CWS5095′ did not produce any group A saponins. Segregation analysis showed that the absence of group A saponins is controlled by a single recessive allele. The locus was mapped on chromosome 15 (4.3 Mb) between Affx-89193969 and Affx-89134397 where the previously identified Glyma.15g243300 gene is positioned. Sequence analysis of the coding region for the Glyma.15g243300 gene revealed the presence of four SNPs in ′CWS5095′ compared to the control lines. One of these four SNPs (G1127A) leads to the amino acid change Arg376Lys in the EXXR motif, which is invariably conserved among the CYP450 superfamily proteins. Co-segregation analysis showed that the missense mutation (Arg376Lys) was tightly linked with the absence of group A saponins in ′CWS5095′. Even though Arg and Lys have similar chemical features, the 3D modelled protein structure indicates that the replacement of Arg with Lys may cause a loss-of-function of the Sg-5 protein by inhibiting the stable binding of a heme cofactor to the CYP72A69 apoenzyme."

The MDSS recorded during the study period 538 deaths of WRA and 29 maternal deaths (including only one outside health facility) representing respectively an underreporting of 22.0% and 58.0%. Late maternal deaths represented 11.4% of all deaths of women with a registered pregnancy within 12 months prior to the death, while the MDSS identified none. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was estimated at 103, approximately 2.5 times higher than that reported in the MDSS.Our study has shown weaknesses in the current notification system for maternal deaths in the region of GCBH. Therefore, more attention must be given to the regional committees in charge of auditing the cases and defining actions to be implemented to prevent further maternal deaths."

The present study investigated whether erythropoietin (EPO) administration attenuates burn-induced motor neuron apoptosis and neuroinflammatory response. To validate our hypothesis, a third-degree hind paw burn rat model was developed by bringing the paw into contact with a metal surface at 75°C for 10 s. A total of 24 male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: Group A, sham-control; Group B, burn-induced; Group C, burn + single EPO dose (5000 IU/kg i.p. at D0); and Group D, burn + daily EPO dosage (3000 IU/kg/day i.p. at D0–D6). Two treatment regimens were used to evaluate single versus multiple doses treatment effects. Before sacrifice, blood samples were collected for hematological parameter examination. The histological analyses of microglia activation, iNOS, and COX-2 in the spinal cord ventral horn were performed at week 1 post-burn. In addition, we examined autophagy changes by biomarkers of LC3B and ATG5. The expression of BCL-2, BAX, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-AKT, and mTOR was assessed simultaneously through Western blotting. EPO administration after burn injury attenuated neuroinflammation through various mechanisms, including the reduction of microglia activity as well as iNOS and COX-2 expression in the spinal cord ventral horn. In addition, the expression of phospho-AKT, mTOR and apoptotic indicators, such as BAX, BCL-2, and cleaved caspase-3, was modulated. Furthermore, the activity of burn-induced autophagy in the spinal cord ventral horn characterized by the expression of autophagic biomarkers, LC3B and ATG5, was reduced after EPO administration. The present results indicate that EPO inhibits the AKT-mTOR pathway to attenuate burn-induced motor neuron programmed cell death and microglia activation. EPO can modulate neuroinflammation and programmed cell death and may be a therapeutic candidate for neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2786009803,"The advent of multicellularity was a watershed event in the history of life, yet the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity is not well understood. Multicellularity opens up opportunities for innovations in intercellular communication, cooperation, and specialization, which can provide selective advantages under certain ecological conditions. The unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has never had a multicellular ancestor yet it is closely related to the volvocine algae, a clade containing taxa that range from simple unicells to large, specialized multicellular colonies. Simple multicellular structures have been observed to evolve in C. reinhardtii in response to predation or to settling rate-based selection. Structures formed in response to predation consist of individual cells confined within a shared transparent extracellular matrix. Evolved isolates form such structures obligately under culture conditions in which their wild type ancestors do not, indicating that newly-evolved multicellularity is heritable. C. reinhardtii is capable of photosynthesis, and possesses an eyespot and two flagella with which it moves towards or away from light in order to optimize input of radiant energy. Motility contributes to C. reinhardtii fitness because it allows cells or colonies to achieve this optimum. Utilizing phototaxis to assay motility, we determined that newly evolved multicellular strains do not exhibit significant directional movement, even though the flagellae of their constituent unicells are present and active. In C. reinhardtii the first steps towards multicellularity in response to predation appear to result in a trade-off between motility and differential survivorship, a trade-off that must be overcome by further genetic change to ensure long-term success of the new multicellular organism."

Differences in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires may identify HPV16-infected women at highest-risk for progression to cancer. We conducted a proof-of-principle study nested within the Guanacaste HPV Natural History Study to evaluate the utility of next-generation sequencing for interrogating the TCR repertoires among women who cleared and failed to clear cervical HPV16.TCR repertoires of women with HPV16-related intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or higher (CIN3+; n = 25) were compared to women who cleared an incident HPV16 infection without developing precancer/cancer (n = 25). TCR diversity (richness and evenness) and relative abundance (RA) of gene segment (V [n = 51], D [n = 2], J [n = 13]) usage was evaluated; receiver operating curve analysis assessed the ability to differentiate case-control status.TCR repertoire richness was associated with CIN3+ status (P = 0.001). Relative abundance (RA) of V-gene segments was enriched for associations between cases and controls. A single V-gene (TRBV6-7) was significantly associated with CIN3+ status (RA = 0.11%, 0.16%, among cases and controls, respectively, Bonferroni P = 0.0008). The estimated area under the curve using richness and V-gene segment RA was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.73-0.90).Substantial differences in TCR repertoire among women with CIN3+ compared to women who cleared infection were observed.This is the first study to use next-generation sequencing to investigate TCR repertoire in the context of HPV infection. These findings suggest that women with HPV16-associated cervical lesions have significantly different TCR repertoires from disease-free women who cleared HPV16 infection."

https://openalex.org/W2785494269,"Substrate type is a key-factor in nest-site selection and nest architecture of burrowing birds. However, little is known about which factors drive nest-site selection for these species, especially in the tropics. We studied the influence of soil attributes on nest-site selection by the campo miner Geositta poeciloptera, an open grassland bird that builds its nests within soil cavities. For all nests found, we measured the depth of the nest cavity and the resistance of the soil to penetration, and identified the soil horizon in which the nest was located. In soil banks with nests, we collected soil samples for granulometric analysis around each nest cavity, while in soil banks without nests we collected these samples at random points. From 43 nests found, 86% were located in the deeper soil horizons (C-horizon), and only 14% in the shallower horizons (B-horizon). Granulometric analysis showed that the C-horizons possessed a high similar granulometric composition, with high silt and low clay contents. These characteristics are associated with a low degree of structural development of the soil, which makes it easier to excavate. Contrarily, soil resistance to penetration does not seem to be an important criterion for nest site selection, although nests in more resistant the soils tend to have shallower nest cavities. Among the soil banks analyzed, 40% of those without cavities possessed a larger proportion of B-horizon relative to the C-horizon, and their texture was more clayey. On the other hand, almost all soil banks containing nest cavities had a larger C-horizon and a silty texture, indicating that soil attributes drive nest-site selection by G. poeciloptera. Thus, we conclude that the patchy distribution of G. poeciloptera can attributed to the infrequent natural exposure of the C-horizon in the tropical region, where well developed, deep and permeable soils are more common."
https://openalex.org/W2788769756,"Most of the tools and diagnosis models of Masticatory Efficiency (ME) are not well documented or severely limited to simple image processing approaches. This study presents a novel expert system for ME assessment based on automatic recognition of mixture patterns of masticated two-coloured chewing gums using a combination of computational intelligence and image processing techniques. The hypotheses tested were that the proposed system could accurately relate specimens to the number of chewing cycles, and that it could identify differences between the mixture patterns of edentulous individuals prior and after complete denture treatment. This study enrolled 80 fully-dentate adults (41 females and 39 males, 25 ± 5 years of age) as the reference population; and 40 edentulous adults (21 females and 19 males, 72 ± 8.9 years of age) for the testing group. The system was calibrated using the features extracted from 400 samples covering 0, 10, 15, and 20 chewing cycles. The calibrated system was used to automatically analyse and classify a set of 160 specimens retrieved from individuals in the testing group in two appointments. The ME was then computed as the predicted number of chewing strokes that a healthy reference individual would need to achieve a similar degree of mixture measured against the real number of cycles applied to the specimen. The trained classifier obtained a Mathews Correlation Coefficient score of 0.97. ME measurements showed almost perfect agreement considering pre- and post-treatment appointments separately (κ ≥ 0.95). Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that a complete denture treatment for edentulous patients elicited a statistically significant increase in the ME measurements (Z = -2.31, p < 0.01). We conclude that the proposed expert system proved able and reliable to accurately identify patterns in mixture and provided useful ME measurements."

The endpoints were recurrence and mortality rates. Data were presented as per the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. Practice guidelines were generated via the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.From 6,755 records, 94 full-texts articles were reviewed for eligibility, and five studies were included in this systematic review. All included studies were nonrandomized studies: two case-control studies comparing conization (n = 14) with hysterectomy (n = 24), and the other three were interrupted time series including conization (n = 20) and simple vaginal trachelectomy (n = 59). During the median follow-up duration of 43 months, no recurrence was reported in both conization and simple trachelectomy groups in IA1 patients with LVSI. From three studies reporting the fertility outcomes, the rates of pregnancy, live birth, preterm delivery, and second-trimester miscarriage were 73% (35/48), 64% (32/50), 10% (5/48), and 6% (3/48), respectively.Results suggest that simple trachelectomy or conization could be performed for IA1 cervical cancer patients with LVSI who want to preserve fertility, although these results are only based on a small number of nonrandomized studies (recommendation grade 2 = weak; evidence level D = very low). Further randomized trials with long-term study period are needed to address this issue."

Verbatim transcripts were examined by analyzing their thematic content.We identified three profiles of physicians according to their opinions and practices about treatment strategies for depression: pro-pharmacological treatment, pro-psychotherapy and those with mixed practices. Most participants considered their relationships with psychiatrists unsatisfactory, would like more and better collaboration with them and shared the same concept of management in general practice. This concept was based both on the values and principles of practice shared by GPs and on their strong differentiation of their management practices from those of psychiatrists.Several attitudes and values common to GPs might contribute to their low rate of referrals for psychotherapy in France: strong occupational identity, substantial variations in GPs' attitudes and practices regarding depression treatment strategies, representations sometimes unfavorable toward psychiatrists. Actions to develop a common culture and improve cooperation between GPs and psychiatrists are essential. They include systems of collaborative care and the development of interdisciplinary training common to GPs and psychiatrists practicing in the same area."

Through control theory and linear stability analysis of local equilibrium, we obtain the optimal condition under which the system loses stability and a Turing pattern occurs. By combining mathematical analysis and numerical simulation, we show the possible patterns and how these patterns evolve. In addition, we establish a bridge between the complex patterns and the biological mechanism using the results from a previous study in Nature Cell Biology.

The cargo-selective endocytic adaptor Numb participates in clathrin-dependent endocytosis by attaching cargoes to the clathrin adaptor α-adaptin. The phosphorylation of Numb at Ser265 and Ser284 recruits the regulatory protein 14-3-3, accompanied by the dissociation of Numb from α-adaptin and Numb’s translocation from the cortical membrane to the cytosol. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the Numb–α-adaptin interaction and its regulation by Numb phosphorylation and 14-3-3 recruitment remain poorly understood. Here, biochemical and structural analyses of the Numb·14-3-3 complex revealed that Numb phosphorylation at both Ser265 and Ser284 is required for Numb’s efficient interaction with 14-3-3. We also discovered that an RQFRF motif surrounding Ser265 in Numb functions together with the canonical C-terminal DPF motif, required for Numb’s interaction with α-adaptin, to form a stable complex with α-adaptin. Of note, we provide evidence that the phosphorylation-induced binding of 14-3-3 to Numb directly competes with the binding of α-adaptin to Numb. Our findings suggest a potential mechanism governing the dynamic assembly of Numb with α-adaptin or 14-3-3.

In WT mice, this results in immediate release of mature granulocytes from the bone marrow, followed by enhanced commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to granulocytes, with maximal expansion of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors and differentiating granulocytes in the bone marrow by 2 weeks (9Hu L.

We found that injecting Alum every 4 weeks repeated this process in WT mice without resulting in morbidity or mortality (9Hu L. Huang W. Hjort E. Eklund E.A. Increased Fanconi C expression contributes to the emergency granulopoiesis response.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 (23925293): 3952-396610.1172/JCI69032Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Hu L.

We performed repeated induction of emergency granulopoiesis to mimic repeated infectious challenges because of environmental exposure to bacterial and fungal pathogens, which occur on an ongoing basis in humans. Although Alum injection induced immediate granulocyte release from the bone marrow of Fancc−/− mice, there was no subsequent expansion of myeloid progenitors or production of mature granulocytes (9Hu L.

Invest. 2013; 123 (23925293): 3952-396610.1172/JCI69032Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Instead, repeated emergency granulopoiesis attempts resulted in progressive pancytopenia and death in most Fancc−/− mice, associated with apoptosis of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors (9Hu L. Huang W. Hjort E. Eklund E.A. Increased Fanconi C expression contributes to the emergency granulopoiesis response.J. Clin.

Surviving mice developed clonal progression with a rapid rise of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow (9Hu L. Huang W. Hjort E. Eklund E.A.

These studies suggest that Icsbp protects the bone marrow from DNA-damage as emergency granulopoiesis is terminating by increasing the activity of the Fanconi DNA repair pathway (9Hu L. Huang W.

However, the mechanisms to increase FANCC transcription during initiation of emergency granulopoiesis or at peak granulocyte production are not clear. In this work, we investigate the roles of Stat3 and C/ebpβ in activation of the FANCC gene promoter. We determine that Stat3 and C/ebpβ increase FANCC transcription during initiation of emergency granulopoiesis, that Icsbp cooperates with these two transcription factors for maximal FANCC transcription during peak granulocyte production, and that Icsbp maintains FANCC expression as Stat3 and C/ebpβ levels fall during termination of this process. We also implicate a sustained increase in Stat3 and C/ebpβ proteins as the major mechanism for this activity during initiation and peak emergency granulopoiesis. In prior studies, we identified an Icsbp binding cis element in the proximal FANCC promoter (−48 to −56 bp) (9Hu L. Huang W. Hjort E. Eklund E.A. Increased Fanconi C expression contributes to the emergency granulopoiesis response.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 (23925293): 3952-396610.1172/JCI69032Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Icsbp protects bone marrow stem and progenitor cells from DNA damage during termination of emergency granulopoiesis. Because Stat3 and C/ebpβ are required to initiate and sustain emergency granulopoiesis, we considered the possibility that these transcription factors activate the FANCC promoter early in this process. To investigate this hypothesis, we assayed the promoter activity of a set of reporter constructs with −1.0 kb to −400 bp of the FANCC 5′ flank linked to a firefly luciferase reporter (or an empty control reporter vector) (Fig. 1A). We determined the activity of these constructs in U937 myeloid cells co-transfected with vectors to express Stat3 or C/ebpβ (versus an empty control expression vector). For these studies, we considered two isoforms of C/ebpβ: Lap and Lip. The former is a transcriptional activator, and the shorter Lip isoform is an antagonist of Lap (19Luedde T. Duderstadt M. Streetz K.L. Tacke F. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. C/EBP β isoforms LIP and LAP modulate progression of the cell cycle in the regenerating mouse liver.Hepatology. 2004; 40 (15368440): 356-36510.1002/hep.20333Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because Stat3 and Stat5 share similar binding site consensus sequences, we tested both proteins. Icsbp was a positive control for activation of the FANCC promoter. All cells were co-transfected with an internal control reporter vector (with a CMV promoter and Renilla luciferase reporter) to normalize for transfection efficiency. We found that Stat3, C/ebpβ-Lap, and Icsbp each significantly increased the reporter activity from constructs with 1.0 kb or 500 bp of the FANCC promoter (p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig. 1B). Both Icsbp and C/ebpβ-Lap activated a construct with 450 bp of the FANCC promoter (p < 0.001, n = 6) but Stat3 did not. This suggested the presence of a Stat3-influenced cis element between 450 and 500 bp in the FANCC promoter. Further truncation of the promoter to 400 bp abolished activation by C/ebpβ-Lap, identifying a potential cis element between −450 and −400 bp (Fig. 1B). None of the FANCC promoter constructs were activated or repressed by Stat5 or C/ebpβ-Lip. None of these proteins influenced the activity of an empty reporter control vector, and this was subtracted as background. Stat3 and C/ebpβ are required for emergency granulopoiesis, and IL1β is the essential cytokine for this process. Therefore, we tested the effect of Stat3 and C/ebpβ on FANCC promoter activity during differentiation with IL1β (11Ueda Y. Cain D.W. Kuraoka M. Kondo M. Kelsoe G. IL1R type I dependent hematopoietic stem cell proliferation is necessary for inflammatory granulopoiesis and neutrophilia.J. Immunol. 2009; 182 (19414802): 6477-648410.4049/jimmunol.0803961Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We assayed the activity of the 1.0 kb FANCC promoter/luciferase reporter construct in U937 cells co-transfected with vectors to overexpress or knock down Stat3 or C/ebpβ-Lap. We found that IL1β significantly increased FANCC promoter activity with or without overexpression of Stat3 or C/ebpβ-Lap (p < 0.0001, n = 6) (Fig. 1C). We also found that knockdown of either Stat3 or C/ebpβ significantly decreased FANCC promoter activity (p < 0.0001, n = 6), but only in IL1β-treated transfectants. This was consistent with a role for endogenous Stat3 and C/ebpβ in FANCC promoter activation during IL1β-induced differentiation. We investigated possible additive or cooperative effects of these transcription factors on the FANCC promoter despite interacting with discrete binding sites. For these studies, we co-transfected U937 cells with the 1.0 FANCC promoter/firefly luciferase reporter vector and various combinations of vectors to overexpress Stat3, C/ebpβ-Lap, or Icsbp. Cells were co-transfected with the internal control reporter vector described above. We found that combination of any two of these transcription factors was additive for FANCC promoter activity (p < 0.001, n = 6), and the effect of all three was greater than any two (p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig. 1C). The total amount of expression vector was maintained at a constant level in these studies (e.g. there is half the amount of Stat3 plasmid in Stat3 + C/ebpβ experiments compared with experiments with Stat3 alone). Therefore, these studies indicated cooperation, rather than redundancy, between the three transcription factors. To confirm that Stat3 and C/ebpβ activated cis elements within the promoter regions defined above, we performed a sequence analysis (using Vista Tools for Comparative Software) (20Frazer K.A. Pachter L. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Dubchak I.

We identified a tandem Stat consensus sequence from −442 to −464 bp in the FANCC promoter (separated by 2 bp). These sites were conserved in mouse and human but slightly divergent from the derived consensus for Stat3 binding (consensus, 5′-T(T/G)N4–5GAA-3′; proximal FANCC site, 5′-TGATTTGAA-3′; distal site, 5′-AGCGTTGAA-3′) (23Horvath C.M.

We generated a reporter construct with one copy of this tandem site linked to a minimal promoter (−438 to −474 bp from the FANCC promoter in the pGL3-promoter vector). Additional constructs were generated with mutation of the proximal, distal, or both putative Stat3 binding sites. Reporter activity was assayed in U937 cells co-transfected with vectors to express Stat3, Stat5, or an empty control vector (and a reporter vector to function as an internal control as described above). We found that Stat3 significantly increased the activity of the −438 to −474 bp FANCC/minimal promoter construct (p < 0.0001, n = 6) (Fig. 2A). Mutation of either consensus significantly decreased this activity (p < 0.001, n = 6), but activation by Stat3 was completely abolished by mutation of both (p = 0.6, n = 6 relative to minimal promoter/reporter control) (Fig. 2A). Stat5 had no effect on the −438 to −474 bp construct, and none of these proteins influenced the empty minimal promoter/luciferase reporter vector (Fig. 2A). We identified a potential C/ebp binding site between −392 and −403 in the FANCC promoter (consensus, 5′-T[TG]NNGNNAA[TG]-3′; FANCC sequence, 5′-TAGGGGAAATC-3′) (26Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. DNA binding specificity of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein transcription factor family.J. Biol.

We generated a minimal promoter/reporter construct with three copies of the −385 to −408 bp FANCC promoter sequence. An additional construct was generated with mutation of this consensus. Reporter activity was assayed in U937 cells co-transfected with vectors to express C/ebpβ-Lap, C/ebpβ-Lip, or control vector (and the internal control reporter vector described above). C/ebpβ-Lap increased the activity of the −385 to −408 bp FANCC sequence significantly (p < 0.0001, n = 6) (Fig. 2B). C/ebpβ-Lip did not activate this FANCC sequence, and neither protein activated the minimal promoter/reporter control vector. We investigated binding of Stat3 and C/ebpβ to these FANCC promoter regions by chromatin co-immunoprecipitation. For these studies, lysates of Lin−CD34+ murine bone marrow cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Stat3, C/ebpβ, or an irrelevant control antibody (27Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Identification of unknown target genes of human transcription factors using chromatin immunoprecipitation.Methods. 2002; 26 (12054903): 37-4710.1016/S1046-2023(02)00006-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Some cells were differentiated with IL1β for 24 h prior to cross-linking and lysis. Co-precipitating chromatin was amplified by semiquantitative PCR (Fig. 2C) or quantitative real-time PCR (using SYBR Green and the standard curve method) (Fig. 2D). We found specific co-precipitation of the −380 to −410 bp sequence with C/ebpβ and of the −430 to −470 bp sequence by Stat3 (Fig. 2C). Co-precipitation of both proteins was significantly increased by IL1β. Neither protein co-precipitated the irrelevant 5′ flank sequence (data not shown). Reporter assays in cell lines provide information regarding promoter activity but should be interpreted carefully because of the transformed nature of these cells. To investigate FancC expression in a non-transformed setting, and possible contributions by Stat3 or C/ebpβ, we performed studies in primary myeloid progenitor cells from murine bone marrow. For these studies, Lin−CD34+ cells were isolated, and some cells were differentiated with IL1β or G-CSF. The amount of G-CSF employed was consistent with serum levels in emergency granulopoiesis (9Hu L. Huang W. Hjort E. Eklund E.A. Increased Fanconi C expression contributes to the emergency granulopoiesis response.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 (23925293): 3952-396610.1172/JCI69032Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was analyzed for gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR. The standard curve method was used, so data are presented as mRNA abundance according to this technique. We found significantly increased FancC mRNA in response to treatment with either cytokine (p < 0.001, n = 4) (Fig. 3A). We also found a significant cytokine-induced increase in Stat3 and C/ebpβ mRNA in these cells (p < 0.001, n = 4) (Fig. 3A). The relative increase in expression of Stat3 and C/ebpβ in response to either IL1β or G-CSF was not significantly different (p = 0.2, n = 4). We next investigated the impact on Stat3 protein. For these studies, cells were analyzed with or without IL1β or G-CSF treatment for total Stat3, Tyr(P)-705–Stat3, or Ser(P)-727–Stat3 by Western blot.

First, large-scale research publication metadata derived from QC research published from 2001-2017 was used to examine the research performance of China relative to that of global peers using established quantitative and qualitative measures. Second, this study identified the thematic evolution of China's QC research using co-word cluster network analysis, a computational science mapping technique. The results from the first phase indicate that over the past 17 years, China's performance has evolved dramatically, placing it in a leading position. Among the most significant findings is the exponential rate at which all of China's performance indicators (i.e., Publication Frequency, citation score, H-index) are growing. China's H-index (a normalized indicator) has surpassed all other countries' over the last several years. The second phase of analysis shows how China's main research focus has shifted among several QC themes, including quantum-key-distribution, photon-optical communication, network protocols, and quantum entanglement with an emphasis on applied research. Several themes were observed across time periods (e.g., photons, quantum-key-distribution, secret-messages, quantum-optics, quantum-signatures); some themes disappeared over time (e.g., computer-networks, attack-strategies, bell-state, polarization-state), while others emerged more recently (e.g., quantum-entanglement, decoy-state, unitary-operation). Findings from the first phase of analysis provide empirical evidence that China has emerged as the global driving force in QC. Considering China is the premier driving force in global QC research, findings from the second phase of analysis provide an understanding of China's QC research themes, which can provide clarity into how QC technologies might take shape. QC and science and technology policy researchers can also use these findings to trace previous research directions and plan future lines of research."
https://openalex.org/W2794242460,"Zinc finger (ZF) motifs on proteins are frequently recognized as a structure for DNA binding. Accumulated reports indicate that ZF motifs contain nuclear localization signal (NLS) to facilitate the transport of ZF proteins into nucleus. We investigated the critical factors that facilitate the nuclear transport of triple C2H2 ZF proteins. Three conserved basic residues (hot spots) were identified among the ZF sequences of triple C2H2 ZF proteins that reportedly have NLS function. Additional basic residues can be found on the α-helix of the ZFs. Using the ZF domain (ZFD) of Egr-1 as a template, various mutants were constructed and expressed in cells. The nuclear transport activity of various mutants was estimated by analyzing the proportion of protein localized in the nucleus. Mutation at any hot spot of the Egr-1 ZFs reduced the nuclear transport activity. Changes of the basic residues at the α-helical region of the second ZF (ZF2) of the Egr-1 ZFD abolished the NLS activity. However, this activity can be restored by substituting the acidic residues at the homologous positions of ZF1 or ZF3 with basic residues. The restored activity dropped again when the hot spots at ZF1 or the basic residues in the α-helix of ZF3 were mutated. The variations in nuclear transport activity are linked directly to the binding activity of the ZF proteins with importins. This study was extended to other triple C2H2 ZF proteins. SP1 and KLF families, similar to Egr-1, have charged amino acid residues at the second (α2) and the third (α3) positions of the α-helix. Replacing the amino acids at α2 and α3 with acidic residues reduced the NLS activity of the SP1 and KLF6 ZFD. The reduced activity can be restored by substituting the α3 with histidine at any SP1 and KLF6 ZFD. The results show again the interchangeable role of ZFs and charge residues in the α-helix in regulating the NLS activity of triple C2H2 ZF proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2790776150,"Argonaute family proteins are well conserved among all organisms. Its role in mitotic cell cycle progression and apoptotic cell elimination is poorly understood. Earlier we have established the contribution of Ago-1 in cell cycle control related to G2/M cyclin in Drosophila. Here we have extended our study in understanding the relationship of Ago-1 in regulating apoptosis during Drosophila development. Apoptosis play a critical role in controlling organ shape and size during development of multi cellular organism. Multifarious regulatory pathways control apoptosis during development among which highly conserved JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathway play a crucial role. Here we have over expressed Ago-1 in Drosophila eye and brain by employing UAS (upstream activation sequence)-GAL4 system under the expression of eye and brain specific driver. Over expression of Ago-1 resulted in reduced number of ommatidia in the eye and produced smaller size brain in adult and larval Drosophila. A drastic reversal of the phenotype towards normal was observed upon introduction of a single copy of the dominant negative mutation of basket (bsk, Drosophila homolog of JNK) indicating an active and physical involvement of the bsk with Ago-1 in inducing developmental apoptotic process. Further study showed that Ago-1 stimulates phosphorylation of JNK through transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1- hemipterous (Tak1-hep) axis of JNK pathway. JNK phosphorylation results in up regulation of pro-apoptotic genes head involution defective (hid), grim & reaper (rpr) and induces activation of Drosophila caspases (cysteinyl aspartate proteinases);DRONC (Death regulator Nedd2-like caspase), ICE (alternatively Drice, Death related ICE-like caspase) and DCP1 (Death caspase-1) by inhibiting apoptotic inhibitor protein DIAP1 (Death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis 1). Further, Ago-1 also inhibits miR-14 expression to trigger apoptosis. Our findings propose that Ago-1 acts as a key regulator in controlling cell death, tumor regression and stress response in metazoan providing a constructive bridge between RNAi machinery and cell death."

The specific case study used as an example of how to address this issue was the University Park neighborhood of Portland, Oregon (USA) where residents frequently complain about industrial odors, and suspect the main source to be a nearby Daimler Trucks North America LLC manufacturing plant. We collected 19,665 odor observations plus 105,120 wind measurements, using an automated weather station to measure winds in the area at five-minute intervals, logging continuously from December 2014 through November 2015, while we also measured odors at 19 locations, three times per day, using methods from the American Society of the International Association for Testing and Materials. Our results quantify how winds vary with season and time of day when industrial odors were observed versus when they were not observed, while also mapping spatiotemporal patterns in these odors using Ordinary Kriging. Our analyses show that industrial odors were detected most frequently to the northwest of the Daimler plant, mostly when winds blew from the southeast, suggesting Daimler's facility is a likely source for much of this odor."

A total of 491 PLHA were included in this study and tested for the presence of HCV infection. HIV viral loads were obtained using the Generic HIV viral Load® assay and the CD4+ T cells count was performed using BD FACSCount™ CD4 reagents. HCV screening was performed using the MP Diagnostics HCV ELISA 4.0 kit. HCV genotypes were determined by sequence analysis of NS5B and Core regions. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the groups. Chi-2 test and Fisher's Exact Test were used to compare prevalence.HCV seroprevalence was 2.9% (14/491), (95% confidence interval (CI):1.4-4.3%). The percentage of HCV viremic patients, defined by the detection of HCV RNA in plasma, was 57% (8/14), representing 1.6% of the total population. HCV seroprevalence and replicative infection were not statistically differ with gender. The percentage of co-infection increased with age. No correlation with CD4+ T cells count and HIV viral load level was registered in this study. Identified HCV strains were predominantly of genotype 4 (87.5%) including 4k, 4e, 4g, 4p, 4f and 4c subtypes. Only one strain belonged to genotype 2 (subtype 2q). Analysis of the NS5B region did not reveal the presence of resistance-associated substitutions for sofosbuvir.A systematic screening of hepatitis C is therefore strongly recommended as well as genotyping of HCV strains in order to adapt treatments for the specific case of people living with HIV/AIDS in Central Africa."
