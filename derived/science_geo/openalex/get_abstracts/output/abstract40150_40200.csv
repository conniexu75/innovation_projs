https://openalex.org/W1591495971,"The binding of biologically active, 125I-labeled basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to baby hamster kidney-derived cell line cells (BHK-21) was studied at 4 degrees C. Unlabeled FGF displaced cell surface bound 125I-FGF, but platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, or transferrin did not. Binding was saturable both as a function of time and as a function of increasing 125I-FGF concentrations. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed the presence of about 1.2 X 10(5) binding sites/cell with an apparent KD of 270 pM. The number of the binding sites was down-regulated following preincubation of the cells with FGF. The density of binding sites/cell also decreased as an inverse function of cell density. When 125I-FGF binding was studied in a BHK-21 cell membrane preparation, it was found that the membranal binding site displayed a lower KD of 21 pM. 125I-FGF was covalently cross-linked to its cell surface receptor on intact BHK-21 cells using the homobifunctional agent disuccinimidyl suberate. Two macromolecular species with an apparent molecular weight of 145,000 and 125,000, respectively, were labeled under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Unlabeled FGF competed with 125I-FGF for binding to both macromolecular species. The labeling of the macromolecules was also inhibited by heparin. No labeling was observed in the absence of the cross-linkers or when heat-inactivated 125I-FGF was used instead of radiolabeled, biologically active FGF."
https://openalex.org/W1516160268,"Synthetic actin and CYH2 pre-mRNAs containing a single are accurately spliced in a soluble whole cell extract of yeast. Splicing in vitro requires ATP. The excised is released as a lariat in which an RNA branch connects the 5' end of the molecule to the last A in the intron conserved sequence UACUAAC. Two other discrete RNA species produced during splicing in vitro may represent reaction intermediates: free, linear exon 1 and a form of the lariat extending beyond the 3' splice site to include exon 2. Both lariat forms correspond to molecules previously shown to be produced during yeast pre-mRNA splicing in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1505356419,"The effect of autophosphorylation and protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation on the tyrosine-protein kinase activity and ligand binding affinity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has been studied. Kinetic parameters for the phosphorylation by the receptor kinase of synthetic peptide substrates having sequences related to the 3 in vitro receptor autophosphorylation sites (tyrosine residues 1173 (P1), 1148 (P2), and 1068 (P3)) were measured. The Km of peptide P1 (residues 1164-1176) was significantly lower than that for peptides P2 (residues 1141-1151) or P3 (residues 1059-1072). The tyrosine residue 1173 was also the most rapidly autophosphorylated in purified receptor preparations, consistent with previous observations for the receptor in intact cells (Downward, J., Parker, P., and Waterfield, M. D. (1984) Nature 311, 483-485). Variation in the extent of receptor autophosphorylation from 0.1 to 2.8 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor did not influence kinase activity or EGF binding affinity either for purified receptor or receptor in membrane preparations. Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by protein kinase C was shown to cause a 3-fold decrease in the affinity of purified EGF receptor for EGF and to reduce the receptor kinase activity. In membrane preparations, phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by protein kinase C resulted in conversion of high affinity EGF binding sites to a low affinity state. This suggests that activation of protein kinase C by certain growth promoting agents and tumor promoters is directly responsible for modulation of the affinity of the EGF receptor for its ligand EGF. The regulation of the EGF receptor function by protein kinase C is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1567061008,"Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with NaF produced a concentration-dependent activation of phosphorylase, inactivation of glycogen synthase, efflux of Ca2+, rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), increase in myo-inositol-1,4,5,-P3 levels, decrease in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 levels, and increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol levels. These changes were evident within 1 min and maximum at 2-5 min. Maximum effects on Ca2+ efflux, [Ca2+]i, glycogen synthase, and phosphorylase were observed with 15 mM NaF, whereas myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol levels were maximally stimulated by 50 mM NaF. The levels of intracellular cAMP were decreased by NaF (up to 10 mM) in the absence or presence of glucagon (0.1-1 nM) or forskolin (2 microM). The effects of low doses of NaF (2-15 mM) to inhibit basal or glucagon-stimulated cAMP accumulation, mobilize Ca2+, activate phosphorylase, and inactivate glycogen synthase were all potentiated by AlCl3. This potentiation was abolished by the Al3+ chelator deferoxamine. These results illustrate that AlF4- can mimic the effects of Ca2+-mobilizing hormones in hepatocytes and suggest that the coupling of the receptors for these hormones to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 to myo-inositol 1,4,5-P3 is through a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein. This is because AlF4- is known to modulate the activity of other guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Ni, Ns, and transducin)."
https://openalex.org/W1571099567,"Angiotensin II acts on cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to induce the rapid, phospholipase C-mediated generation of inositol trisphosphate from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. sn-1,2-Diacylglycerol, the other major product of inositol phospholipid breakdown, is known to activate protein kinase C, but its role in angiotensin II action on VSMC has not been defined. We report herein that, in cultured VSMC prelabeled with [3H]myoinositol, brief incubations (2-5 min) with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1-100 nM) or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (10-100 microM), two potent activators of protein kinase C, inhibit subsequent angiotensin II (100 nM)-induced increases in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate breakdown and inositol trisphosphate formation. In addition, pretreatment of VSMC with either PMA (IC50 approximately 1 nM) or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (IC50 approximately 7.5 microM) also markedly inhibits angiotensin II (1 nM)-stimulated increases in cytosolic free Ca2+, as measured with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator quin 2, or 45Ca2+ efflux. Neither PMA nor 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol initiated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate breakdown or Ca2+ flux by itself. PMA treatment (10 nM, 5 min) did not influence the number or affinity of 125I-angiotensin II-binding sites in intact cells. These data suggest that one function of angiotensin II-generated sn-1,2-diacylglycerol in vascular smooth muscle may be to modulate, by protein kinase C-mediated mechanisms, angiotensin II receptor coupling to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1548292004,"The effect of self-phosphorylation on the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor has been investigated using immunoaffinity-purified protein. Enzyme was first incubated for various times with excess ATP to phosphorylate it to differing extents; the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate exogenous peptide substrates was then measured as a function of its self-phosphorylation state. Increasing self-phosphorylation to 1.3-1.8 mol of phosphate mol-1 of epidermal growth factor receptor enhanced protein-tyrosine kinase activity 2-3-fold. Comparison of the kinetics of protein-tyrosine kinase activity at different ATP concentrations revealed significant differences between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated enzyme. At low levels of ATP, a double reciprocal plot of the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the unphosphorylated enzyme was hyperbolic, suggesting that ATP may act as an activator of the enzyme. At higher ATP concentrations, where greater levels of self-phosphorylation occurred during the reaction, the kinetics appeared linear and similar to those of the phosphorylated enzyme. Dose-response studies using three different peptide substrates (angiotensin II, gastrin, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the self-phosphorylation site in p60v-src) showed that exogenous substrates inhibit receptor self-phosphorylation. In each case, half-maximal inhibition was observed at a peptide concentration approximately equal to the substrate's Km. A kinetic analysis comparing peptide phosphorylation using unphosphorylated and prephosphorylated enzyme indicated that the self-phosphorylation site can act as a competitive inhibitor (alternate substrate) versus peptide substrates. These results suggest that self-phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor removes a competitive constraint so that exogenous substrates can be more readily phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W1568773554,"The main retinoids and some binding proteins and enzymes involved in retinol metabolism have been quantified in different types of rat liver cells. Hepatic perisinusoidal stellate cells contained 28-34 nmol of retinoids/10(6) cells, and parenchymal liver cells contained 0.5-0.8 nmol of retinoids/10(6) cells, suggesting that as much as 80% of more of total liver retinoids might be stored in stellate cells with the rest stored in parenchymal cells. Isolated endothelial cells and Kupffer cells contained very low levels of retinoids. More than 98% of the retinoids recovered in stellate cells were retinyl esters. Isolated parenchymal and stellate cell preparations both contained considerable retinyl palmitate hydrolase and acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase activities. Parenchymal cells accounted for about 75-80% of the total hepatic content of these two enzyme activities, with the rest located in stellate cells. On a cell protein basis, the concentrations of both of these activities were much greater in stellate cells than in parenchymal cells. In contrast, cholesteryl oleate and triolein hydrolase activities were fairly evenly distributed in all types of liver cells. Large amounts of cellular retinol binding proteins were also found in parenchymal and stellate cells. Although parenchymal cells accounted for more than 90% of hepatic cellular retinol binding protein, the concentration of the protein in stellate cells (per unit protein) was 22 X greater than that in parenchymal cells. Stellate cells were also enriched in cellular retinoic acid binding protein. Thus, both parenchymal and stellate cells contain substantial amounts of retinoids and of the enzymes and intracellular binding proteins involved in retinol metabolism. Stellate cells are particularly enriched in these several components."
https://openalex.org/W1516495306,"When grown on methylamine as a sole carbon source, Paracoccus denitrificans synthesizes a Type I blue copper protein which mediates electron transfer between methylamine dehydrogenase and cytochrome c. This blue copper protein does not serve as an electron acceptor for methanol dehydrogenase and is not synthesized by cells grown on methanol or succinate. The blue copper protein and methylamine dehydrogenase were localized in the periplasm of P. denitrificans, whereas formate dehydrogenase was cytoplasmic. The copper protein can be purified to high yield in a single step from the periplasmic subcellular fraction prepared from P. denitrificans. The purified protein contains a single 15,000-Da polypeptide chain and one copper atom/molecule and exhibits a pI of 4.8. The oxidized form of the protein absorbs strongly at 595 nm and weakly at 464 nm. The physical and physiological properties of this protein indicate that it is not an azurin, but representative of another class of blue copper proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1674418446,"To define the mechanism whereby glucose regulates islet insulin mRNA content, insulin gene transcription rates were determined in islets labeled with [3H]uridine at low (3.3) or high (17 mM) glucose. Glucose stimulated the transcription of total RNA almost 2-fold and insulin mRNA 5.6-fold. Addition of dibutyryl cAMP to islets in vitro could partially mimic the effect of glucose on insulin gene-specific transcription. In the insulin-producing RIN-5F cell line, glucose did not affect transcription, while cholera toxin acted as a secretagogue and increased total RNA and insulin gene-specific transcription as well. We conclude that glucose exerts a specific stimulatory effect on the transcription of the insulin gene(s) in normal islets and that this effect may be mediated in part by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1492352549,"Pseudomonas testosteroni protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase and Pseudomonas putida catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (metapyrocatechase) catalyze extradiol-type oxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring of their substrates. The essential active site Fe2+ of each enzyme binds nitric oxide (NO) to produce an EPR active complex with an electronic spin of S = 3/2. Hyperfine broadening of the EPR resonances of the nitrosyl complexes by 17O-enriched H2O shows that water is bound directly to the Fe2+ in the native enzymes, but is apparently displaced in substrate complexes. NO is not displaced by either substrates or inhibitors. The EPR spectra of several enzyme-inhibitor-NO complexes are different from those of enzyme-NO or enzyme-substrate-NO complexes and are found to be broadened by 17O-enriched water. The data show that at least 2 and perhaps 3 sites in the Fe ligation can be occupied by exogenous ligands. Furthermore, it is likely that substrates and inhibitors displace water by binding either at or near to the Fe in the nitrosyl complex. Nitric oxide binding is found to be substrate-dependent for each enzyme. Native catechol 2,3-dioxygenase exhibits KD values of 190 microM and 2.0 mM for NO binding in two types of independent sites. Only one type of site is observed in the catechol complex which exhibits a KD for NO of 3.4 microM. One type of NO binding site is observed for both the native and substrate complexed protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase with KD values of 360 and 3 microM, respectively. The presence of a specific site in the Fe coordination for NO which is modified in the substrate complex, suggests that O2 binding by the extradiol dioxygenases may also occur at the Fe."
https://openalex.org/W1586273433,"To investigate the mechanisms by which hydrostatic pressure inhibits (Na,K)-ATPase, we measured enzyme activity, as a function of pressure and temperature, of purified (Na,K)-ATPase from dog kidney and eel electroplax, and we monitored protein conformation, possible subunit interactions, and the fluidity of the membrane with fluorescent probes. The (Na,K)-ATPase and p-nitrophenylphosphatase activities were inhibited reversibly by pressures below 1.5 kilobars (eel enzyme) and 2.5 kilobars (dog kidney enzyme). Above these pressures, the enzymes were inactivated irreversibly. The plots of 1n(activity) versus pressure were curvilinear; this indicates that the reversible inhibition by pressure involves two or more rate-limiting steps. The calculated activation volumes varied with temperature and pressure and were larger for the (Na,K)-ATPase activity compared to the p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity. The fluorescence polarization of three hydrophobic probes decreased with increasing temperature (10-36 degrees C) and increased with increasing pressure (10(-3)-1.5 kilobars), reversibly, without any evidence of a lipid phase transition. Plots of enzyme activity versus fluorescence polarization of the lipid probes showed an inverse relationship; this indicates that enzyme activity was directly related to the fluidity of the membrane as measured by the lipid probes. Pressure had no effect on the fluorescence polarization of two cardiac glycoside probes nor on the efficiency of resonance energy transfer between either donor and acceptor cardiac glycosides specifically bound to the ouabain sites of different alpha-subunits, or tryptophan and the bound cardiac glycoside probe. These results suggest that dissociation of dimeric alpha-subunits is not related to the inhibition by pressure, and that the cardiac glycoside-complexed enzyme conformation is stabilized by pressure. It is concluded that increased pressure decreases the membrane fluidity which hinders conformational transitions associated with rate-limiting steps of the (Na,K)-ATPase reaction. It is proposed that ion-bound or -occluded forms of (Na,K)-ATPase are stabilized by pressure because they occupy a smaller volume."
https://openalex.org/W1542845577,"The H+,K+-ATPase has been postulated to be the enzyme responsible for H+ secretion by the parietal cell. Omeprazole has been shown to be an inhibitor of acid secretion in vivo, but also in in vitro test models for acid secretion, including partly purified H+,K+-ATPase, the inhibitory action of omeprazole has been demonstrated (Wallmark, B., Jaresten, B. M., Larsson, H., Ryberg, B., Brandstrom, A., and Fellenius, E. (1983) Am. J. Physiol. 245, G64-G71). It was thus possible to use this compound to demonstrate a correlation between H+,K+-ATPase activity in rat oxyntic mucosa and in vivo H+ secretion. Two results were found. (a) Increasing oral doses of omeprazole progressively inhibited acid secretion, H+,K+-ATPase activity, and phosphoenzyme formation of a microsomal fraction isolated from the inhibited rat mucosa. Furthermore, a Mg2+-stimulated ATPase activity, associated with the H+,K+-ATPase membrane fraction, was not affected by the omeprazole treatment. (b) Recovery of H+,K+-ATPase activity following complete omeprazole inhibition was correlated with the appearance of acid secretion. The results indicate a strict relationship between the activity of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase in the microsomal fraction and gastric acid secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1574505285,"The effect of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, was investigated on glucose transport in human erythrocytes. Forskolin was found to be a potent inhibitor of 3-O-methylglucose (3-O-MG) influx in human erythrocytes. The inhibition of 3-O-MG transport was instantaneous and reversible. The inhibitory effect of forskolin was concentration-dependent, having an IC50 value of 7.5 microM. Forskolin caused a decrease in Vmax of carrier-mediated 3-O-MG transport from 35.32 to 1.56 mumol/ml of cell X min in the presence of 50 microM forskolin. Inhibition of influx was not reversed at high concentrations of 3-O-MG. In addition, forskolin inhibited the influx of other carbohydrates including galactose, ribose, and fructose. In contrast, forskolin was without effect on adenosine transport. To unravel the underlying mechanism responsible for the inhibitory action of forskolin, the possible involvement of cyclic AMP in controlling glucose transport was examined. Erythrocytes treated with 50 microM forskolin exhibited an increase in cyclic AMP content from the basal levels of 258 fmol/ml of cell to 334 fmol/ml of cell within 10 s after forskolin exposure. However, erythrocytes in which cyclic AMP was allowed to accumulate in excess of 10,000 times the basal level, by means of preincubation with exogenous cyclic AMP, displayed 3-O-MG transport indistinguishable from that of cyclic AMP-poor control cells. In view of the finding that cyclic AMP plays no discernible role in the erythrocyte 3-O-MG transport, it is suggested that the forskolin inhibition is mediated by a mechanism other than by stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. Moreover, forskolin appears to directly inactivate the 3-O-MG transport system since glucose-sensitive cytochalasin B binding to erythrocyte membranes is virtually abolished by 50 microM forskolin."
https://openalex.org/W1641482941,"The cardiac sarcolemmal 15-kDa protein, previously shown to be the principal sarcolemmal substrate phosphorylated in intact heart in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation (Presti, C. F., Jones, L. R., and Lindemann J. P. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3860-3867), was demonstrated to be the major substrate phosphorylated in purified canine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles by an intrinsic protein kinase C activity. The intrinsic protein kinase C, detected by its ability to phosphorylate H1 histones, was most concentrated in cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles and absent from sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. Unmasking techniques localized the intrinsic protein kinase activity and its principal endogenous substrate, the 15-kDa protein, to the cytoplasmic surfaces of sarcolemmal vesicles; phospholamban contaminating the sarcolemmal preparation was not significantly phosphorylated. The intrinsic protein kinase C required micromolar Ca2+ for activity, but not calmodulin. Half-maximal phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein occurred at 10 microM Ca2+; optimal phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein by protein kinase C and Ca2+ was additive to that produced by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Exogenous phospholipids were not required to activate endogenous protein kinase C. However, heat-treated sarcolemmal vesicles, in which intrinsic protein kinase activities were inactivated, were sufficient to maximally activate soluble protein kinase C prepared from rat brain, suggesting that all the necessary phospholipid cofactors were already present in sarcolemmal vesicles. Of the many proteins present in sarcolemmal vesicles, only the 15-kDa protein was phosphorylated significantly in heat-inactivated sarcolemmal vesicles by soluble protein kinase C, confirming that the 15-kDa protein was a preferential substrate for this enzyme. Consistent with a protein kinase C activity in sarcolemmal vesicles, the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate stimulated 15-kDa protein phosphorylation severalfold, producing approximately 70% of the maximal phosphorylation even in the absence of significant ionized Ca2+. The results are compatible with an intrinsic protein kinase C activity in sarcolemmal vesicles whose major substrate is the 15-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1563266905,"Phosphatidylserine synthase is found predominantly in the microsomal fraction, and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase is found predominantly in the mitochondrial fraction of baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. This segregation of enzymes of phosphatidylserine metabolism allows serine metabolism to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine to be used as an indicator of the intracellular movement of phosphatidylserine. After BHK-21 cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]serine, phosphatidylserine was efficiently labeled, and subsequently 40-50% of this radiolabeled lipid turned over to form phosphatidylethanolamine during a 7.5-h chase. Treatment of cells with NaN3 plus NaF or cycloheximide at the end of the pulse labeling period markedly inhibited the rate and extent of phosphatidylserine turnover during the chase period. The inhibition of phosphatidylserine turnover could not be attributed to inhibition of either phosphatidylserine decarboxylase or phosphatidylserine exchange protein activity. Subcellular fractionation of the BHK-21 cells demonstrated that cells poisoned with NaN3 plus NaF accumulated phosphatidylserine in the microsomal fraction relative to unpoisoned cells. The results indicate that metabolic energy is required for the transport of phosphatidylserine to the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2096891871,"The ligand-binding subunit of the A1-adenosine receptor has been identified by photoaffinity labeling. A photolabile derivative of R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, R-2-azido-N6-p-hydroxyphenylisopropyladenosine (R-AHPIA), has been synthesized as a covalent specific ligand for A1-adenosine receptors. In adenylate cyclase studies with membranes of rat fat cells and human platelets, R-AHPIA has adenosine receptor agonist activity with a more than 60-fold selectivity for the A1-subtype. It competes for [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine binding to A1-receptors of rat brain membranes with a Ki value of 1.6 nM. After UV irradiation, R-AHPIA binds irreversibly to the receptor, as indicated by a loss of [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine binding after extensive washing; the Ki value for this photoinactivation is 1.3 nM. The p-hydroxyphenyl substituent of R-AHPIA can be directly radioiodinated to give a photoaffinity label of high specific radioactivity (125I-AHPIA). This compound has a KD value of about 1.5 nM as assessed from saturation and kinetic experiments. Adenosine analogues compete for 125I-AHPIA binding to rat brain membranes with an order of potency characteristic for A1-adenosine receptors. Dissociation curves following UV irradiation at equilibrium demonstrate 30-40% irreversible specific binding. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates that the probe is photoincorporated into a single peptide of Mr = 35,000. Labeling of this peptide can be blocked specifically and stereoselectively by adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists in a manner which is typical for the A1-subtype. The results indicate that 125I-AHPIA identifies the ligand-binding subunit of the A1-adenosine receptor, which is a peptide with Mr = 35,000."
https://openalex.org/W1504102328,"Addition of either vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, to confluent monolayers of the T84 epithelial cell line derived from a human colon carcinoma increased the rate of 86Rb+ or 42K+ efflux from preloaded cells. Stimulation of the rate of efflux by VIP and A23187 still occurred in the presence of ouabain and bumetanide, inhibitors of the Na+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport, respectively. The effect of A23187 required extracellular Ca2+, while that of VIP correlated with its known effect on cyclic AMP production. Other agents which increased cyclic AMP production or mimicked its effect also increased 86Rb+ efflux. VIP- or A23187-stimulated efflux was inhibited by 5 mM Ba2+ or 1 mM quinidine, but not by 20 mM tetraethylammonium, 4 mM 4-aminopyridine, or 1 microM apamin. Under appropriate conditions, VIP and A23187 also increased the rate of 86Rb+ or 42K+ uptake. Stimulation of the initial rate of uptake by either agent required high intracellular K+ and was not markedly affected by the imposition of transcellular pH gradients. The effect of A23187, but not VIP or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, was refractory to depletion of cellular energy stores. A23187-stimulated uptake was not significantly affected by anion substitution, however, stimulation of uptake by VIP required the presence of a permeant anion. This result may be due to the simultaneous activation of a cyclic AMP-dependent Cl- transport system. The kinetics of both VIP- and A23187-stimulated uptake and efflux were consistent with a channel-rather than a carrier-mediated K+ transport mechanism. The results also suggest that cyclic AMP and Ca2+ may activate two different kinds of K+ transport systems. Finally, both transport systems have been localized to the basolateral membrane of T84 monolayers, a result compatible with their possible regulatory role in hormone-activated electrogenic Cl- secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1603620343,"Three monoclonal antibodies reactive with different structural domains of the T3-T cell receptor complex of the human T cell leukemia line, HPB-ALL, were previously shown to activate a membrane potential-sensitive, La3+-inhibitable Ca2+ influx (Oettgen, H. C., Terhorst, C., Cantley, L. C., and Rosoff, P. M. (1985) Cell 40, 583-590). OKT3 (anti-T3), WT-31 (anti-receptor constant region), and T40/25 (anti-receptor variable region) also enhance the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger in these cells. The associated rise in pHi was dependent on the presence of external Ca2+ and Na+, was inhibited by dimethylamiloride and La3+, and was maintained for at least 20 min. Phorbol esters, which are co-mitogenic in T cells and activate protein kinase C, also stimulated the exchanger, but by a mechanism not requiring an elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+; the rise in pHi rapidly peaked and returned to baseline levels within 20 min. Pretreatment with phorbols prevented an increase in pHi by OKT3 although a transient additive effect was observed when the two were added simultaneously. Receptor function was maintained in the presence of phorbol esters as OKT3 still stimulated a Ca2+ influx. These data demonstrate the existence of two interdependent pathways to activate Na+/H+ exchange in T lymphocytes and suggest a pathway of internal regulation of antigen-activated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1586731042,"The murine major histocompatibility complex is known to express two class II molecules, A and E. They are composed of one alpha- and one beta-polypeptide chain. Recently, we reported the finding of an additional beta-chain second domain exon tentatively designated A beta 2. We describe here the nucleotide sequence of the A beta 2 gene and an A beta 2 cDNA clone. A beta 2 displays the same exon organization as the known expressed beta-chain genes, and the predicted A beta 2 polypeptide shows all the characteristic features of the expressed beta-chains. The predicted A beta 2 polypeptide shows 49-56% amino acid sequence identity to A beta and E beta chains and to the human DP, DQ, and DR beta-chains. These are 63-79% homologous to each other, indicating that A beta 2 is the most divergent member of the beta-chain family. The A beta 2 gene seems to be transcribed in the same types of cells as other class II genes. Detection of incompletely spliced A beta 2 mRNA and the finding of a cDNA clone containing an intron segment suggest that A beta 2 transcripts are processed slowly. Hybridizations with A beta 2 probes to restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA indicate that the A beta 2 gene displays lower allelic polymorphism than the A beta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1535402441,"The fumarate reductase complex and soluble enzyme from Escherichia coli have been investigated by low temperature magnetic circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. The results confirm the presence of one [2Fe-2S] cluster and show that the high potential iron-sulfur center is a 3Fe cluster of the type found in bacterial ferredoxins. Since the 3Fe cluster is present in catalytically competent enzyme and does not appear to be involved in any type of cluster conversion under reducing conditions, we conclude that it is an intrinsic component of the functional enzyme. The significance of the results is discussed in relation to the published amino acid sequence and the iron-sulfur cluster composition of bacterial fumarate reductases."
https://openalex.org/W1568550205,"Unlike lactoperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase, thyroid peroxidase catalyzed the oxidation of hydroquinone mostly by way of 2-electron transfer. This conclusion could be derived from three independent experiments: ESR measurements of p-benzosemiquinone, trapping the unpaired electron by cytochrome c, and spectrophotometric analysis of catalytic intermediates of the enzymes. The 1-electron flux for hydroquinone oxidation was found to be 15-19% in the reaction of thyroid peroxidase, while it was nearly 100% in the reactions of lactoperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase. From the spectrophotometric analysis of the catalytic intermediates of enzyme, it was suggested that the mechanism of oxidation catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase changes from a 2-electron to a 1-electron type as the substituents at 2- and 6-positions of phenol become bulky or heavy. On the other hand, the mechanism was invariably a 1-electron type when the oxidation of phenols was catalyzed by lactoperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase. These three peroxidases all catalyzed 1-electron oxidation of ascorbate."
https://openalex.org/W1606480282,"The native structures of protein phosphatases have not been clearly established. Several tissues contain high molecular weight enzymes which are converted to active species of Mr approximately 35,000 by denaturing treatments or partial proteolysis. We have used a monoclonal antibody directed against purified bovine cardiac Mr = 38,000 protein phosphatase to determine whether this species is the native catalytic subunit or a proteolytic product of a larger polypeptide. Monoclonal antibody was obtained from a cloned hybrid cell line produced by the fusion of Sp2 myeloma cells with spleen cells from a mouse immunized with phosphatase coupled to hemocyanin. This antibody was specific for the Mr = 38,000 phosphatase as determined by immunoblot analysis of purified enzyme or cardiac tissue extracts after native or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A single immunoreactive protein of Mr = 38,000 was present in cardiac tissue extracts including extracts prepared from freeze-clamped rat heart rapidly denatured in hot sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer. Precipitation of cardiac extract with 80% ethanol did not alter the Mr of the phosphatase nor did it liberate new immunoreactive material not observed in the extract. Ethanol precipitation caused the dissociation of both phosphatase activity and immunoreactivity from a high Mr form to a form of Mr between 30,000 and 40,000. An immunoreactive protein of Mr = 38,000 was identified in several bovine and rat tissues as well as tissues from rabbits, mice and chickens and human HT-29 cells. From these data we conclude that the Mr = 38,000 cardiac phosphatase is a native catalytic subunit of higher molecular complexes which are dissociated by ethanol precipitation. A very similar, or identical, protein is present in several tissues and species suggesting that this catalytic subunit is a ubiquitous enzyme important in many dephosphorylation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1587224513,"Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma X glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with 10 nM [D-Ala2,D-Leu5] enkephalin (DADLE) results in a reduction of cell-surface opiate delta receptors. Whether opiate receptor internalization requires the activation of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ni) is unclear. Hence, activation of Ni was attenuated by treating hybrid cells with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PT) for 3 h, which resulted in a decrease in DADLE's ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. Despite this prior treatment with PT, chronic exposure of these cells to 10 nM DADLE resulted in a time-dependent decrease in both [3H]diprenorphine and [3H]DADLE binding. This reduction in 3H-ligand binding in cells previously treated with PT represented internalization of the receptors because translocation was observed of bound [3H]DADLE from plasma membrane fractions to the lysosomal fractions in the Percoll gradients. Thus, opiate receptors internalize without activation of Ni. The internalization of opiate receptors was not accompanied by Ni. By measuring the amount of the 41-kDa alpha subunit being labeled by PT with [32P]NAD+, it was determined that plasma membrane preparations, of both the control cells and cells treated with 10 nM of DADLE for 4 h, contained equal concentrations of Ni, 2 pmol of Ni/mg of protein. Additionally, there was no measurable alteration in the amount of PT substrate in the lysosomal fractions of the DADLE-treated cells as compared to that of control cells. Chronic DADLE treatment resulted in a decrease in Km value of NAD+ in the ADP-ribosylation of 41-kDa subunit of Ni. In summary, opiate receptors internalize as agonist-receptor complexes without the guanine nucleotide-binding component."
https://openalex.org/W1565432868,"An RNase H was purified 2,500-fold to near homogeneity from early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. The purified enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 180,000 and appears to consist of two 49,000- and two 39,000-dalton polypeptides. The enzyme specifically hydrolyzes RNA.DNA hybrids and releases oligoribonucleotides ranging in size from 2-9 residues. The RNase H can also remove RNA primers that are synthesized and subsequently elongated by the Drosophila polymerase-primase. Preincubation of the RNase H from D. melanogaster embryos with the homologous DNA polymerase-primase results in an increased rate of DNA synthesis. The DNA chains synthesized under these conditions are shorter than those synthesized in the absence of the RNase H, and the rate of primer synthesis is increased significantly. These findings suggest that the RNase H forms a complex with the polymerase-primase, increasing its recycling capacity and thereby increasing the frequency of chain initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1621956931,"An inhibitor of sodium-potassium-ATPase has been partially purified from the culture medium obtained from hypothalamic cells maintained in a capillary membrane perfusion system, and some of the properties of this inhibitory factor have been investigated. Gel filtration (Sephadex G-25 Superfine) of heat-treated medium (80 degrees C for 10 min) resulted in elution of inhibitory activity in the post-salt fraction. These fractions inhibited active (i.e. sodium-potassium-ATPase-mediated) sodium transport in intact human erythrocytes, displaced [3H]ouabain from its binding site, and directly inhibited canine kidney sodium-potassium-ATPase as measured by NADH oxidation. High-performance liquid chromatography (on Hypersil ODS) of these fractions after desalting yielded one region which showed inhibitory activity on all three assays. Inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase was dose-related and filtered through an Amicon UM10 membrane. Incubation of this material with dispase, carboxypeptidase A, chymotrypsin, and prolidase destroyed inhibitory activity, whereas trypsin and leucine aminopeptidase were ineffective. These studies show that hypothalamic neurones release a low molecular weight heat-stable peptide which inhibits active sodium transport, ouabain binding, and sodium-potassium-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2124408126,"[3H]Ethylpropylamiloride is a useful radioactive label to identify the Na+/H+ exchange system (Vigne, P., Frelin, C., Audinot, M., Borsotto, M., Cragoe, E. J., and Lazdunski, M. (1984) EMBO J. 3, 2647-2651). This paper extends the analysis of the properties of interaction of [3H]ethylpropylamiloride with the exchanger and describes its use with hypertrophied kidneys. [3H]Ethylpropylamiloride-binding sites copurify with the luminal membrane marker alkaline phosphatase but not with the basolateral membrane marker (Na+,K+)ATPase, thus indicating an asymmetric distribution of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Specific [3H]ethylpropylamiloride binding is dependent on pH. The pH dependency indicates that an ionizable function with a pKapp of 7.0 is essential in the association of the amiloride derivative. H+ acts competitively on [3H]ethylpropylamiloride binding; Na+, Li+, or cholinium ions have no effect on the association. Compensatory adaptation of the kidney to chronic reduction of renal mass is accompanied by a 1.7-fold increase in the activity of the Na+/H+ exchange system. Properties of interaction of internal and external pH with the Na+/H+ exchanger of normal and hypertrophied kidneys are identical. Titration of [3H]ethylpropylamiloride-binding sites in normal and hypertrophied kidneys suggests that the increased activity of the Na+/H+ exchange system is not accompanied by an increased concentration of exchangers."
https://openalex.org/W1600690228,"Purified fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was phosphorylated in vitro by purified yeast cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Maximal phosphorylation was accompanied by an inactivation of the enzyme by about 60%. In vitro phosphorylation caused changes in the kinetic properties of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase: 1) the ratio R(Mg2+/Mn2+) of the enzyme activities measured at 10 mM Mg2+ and 2 mM Mn2+, respectively, decreased from 2.6 to 1.2; 2) the ratio R(pH 7/9) of the activities measured at pH 7.0 and pH 9.0, respectively, decreased from 0.62 to 0.38, indicating a shift of the pH optimum to the alkaline range. However, the affinity of the enzyme for its inhibitors fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) and AMP, expressed as the concentration required for 50% inhibition, was not changed. The maximum amount of phosphate incorporated into fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was 0.6-0.75 mol/mol of the 40-kDa subunit. Serine was identified as the phosphate-labeled amino acid. The initial rate of in vitro phosphorylation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, obtained with a maximally cAMP-activated protein kinase, increased when Fru-2,6-P2 and AMP, both potent inhibitors of the enzyme, were added. As Fru-2,6-P2 and AMP did not affect the phosphorylation of histone by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the inhibitors must bind to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in such a way that the enzyme becomes a better substrate for phosphorylation. Nevertheless, Fru-2,6-P2 and AMP did not increase the maximum amount of phosphate incorporated into fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase beyond that observed in the presence of cAMP alone."
https://openalex.org/W1608132743,"By selecting for growth on testosterone or estradiol-17 beta as the only source of organic carbon, we have isolated a number of soil microorganisms which contain highly active and novel, inducible, NAD-linked 3 alpha-, 3 beta-, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Such enzymes are suitable for the microanalysis of steroids and of steroid-transforming enzymes, as well as for performing stereoselective oxidations and reductions of steroids. Of particular interest among these organisms is a new species of Alcaligenes containing 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, easily separable from 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Unlike any of the other isolated organisms, this Alcaligenes sp. contained no 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity. A large-scale purification (763-fold) to homogeneity of the major induced 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was achieved by ion-exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity chromatographies. The enzyme has high specific activity for the oxidation of testosterone (Vmax = 303 mumol/min/mg of protein; Km = 3.6 microM) and reacts almost equally well with estradiol-17 beta (Vmax = 356 mumol/min/mg; Km = 6.4 microM). It consists of apparently identical subunits (Mr = 32,000) and exists in polymeric form under nondenaturing conditions (Mr = 68,000 by gel filtration and 86,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The isoelectric point is pH 5.1. The enzyme is almost completely specific for 17 beta-hydroxysteroids which may be delta 5-olefins or ring A phenols or have cis or trans A/B ring fusions. Substituents at other positions are tolerated, although the presence of a 16 alpha- or 16 beta-hydroxyl group blocks the oxidation of the 17 beta-hydroxyl function. 3 beta-Hydroxysteroids (A/B ring fusion trans, but not cis, or delta 5-olefins) are very poor substrates. The application of this highly active, specific, and stable 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to the microestimation of steroids by enzymatic cycling of nicotinamide nucleotides and for the stereospecific oxidation of steroids is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1559801128,"The collagenase produced by rat uterine cells in culture has been examined for its ability to degrade denatured collagen. Acting as a gelatinase, rat uterus collagenase was able to successfully degrade the denatured chains of collagen types I through V. In addition, the enzyme produced multiple cleavages in these chains and displayed values for Km of 4-5 microM, compared to values of 1-2 microM when native collagen was used as substrate. Furthermore, rat uterus collagenase degraded the alpha 2 chain of denatured type I collagen at a significantly faster rate than the alpha 1 chain, as previously observed for human skin fibroblast collagenase. In contrast to the action of human skin collagenase, however, the rat uterus enzyme was found to be a markedly better gelatinase than a collagenase, degrading the alpha chains of denatured type I guinea pig skin collagen at rates some 7-15-fold greater than native collagen. Human skin collagenase degrades the same denatured chains at rates ranging from 13-44% of its rate on native collagen. Rat uterus collagenase, then, is approximately 50 times better a gelatinase than is human skin collagenase. In addition to its ability to cleave denatured collagen chains at greater rates than native collagen, the rat uterus collagenase also attacked a wider spectrum of peptide bonds in gelatin than does human skin collagenase. In addition to cleaving the Gly-Leu and Gly-Ile bonds characteristic of its action on native collagen, rat uterus collagenase readily catalyzed the cleavage of Gly-Phe bonds in gelatin. The rat enzyme was also capable of cleaving Gly-Ala and Gly-Val bonds, although these bonds were somewhat less preferred by the enzyme. The cleavage of peptide bonds other than Gly-Leu and Gly-Ile appears to be a property of the collagenase itself and not a contaminating protease. Thus, it appears that the collagenase responsible for the degradation of collagen during the massive involution of the uterus might also act as a gelatinase to further degrade the initial products of collagenolysis to small peptides suitable for further metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1519499635,"The effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) on phospholipid metabolism was examined in clonal rat osteogenic sarcoma cells, UMR 106, of osteoblastic phenotype. Treatment of UMR 106 cells with 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h caused an increase in [14C]serine incorporation into phosphatidylserine (PS) and a decrease in [3H]ethanolamine, [3H]linositol, and [14C]choline incorporation into phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine, respectively; the decrease in [3H]ethanolamine incorporation into PE was the largest. The total contents of phospholipids were similarly affected by 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, suggesting that the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 are due largely to alterations in the synthesis of these phospholipids. The effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 were evident at 10(-10) M 1,25-(OH)2D3, and 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a maximal stimulation of [14C]PS synthesis (167% of control) and a maximal reduction in the [3H]PE synthesis (41% of control). The [14C]PS/[3H]PE ratio increased gradually and reached a maximum after 70 h of treatment with 10(-8)M 1,25-(OH)2D3. When the cells were cultured in calcium-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA or when 5 microM cycloheximide was added to the medium, the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on phospholipid metabolism was almost completely inhibited. Neither 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 nor 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 caused significant changes in phospholipid metabolism. These results suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 alters phospholipid metabolism by enhancing PS synthesis through a calcium-dependent stimulation of the base exchange reaction of serine with other phospholipids and that the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 requires the synthesis of new proteins. Because PS is thought to be important for apatite formation and bone mineralization by binding calcium and phosphate to form calcium-PS-phosphate complexes, the present data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 may stimulate bone mineralization by a direct effect on osteoblasts, stimulating PS synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560010570,"We have characterized a cyclic AMP-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant in which one of two major species of type I regulatory subunit (RI) of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is altered. Wild-type CHO cell extracts contain two cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activities. As shown by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, there is a peak of type I protein kinase activity in mutant extracts, but the type II protein kinase activity is considerably reduced even though free type II regulatory subunit (RII) is present. The type I kinase from the mutant has an altered RI (RI*) whose KD for the binding of 8-N3[32P] cAMP (KD = 1.3 X 10(-5) M) is increased by more than 200-fold compared to RI from the wild-type enzyme (KD = 5.5 X 10(-8) M). No differences were found between the catalytic subunits from the wild-type and mutant type I kinases. A large portion of RI in mutant and wild-type extracts is present in the free form. The RI* derived from mutant type I protein kinase shows altered labeling by 8-N3[32P]cAMP (KD = 1.3 X 10(-5) M) whereas the free RI from the mutant is labeled normally by the photoaffinity label (KD = 7.2 X 10(-8) M), suggesting that the RI* which binds to the catalytic subunit is functionally different from the free form of RI. The decreased amount of type II kinase activity in the mutant appears to be due to competition of RI* with RII for binding to the catalytic subunit. Translation of mRNA from wild-type CHO cells results in the synthesis of two different charge forms of RI, providing biochemical confirmation of two different species of RI in CHO cells. Additional biochemical evidence based on isoelectric focusing behavior of 8-N3[32P]cAMP-labeled RI species and [35S]methionine-labeled RI from mutant and wild-type extracts confirms the charge heterogeneity of RI species in CHO cells. These genetic and biochemical data taken together are consistent with the conclusion that there are at least two different species of RI present in CHO cells and that one of these species is altered in the mutant analyzed in this work."

The C6 glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA clone (pGPDH-1,1800 base pairs) used in these studies was selected from a C6 library generated from polysomal poly(A)+ RNA. pGPDH-1 hybridized to a 4.7-kilobase RNA from rat muscle and brain, mouse liver, and C6 cells; this mRNA is at least four times larger than the required coding sequence for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase.

The 10-oxo derivative was separated from 1,25-(OH)2-D3 by normal phase HPLC with dichloromethane:propanol-2 (19:1) or by reverse phase HPLC with methanol:water (4:1). Unlike 1,25-(OH)2-D3 production, formation of 10-oxo-19-nor-25-OH-D3 did not require a source of reducing equivalents and was blocked by the antioxidants, diphenyl-rho-phenylenediamine, and butylated hydroxytoluene, implicating a free radical or peroxidative synthetic mechanism. Rat kidney mitochondria solubilized with cholate or with cholate and Emulgen 911 produced 10-oxo-19-nor-25-OH-D3 but no detectable 1 alpha,25-(OH)2-D3. These results stress the importance of careful identification of vitamin D metabolites produced in vitro and suggest the use of alternate chromatographic conditions for isolating 1,25-(OH)2-D3 or inclusion of antioxidants in the assay of solubilized 1 alpha-hydroxylase to eliminate contamination of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 with 10-oxo-19-nor-25-OH-D3."

We demonstrate that this differentiation is associated with a large increase (greater than 40-fold) in the activity of an enzyme, prolyl-4-hydroxylase, involved in the posttranslational modification of collagens. This large increase in prolyl-4-hydroxylase activity occurs between 42 and 72 h after retinoic acid addition, and is associated with an increased amount of immunoprecipitable prolyl hydroxylase enzyme. This enzyme should be a useful marker for certain differentiated cell types produced during differentiation of teratocarcinoma stem cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1579165919,"Reduced ferredoxin can serve as electron donor in the 6-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia catalyzed by spinach nitrite reductase. We have examined interactions between nitrite reductase and its substrates, ferredoxin and nitrite, with emphasis upon protein-protein interactions between ferredoxin and nitrite reductase. Ferredoxin, of the proteins tested, is the most effective in retarding low ionic strength inactivation of nitrite reductase. The interaction appears to be electrostatic, and the apparent Kd, calculated from the concentration dependence of ferredoxin protection, is about 1 microM in 2 mM Tris. Chemical modification of carboxyl residues of ferredoxin resulting in a change of charge reduces its reactivity with both ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase and nitrite reductase, indicating the importance of charge-charge interactions. Cross-linking studies provided no evidence for a ternary complex containing the oxidoreductase and nitrite reductase but indicated that the two enzymes will compete for ferredoxin, possibly using the same site (or overlapping sites) on the ferredoxin. A complex containing ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase, ferredoxin, and cytochrome c was detected, indicating that ferredoxin has different binding sites for cytochrome c and ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Active cross-linked complexes of ferredoxin and nitrite reductase were obtained and were less sensitive to low ionic strength inactivation than free reductase and had decreased ferredoxin-supported nitrite reductase activity. The evidence presented of protein-protein interactions between ferredoxin and nitrite reductase indicates that ferredoxin is indeed the specific physiological electron donor to the reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1528320988,"The enzymatic dephosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) by membrane preparations from calf brain has been reported previously (Burton, W.A., Scher, M.G., and Waechter, C. J. (1981) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 208, 409-417). The study presented here shows that polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity increases with age in crude microsomal fractions from white (glial-enriched) and grey (neuronal-enriched) matter of pig brain. A kinetic analysis of grey matter phosphatase activity revealed that the apparent Km values for Dol-P are similar for membranes from adults (0.13 mM) and prenatal subjects (0.12 mM), but the Vmax is significantly higher in adults. In direct contrast to this result, the specific activity of dolichol kinase is nearly 2-fold higher in membranes from pig brain grey matter of prenatal subjects as compared to identical preparations from animals 90 days of age. While the changes in kinase and phosphatase activity are approximately 2-fold, reciprocal changes in these activities would enhance shifts in the metabolic balance of a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation process. In another aspect of this study on polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase in nervous tissue, membrane preparations from calf brain are shown to dephosphorylate S- and R-Dol-P. Similar apparent Km values were obtained for S-Dol-P and R-Dol-P, but the Vmax for the dephosphorylation reaction was found to be 1.8-fold greater for S-Dol-P. These results extend the description of polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity in brain and provide information on developmental changes in phosphatase and kinase activities involved in Dol-P metabolism in nervous tissue."

At 4 degrees C myeloid differentiated, but not undifferentiated, monocytic differentiated or eosinophilic differentiated HL-60 cells display marked specific leukotriene B4 binding. Leukotriene B4 binding at 4 degrees C reaches a maximum within 10 min, is readily reversed by unlabeled leukotriene B4, and is stereospecific. Only molecules with structural and biological similarity to leukotriene B4 can competitively inhibit leukotriene B4 binding. Scatchard analysis at 4 degrees C in differentiated cells shows two classes of binding sites. The high affinity sites have a Kd of 0.27 nM and a Bmax of 14.8 fmol/10(7) cells; the low affinity sites have a Kd of 0.58 microM and a Bmax of 2453 fmol/10(7) cells. The appearance of specific leukotriene B4 binding sites in the myeloid differentiated cells correlates with their ability to chemotax in response to leukotriene B4. Undifferentiated cells do not chemotax to leukotriene B4. At 37 degrees C leukotriene B4 is incorporated into phospholipid and triglyceride species in both undifferentiated and myeloid differentiated HL-60 cells making binding studies at 37 degrees C in intact cells impossible. No evidence of omega-hydroxylase activity was found in HL-60 cells. These data suggest that the HL-60 cell may be an excellent model system for the study of leukotriene B4 receptor binding, processing, and gene expression."

The high affinity binding of (-)-[3H]HBI to membranes prepared from L6 myoblasts was stereoselectively inhibited by the active isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol. The density of receptors determined with (-)-[3H]HBI was less than that determined with [125I]IPIN. The binding of (-)-[3H]HBI was inhibited by guanine nucleotides, suggesting an agonist-mediated association of the receptor with a guanine nucleotide-binding protein, presumably the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ns) of adenylate cyclase. Results obtained in studies with membranes prepared from wild-type S49 lymphoma cells and the adenylate cyclase-deficient variant (cyc-) were similar to those obtained in experiments carried out with membranes prepared from L6 myoblasts. Thus, the high affinity binding of (-)-[3H]HBI to membranes prepared from wild-type and cyc- S49 lymphoma cells was stereoselectively inhibited by the active isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol, and was inhibited by GTP. Moreover, the density of sites determined with (-)-[3H]HBI was less than that determined with [125I]IPIN. These results suggest either that cyc- cells contain a partially functional Ns, or alternatively, that the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Ni) is capable of interacting with beta-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1552601133,"Abstract A high molecular weight phosphoprotein phosphatase was purified from rabbit liver using high speed centrifugation, acid precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sepharose-histone, and Bio-Gel A-0.5m. The purified enzyme showed a single band on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide anionic disc gel which was associated with the enzyme activity. The enzyme was made up of equimolar concentrations of two subunits whose molecular weights were 58,000 (range 58,000-62,000) and 35,000 (range 35,000-38,000). Two other polypeptides (Mr 76,000 and 27,000) were also closely associated with our enzyme preparation, but their roles, if any, in phosphatase activity are not known. The optimum pH for the reaction was 7.5-8.0. Km value of phosphoprotein phosphatase for phosphorylase a was 0.10-0.12 mg/ml. Freezing and thawing of the enzyme in the presence of 0.2 M beta-mercaptoethanol caused an activation (100-140%) of phosphatase activity with a concomitant partial dissociation of the enzyme into a Mr 35,000 catalytic subunit. Divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) and EDTA were inhibitory at concentrations higher than 1 mM. Spermine and spermidine were also found to be inhibitory at 1 mM concentrations. The enzyme was inhibited by nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP), PPi, Pi, and NaF; the degree of inhibition was different with each compound and was dependent on their concentrations employed in the assay. Among various types of histones examined, maximum activation of phosphoprotein phosphatase activity was observed with type III and type V histone (Sigma). Further studies with type III histone indicated that it increased both the Km for phosphorylase a and the Vmax of the dephosphorylation reaction. Purified liver phosphatase, in addition to the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a, also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain, myosin, histone III-S, and myelin basic protein. The effects of Mn2+, KCl, and histone III-S on phosphatase activity were variable depending on the substrate used."
https://openalex.org/W1671385638,"Using an assay which measures catenation of a supercoiled DNA template, we have characterized and quantitated a potent activity identified in crude fractions of HeLa cell nuclei. Catenation requires Mg-ATP and a DNA-condensing agent, polyvinyl alcohol. A filter-binding or agarose gel assay can be used to quantitate activity. In this reaction, DNA topoisomerase I relaxes the input supercoiled DNA to provide DNA topoisomerase II, a strongly favored template for catenation. DNA topoisomerase II preferentially catenates relaxed DNA over supercoiled DNA by a factor of 100. One molecule of DNA topoisomerase II is able to catenate about 20 circles of relaxed DNA/min at 30 degrees C but only 0.16 circle of supercoiled DNA/min at 30 degrees C. The purified HeLa topoisomerase I can also catenate DNA under these assay conditions, yet in an ATP-independent fashion. It is much less efficient than topoisomerase II; one molecule of topoisomerase I catenates only about 3.8 X 10(-3) molecules of supercoiled DNA/min at 30 degrees C with a DNA template containing 5% nicked circles. This remarkable difference between the two enzymes allows quantitation of DNA topoisomerase II activity seen in the presence of excess topoisomerase I. Unlike Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (omega), catenation by the HeLa topoisomerase I is not stimulated by gapped circles."

This dominant mutation in CHO cell line 10248 is responsible for an alteration in the RI subunit (RI*) of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Singh, T. J., Hochman, J., Verna, R., Chapman, M., Abraham, I., Pastan, I.H., and Gottesman, M.M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 13927-13933). The transformant 11564 which was studied in detail, has the same characteristics as the original mutant 10248 including continued growth in medium containing 8-Br-cAMP, an increase in the Ka for cAMP activation of the kinase, a greatly reduced amount of type II protein kinase activity, an altered incorporation of the photoaffinity label 8-N3[32P]cAMP into the RI* subunit of PKI, and an absence of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of a Mr = 52,000 protein in intact cells. In addition, analysis of the DNA of the transformant indicates the presence of an increased amount of DNA for the RI gene. These results are consistent with the transfer of a mutant gene for the RI* subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and its phenotypic expression in the transformant and also support the hypothesis that the mutation responsible for the defect in cell line 10248 is due to an alteration in the gene for RI."
https://openalex.org/W1561298848,"Inactivation of a bifunctional enzyme, fructose-6-P,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase by pyridoxal 5‘-P followed by reduction with NaBH4 was studied. Fructose-6-P,2-kinase is over 80% inactivated by 2 mM pyridoxal 5‘-P. The stoichiometry of the pyridoxyl-P incorporation and the inactivation of the kinase follows a biphasic curve. The first P-pyridoxyl residue incorporated per protomer does not affect fructose-6-P,2-kinase, but the next two P-pyridoxyl incorporation/protomer results in 80% inactivation. The Km values for ATP and fructose-6-P of the enzymes containing varying amounts of P-pyridoxyl groups at intermediate levels of inactivation are not altered, but Vmax is decreased. Among the metabolites tested, only fructose-2,6-P2 and Mg-ATP are competitive with pyridoxal-P and protect the enzyme against the inactivation. Neither the activity nor the fructose-6-P inhibition of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase is affected by the modification. The acid hydrolysate of the inactive P-[3H]pyridoxyl enzyme contained only [3H]pyridoxyl lysine. High performance liquid chromatography of tryptic peptides of phospho[3H]pyridoxyl enzymes reveals two peptides which were missing in the enzyme protected by fructose-2,6-P2 or ATP during the modification reaction. These peptides have been isolated, and their amino acid sequences have been determined as Asp-Gln-Asp-Lys-Tyr-Arg and Asp-Val-His-Lys-Tyr. Pyridoxal-P reacts specifically with two lysine residues at the fructose-2,6-P2-binding site of fructose-6-P,2-kinase but not that of fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. The site may also overlap with the ATP-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1642157127,"Abstract Limited tryptic digestion of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the presence of magnesium ions results in the formation of an active enzyme derivative which is no longer inhibited by the allosteric effector AMP. The presence of AMP during incubation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase with trypsin protects against the loss of AMP inhibition. By contrast, the presence of the nonhydrolyzable substrate analog fructose 2,6-bisphosphate accelerates the rate of formation of that form of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase which is insensitive to AMP inhibition. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of samples taken during trypsin treatment shows that the loss of AMP inhibition parallels the conversion of the native 36,500 molecular weight fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase subunit into a 34,000 molecular weight species. Automated Edman degradation of trypsin-treated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase following gel filtration shows a single sequence beginning at Gly-26 in the original enzyme, but no changes in the COOH-terminal region of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, the proteolytic product has been characterized as A comparison of the kinetic properties of control enzyme and des-1-25-fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase reveals some differences in properties (pH optimum, Ka for Mg2+, K+ activation, inhibition by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) between the two enzymes, but none is so striking as the complete loss of AMP sensitivity shown by des-1-25-fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The loss of AMP inhibition is due to the loss of AMP-binding capacity, but it is not known at this stage whether residues of the AMP site are present in the 25-amino acid NH2-terminal region or the removal of this region leads to a conformational change that abolishes the function of an AMP site located elsewhere in the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1516453365,"The interactions between ATP, monovalent cations, and divalent cations on rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase have been examined using 7Li, 31P, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. Water proton nuclear relaxation studies are consistent with the binding of Li+ to the K+ site on pyruvate kinase with an affinity of 120 mM in the absence of substrates and 16 mM in the presence of P-enolpyruvate. Titrations with pyruvate demonstrate that pyruvate binds to the enzyme with an affinity of 0.65 mM in the presence of Li+ and 0.4 mM in the presence of K+. 7Li+ nuclear relaxation rates in solutions of pyruvate kinase are increased upon titration with the metal-nucleotide analogue, Cr(H2O)4ATP. Mn2+ EPR spectra were used to determined the distribution of the enzyme between the so-called isotropic and anisotropic conformations of the enzyme (Ash, D. E., Kayne, F., and Reed, G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. (1978) 190, 571-577). Li-Cr distances of 5.6 and 11.0 A were calculated for the anisotropic and isotropic forms, respectively, in the absence or presence of pyruvate. When the divalent cation site on the enzyme was saturated with Mg2+, these distances increased to 6.7 and 9.5 A, respectively, regardless of the presence or absence of pyruvate. 31P nuclear relaxation studies with the diamagnetic metal-nucleotide analogue, Co(NH3)4ATP, indicated that addition of Mn2+ ion to the divalent cation site on the enzyme increased the longitudinal relaxation rates of all three phosphorus nuclei of the analogue. The 31P data indicate that the presence of pyruvate at the active site effects a decrease in the Mn-P distances, bringing Mn2+ and Co(NH3)4ATP closer together at the active site. The data also permit an evaluation of the role of the metal coordinated to the beta-P and gamma-P of ATP at the active site."

Among the inducible enzymes is a reductase which transfers electrons from NADH to the terminal dioxygenase that converts phthalate to the corresponding cis-1,2-dihydrodiol (Keyser, P. (1976) Ph. D. thesis, University of Miami; Ribbons, D. W., and Evans, W. C. (1960) Biochem. J. 76, 310-318). The phthalate oxygenase reductase induced in Pseudomonas cepacia is a single polypeptide chain (Mr approximately equal to 33,000) with two prosthetic groups, FMN and [2Fe-2S]. This oxidoreductase has been crystallized at pH 6.7 from polyethylene glycol 6000 in space group R3 with a = b = 113.4 A and c = 77.7 A (hexagonal indexing)."
https://openalex.org/W1542773030,"Abstract To define new methods for gene isolation exploiting mutant mammalian cells we transformed a mutant mouse cell line deficient in glucosidase II with total human genomic DNA and detected transient expression of the human glucosidase II gene. Maximum gene expression was detected 48 h after addition of DNA as a 2.5-fold increase in neutral alpha-glucosidase activity (2.47 +/- 0.15, n = 4). When mutant mouse DNA was used for transformation, no increase in enzyme activity was seen. The increased enzyme activity was due to expression of the human gene product. Thus, by immunoelectrophoresis, cells transformed with human DNA yielded a rocket which reacted with antibody to human but not to mouse glucosidase II and which hydrolyzed substrate in situ. Specific DNA sequences were required for expression of the enzyme activity, since digestion of DNA with EcoRI and SstI rendered the DNA ineffective for eliciting expression of the enzyme, while digestion of DNA with BamHI and XhoI did not affect the increase. Transfection with intact phage from a human genomic DNA library also resulted in transient expression of the human gene. These results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting, by enzymatic assay, transient expression of a human gene for an intracellular enzyme following DNA-mediated transformation both with total human DNA and with intact phage from a human recombinant library. This system could be used as an assay for isolation of a gene from a genomic library by sibling selection."
https://openalex.org/W1575417641,"Arginyl residues in BamHI endonuclease were examined because of their alleged role in proteins that contain nucleotide- or phosphate-binding sites. Butanedione, an arginine-specific reagent, inhibited the endonuclease in the presence of sodium borate. The inhibition was decreased by preliminary incubation of the enzyme with DNA or competitive inhibitors which were the 5'-phosphoryl deoxydinucleotide subsets of the BamHI recognition sequence. The dinucleotide pdGpdG protected the enzyme most efficiently against the butanedione modification. Dinucleotides that were unrelated to the recognition sequence failed to protect the enzyme from inactivation. These studies indicate that arginine residues may reside in the enzyme's active site and might function in the sequence-specific recognition of the BamHI palindrome."
https://openalex.org/W1498155112,"Murine LSTRA lymphoma cells contain a very active tyrosine protein kinase of 56 kDa (p56) which is not related to any of the other known tyrosine kinases. In the past the purification and characterization of the p56 have been hampered because of the low amount of this protein in LSTRA membranes. In this study, we have utilized a different approach for purification which consisted of trapping the protein in the membrane of vesicular stomatitis virus. Incubation of the virions with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the phosphorylation of p56 on tyrosine residues. Moreover, the phosphopeptide digest profile of vesicular stomatitis virus-p56 was identical to that observed with authentic LSTRA-p56. The p56 from such virions could be resolved from other proteins by two-dimensional gels, and furthermore, such virions have been used to prepare several antisera directed against the p56."
