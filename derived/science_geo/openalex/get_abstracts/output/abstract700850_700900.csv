https://openalex.org/W4295681610,"Molecular interactions between β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and membranes contribute to the neuronal toxicity of Aβ and the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal plasma membranes serve as biologically relevant environments for the Aβ aggregation process as well as affect the structural polymorphisms of Aβ aggregates. However, the nature of these interactions is unknown. Here, we utilized solid-state NMR spectroscopy to explore the site-specific interactions between Aβ peptides and lipids in synaptic plasma membranes at the membrane-associated nucleation stage. The key results show that different segments in the hydrophobic sequence of Aβ initiate membrane binding and interstrand assembling. We demonstrate early stage Aβ-lipid interactions modulate lipid dynamics, leading to more rapid lipid headgroup motion and reduced lateral diffusive motion. These early events influence the structural polymorphisms of yielded membrane-associated Aβ fibrils with distinct C-terminal quaternary interface structure compared to fibrils grown in aqueous solutions. Based on our results, we propose a schematic mechanism by which Aβ-lipid interactions drive membrane-associated nucleation processes, providing molecular insights into the early events of fibrillation in biological environments."
https://openalex.org/W4296311735,"Amyloid aggregates of specific proteins constitute important pathological hallmarks in many neurodegenerative diseases, defining neuronal degeneration and disease onset. Recently, increasing numbers of patients show comorbidities and overlaps between multiple neurodegenerative diseases, presenting distinct phenotypes. Such overlaps are often accompanied by colocalizations of more than one amyloid protein, prompting the question of whether direct interactions between different amyloid proteins could generate heterotypic amyloids. To answer this question, we investigated the effect of α-synuclein (αS) on the DNA-binding protein TDP-43 aggregation inspired by their coexistence in pathologies such as Lewy body dementia and limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. We previously showed αS and prion-like C-terminal domain (PrLD) of TDP-43 synergistically interact to generate toxic heterotypic aggregates. Here, we extend these studies to investigate whether αS induces structurally and functionally distinct polymorphs of PrLD aggregates. Using αS-PrLD heterotypic aggregates generated in two different stoichiometric proportions, we show αS can affect PrLD fibril forms. PrLD fibrils show distinctive residue level signatures determined by solid state NMR, dye-binding capability, proteinase K (PK) stability, and thermal stability toward SDS denaturation. Furthremore, by gold nanoparticle labeling and transmission electron microscopy, we show the presence of both αS and PrLD proteins within the same fibrils, confirming the existence of heterotypic amyloid fibrils. We also observe αS and PrLD colocalize in the cytosol of neuroblastoma cells and show that the heterotypic PrLD fibrils selectively induce synaptic dysfunction in primary neurons. These findings establish the existence of heterotypic amyloid and provide a molecular basis for the observed overlap between synucleinopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4296322828,"Maternal delay factors, together with medical factors, have a substantial role in determining maternity outcomes. Although several studies were conducted on delay factors that contribute to maternal death in Ethiopia, the studies were mostly focused either on an individual or at a provincial level factor with a limited number of study participants. In response to this gap, this study is aimed at exploring the magnitude and factors related to delay factors that contribute to maternal death in Ethiopia.The study used maternal death surveillance data collected from different regions of Ethiopia, compiled between 2013 and 2021. A total of 4530 maternal deaths were reviewed during the study period. A Multilevel multinomial logistic regression model was applied to examine factors associated with delays related to maternal death. An adjusted relative risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval was stated and variables with p-values less than 0.05 were declared as significant predictors of maternal delay.Delay three (delay in receiving adequate and appropriate care once reached a health facility) has contributed to 36.3% of maternal deaths followed by delay one (delay in deciding to seek care when experiencing an obstetric emergency) and delay two (delay in reaching to an appropriate obstetric facility) where each of them contributed to 36.1% and 27.6% of maternal deaths respectively. In the multivariate multilevel multinomial model, maternal age, education status, and place of death were among the individual level factors associated with both delay two and delay three. Conversely, marital status and ANC follow-up were associated with delay two alone, while the timing of maternal death was associated with delay three. Residence and type of facility were provincial-level factors linked with both delay two and delay three, while the type of region was related to delay three of maternal death.Both delay one and three have a major contribution to maternal death in Ethiopia. Individual and provincial level factors played an important role in determining delays related to maternal death. Therefore, it is crucial to account for measures that provide emphasis on the area of raising awareness on the utilization of Antenatal care (ANC) service, improving facility readiness to handle obstetrics emergencies, and narrowing down inequality among regions in service provision."
https://openalex.org/W4296323719,"Background The number of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) used in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has increased in recent years. We aimed to compare the drug retention rates and safety of abatacept (ABT) and tocilizumab (TCZ) in elderly patients with RA. Methods A total 125 elderly patients with RA (&gt;65 years) who began therapy with either ABT (n = 47) or TCZ (n = 78) between 2014 and 2021 at our institute were enrolled. We compared the drug retention rate and clinical response at 24 weeks between elderly patients with RA treated with ABT and those treated with TCZ. Adverse events (AEs) and the reasons for drug discontinuation were assessed. Results There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics except for the use of glucocorticoid between the ABT and TCZ groups. There was no significant difference in the drug retention rate between the ABT and TCZ groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the discontinuation rates due to the lack of effectiveness between these two groups. The proportions of the patients archiving low disease activity at 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the two groups. Whereas, the discontinuation rates due to AEs, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), seemed higher in the TCZ group than in the ABT group. In TCZ-treated group, the concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) significantly increased the incidences of AEs leading to the discontinuation of TCZ. Whereas these was no significant impact of concomitant use of MTX on the incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation in ABT-treated group. Conclusions In elderly patients with RA treated with ABT and TCZ, drug retention rates were equivalent between the two groups. There were some differences in safety profiles between ABT and TCZ, and the rates of discontinuation due to AEs, including ILD, seem to be lower with ABT than with TCZ in elderly patients with RA."
https://openalex.org/W4296328984,"In the modern era, researchers have focused a great deal of effort on multimedia security and fast processing to address computational processing time difficulties. Due to limited battery capacity and storage, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) must use energy-efficient processing. In order to overcome the vulnerability of time inefficiency and provide an appropriate degree of security for digital images, this paper proposes a new encryption system based on the bit-plane extraction method, chaos theory, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Using confusion and diffusion processes, chaos theory is used to modify image pixels. In contrast, bit-plane extraction and DWT are employed to reduce the processing time required for encryption. Multiple cyberattack analysis, including noise and cropping attacks, are performed by adding random noise to the ciphertext image in order to determine the proposed encryption scheme’s resistance to such attacks. In addition, a variety of statistical security analyses, including entropy, contrast, energy, correlation, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and mean square error (MSE), are performed to evaluate the security of the proposed encryption system. Moreover, a comparison is made between the statistical security analysis of the proposed encryption scheme and the existing work to demonstrate that the suggested encryption scheme is better to the existing ones."
https://openalex.org/W4296330738,"Extensive gastrointestinal surgery surveillance data in Japan were analyzed to examine the differences in the risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) between laparotomy and laparoscopic abdominal procedures. Surgical procedures investigated in the study were gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, colectomy, rectal resection, and appendectomy. A total of 32,629 patients were included in the study. The study participants were divided into two groups according to the year of surgery, 2003–2009 (first study period) and 2010–2015 (second study period), due to the increase in the number of laparoscopic surgeries in the second study period. The incidence of SSI was stratified by three SSI classifications (superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space SSI). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the risk factors for SSI. The percentage of laparoscopic surgeries performed has increased linearly since 2010. Patients in the second study period were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of SSI risk factors compared with those in the first study period. In addition, the predictive factors changed substantially in most surgical procedures between the two study periods. Wound class ≥ 3 was a ubiquitous risk factor for superficial incisional SSI (SI-SSI) and organ/space SSI (OS-SSI) in both open (laparotomy) and laparoscopic procedures in the first study period. Meanwhile, in the second study period, operative duration was a ubiquitous risk factor in both procedures. The risk factors for SI-SSI differed from those for OS-SSI in the five abdominal surgeries investigated in the study. Periodic examination of risk factors for SSI is recommended in an aging society."
https://openalex.org/W4295941472,"P2X7 receptors are nonselective cation channels that are activated by extracellular ATP and play important roles in inflammation. They differ from other P2X family members by a large intracellular C-terminus that mediates diverse signaling processes that are little understood. A recent cryo-EM study revealed that the C-terminus of the P2X7 receptor forms a unique cytoplasmic ballast domain that possesses a GDP-binding site as well as a dinuclear Zn2+ site. However, the molecular basis for the regulatory function of the ballast domain as well as the interplay between the various ligands remain unclear. Here, we successfully expressed a soluble trimeric P2X7 ballast domain (P2X7BD) and characterized its ligand binding properties using a biophysical approach. We identified calmodulin (CaM)-binding regions within the ballast domain and found that binding of Ca2+-CaM and GDP to P2X7BD have opposite effects on its stability. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments indicate that Ca2+-CaM binding disrupts the trimeric state of P2X7BD. Our results provide a possible framework for the intracellular regulation of the P2X7 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W4296124793,"Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are precursors to sphingolipids, glycerophospholipids, and plant cuticular waxes. In plants, members of a large 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) gene family catalyze the substrate-specific elongation of VLCFAs. Although it is well understood that KCSs have evolved to use diverse substrates, the underlying molecular determinants of their specificity are still unclear. In this study, we exploited the sequence similarity of a KCS gene cluster from Populus trichocarpa to examine the evolution and molecular determinants of KCS substrate specificity. Functional characterization of five members (PtKCS1, 2, 4, 8, 9) in yeast showed divergent product profiles based on VLCFA length, saturation, and position of the double bond. In addition, homology models, rationally designed chimeras, and site-directed mutants were used to identify two key regions (helix-4 and position 277) as being major determinants of substrate specificity. These results were corroborated with chimeras involving a more distantly related KCS, PtCER6 (the poplar ortholog of the Arabidopsis CER6), and used to show that helix-4 is necessary for the modulatory effect of PtCER2-like5 on KCS substrate specificity. The role of position 277 in limiting product length was further tested by substitution with smaller amino acids, which shifted specificity toward longer products. Finally, treatment with KCS inhibitors (K3 herbicides) showed varying inhibitor sensitivities between the duplicated paralogs despite their sequence similarity. Together, this work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms driving substrate diversification in the KCS family and lays the groundwork for tailoring the production of specific VLCFAs."
https://openalex.org/W4296161899,"The establishment of photosynthetic protein complexes during chloroplast development requires the influx of a large number of chloroplast proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome, which is critical for cytosol and chloroplast protein homeostasis and chloroplast development. However, the mechanisms regulating this process are still not well understood in higher plants. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the pale green Arabidopsis pga1-1 mutant, which is defective in chloroplast development and chloroplast protein accumulation. Using genetic and biochemical evidence, we reveal that PGA1 encodes AtFtsH12, a chloroplast envelope-localized protein of the FtsH family proteins. We determined a G703R mutation in the GAD motif of the conserved ATPase domain renders the pga1-1 a viable hypomorphic allele of the essential gene AtFtsH12. In de-etiolation assays, we showed that the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins and the expression of photosynthetic genes were impaired in pga1-1. Using the FNRctp-GFP and pTAC2-GFP reporters, we demonstrated that AtFtsH12 was required for the accumulation of chloroplast proteins in vivo. Interestingly, we identified an increase in expression of the mutant AtFtsH12 gene in pga1-1, suggesting a feedback regulation. Moreover, we found that cytosolic and chloroplast proteostasis responses were triggered in pga1-1. Together, taking advantage of the novel pga1-1 mutant, we demonstrate the function of AtFtsH12 in chloroplast protein homeostasis and chloroplast development."
https://openalex.org/W4296293225,"While muscle and bone adaptations to deconditioning have been widely described, few studies have focused on the tendon enthesis. Our study examined the effects of mechanical loading on the structure and mechanical properties of the Achilles tendon enthesis. We assessed the fibrocartilage surface area, the organization of collagen, the expression of collagen II, the presence of osteoclasts, and the tensile properties of the mouse enthesis both after 14 days of hindlimb suspension (HU) and after a subsequent 6 days of reloading. Although soleus atrophy was severe after HU, calcified fibrocartilage (CFc) was a little affected. In contrast, we observed a decrease in non-calcified fibrocartilage (UFc) surface area, collagen fiber disorganization, modification of morphological characteristics of the fibrocartilage cells, and altered collagen II distribution. Compared to the control group, restoring normal loads increased both UFc surface area and expression of collagen II, and led to a crimp pattern in collagen. Reloading induced an increase in CFc surface area, probably due to the mineralization front advancing toward the tendon. Functionally, unloading resulted in decreased enthesis stiffness and a shift in site of failure from the osteochondral interface to the bone, whereas 6 days of reloading restored the original elastic properties and site of failure. In the context of spaceflight, our results suggest that care must be taken when performing countermeasure exercises both during missions and during the return to Earth."
https://openalex.org/W4296324837,"One of the most straightforward and commonly used chemical modifications of proteins is to react surface amino groups (lysine residues) with activated esters. This chemistry has been used to generate protein-polymer conjugates, many of which are now approved therapeutics. Similar conjugates have also been generated by reacting activated ester atom transfer polymerization initiators with lysine residues to create biomacromolecular initiators for polymerization reactions. The reaction between activated esters and lysine amino groups is rapid and has been consistently described in almost every publication on the topic as a ""random reaction"". A random reaction implies that every accessible lysine amino group on a protein molecule is equally reactive, and as a result, that the reaction is indiscriminate. Nonetheless, the literature contradicts itself by also suggesting that some lysine amino groups are more reactive than others (as a function of pKa, surface accessibility, temperature, and local environment). If the latter assumption is correct, then the outcome of these reactions cannot be random at all, and we should be able to predict the outcome from the structure of the protein. Predicting the non-random outcome of a reaction between surface lysines and reactive esters could transform the speed at which active bioconjugates can be developed and engineered. Herein, we describe a robust integrated tool that predicts the activated ester reactivity of every lysine in a protein, thereby allowing us to calculate the non-random sequence of reaction as a function of reaction conditions. Specifically, we have predicted the intrinsic reactivity of each lysine in multiple proteins with a bromine-functionalised N-hydroxysuccinimide initiator molecule. We have also shown that the model applied to PEGylation. The rules-based analysis has been coupled together in a single Python program that can bypass tedious trial and error experiments usually needed in protein-polymer conjugate design and synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4296327415,"Purpose To compare the ankle plantar-flexor muscle-tendon mechanical behaviour during barefoot and shod forefoot running. Methods Thirteen highly trained forefoot runners performed five overground steady-state running trials (4.5 ± 0.5 m . s -1 ) while barefoot and shod. Three-dimensional kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected and used as inputs for musculoskeletal modelling. Muscle-tendon behaviour of the ankle plantar-flexors (soleus; medial gastrocnemius; and lateral gastrocnemius) were estimated across the stance phase and compared between barefoot and shod running using a two-way multivariate analysis of variance. Results During barefoot running peak muscle-tendon unit (MTU) power generation was 16.5% (p = 0.01) higher compared to shod running. Total positive MTU work was 18.5% (p = 0.002) higher during barefoot running compared to shod running. The total sum of tendon elastic strain energy was 8% (p = 0.036) greater during barefoot compared to shod running, however the relative contribution of tendon and muscle fibres to muscle-tendon unit positive work was not different between conditions. Conclusion Barefoot forefoot running demands greater muscle and tendon work than shod forefoot running, but the relative contribution of tendon strain energy to overall muscle-tendon unit work was not greater."
https://openalex.org/W4296330031,"Designing targeted treatments for breast cancer patients after primary tumor removal is necessary to prevent the occurrence of invasive disease events (IDEs), such as recurrence, metastasis, contralateral and second tumors, over time. However, due to the molecular heterogeneity of this disease, predicting the outcome and efficacy of the adjuvant therapy is challenging. A novel ensemble machine learning classification approach was developed to address the task of producing prognostic predictions of the occurrence of breast cancer IDEs at both 5- and 10-years. The method is based on the concept of voting among multiple models to give a final prediction for each individual patient. Promising results were achieved on a cohort of 529 patients, whose data, related to primary breast cancer, were provided by Istituto Tumori “Giovanni Paolo II” in Bari, Italy. Our proposal greatly improves the performances returned by the baseline original model, i.e., without voting, finally reaching a median AUC value of 77.1% and 76.3% for the IDE prediction at 5-and 10-years, respectively. Finally, the proposed approach allows to promote more intelligible decisions and then a greater acceptability in clinical practice since it returns an explanation of the IDE prediction for each individual patient through the voting procedure."
https://openalex.org/W4296330924,"Breast cancer-related lymphedema is a treatment-related chronic disease that causes great distress and medical burden. Early screening and precautionary measures for lymphedema could improve well-being and decrease medical costs. Herein, we used bioelectrical impedance analysis for early screening of lymphedema. We set up a verifiable standardized subclinical standard to screen subclinical lymphedema in postoperative breast cancer patients using bioelectrical impedance. The first part determined the criteria of subclinical lymphedema. Among the 424 female participants, 127 were healthy women, whereas 297 were postoperative breast cancer survivors. Subclinical standard boundaries were determined by the 95% confidence interval of the healthy women. The screening rate of patients with subclinical lymphedema was inferred by comparing the subclinical standard boundaries and the postoperative patient values. A total of 14.81–20.87% of postoperative breast cancer survivors were identified as patients with subclinical lymphedema. The second part provided the results of the verification test of this subclinical standard. The data of the verification test from 30 healthy women and 30 screened patients met the subclinical standard, and 30 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema verified the utility and feasibility of the subclinical standard. Therefore, this standard could provide a screening tool for early the identification of subclinical breast cancer survivors. Early detection helps implement personal and precise medical precautions for patients with subclinical lymphedema."

https://openalex.org/W4296324749,"The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of science. Although the strength of the association between evolution acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality, religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic students showed significant differences between the two countries, and the gap between them was wider than between Catholics and non-Catholic Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better understanding of attitudes towards evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4296326246,"Effects of high humid weather conditions on photovoltaic (PV) modules were examined in this study, particularly insulation resistance. Three types of tests were conducted which include leakage voltage test, leakage current test, and wet leakage current test. Due to the usual field constraints in the study of insulation resistance, which limited measurements of leakage current, assurance was made that representative sampling were conducted. The study found a high number of modules with low insulation resistance and high leakage voltage values, which can interrupt the PV plant operation. High leakage voltage creates safety hazards issues. About two third of the samples, which showed deep moisture ingress in the modules, could not pass the minimum criterion of IEC 61646 standard for wet insulation resistance testing. The leakage current results showed the same trend as of leakage voltage, proving that leakage voltage test, which is quite easy and economical, can be used to detect such type of problems in field tests. Prolonged humidity conditions of the PV power plant particularly from natural disaster, should be avoided. Efficient drainage system should be supported in and around installations and all other moisture sources should be regularly removed from the plant area to keep proper operation and minimize losses in energy production."
https://openalex.org/W4296330068,"Background In Ethiopia, malaria remains a major public health problem. To eliminate malaria, parasite clearance interventions were implemented in six kebeles (the lowest administrative unit) in the Amhara region. Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria is essential for targeting appropriate parasite clearance interventions to achieve the elimination goal. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal distribution of malaria incidence in the intervention and non-intervention areas. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of community-based malaria in the intervention and non-intervention kebeles between 2013 and 2018 in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. Methods Malaria data from 212 kebeles in eight districts were downloaded from the District Health Information System2 ( DHIS2 ) database. We used Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to investigate seasonal variations; Anselin Local Moran’s I statistical analysis to detect hotspot and cold spot clusters of malaria cases; and a discrete Poisson model using Kulldorff scan statistics to identify statistically significant clusters of malaria cases. Results The result showed that the reduction in the trend of malaria incidence was higher in the intervention areas compared to the non-intervention areas during the study period with a slope of -0.044 (-0.064, -0.023) and -0.038 (-0.051, -0.024), respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The Global Moran’s I statistics detected the presence of malaria clusters (z-score = 12.05; p&lt;0.001); the Anselin Local Moran’s I statistics identified hotspot malaria clusters at 21 locations in Gendawuha and Metema districts. A statistically significant spatial, temporal, and space-time cluster of malaria cases were detected. Most likely type of spatial clusters of malaria cases (LLR = 195501.5; p &lt;0.001) were detected in all kebeles of Gendawuha and Metema districts. The temporal scan statistic identified three peak periods between September 2013 and November 2015 (LLR = 8727.5; p&lt;0.001). Statistically significant most-likely type of space-time clusters of malaria cases (LLR = 97494.3; p&lt;0.001) were detected at 22 locations from June 2014 to November 2016 in Metema district. Conclusion There was a significant decline in malaria incidence in the intervention areas. There were statistically significant spatiotemporal variations of malaria in the study areas. Applying appropriate parasite clearance interventions is highly recommended for the better achievement of the elimination goal. A more rigorous evaluation of the impact of parasite clearance interventions is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4296330629,"Prospective cohort studies suggest that frailty is associated with an increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, but their mechanistic and developmental relations are not fully understood. We investigated whether frailty predicted an increased risk of incident nonfatal and fatal CVD among community-dwelling older adults.A population cohort of 5015 participants aged 55 years and above free of CVD at baseline was followed for up to 10 years. Pre-frailty and frailty were defined as the presence of 1-2 and 3-5 modified Fried criteria (unintentional weight loss, weakness, slow gait speed, exhaustion, and low physical activity), incident CVD events as newly diagnosed registered cases of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and CVD-related mortality (ICD 9: 390 to 459 or ICD-10: I00 to I99). Covariate measures included traditional cardio-metabolic and vascular risk factors, medication therapies, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and blood biomarkers (haemoglobin, albumin, white blood cell counts and creatinine).Pre-frailty and frailty were significantly associated with elevated HR = 1.26 (95%CI: 1.02-1.56) and HR = 1.54 (95%CI:1.00-2.35) of overall CVD, adjusted for cardio-metabolic and vascular risk factors and medication therapies, but not after adjustment for GDS depression and MMSE cognitive impairment. The HR of association between frailty status and both CVD mortality and overall mortality, however, remained significantly elevated after full adjustment for depression, cognitive and blood biomarkers.Frailty was associated with increased risk of CVD morbidity and especially mortality, mediated in parts by traditional cardio-metabolic and vascular risk factors, and co-morbid depression and associated cognitive impairment and chronic inflammation. Given that pre-frailty and frailty are reversible by multi-domain lifestyle and health interventions, there is potential benefits in reducing cardiovascular diseases burden and mortality from interventions targeting pre-frailty and early frailty population."

An ambispective cohort was established from March 2020 to February 2021. From November 2020 to February 2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured on two occasions 14–90 days apart to determine seroprevalence and seroconversion. We used multivariate log-binomial regression to evaluate factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 2,597 HCWs, the cumulative incidence of infection was 35.7%, and seroprevalence was 21.5%. A reduced risk of infection was observed among those aged 35–44 and ≥45 years (adjusted relative risks [aRRs], 0.84 and 0.83, respectively), physicians (aRR, 0.77), those wearing N95 respirators (aRR, 0.82) and working remotely (aRR, 0.74). Being overweight (aRR, 1.18) or obese (aRR, 1.24); being a nurse or nurse assistant (aRR, 1.20); working in the emergency room (aRR, 1.45), general wards (aRR, 1.45), intensive care unit (aRR, 1.34), or COVID-19 areas (aRR, 1.17); and close contact with COVID-19 cases (aRR, 1.47) increased the risk of infection. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study reflects the dynamics of the first year of the pandemic in Bogotá. A high burden of infection calls for strengthening prevention and screening measures for HCWs, focusing especially on those at high risk."

Although Hsp78 has been shown to contribute to proteostasis in elevated temperatures, the biochemical mechanisms underlying this mitochondria-specific thermotolerance are still largely unclear. To identify endogenous chaperone substrate proteins, here, we generated an Hsp78-ATPase mutant with stabilized substrate-binding behavior. We used two stable isotope labeling–based quantitative mass spectrometry approaches to analyze the role of Hsp78 during heat stress–induced mitochondrial protein aggregation and disaggregation on a proteomic level. We first identified the endogenous substrate spectrum of the Hsp78 chaperone, comprising a wide variety of proteins related to metabolic functions including energy production and protein synthesis, as well as other chaperones, indicating its crucial functions in mitochondrial stress resistance. We then compared these interaction data with aggregation and disaggregation processes in mitochondria under heat stress, which revealed specific aggregation-prone protein populations and demonstrated the direct quantitative impact of Hsp78 on stress-dependent protein solubility under different conditions.

Every organism requires specific biochemical processes for the maintenance of the internal protein homeostasis, keeping cellular functions intact and the cell alive.

Also human cells may be subjected to heat stress under certain pathological conditions like fever. These proteo-protective mechanisms are based on the activity of molecular chaperones, representing ATP-dependent enzymes that stabilize misfolded proteins, protecting them from aggregation and support degradation processes (1Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cellular strategies for controlling protein aggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 2Voos W.

Rev. 2012; 76: 115-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). One important group of chaperones with a major role during protein aggregation reactions is the Hsp100 chaperone family. They belong to the AAA+ class of enzymes (ATPase associated with wide variety of cellular activities), many of them involved in molecular remodeling reactions (5Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. et al.Sculpting the proteome with AAA(+) proteases and disassembly machines.Cell. 2004; 119: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Enzymes of a particular subgroup of the Hsp100 family, all relatives of the bacterial ClpB protein, are able to resolve polypeptides from insoluble aggregates and to support their refolding via the Hsp70 chaperone system or their degradation through various ATP-dependent proteases (6Hodson S. Marshall J.J. Burston S.G. Mapping the road to recovery: The ClpB/hsp104 molecular chaperone.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 179: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Mogk A. Kummer E. Bukau B. Cooperation of Hsp70 and Hsp100 chaperone machines in protein disaggregation.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2015; 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ClpB-type chaperones typically form hexameric ring structures that are formed by intermolecular interactions of their two AAA protein domains. It was proposed that the mechanistic basis of the chaperone activity is based on a threading mechanism of the polypeptide chains through the central pore of the ring complex, thereby dissolving any incorrect protein conformations (3Doyle S.M. Genest O. Wickner S. Protein rescue from aggregates by powerful molecular chaperone machines.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Bacterial ClpB was shown to cause thermal hypersensitivity in the respective null-mutant strains, thus ClpB-type chaperones facilitate thermal tolerance to bacteria (8Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Roder D. Langen H. et al.Identification of thermolabile Escherichia coli proteins: Prevention and reversion of aggregation by DnaK and ClpB.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In comparison to other Hsp100 chaperones, ClpB-type proteins do not directly assemble with proteases (9Kirstein J. Molière N. Dougan D.A. Turgay K. Adapting the machine: Adaptor proteins for Hsp100/Clp and AAA+ proteases.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).The problematic nature of heat stress might be even more relevant for mitochondrial proteins as it is assumed that, due to metabolic processes, temperature inside the organelle may be elevated permanently (10Chrétien D. Bénit P. Ha H.H. Keipert S. El-Khoury R. Chang Y.T. et al.Mitochondria are physiologically maintained at close to 50 °C.PLoS Biol. 2018; 16e2003992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The basic biochemical mechanisms of the chaperone enzymes involved in mitochondrial aggregation have been largely established to date, either based on the utilization of artificial reporter proteins or the characterization of the thermal reactivity of single examples of specific proteins. However, for a complete understanding of mitochondrial protein homeostasis under thermal stress conditions, it is fundamental to identify proteins that exhibit less stable folding states and have a tendency to aggregate. Previous experiments exposing human cells to mild heat stress, similar to fever conditions, exhibited an overall quite robust behavior of mitochondrial proteins with only few polypeptides prone to aggregation (11Wilkening A. Rub C. Sylvester M. Voos W. Analysis of heat-induced protein aggregation in human mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 11537-11552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, a study in yeast established a strong effect of elevated temperatures on mitochondrial morphology (12Lewandowska A. Gierszewska M. Marszalek J. Liberek K. Hsp78 chaperone functions in restoration of mitochondrial network following heat stress.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast cells contain two homologs of bacterial Hsp100 family chaperone ClpB, the cytosolic Hsp104 (13Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S. Hsp104 is required for tolerance to many forms of stress.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2357-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial Hsp78 (14Leonhardt S.A. Fearon K. Danese P.N. Mason T.L. HSP78 encodes a yeast mitochondrial heat shock protein in the Clp family of ATP-dependent proteases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As ClpB family members are not present in higher eukaryotes (15Erives A.J. Fassler J.S. Metabolic and chaperone gene loss marks the origin of animals: Evidence for Hsp104 and Hsp78 chaperones sharing mitochondrial enzymes as clients.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0117192Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that other chaperones, in particular mtHsp70 together with its cochaperone Tid1, may take over Hsp100 function in human mitochondria (16Iosefson O. Sharon S. Goloubinoff P. Azem A. Reactivation of protein aggregates by mortalin and Tid1--the human mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone system.Cell Stress Chaperones. 2012; 17: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar to other Hsp100 family members, Hsp78 is an ATP-dependent enzyme, which is upregulated upon thermal stress and most likely forms the typical barrel-shaped hexameric enzyme complexes with a central pore (17Leidhold C. Janowsky B.V. Becker D. Bender T. Voos W. Structure and function of Hsp78, the mitochondrial ClpB homolog.J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Krzewska J. Konopa G. Liberek K. Importance of two ATP-binding sites for oligomerization, ATPase activity and chaperone function of mitochondrial Hsp78 protein.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In analogy to bacterial ClpB, it is assumed also for Hsp78 that substrate polypeptides are mechanically pulled through the pore and are thereby disaggregated for further processes executed by other chaperone systems (19Deville C. Carroni M. Franke K.B. Topf M. Bukau B. Mogk A. et al.Structural pathway of regulated substrate transfer and threading through an Hsp100 disaggregase.Sci. Adv. 2017; 3e1701726Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of the family, Hsp78 contains two AAA-type nucleotide-binding domains with conserved Walker A and Walker B motifs (20Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. Distantly related sequences in the alpha- and beta-subunits of ATP synthase, myosin, kinases and other ATP-requiring enzymes and a common nucleotide binding fold.EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar), which are connected by a coiled-coil middle segment (M domain) that is proposed to provide an interaction with Hsp70-type chaperones, stimulating ATPase function (21Seyffer F. Kummer E. Oguchi Y. Winkler J. Kumar M. Zahn R. et al.Hsp70 proteins bind Hsp100 regulatory M domains to activate AAA+ disaggregase at aggregate surfaces.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Due to its organellar localization, Hsp78 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence but lacks the N-terminal substrate-binding domain of bacterial ClpB (17Leidhold C. Janowsky B.V. Becker D. Bender T. Voos W. Structure and function of Hsp78, the mitochondrial ClpB homolog.J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the N-terminal domain of ClpB plays a role in disaggregation of large aggregates (22Barnett M.E. Nagy M. Kedzierska S. Zolkiewski M. The amino-terminal domain of ClpB supports binding to strongly aggregated proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34940-34945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), while there is little known about the mechanism of substrate interaction in case of the mitochondrial version.Knowledge about the proteome stability inside mitochondria and the client pattern of the Hsp78 chaperone would provide fundamental information for the understanding of pathological patterns related to mitochondrial stress. So far, although some information is available on a whole-cell level (23Wallace E.W. Kear-Scott J.L. Pilipenko E.V. Schwartz M.H. Laskowski P.R. Rojek A.E. et al.Reversible, specific, active aggregates of endogenous proteins assemble upon heat stress.Cell. 2015; 162: 1286-1298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), no comprehensive proteomic study was done in yeast mitochondria with the focus on Hsp78 disaggregation activity after heat stress. In our new study, we constructed a mutant form of Hsp78 with both AAA domains mutated in their Walker B motifs (Hsp78TR). We aimed on generating a stabilized client–chaperone interaction due to an impaired capability to hydrolyze ATP. A similar approach was pursued for bacterial ClpB to identify endogenous substrate proteins (24Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Bukau B. Mogk A. Characterization of a trap mutant of the AAA+ chaperone ClpB.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32608-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We performed a basic biochemical characterization of the mutant enzyme in order to check characteristics like complex formation and ATPase activity, as well as its general protein disaggregation competence. We focused on the identification of Hsp78-interacting proteins under normal and stress conditions, utilizing a quantitative proteomics approach. In a second quantitative mass spectroscopy (qMS) experiment, we demonstrate differences in protein aggregation and aggregate recovery between WT and mutant Hsp78 inside mitochondria on a proteomic level. The analysis revealed that Hsp78 plays a critical role in mitochondrial protein homeostasis with a focus on the reactivation of essential mitochondrial functions like TCA cycle and the respiratory chain but also including protein synthesis and import, after thermal stress exposure.ResultsHsp78TR shows altered ATPase turnover but functional complex formationWe generated an Hsp78 ATPase-deficient mutant protein with both glutamic acids in the Walker B motifs exchanged to glutamine (E216Q/E614Q). Based on observation with a similar mutant form of the bacterial ClpB (24Weibezahn J. Schlieker C. Bukau B. Mogk A. Characterization of a trap mutant of the AAA+ chaperone ClpB.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32608-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we expected that the Hsp78 mutant would exhibit a higher substrate affinity to support the determination of the endogenous polypeptide client spectrum. The E216Q/E614Q mutant protein is abbreviated in the following as Hsp78TR. In order to facilitate protein purification, we added a C-terminal 6× polyhistidine-tag (Fig. 1A). To serve as control for the biochemical properties of the mutant protein, a similar WT version was also generated. Both constructs were inserted in a yeast expression plasmid that allowed expression of the protein in a galactose-inducible fashion to avoid a long-term adaptation to the mutant phenotype. Proteins were expressed in a deletion background lacking the endogenous Hsp78 (hsp78Δ) so only the properties of the expressed proteins were analyzed. To check whether protein levels of WT and mutant proteins were comparable, we performed expression tests with both tagged proteins compared to an untagged WT version (Fig. 1B). Mutant Hsp78TR was expressed slightly weaker than the corresponding WT version although the His-tag had no severe effect on the expression level (Fig. 1B). ATPase activities of the Hsp78 variants were measured using purified protein expressed in Escherichia coli by a coupled enzymatic assay. The assay revealed a strong ATPase impairment of 70% in the Hsp78TR mutant compared to WT (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, a thermotolerance growth assay on nonfermentable carbon source (glycerol) was performed to analyze mitochondrial functionality after heat pretreatment at 42 °C for 60 min and a subsequent thermal shock at an otherwise lethal temperature of 48 °C for 60 min. Under these thermal stress conditions, the dependence of mitochondrial activity on the function of Hsp78 was clearly visible, showing a higher thermal resistance for cells expressing WT protein than mutant Hsp78TR. In contrast, growth on fermentable carbon source (glucose) was similar (Fig. 1D).In order to test complex formation of the expressed mutant Hsp78 under near-native conditions, we performed a blue-native (BN) PAGE with isolated mitochondria expressing the tagged constructs as described above. The majority of the Hsp78 signals were detected at sizes corresponding to a trimeric and hexameric complex, typical for ClpB-type chaperones. In particular with the trap mutant, we additionally detected a small amount of even higher molecular mass signals under ATP regenerating conditions (Fig. 1E, lane 2) that might represent chaperone complexes with bound polypeptide substrates. Moreover, we analyzed the purified proteins by size-exclusion chromatography showing formation of similar complexes with additional smaller and even higher complexes. We also investigated complex stability by its resistance to high salt treatment. We found hsp78TR being stable up to concentrations of 400 mM NaCl in the buffer, while WT protein was dissociating into smaller oligomers (dimers and trimers) (Fig. 1F). We concluded that a higher complex stability for the mutant likely reflected a stronger client-binding capacity. Taken together, we could show that our Hsp78 mutant is basically functional but exhibited a reduced ATPase activity and a stabilized complex formation.Hsp78 is the key mitochondrial disaggregase and binds actively to aggregated proteinsFurthermore, we tested the influence of the novel Hsp78 mutant proteins on the mitochondrial disaggregation reaction. As an aggregation reporter, we utilized the fusion protein b2(107)Δ-DHFRDS that contains a thermo-labile dihydrofolate reductase domain with a matrix-targeting mitochondrial presequence (25von Janowsky B. Major T. Knapp K. Voos W. The disaggregation activity of the mitochondrial ClpB homolog Hsp78 maintains Hsp70 function during heat stress.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This reporter protein was imported in radioactively labeled form into isolated mitochondria, and aggregation was triggered by applying a short heat stress treatment. Afterward, the resolubilization of the reporter was determined by a comparison of the radioactive signal intensities in pellet and soluble fractions. Experiments were conducted for isolated WT mitochondria in presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 2A) or with hsp78Δ mitochondria overexpressing either Hsp78 or Hsp78TR (Fig. 2B). Quantification of the resolubilization efficiencies (Fig. 2C) showed a strongly reduced recovery activity for Hsp78TR with comparable values to knockout or WT control mitochondria without ATP supply. This shows that the inability of the mutant to hydrolyze ATP has a direct effect on its potential to resolubilize aggregated polypeptides.Figure 2Hsp78 supports active disaggregation of heat-induced mitochondrial protein aggregates. A, disaggregation of imported reporter protein. [35S]-labeled b2(107)Δ-DHFRds was imported for 20 min at 25 °C into isolated WT mitochondria. Mitochondria were then resuspended in presence (+ATP) or absence of ATP (-ATP), kept at 25 °C or stressed for 5 min at 42 °C. After recovery at 25 °C for 60 min (R), lysis and ultracentrifugation was performed for all samples. Supernatants and pellet fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Nonimported preproteins were digested by protease K (PK) as indicated (preprotein, p; mature form, m). Asterisk (∗) indicates additional translation product.

Aggregate pellets (AP) were prepared by lysis and centrifugation of heat-treated hsp78Δ mitochondria and combined with supernatant (S) fractions from untreated mitochondria expressing the indicated Hsp78 variants (AP+S).

First, a mix of aggregated mitochondrial polypeptides, serving as potential Hsp78-clients, was produced by a high-temperature treatment of hsp78Δ mitochondria, lysis, and subsequent high-velocity centrifugation obtaining an aggregate pellet (AP) without interference by Hsp78. Second, we generated cleared lysates of Hsp78 and Hsp78TR-expressing mitochondria (S) that were not subjected to any heat treatment as chaperone sources. Next, the mitochondrial lysates containing the Hsp78 variants were incubated with the previously obtained resuspended AP to monitor potential client-binding reactions. Lysates and aggregated proteins were incubated together for 30 min at 30 °C and then centrifuged again. The chaperone detected in the pellet of the second centrifugation therefore reflected the amount bound to aggregated polypeptides. As control for a potential intrinsic aggregation propensity of the mutant Hsp78TR, also the pellets (P) of mitochondrial lysates without any heat treatment were analyzed showing that only a minor amount of the mutated Hsp78TR was sedimented, most likely because the mutations introduced a certain instability of the polypeptide structure. Although the expression of Hsp78 in the cleared lysates was higher than that of Hsp78TR, the experiment showed that Hsp78TR did cosediment stronger with the heat-induced aggregates than Hsp78 (P.AP+S lanes, Fig. 2E). The equally treated control samples in the absence of aggregate did not show any Hsp78 signal in the pellet fractions (P.C) (Fig. 2E), indicating that there was no unspecific aggregation of soluble chaperone species that could lead to false positive results. Taken together, the results indicate that Hsp78 is indeed interacting with aggregated polypeptides and that Hsp78TR mutant has a stronger substrate affinity than the WT protein, consistent with the expected effect of the mutagenesis.Copurification studies reveal a variety of interacting mitochondrial proteinsIn order to perform an unbiased identification of potential client proteins of Hsp78 in a natural organellar environment, we used Hsp78 and mutant Hsp78TR as overexpressed bait proteins in an affinity-based copurification procedure. Three different yeast strains expressing untagged Hsp78 as control, 6xHis-tagged Hsp78 and Hsp78TR mutant were cultured in minimal medium containing light, medium, and heavy nitrogen isotope amino acids, respectively. After isolation of mitochondria, organelles were lysed under native conditions and the Ni-metal affinity purification was performed (Fig. S1A). Samples of the copurification experiments confirmed a successful purification of the Hsp78 proteins, while the outer membrane protein Tom40, serving as internal control for an abundant noninteracting protein, showed no copurification (Fig. S1B), indicating the specificity of our approach. The eluates containing the different Hsp78 forms as well as copurifying polypeptides were combined (Fig. S1C) and subjected to stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry. Proteins identified in the untagged Hsp78 control sample were defined as background. These background abundance values were subtracted from the corresponding signal in the samples containing the respective tagged Hsp78 form as bait to allow a positive identification of potential interacting proteins.In total, 465 proteins were at least once identified by MS in the different copurification experiments (raw qMS abundance values summarized in Table S2) of which 208 proteins exhibited a positive value above background. To correct for the differences in bait (Hsp78) expression levels, the interaction values were normalized to the qMS abundance of the respective Hsp78 variant (Table S3). To assess the specificity of the approach, we sorted all positively identified proteins according to their assigned cellular localization and plotted them based on their relative abundance values (Fig. 3A). Except for the Hsp78 samples at 25 °C, the cofractioned proteins were predominantly mitochondrial, indicating the validity of the approach. In most samples, more than 90% of the cofractionating protein amount were mitochondrial, with the majority located in the matrix compartment, as expected. The comparably large amount of nonmitochondrial proteins cofractioning with Hsp78 at 25 °C (about 45% of the total) likely indicated a high probability of nonspecific interactions that occur after lysis of mitochondria. In this sample, 41% of the total protein amount was represented solely by the proteins Lsp1 and Pil1, both very abundant proteins and components of the eisosome complex that is associated with the cell membrane. Hence, we suggest that these were purification artefacts. Another outlier protein was the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Om45 that was found in all samples in very high amounts, representing at least 25% up to more than 80% of the cofractionating protein amounts. As Om45 is an integral membrane protein of the outer membrane with its bulk part exposed to the cytosol, it is very unlikely that it represents a potential Hsp78 client and was therefore excluded in the subsequent analysis of the quantitative data. In case of the WT form, the proportion of nonmitochondrial proteins decreased strongly during and after the 42 °C heat shock treatment, indicating that under stress conditions, the interaction specificity switched to the real endogenous client polypeptides. Interestingly, the overall binding behavior of the Hsp78TR mutant at 25 °C closely reflected that of the WT form under heat stress. This behavior likely correlates with the expected increased substrate-binding affinity of Hsp78TR already in absence of stress conditions. We also detected some inner membrane proteins binding to both Hsp78 forms with total ratio between 4% and 8%. This suggests that also some inner membrane proteins, likely that are exposed to the matrix compartment, can serve as potential Hsp78 clients. In addition, the specific effects of the different heat treatments already indicate a broad role of Hsp78 concerning mitochondrial thermal tolerance.Figure 3Hsp78 interaction proteome analysis by affinity-tag co-purification.

https://openalex.org/W4296067604,"The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that triggers the activation of proinflammatory cytokines. The adapter ASC and its isoform ASCb mediate inflammasome assembly via self-association and oligomerization with other inflammasome proteins by homotypic interactions of their two identical Death Domains, PYD and CARD, connected by a linker of different length: 23 (ASC) and 4 (ASCb) amino acids long. However, ASC is a more potent inflammasome activator compared to ASCb. Thus, adapter isoforms might be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. As previously reported, ASC’s faster and less polydisperse self-association compared to ASCb points to interdomain flexibility resulting from the linker length as a key factor in inflammasome regulation. To test the influence of linker length in self-association, we have engineered the isoform ASC3X with identical PYD and CARD connected by a 69 amino acid-long linker (i.e., three-times longer than ASC’s linker). Real-time NMR and dynamic light scattering data indicate that ASC3X polymerization is less effective and more polydisperse compared to ASC or ASCb. However, transmission electron micrographs show that ASC3X can polymerize into filaments. Comparative interdomain dynamics of the three isoforms obtained from NMR relaxation data reveal that ASCb tumbles as a rod, whereas the PYD and CARD of ASC and ASC3X tumble independently with marginally higher interdomain flexibility in ASC3X. Altogether, our data suggest that ASC’s linker length is optimized for self-association by allowing enough flexibility to favor intermolecular homotypic interactions but simultaneously keeping both domains sufficiently close for essential participation in filament formation.

Protein structure and dynamics determine function and operating mode. Specifically, interdomain motion plays a critical role in the function of multidomain proteins. The combination of domains is a frequent strategy to naturally develop new functions using minimal resources (1Bashton M. Chothia C. The generation of new protein functions by the combination of domains.Structure. 2007; 15: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Vogel C. Bashton M. Kerrison N.D. Chothia C. Teichmann S.A. Structure, function and evolution of multidomain proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 208-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar); therefore, approximately 80% of eukaryotic proteins are predicted to be composed of multiple domains (3Ma B. Tsai C.-J. Haliloğlu T. Nussinov R. Dynamic allostery: linkers are not merely flexible.Structure. 2011; 19: 907-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The function and three-dimensional structure of multidomain proteins depend on the concerted action of the different domains (4Papaleo E. Saladino G. Lambrughi M. Lindorff-Larsen K. Gervasio F.L. Nussinov R. The role of protein loops and linkers in conformational dynamics and allostery.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6391-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Vishwanath S. Brevern A. G. de Srinivasan N. Same but not alike: structure, flexibility and energetics of domains in multidomain proteins are influenced by the presence of other domains.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2018; 14e1006008Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Stretches of amino acids that connect protein domains (interdomain linkers) may facilitate interdomain communication (6Wriggers W. Chakravarty S. Jennings P.A. Control of protein functional dynamics by peptide linkers.Biopolymers. 2005; 80: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid composition and length, interdomain linkers can adopt transient secondary structures or remain intrinsically disordered, hence conferring different degrees of interdomain flexibility (7Bhaskara R.M. de Brevern A.G. Srinivasan N. Understanding the role of domain–domain linkers in the spatial orientation of domains in multidomain proteins.J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2013; 31: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the length and structure of the linker have a strong impact on domain separation and orientation, leading to changes in the biological function of multidomain proteins. For instance, it has been reported that linker flexibility or lack thereof has a direct influence on catalytic sites, degree of domain separation, interdomain orientation, and coordinated binding in protein–ligand interactions (4Papaleo E. Saladino G. Lambrughi M. Lindorff-Larsen K. Gervasio F.L. Nussinov R. The role of protein loops and linkers in conformational dynamics and allostery.Chem.

Understanding the role of domain–domain linkers in the spatial orientation of domains in multidomain proteins.J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2013; 31: 1467-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In some cases, linker flexibility might be required to grant a greater amount of domain mobility, allowing the different domains to function independently of each another. The critical role of interdomain linkers is evidenced by studies showing that changes such as deletions and mutations directly impact the biological function of multidomain proteins (8Yu C.-H.

Inflammasome assembly is mediated by homotypic interactions between multiple copies of three proteins: sensor, adapter ASC, and the effector procaspase-1 (17Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J.

Death Domain superfamily members typically carry several caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), pyrin domains (PYDs), and death effector domains (DEDs), which are prevalent in the assembly and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic complexes (11Park H.H.

Activation and assembly of the inflammasomes through conserved protein domain families.Apoptosis Int. J. Program Cell Death. 2015; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inflammasome sensors are generally grouped based on their structural features as NLRs (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptors), ALRs (Absent in melanoma 2-like receptors), or pyrin (20Mariathasan S.

The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4358) Google Scholar). NLRP3, from the NLR family, is one of the best well-characterized inflammasome sensors that has been implicated in the development of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (23Seok J.K. Kang H.C. Cho Y.-Y. Lee H.S. Lee J.Y. Therapeutic regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in chronic inflammatory diseases.Arch. Pharm. Res. 2021; 44: 16-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inflammasome activation is a tightly controlled process involving two steps: priming and activation (24Bauernfeind F.G. Horvath G. Stutz A. Alnemri E.S. MacDonald K. Speert D. et al.Cutting edge: NF-κB activating pattern recognition and cytokine receptors license NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating NLRP3 expression.J.

Sci. 2021; 22: 872Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The priming signal triggers toll-like receptors to initiate the nuclear factor NF-kβ pathway that results in the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and procaspase-1 (24Bauernfeind F.G.

Rev. 2015; 265: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, a secondary signal (activation) is required to prompt inflammasome assembly. The secondary signal is triggered by a variety of stimuli such as changes in cellular concentration of K+, increase in intracellular Ca2+, internalization of flagella through endocytosis, pore-forming toxins, and lysosomal disruption, among others (25Sharma M. de Alba E.

Activation and oligomerization of the NLRP3 sensor leads to the recruitment of the adapter ASC and effector procaspase-1 to the inflammasome complex, which ultimately results in procaspase-1 autocleavage into its active form (Fig. 1). Caspase-1 processes proinflammatory cytokines into their active forms, as well as the protein gasdermin-D into its active N-terminus form (29Shi J. Zhao Y. Wang K. Shi X. Wang Y.

Once cleaved, the N-terminus of gasdermin-D self-associates forming large pores in the plasma membrane causing the cell to undergo an inflammatory form of death known as pyroptosis (30Kayagaki N.

ASC functions as a mediator between the sensor and procaspase-1 during inflammasome formation and regulates proper inflammasome assembly (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y.

Enzymol. 2019; 625: 223-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). ASC is a multidomain protein consisting of a N-terminal PYD and a C-terminal CARD connected by a 23 amino acid linker (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ASC exists in four different isoforms: canonical ASC, ASCb, ASCc, and ASCd (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ASC and ASCb are structurally similar, differing only in the length of their linker (23 amino acids versus 4 amino acids, respectively) (13Matsushita K. Takeoka M. Sagara J. Itano N. Kurose Y. Nakamura A. et al.A splice variant of ASC Regulates IL-1 β release and aggregates differently from intact ASC.Med. Inflamm. 2009; 2009: 287387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Bryan N.B.

Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During activation, ASC localizes with the sensor and procaspase-1 forming the inflammasome, which adopts the shape of a micrometer size ring or speck (ASC speck) in the cytosol (36Man S.M. Hopkins L.J. Nugent E. Cox S. Gluck I.M. Tourlomousis P. et al.Inflammasome activation causes dual recruitment of NLRC4 and NLRP3 to the same macromolecular complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Colocalization of ASC with caspase-1 and NLRP3 produces a strong inflammatory response measured by IL-1β release to the extracellular milieu (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, ASCb is not able to assemble into the typical filamentous ASC speck, instead forming irregular filaments. It has been reported that ASCb is a less potent activator of the inflammasome compared to ASC (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ASCc, which retains the intact CARD but not the PYD, acts as an inhibitor of the inflammasome complex, whereas the function of ASCd is currently unknown (14Bryan N.B. Dorfleutner A. Kramer S.J. Yun C. Rojanasakul Y. Stehlik C. Differential splicing of the apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) regulates inflammasomes.J. Inflamm. 2010; 7: 23Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported using real-time NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS) that ASC and ASCb show stark differences in their ability to self-associate (16Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. de Inflammasome regulation by adaptor isoforms, ASC and ASCb, via differential self-assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We also showed using high resolution NMR that the PYD and CARD of both proteins are identical at the structural level. Thus, differences in self-association must be associated with the length of the linker and with interdomain flexibility. Interdomain dynamics of multidomain proteins can be quantified using 15N NMR relaxation techniques to determine local and global dynamics. 15N relaxation studies of the protein backbone provide dynamic information that can be correlated to protein function (37Kleckner I.R. Foster M.P. An introduction to NMR-based approaches for measuring protein dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1814: 942-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Our previous studies on the structure and dynamics of ASC suggest that interdomain flexibility could facilitate protein–protein interactions by enabling the two domains to act semi-independently of each other, thus allowing each domain to sample a large volume of space without interfering with each other’s binding capability (35de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We report herein the study and comparison of the interdomain dynamics of ASC and ASCb using NMR relaxation techniques. Protein rotational correlation times derived from NMR relaxation data indicate that ASCb tumbles as a rod with little interdomain flexibility, whereas ASC domains are semi-independent. Thus, interdomain flexibility correlates with improved self-association observed for ASC relative to ASCb (16Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. de Inflammasome regulation by adaptor isoforms, ASC and ASCb, via differential self-assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 35de Alba E. Structure and interdomain dynamics of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32932-32941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We hypothesize whether a longer linker would confer additional flexibility and thus better interacting capabilities. To test this hypothesis and further understand the influence of linker length on the function of the inflammasome adapter, we generated an artificial isoform, herein referred to as ASC3X, with a significantly increased linker length (69 amino acids, corresponding to three times the length of ASC linker). The rationale behind the use of a 3X linker is to determine the effect of linker length on interdomain dynamics at one extreme scenario contrasting ASCb’s very short linker. We show by NMR that the PYD and CARD of ASC3X retain the six-helix bundle motif common to death domain proteins. However, real-time NMR data of ASC3X self-association indicate a significantly different behavior compared to ASC and ASCb (16Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. de Inflammasome regulation by adaptor isoforms, ASC and ASCb, via differential self-assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, DLS studies reveal higher polydispersity compared to the natural isoforms. Size-exclusion chromatographic analysis of ASC3X shows low-order and high-order oligomers, whereas the low-order species was not observed in ASC and ASCb. We reported previously that both PYD and CARD in ASC are integral part of the filament structure. Here, negative-staining transmission electron microscopy (ns-TEM) studies show that ASC3X also assembles into filament bundles with analogous structural characteristics to those formed by ASC and ASCb. Finally, NMR relaxation techniques reveal that interdomain flexibility in ASC3X is only slightly larger than that of ASC. This modest increase suggests that an intermediate size protein such as ASC2X (46 amino acid-long linker) would not lead to significant changes. Altogether, our results point to a critical role played by ASC’s linker length in fast self-association and close to monodisperse oligomerization that involves both interdomain flexibility but also sufficient proximity of the PYD and CARD to form part of the filament structure. In contrast, ASC3X interdomain flexibility is comparable to that of ASC but the two domains are separated by a very long linker, likely slowing down filament and filament bundle formation. We reported recently that ASC’s faster and less polydisperse self-association compared to ASCb is related to its longer linker (23 and 4 amino acids for ASC and ASCb, respectively) (amino acid sequences shown in Fig. S1) (16Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. de Inflammasome regulation by adaptor isoforms, ASC and ASCb, via differential self-assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To test whether a longer linker would further improve the interacting capabilities of ASC isoforms, we engineered an artificial isoform (ASC3X) sharing identical PYD and CARD domains albeit connected by a linker three-times longer than ASC’s linker (Fig. 2A) (Amino acid sequence shown in Fig. S1). We showed previously that ASC and ASCb share the same six-helix bundle motif in the PYD and CARD (16Diaz-Parga P. de Alba E. de Inflammasome regulation by adaptor isoforms, ASC and ASCb, via differential self-assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2022; 298101566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For an analogous structural comparison between ASC and ASC3X, the NMR chemical shift assignments of ASC3X were inferred from the chemical shifts reported for ASC (38de Alba E. 1H, 15N and 13C backbone and side chain chemical shifts of human ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain).Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and checked by triple-resonance NMR. ASC3X 1H, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts are shown in Table S1 and have been deposited in the Biomagnetic Resonance Bank with ID 51509. The overlay of the amide [1H-15N]-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of ASC and ASC3X shows signal overlap of most amino acids in the PYD and CARD regions, thus indicating structure equivalence (Fig. 2B). The 69 amino acid-long linker in ASC3X results in intense signals in the 1H chemical shift interval between 8.0 and 8.5 ppm, which corresponds to amide 1H chemical shifts of disordered protein regions (39Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. 1H, 13C and 15N random coil NMR chemical shifts of the common amino acids. I. Investigations of nearest-neighbor effects.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Combined amide 1H-15N chemical shift deviations between ASC and ASC3X are small with a SD value lower than 0.025 ppm (Fig. 3A). Larger deviations are expected for residues close to the linker in the amino acid sequence or in the 3D structure. In addition, the 13Cα chemical shift differences from tabulated random coil values indicate the presence of two six-helix bundle motifs for the PYD and CARD of ASC3X as previously observed for ASC (Fig. 3B). ASC and ASCb have a strong tendency to polymerize forming filaments and filament bundles under physiological conditions in accord with their function as inflammasome adapters (14Bryan N.B.

https://openalex.org/W4296126070,"Pentacyclic triterpenoids, including ursolic acid (UA), are bioactive compounds with multiple biological activities involving anti-inflammatory effects. However, the mode of their action on mast cells, key players in the early stages of allergic inflammation, and underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. To better understand the effect of UA on mast cell signaling, here we examined the consequences of short-term treatment of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells with UA. Using IgE-sensitized and antigen- or thapsigargin-activated cells, we found that 15 min exposure to UA inhibited high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI)-mediated degranulation, calcium response, and extracellular calcium uptake. We also found that UA inhibited migration of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells toward antigen but not toward prostaglandin E2 and stem cell factor. Compared to control antigen-activated cells, UA enhanced the production of tumor necrosis factor-α at the mRNA and protein levels. However, secretion of this cytokine was inhibited. Further analysis showed that UA enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the SYK kinase and several other proteins involved in the early stages of FcεRI signaling, even in the absence of antigen activation, but inhibited or reduced their further phosphorylation at later stages. In addition, we show that UA induced changes in the properties of detergent-resistant plasma membrane microdomains and reduced antibody-mediated clustering of the FcεRI and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein Thy-1. Finally, UA inhibited mobility of the FcεRI and cholesterol. These combined data suggest that UA exerts its effects, at least in part, via lipid-centric plasma membrane perturbations, hence affecting the functions of the FcεRI signalosome."
https://openalex.org/W4296290478,"RiPPs (ribosomally-synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides) are a class of pharmaceutically-relevant natural products expressed as precursor peptides before being enzymatically processed into their final functional forms. Bioinformatic methods have illuminated hundreds of thousands of RiPP enzymes in sequence databases and the number of characterized chemical modifications is growing rapidly; however, it remains difficult to functionally express them in a heterologous host. One challenge is peptide stability, which we addressed by designing a RiPP stabilization tag (RST) based on a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) domain that can be fused to the N- or C-terminus of the precursor peptide and proteolytically removed after modification. This is demonstrated to stabilize expression of eight RiPPs representative of diverse phyla. Further, using Escherichia coli for heterologous expression, we identify a common set of media and growth conditions where 24 modifying enzymes, representative of diverse chemistries, are functional. The high success rate and broad applicability of this system facilitates: (i) RiPP discovery through high-throughput “mining” and (ii) artificial combination of enzymes from different pathways to create a desired peptide."
https://openalex.org/W4296322268,"Recommended best practice for resource allocation decisions by governments include a stepwise process guided by economic evidence. However, the use of economic evidence in preventive health decision-making, which often impacts on multiple sectors of government, is under-researched. This study aimed to explore the resource allocation decision-making processes for preventive health interventions in the New South Wales (NSW) Government in Australia, and specifically examined the barriers and facilitators to the use of economic evidence from the perspective of multiple government departments.This mixed methods study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with NSW Treasury representatives (n = 4), a focus group of NSW Ministry of Health representatives (n = 9), and a quantitative questionnaire of all participants. The schedule for the interviews and focus group was based on resource allocation guidance documents from Australian government agencies. Deductive content analysis was undertaken, guided by the Multiple Streams Framework.NSW Treasury participants believed that decision-making processes where economic efficiency was the key guiding principle was the ideal approach. However, the NSW Ministry of Health participants identified that for preventive health decision-making, economic evidence was not used to inform their own choices but was typically only used to convince other agencies of the merits of proposed initiatives when seeking approval. The key barriers to the use of economic evidence were the lack of capacity within the NSW Ministry of Health to understand and undertake economic evaluations; a lack of collaboration between NSW Treasury and preventive health decision-makers within the NSW Ministry of Health; and deficient processes and governance mechanisms that do not facilitate or incentivise effective inter-sectoral decision-making.Institutional structures for resource allocation decision-making regarding preventive health result in processes that contrast with best practice recommendations. The multiple challenges to collaborative decision-making across agencies require organisational change to promote a whole-of-government approach."

The consequence of the increased market requirements is the need to maintain high reliability and efficiency of machines and the production process. The existing methods of production management have proved to be inefficient enough to maintain the company’s competitive position on the market. The Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) concept is one of the tools to maximize equipment efficiency by establishing an optimal relationship between people and machines. The aim of the article is to present the issues related to TPM and demonstrate in the process of empirical research that it serves the purpose of improving efficiency and supports quality in the enterprise. The considerations are based on the thesis that TPM is an economical variant of maintenance and guarantees stability, quality and maximization of production efficiency. The article presents the results of empirical research in an enterprise extracting and processing pre-crudes and gas from Caspian Sea. The data from the SAP management system of the investigated enterprise were used. Based on 146 maintenance orders for 40 devices, a correlation between preventive and corrective maintenance was determined using statistical tools. The main goal of the study was to show whether preventive maintenance reduces the occurrence of failures contributing to the elimination of disturbances in the production process. In addition, we analyzed real cases of equipment failures to answer the question whether the procedure of preventive maintenance of equipment in the studied population would prevent the occurrence of these defects. The empirical study demonstrated a clear impact of Preventive Maintenance on limiting the occurrence of equipment failures, and thus production disturbances."
https://openalex.org/W4296323069,"Background Non-adherence to the maternal continuum of care remains a significant challenge. Though early initiation and continuum of care are recommended for mothers’ and newborns’ well-being, there is a paucity of evidence that clarify this condition in resource-limited settings. This study aimed to assess the level of women’s completion of the maternal continuum of care and factors affecting it in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to November, 2020. Data were collected from 811 women who had a recent history of birth within the past one year. The random and fixed effects were reported using an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. The p-value of 0.05 was used to declare significantly associated factors with women’s completion of the maternal continuum of care. Results The study revealed that 6.9% (95%CI: 5.3–8.9%) of women were retained fully on the continuum of maternal care, while 7.89% of women did not receive any care from the existing healthcare system. Attending secondary and above education (AOR = 3.15; 95%CI: 1.25,7.89), membership in the women’s development army (AOR = 2.91; 95%CI: 1.56,5.44); being insured (AOR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.33,5.01); getting health education (AOR = 2.44; 95%CI: 1.33,4.45); short distance to health facility (AOR = 4.81; 95%CI: 1.55,14.95); and mass-media exposure (AOR = 2.39; 95%CI: 1.11,5.15) were significantly associated with maternal continuum of care. Conclusions The maternal continuum of care is low in rural northwest Ethiopia compared to findings from most resource-limited settings. Therefore, the existing health system should consider multilevel intervention strategies that focus on providing maternal health education, facilitating insurance mechanisms, encouraging women’s participation in health clubs, and ensuring physical accessibility to healthcare facilities to be more effective in improving maternal health services."
https://openalex.org/W4296323868,"Population surveillance in COVID-19 Pandemic is crucial to follow up the pace of disease and its related immunological status. Here we present a cross-sectional study done in Maricá, a seaside town close to the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Three rounds of study sampling, enrolling a total of 1134 subjects, were performed during May to August 2021. Here we show that the number of individuals carrying detectable IgG antibodies and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels were greater in vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated ones, highlighting the importance of vaccination to attain noticeable levels of populational immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we found a decreased incidence of COVID-19 throughout the study, clearly correlated with the level of vaccinated individuals as well as the proportion of individuals with detectable levels of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 and NAb. The observed drop occurred even during the introduction of the Delta variant in Maricá, what suggests that the vaccination slowed down the widespread transmission of this variant. Overall, our data clearly support the use of vaccines to drop the incidence associated to SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4296324834,"Introduction The main objective of this study was to investigate whether systematic medication review conducted by clinical pharmacists can impact clinical outcomes and post-discharge outcomes for patients admitted to the emergency department. Method This parallel group, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted in the emergency department, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03123640 in April 2017. From April 2017 to May 2018, patients ≥18 years were included and randomized (1:1) to intervention- or control group. The control group received standard care from emergency department physicians and nurses. In addition to standard care, the intervention group received systematic medication review including medication reconciliation conducted by pharmacists, during the emergency department stay. The primary outcome was proportion of patients with an unplanned contact with hospital within 12 months from inclusion stay discharge. Results In total, 807 patients were included and randomized, 1:1, to intervention or control group. After excluding 8 patients dying during hospital stay and 10 patients lacking Norwegian personal identification number, the primary analysis comprised 789 patients: 394 intervention group patients and 395 control group patients. Regarding the primary outcome, there was no significant difference in proportion of patients with an unplanned contact with hospital within 12 months after inclusion stay discharge between groups (51.0% of intervention group patients vs. 53.2% of control group patients, p = 0.546). Conclusion As currently designed, emergency department pharmacist-led medication review did not significantly influence clinical- or post-discharge outcomes. This study did, however pinpoint important practical implementations, which can be used to design tailored pharmacist-led interventions and workflow regarding drug-related issues in the emergency department setting."
https://openalex.org/W4296325321,"Caregiver psychological distress (i.e., depression and anxiety) is harmful to both caregiver and patient. Different affect-regulation strategies associated with attachment orientations may impact a caregiver's perception of their caregiving role as a burden, thereby contributing to their psychological distress. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the links among attachment orientations, caregiver burden, and psychological distress in a cardiac context. Participants (N = 181, Mage = 61.79, SD = 10.49; males = 24.7%) were romantic partners of patients with heart disease (i.e., informal caregivers) who completed validated questionnaires. The majority of caregivers had partners with coronary artery disease (n = 127, 70. 2%). 66.3% of caregivers reported low burden, 87.6% reported low levels of depression and 89.9% reported low levels of anxiety. The mean anxious attachment score was 2.74 (SD = 1.37) and the mean avoidant attachment score was 2.95 (SD = 1.26). Four mediation analyses were run using PROCESS macro for IBM SPSS (version 26). Statistical models showed that the relationships between attachment anxiety and psychological distress were mediated by caregiver burden [abanxiety= 0.15, 95% C.I. (0.04, 0.29); abdepression = 0.15, 95% C.I. (0.05, 0.28)] and that attachment avoidance was not a significant covariate (cvanxiety = -0.02, p>0.05; cvdepression = 0.40, p>0.05). The relationships between attachment avoidance and psychological distress were also mediated by caregiver burden [abanxiety = 0.23, 95% C.I. (0.10, 0.42); abdepression = 0.21, 95% C.I. (0.09, 0.37]with attachment anxiety as a significant covariate (cvanxiety = 1.09, p<0.001; cvdepression = 1.09, p<0.001). Interventions for caregivers reporting attachment insecurity and burden should be explored to potentially lessen caregiver distress as they support their partners with heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W4296326199,"Homozygosity for pathogenic variants in the leptin gene leads to congenital leptin deficiency causing severe early-onset obesity. This monogenic form of obesity has mainly been detected in patients from consanguineous families. Prevalence estimates for the general population using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database reported a low frequency of leptin mutations. One in approximately 15 million individuals will be homozygous for a deleterious leptin variant. With the present study, we aimed to extend these findings utilizing the augmented Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v2.1.1 including more than 140,000 samples. In total, 68 non-synonymous and 7 loss-of-function leptin variants were deposited in gnomAD. By predicting functional implications with the help of in silico tools, like SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster2021, the prevalence of hetero- and homozygosity for putatively pathogenic variants (n = 32; pathogenic prediction by at least two tools) in the leptin gene were calculated. Across all populations, the estimated prevalence for heterozygosity for functionally relevant variants was approximately 1:2,100 and 1:17,830,000 for homozygosity. This prevalence deviated between the individual populations. Accordingly, people from East Asia and individuals of mixed ethnicities ('Others') were at greater risk to carry a possibly damaging leptin variant. Generally, this study emphasises the scarcity of pathogenic leptin variants in the general population with varying prevalence for distinct study groups."
https://openalex.org/W4296327334,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health issue, but low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face the greatest burden. Significant differences in neurotrauma outcomes are recognised between LMICs and high-income countries. However, outcome data is not consistently nor reliably recorded in either setting, thus the true burden of TBI cannot be accurately quantified.To explore the specific contextual challenges of, and possible solutions to improve, long-term follow-up following TBI in low-resource settings.A cross-sectional, pragmatic qualitative study, that considered knowledge subjective and reality multiple (i.e. situated within the naturalistic paradigm). Data collection utilised semi-structured interviews, by videoconference and asynchronous e-mail. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's six-stage Reflexive Thematic Analysis.18 neurosurgeons from 13 countries participated in this study, and data analysis gave rise to five themes: Clinical Context: What must we understand?; Perspectives and Definitions: What are we talking about?; Ownership and Beneficiaries: Why do we do it?; Lost to Follow-up: Who misses out and why?; Processes and Procedures: What do we do, or what might we do?The collection of long-term outcome data plays an imperative role in reducing the global burden of neurotrauma. Therefore, this was an exploratory study that examined the contextual challenges associated with long-term follow-up in LMICs. Where technology can contribute to improved neurotrauma surveillance and remote assessment, these must be implemented in a manner that improves patient outcomes, reduces clinical burden on physicians, and does not surpass the comprehension, capabilities, or financial means of the end user. Future research is recommended to investigate patient and family perspectives, the impact on clinical care teams, and the full economic implications of new technologies for follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W4295681664,"Branching morphogenesis is a key process essential for lung and other organ development in which cellular and tissue architecture branch out to maximize surface area. While this process is known to be regulated by differential gene expression of ligands and receptors, how chromatin remodeling regulates this process remains unclear. Znhit1 (zinc finger HIT-type containing 1), acting as a chromatin remodeler, has previously been shown to control the deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z. Here, we demonstrate that Znhit1 also plays an important role in regulating lung branching. Using Znhit1 conditional KO mice, we show that Znhit1 deficiency in the embryonic lung epithelium leads to failure of branching morphogenesis and neonatal lethality, which is accompanied by reduced cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis of the epithelium. The results from the transcriptome and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveal that this is partially regulated by the derepression of Bmp4, encoding bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, which is a direct target of H2A.Z. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of BMP signaling by the protein inhibitor Noggin rescues the lung branching defects of Znhit1 mutants ex vivo. Taken together, our study identifies the critical role of Znhit1/H2A.Z in embryonic lung morphogenesis via the regulation of BMP signaling."

https://openalex.org/W4296164195,"Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen that can utilize chitin as a carbon source, through its ability to produce chitin-degrading enzymes to digest chitin and membrane transporters to transport the degradation products (chitooligosaccharides) into the cells. Further characterization of these proteins is important to understand details of chitin metabolism. Here, we investigate the properties and function of the S. marcescens chitoporin, namely SmChiP, a chitooligosaccharide transporter. We show that SmChiP is a monomeric porin that forms a stable channel in artificial phospholipid membranes, with an average single-channel conductance of 0.5 ± 0.02 nS in 1 M KCl electrolyte. Additionally, we demonstrated that SmChiP allowed the passage of small molecules with a size exclusion limit of <300 Da and exhibited substrate specificity toward chitooligosaccharides, both in membrane and detergent-solubilized forms. We found that SmChiP interacted strongly with chitopentaose (Kd = 23 ± 2.0 μM) and chitohexaose (Kd = 17 ± 0.6 μM) but did not recognize nonchitose oligosaccharides (maltohexaose and cellohexaose). Given that S. marcescens can use chitin as a primary energy source, SmChiP may serve as a target for further development of nutrient-based antimicrobial therapies directed against multidrug antibiotic-resistant S. marcescens infections."

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of MegaShield ® compared with Guardix-SG ® in the prevention of adhesions in patients undergoing bilateral total thyroidectomy. Method We conducted a multicenter trial between October 2018 and March 2020 in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy. The patients were randomly assigned to either the MegaShield ® group or the Guardix-SG ® group. The primary outcome was the esophageal movement using marshmallow six weeks after the surgery and the secondary outcome was the assessed adhesion score. The safety assessment was also evaluated. Results The study included 70 patients each in the MegaShield ® and control (Guardix-SG ® ) groups. Baseline clinical characteristics, the mean score of marshmallow esophagography, and the sum of adhesion scores were not statistically different between the two groups. Inferiority test demonstrated that the efficacy of MegaShield ® is not inferior to that of Guardix-SG®. There were no device-related complications in both groups. Conclusion The efficacy and safety of MegaShield ® were not inferior than those of Guardix-SG ® . MegaShield ® demonstrated the potential of ADM as a potential future anti-adhesive agent.

https://openalex.org/W4296311741,"Under pathophysiologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer, the endolysosomal cysteine protease legumain was found to translocate to the cytosol, the nucleus, and the extracellular space. These noncanonical localizations demand for a tight regulation of legumain activity, which is in part conferred by protein inhibitors. While there is a significant body of knowledge on the interaction of human legumain with endogenous cystatins, only little is known on its regulation by fungal mycocypins. Mycocypins are characterized by (i) versatile, plastic surface loops allowing them to inhibit different classes of enzymes and (ii) a high resistance toward extremes of pH and temperature. These properties make mycocypins attractive starting points for biotechnological and medical applications. In this study, we show that mycocypins utilize an adaptable reactive center loop to target the active site of legumain in a substrate-like manner. The interaction was further stabilized by variable, isoform-specific exosites, converting the substrate recognition into inhibition. Additionally, we found that selected mycocypins were capable of covalent complex formation with legumain by forming a disulfide bond to the active site cysteine. Furthermore, our inhibition studies with other clan CD proteases suggested that mycocypins may serve as broad-spectrum inhibitors of clan CD proteases. Our studies uncovered the potential of mycocypins as a new scaffold for drug development, providing the basis for the design of specific legumain inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4296323156,"A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to uncover the principles governing how the brain interacts with the external environment. However, assumptions about external stimuli fundamentally constrain current computational models. We show in silico that unknown external stimulation can produce error in the estimated linear time-invariant dynamical system. To address these limitations, we propose an approach to retrieve the external (unknown) input parameters and demonstrate that the estimated system parameters during external input quiescence uncover spatiotemporal profiles of external inputs over external stimulation periods more accurately. Finally, we unveil the expected (and unexpected) sensory and task-related extra-cortical input profiles using functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 96 subjects (Human Connectome Project) during the resting-state and task scans. This dynamical systems model of the brain offers information on the structure and dimensionality of the BOLD signal's external drivers and shines a light on the likely external sources contributing to the BOLD signal's non-stationarity. Our findings show the role of exogenous inputs in the BOLD dynamics and highlight the importance of accounting for external inputs to unravel the brain's time-varying functional dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4296323743,"Thrombosis is common in subjects suffering from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer. Hypercoagulation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of thrombosis. Therefore, the inactivation of thrombin, the key enzyme in coagulation, is tightly regulated via antithrombin (AT). AT deficiency is related to thrombosis and cardiovascular death. In this study we investigated the association between AT levels and mortality, in particularly cardiovascular-related and cancer-related death in the general population.We studied the association of AT levels and mortality in a prospective cohort sampled from the general Italian population (n = 19,676). AT levels were measured in the baseline samples, and mortality was recorded during a median follow-up period of 8.2 years. Cox regression was performed to investigate the association of all-cause, CVD-related and cancer-related mortality with variations in AT levels.In total, 989 subjects died during follow-up, of which 373 subjects of CVD and 353 of cancer-related causes. Cox analysis revealed that, after adjustment for age, sex, current smoking, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, history of cardiovascular disease, history of cancer, vitamin K antagonists, antiplatelet medication, heparin and oral contraceptives AT levels were not associated with all-cause mortality (HRQ1vsQ5: 0.92, 95% CI:0.74-1.15). Interestingly, the risk of CVD-related mortality was reduced in subjects with low AT levels compared to subjects with higher AT levels, after adjustment for age and sex and other confounders did not change the association (HRQ1vsQ5: 0.64, 95% CI:0.44-0.91). Moreover, low AT levels were associated with increased cancer mortality in a fully adjusted model (HRQ1vsQ2-5: 1.26, 95% CI:0.88-1.81).Low AT levels are associated to a lower risk of fatal cardiovascular events in the general population, regardless of age, sex and medication use. In contrast, low AT levels are associated with lower cancer survival. For the first time we show that AT levels lower than the normal range in the general population, even before the development or diagnosis of cancer, are associated with an elevated risk of cancer death."
https://openalex.org/W4296324477,"The rapid expansion of the Slavic speakers in the second half of the first millennium CE remains a controversial topic in archaeology, and academic passions on the issue have long run high. Currently, there are three main hypotheses for this expansion. The aim of this paper was to test the so-called “hybrid hypothesis,” which states that the movement of people, cultural diffusion and language diffusion all occurred simultaneously. For this purpose, we examined an archaeological Deep Data set with a machine learning method termed time series clustering and with emerging hot spot analysis. The latter required two archaeology-specific modifications: The archaeological trend map and the multiscale emerging hot spot analysis. As a result, we were able to detect two migrations in the Eastern Alps between c. 500 and c. 700 CE. Based on the convergence of evidence from archaeology, linguistics, and population genetics, we have identified the migrants as Alpine Slavs, i.e., people who spoke Slavic and shared specific common ancestry."
https://openalex.org/W4296324579,"Tobacco use remains a global public health challenge. While studies report that smoking cessation reduces the risk of cancer and other NCDs, evidence is scarce in African region on socio-economic determinants of smoking cessation behavior. This study examined the socio-economic differentials of smoking cessation behavior among smokers in four African countries.The study was conducted through secondary analysis of Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) data from four African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania). Smoking cessation behavior was assessed using two variables i) intention to quit smoking in next 12 months and ii) previous quit attempts made within 12 months preceding the survey. The weighted percentages for intention to quit smoking and previous quit attempts were computed. The adjusted odds ratios were computed using multinomial logistic regression to identify the association between socio-economic factors and smoking cessation behavior.Across the four countries studied, the previous quit attempts among smokers were in the range of 39.6% to 53.7%. Around 7.6% to 15.8% of the smokers tried to quit with an assistance. In Ethiopia over 76.5% of current smokers reported no intention to quit in next 12 months after survey, whereas the same was 50.4% in Senegal. While country specific differences were observed, females, those belonging to the poorest wealth index, unemployed and those without any formal education reported significantly lower odds of previous quit attempts or having an intention to quit smoking.The socio-economic vulnerabilities were found to compromise smoking cessation behavior among the smokers in countries studied. Targeted interventions, adherence to smokefree laws, and provision of cessation support are essential to improve quit rates and mitigate tobacco risks among socio-economically vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W4296324734,"Introduction Medication errors are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The p harmacist-led I T-based i n tervention to reduce c linically important medication er rors (PINCER) has demonstrated improvements in primary care medication safety, and whilst now the subject of national roll-out its optimal and sustainable use across health contexts has not been fully explored. As part of a qualitative evaluation we aimed to identify factors influencing successful adoption, embedding and sustainable use of PINCER across primary care settings in England, UK. Methods Semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews, including follow-up interviews and an online survey were conducted with professionals knowledgeable of PINCER. Interview recruitment targeted four early adopter regions; the survey was distributed nationally. Initial data analysis was inductive, followed by analysis using a coding framework. A deductive matrix approach was taken to map the framework to the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Themes were then identified. Results Fifty participants were interviewed, 18 participated in a follow-up interview. Eighty-one general practices and three Clinical Commissioning Groups completed the survey. Four themes were identified and interpreted within the relevant NPT construct: Awareness &amp; Perceptions (Coherence), Receptivity to PINCER (Cognitive Participation), Engagement [Collective Action] and Reflections &amp; Adaptations (Reflexive Monitoring). Variability was identified in how PINCER awareness was raised and how staff worked to operationalise the intervention. Facilitators for use included stakeholder investment, favourable evidence, inclusion in policy, incentives, fit with individual and organisational goals and positive experiences. Barriers included lack of understanding, capacity concerns, operational difficulties and the impact of COVID-19. System changes such as adding alerts on clinical systems were indicative of embedding and continued use. Conclusions The NPT helped understand motives behind engagement and the barriers and facilitators towards sustainable use. Optimising troubleshooting support and encouraging establishments to adopt an inclusive approach to intervention adoption and utilisation could help accelerate uptake and help establish ongoing sustainable use."
https://openalex.org/W4296324883,"When aerial cameras get aerial remote sensing images, the defocus will occur because of reasons such as air pressure, temperature and ground elevation changes, resulting in different image sharpness of continual aerial remote sensing images. Nowadays, the rapidly developing feature matching algorithm will rapidly reduce the registration rate between images with different image sharpness. Therefore, in order to enable aerial cameras to get image sharpness parameters according to the locations of aerial image feature points with inconsistent sharpness, this paper proposes a feature matching algorithm between aerial images with different sharpness by using DEM data and multiple constraints. In this paper, the feature matching range is extended according to the modified aerial imaging model and the nonlinear soft margin support vector machine. Then the relative moving speed and its variation of the feature points in the image are obtained by using the extended L-k optical flow, and finally the epipolar geometric constraint is introduced. To locate the feature points is obtained under multiple constraints, there is no need to calculate the feature point descriptors, and some mismatched point pairs are corrected, which improves the matching efficiency and precision. The experimental results show the feature matching precision of this algorithm is more than 90%, and the running time and matching precision can meet various application needs of aerial cameras."
https://openalex.org/W4296327328,"There is currently no test for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that is non-invasive and sufficiently sensitive and specific. Clinicians must therefore diagnose PID clinically, ruling out medical emergencies and conducting pelvic examinations where possible. While guidelines state that clinicians should be prepared to over-diagnose PID, it remains an under-diagnosed condition, with severe reproductive health impacts when left untreated. This research is the first to consider the perspectives of end-users on the development of a diagnostic test for PID.Semi-structured live video feed online (Zoom) interviews were conducted with 11 clinicians and nine women (aged 18-30 years) in Australia to understand how a diagnostic test might be used, and what characteristics a test would need for it to be acceptable to clinicians and young women. Participants were recruited via researcher and university student networks. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to identify key themes relating to the acceptability and characteristics of a diagnostic test for PID.Seven general practitioners, four clinicians working in sexual health clinics, and nine young women (aged 21-27 years) were interviewed. Clinicians were aged between 31-58 years and were predominantly female. Clinicians recognised that the development of an accurate test to diagnose PID would be valuable to themselves and other clinicians, particularly those who lack experience diagnosing PID, and those working in certain settings, including emergency departments. They discussed how they might use a test to enhance their clinical assessment but highlighted that it would not replace clinical judgement. Clinicians also considered how a test would impact the patient experience and time to treatment, emphasising that it should be minimally invasive and have a quick turnaround time. Young women said a test would be acceptable if endorsed by a trustworthy clinician.PID remains a challenging diagnosis. Development of a minimally invasive and sufficiently accurate diagnostic test would be acceptable to young women and benefit some clinicians, although no test would completely replace an experienced clinician's judgement in making a PID diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4296327345,"Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable reading DNA molecules hundreds of kilobases in length and motivate development of DNA amplification methods capable of producing long amplicons. In vivo, DNA replication is performed not by a single polymerase enzyme, but multiprotein complexes called replisomes. Here, we investigate strand-displacement amplification reactions using the T7 replisome, a macromolecular complex of a helicase, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, and a DNA polymerase. The T7 replisome may initiate processive DNA synthesis from DNA nicks, and the reaction of a 48 kilobase linear double stranded DNA substrate with the T7 replisome and nicking endonucleases is shown to produce discrete DNA amplicons. To gain a mechanistic understanding of this reaction, we utilized Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology. Sequence analysis of the amplicons revealed chimeric DNA reads and uncovered a connection between template switching and polymerase exonuclease activity. Nanopore sequencing provides insight to guide the further development of isothermal amplification methods for long DNA, and our results highlight the need for high-specificity, high-turnover nicking endonucleases to initiate DNA amplification without thermal denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W4296330207,"Background The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide; black patients have an increased risk of developing CKD and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) at significantly higher rates than other races. Methods A cross sectional study was carried out on black patients with CKD attending the kidney outpatient clinic at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) in South Africa, between September 2019 to March 2020 . Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the ongoing kidney outpatient clinic records and interviews, and were filled in a questionnaire. Patients provided blood and urine for laboratory investigations as standard of care, and data were descriptively and inferentially entered into REDcap and analysed using STATA version 17. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify demographic and clinical variables associated with advanced CKD. Results A total of 312 black patients with CKD were enrolled in the study with a median age of 58 (IQR 46–67) years; 58% patients had advanced CKD, 31.5% of whom had grossly increased proteinuria, 96.7% had hypertension, 38.7% had diabetes mellitus and 38.1% had both hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In patients with advanced CKD, the median age was 61 (IQR 51–69) years, eGFR 33 (30–39) mL/min/1.73 m 2 , serum bicarbonate 22 (IQR 20–24), haemoglobin 12.9 (IQR 11.5–14.0) g/dl and serum uric acid 0.43 (IQR 0.37–0.53). The prevalence of metabolic acidosis was 62.4%, anemia 46.4% and gout 30.9% among those with advanced CKD, while the prevalence of metabolic acidosis and anaemia was 46.6% and 25.9% respectively in those with early CKD. Variables with higher odds for advanced CKD after multivariable logistic regression analysis were hypertension (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2–9.2, P = 0.020), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1–3.3, P = 0.024), severe proteinuria (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.9–6.5, P = 0.001), angina (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2–5.1, P = 0.008), anaemia (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7–4.9, P = 0.001), hyperuricemia (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.1, P = 0.001), and metabolic acidosis (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2–3.1, P = 0.005). Other associations with advanced CKD were loss of spouse (widow/widower) (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4–7.4, P = 0.006), low transferrin (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1–5.1, P = 0.028), hyperkalemia (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2–24.1, P = 0.029), use of allopurinol (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.3, P = 0.005) and doxazosin (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.1, P = 0.006). Conclusion Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were strongly associated with advanced CKD, suggesting a need for primary and secondary population-based prevention measures. Metabolic acidosis, anemia with low transferrin levels, hyperuricemia and hyperkalemia were highly prevalent in our patients, including those with early CKD, and they were strongly associated with advanced CKD, requiring clinicians and dietitians to be proactive in supporting the needs of CKD patients in meeting their daily dietary requirements towards preventing and slowing the progression of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4296330872,"Purpose This single-center, prospective cohort study aimed to compare the patient-reported outcomes one year after injury between limb salvage and amputation and to elucidate whether amputation contributes to early recovery of functionality and quality of life. Methods We included 47 limbs of 45 patients with severe open fractures of the lower limb and categorized them into limb salvage and amputation groups. Data on patient-reported outcomes one year after injury were obtained from the Database of Orthopaedic Trauma by the Japanese Society for Fracture Repair at our center. Patients’ limbs were evaluated using the lower extremity functional scale and Short-Form 8. Early recovery was assessed using functionality and quality-of-life questionnaires. Results Of the 47 limbs, 34 limbs of 34 patients were salvaged, and 13 limbs of 11 patients were amputated. Significant differences were noted between the limb salvage and amputation groups in terms of the lower extremity functional scale scores (mean: 49.5 vs. 33.1, P = 0.025) and scores for the mental health component (mean: 48.7 vs. 38.7, P = 0.003), role–physical component (mean: 42.2 vs. 33.3, P = 0.026), and mental component summary (mean: 48.2 vs. 41.3, P = 0.042) of the Short-Form 8. The limb salvage group had better scores than the amputation group. Conclusions As reconstruction technology has advanced and limb salvaging has become possible, the focus of studies should now be based on the perspective of “how the patient feels;” hence, we believe that the results of this study, which is based on patient-reported outcomes, are meaningful."

We aimed to evaluate the digestive tolerability and acceptability of Fibersol-2 in healthy and diarrheal children, as well as improvement in stool consistencies in young diarrheal children. Methods Sixty children of either sex, aged 1–3 years having four groups (healthy children/low dose, healthy children/high dose, children with diarrhea/low dose and children with diarrhea/high dose) were enrolled into this exploratory study between 1 st August to 23 rd October 2017. Two presumptive doses, low (2.5g) and high (5g), twice daily with 50 ml drinking water for seven days were the interventions. Outcomes were to observe the development of possible abdominal symptoms, such as pain, distension, rumbling, and bloating during the intervention and post-intervention periods in healthy and diarrheal children as well as improvement in stool consistencies in diarrheal children. Results Among the diarrheal children, the median (IQR) duration of resolution of diarrhea was 3.9 (2.9, 5.1) days vs. 3.5 (2.0, 8.0) days, p = 0.885; in low dose and high dose groups, respectively. Significant difference was observed in terms of abdominal pain (27% vs. 7%, p = 0.038) and distension (40% vs. 0%, p&lt;0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the pre-intervention period. We also observed significant difference in respect of abdominal distension (23% vs. 0%, p = 0.011), rumbling (27% vs. 0%, p = 0.005) and bloating (43% vs. 3%, p = 0.001) in diarrheal children, compared to healthy children during the intervention period. However, no significant difference was observed in relation to abdominal pain (p = 0.347) and distension (p = 0.165) during the pre-intervention period, compared to the intervention period in diarrheal children. Moreover, no significant difference was observed during the post-intervention period for the diarrheal and healthy children. Conclusion Fibersol-2 was found to be well tolerated in healthy and diarrheal children aged 1–3 years. Trial registration This study was registered as part of a randomized trial at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03565393 . The authors confirmed that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention were registered."
https://openalex.org/W4296330998,"Several genetic studies have shown that the small GTPase Rab29 is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). It has also been shown that overexpression of Rab29 increases the activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, a protein kinase often mutated in familial PD, although the mechanism underlying this activation remains unclear. Here, we employed biochemical analyses to characterize the localization of Rab29 and found that, unlike general Rab proteins, Rab29 is predominantly fractionated into the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation. We also found that Rab29 is resistant to extraction from membranes by GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) in vitro. Furthermore, Rab29 failed to interact with GDIs, and its membrane localization was not affected by the knockout of GDIs in cells. We show that the knockout of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase decreased the hydrophobicity of Rab29, suggesting that Rab29 is geranylgeranylated at its carboxyl terminus as is with typical Rab proteins. Notably, we demonstrated that membrane-bound Rab29 retains some hydrophilicity, indicating that mechanisms other than geranylgeranylation might also be involved in the membrane localization of Rab29. Taken together, these findings uncover the atypical nature of Rab29 among Rab proteins, which will provide important clues for understanding how Rab29 is involved in the molecular pathomechanism of PD.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the major neurodegenerative diseases of adult-onset. The cardinal symptoms of PD include resting tremor, muscle rigidity, akinesia, and postural instability caused by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain. The majority of PD is sporadic, and genome-wide association studies have identified loci associated with the development of sporadic PD. One of the loci associated with an increased risk of developing PD is PARK16, which contains three genes, namely NUCKS1, RAB29, and SLC41A1 (1Satake W. Nakabayashi Y. Mizuta I. Hirota Y. Ito C.

It has been well established that Rab proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking. After ribosomal translation, partially folded Rab polypeptides are recognized by Rab escort proteins (REPs) for proper folding and then recruited to Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase) to be geranylgeranylated at the carboxyl-terminal cysteine(s) (16Seabra M.C.

Once geranylgeranylated, Rab proteins are inserted into lipid bilayers due to the hydrophobicity conferred by geranylgeranylation. Rab proteins then begin to cycle between donor and acceptor membranes by changing their bound guanine nucleotide with the help of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Upon reaching acceptor membranes, Rab proteins interact with GAPs and are inactivated by hydrolyzing bound GTP to GDP. Inactivated Rab proteins are extracted from membranes to the cytosol by GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) and recycled back to donor membranes, where GEFs exist for activation (21Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. GDI1 encodes a GDP dissociation inhibitor that plays an essential role in the yeast secretory pathway.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although GEFs and GAPs for Rab29 are not known, it has been documented in the literature that Rab29 is atypical in that it does not form a complex with GDIs in contrast to typical Rab proteins including Rab8 and that it fails to undergo efficient geranylgeranylation in a cell-free experiment (22Gomez R.C. Wawro P. Lis P. Alessi D.R. Pfeffer S.R. Membrane association but not identity is required for LRRK2 activation and phosphorylation of Rab GTPases.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 4157-4170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a detailed analysis of the membrane localization and geranylgeranylation of Rab29 has not been performed.In this report, we comprehensively examined the membrane localization, the hydrophobicity, and the GDI-dependent membrane extraction of Rab29 in vitro and in cultured cells in comparison with other Rab proteins. We herein show that Rab29 is hydrophobic to a similar extent as other Rab proteins but is not extracted from membranes by GDIs and exists predominantly as a membrane-bound form, unlike other Rab proteins. We also show that the membrane-bound Rab29 retains some hydrophilicity, suggesting that other mechanisms besides geranylgeranylation are involved in the membrane localization of Rab29.ResultsEndogenous Rab29 is predominantly fractionated into the membrane fractionTo biochemically examine whether endogenous Rab29 exists in the cytosol or membrane fraction, we fractionated homogenates prepared from mouse primary glial cells into the cytosol and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. Rab10 was mainly fractionated into the cytosol fraction, whereas Rab29 was predominantly fractionated into the membrane fraction (Fig. 1A). The amount of endogenous Rab29 in the cytosol fraction was significantly lower than that of endogenous Rab10 (Fig. 1B). We then fractionated various rat tissue homogenates by ultracentrifugation. The majority of endogenous Rab29 was fractionated into the membrane fraction in all tissues, while Rab10 was mainly fractionated into the cytosol fraction (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, fractionation of A549 cells showed that while Rab10 and Rab12 are mostly cytosolic, a larger part of Rab29 was fractionated into the membrane than into the cytosol, approximately at the ratio of 2 to 1 (Fig. 1E). These results suggested that although the degree varies among cell lines and organs, endogenous Rab29 is mainly fractionated into the membrane fraction, unlike Rab10.As newly synthesized Rab proteins are first captured by REPs in the cytosol before undergoing lipid modification, Rab29 existing in the cytosol might represent newly synthesized molecules. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with cycloheximide for 48 h to block protein synthesis and deplete the newly synthesized molecules. The cells were then fractionated by ultracentrifugation. However, the ratio of cytosolic to total Rab proteins was not significantly changed upon treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. S1), suggesting that Rab29 existing in the cytosol does not represent newly synthesized molecules and that the “age” of Rab10 and Rab29 has no significant effect on their membrane association.Rab29 is resistant to the extraction from membranes by GDIsRab proteins are thought to exist in the cytosol as a result of their extraction from the membrane by GDIs. Since Rab29 mainly resided in the membrane fraction, we hypothesized that Rab29 cannot be extracted by GDIs. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted an in vitro extraction assay using purified GDI1/2 protein. The membrane fraction of HEK293A cells containing endogenous Rab proteins was incubated with recombinant GDI1/2, followed by ultracentrifugation to separate the supernatants containing Rab–GDI complexes (“extracted” fraction) from the precipitates containing the membranes (“not-extracted” fraction). The degree of Rab extraction was quantified as the proportion of Rab in the extracted fraction out of total Rab. In the case of typical Rab proteins which do get extracted by GDIs, adding more recombinant GDI would increase the amount of Rab in the extracted fraction. Indeed, endogenous Rab10 was extracted from the membrane in GDI1- and GDI2-dependent manners (Fig. 2). On the other hand, endogenous Rab29 was not extracted by GDIs (Fig. 2).Figure 2In vitro extraction assay of Rab10 and Rab29 by GDI1/2. Membrane fractions of HEK293A cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentration of recombinant 6His-SUMO1-GDI1 or 6His-SUMO1-GDI2, and the assay mixtures were fractionated into the extracted and not-extracted fractions by ultracentrifugation.

A and C, representative immunoblots of three independent experiments with the indicated antibodies are shown.

However, simple GDI1/2 double KO (DKO) cells could not be generated, presumably because lacking both GDIs severely impaired cell survival and proliferation (data not shown). Therefore, we first generated U2OS cells that inducibly express V5-GDI1 in the presence of doxycycline (dox). Then, while maintaining the expression of exogenous V5-GDI1, we performed the KO of GDI1 by using a guide RNA (gRNA) pair that targets an intron, thereby specifically knocking out the endogenous GDI1 gene. Simultaneously, GDI2 was knocked out using a gRNA pair that targets an exon. Single cell cloning was conducted, and four clones (#2, #4, #5, and #28) were generated. It was confirmed that dox withdrawal resulted in the transient DKO of GDI1/2 (Fig. 3A).Figure 3The effect of GDI1/2 knockout on the localization of Rab proteins.

Four monoclonal GDI1/2 DKO cells (#2, #4, #5, and #28) were established. GAPDH was used as a loading control (bottom panel). B, post-nuclear supernatants of parental U2OS cells as well as U2OS GDI1/2 DKO cells treated without (−) or with (+) dox to induce the expression of V5-GDI1 were fractionated into the cytosol (C) and membrane (M) fractions.

In WT cells, Rab3A, Rab5, Rab7A, Rab8A/B, Rab10, Rab12, and Rab32 were mainly found in the cytosolic fraction, whereas Rab29 was predominantly fractionated into the membrane fraction as described in Figure 1 (Fig. 3C). In GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells without dox, the amount of Rab proteins in the cytosolic fraction was decreased in most of the Rab proteins (Fig. 3, B and D). The cytosolic localization of these Rab proteins was rescued with the dox-inducible expression of V5-GDI1, indicating that the change in localization in GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells was an on-target effect. On the other hand, Rab29 was found mainly in the membrane fraction in GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells as well as in WT cells, suggesting that while typical Rab proteins exist in the cytosol in a GDI-dependent manner, Rab29 exists in the membrane in a manner that is not affected by the presence of GDIs.We also examined the subcellular localization of Rab10 and Rab29 in GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells by immunocytochemistry (Fig. S2). In the absence of dox, HA-Rab10 stably overexpressed in GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells appeared to form large aggregates in the perinuclear region with some cytosolic diffuse staining, whereas, in the presence of dox, vesicular structures presumably corresponding to active Rab10 on vesicles became evident. In contrast, HA-Rab29 stably overexpressed in GDI1/2 DKO #5 cells appeared to be punctate or vesicular in the perinuclear region and reticular in the cytosol regardless of the presence or absence of dox. This might correspond to the membranes of the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), respectively. These results are consistent with the biochemical fractionation by ultracentrifugation. We also investigated the interaction of Rab29 and GDIs in cells. HEK293A cells were transiently overexpressed with either HA-Rab10 (WT) or HA-Rab29 (WT), and immunoprecipitation by an HA antibody was performed. GDI1/2 was coimmunoprecipitated with HA-Rab10 but not with HA-Rab29 (Fig. 4).Figure 4Coimmunoprecipitation of GDI1/2 with Rab proteins. HA-empty, HA-Rab10, HA-Rab29 WT, HA-Rab29 C202S+C203S (CCSS), or HA-Rab29 D63A were overexpressed in HEK293A cells and immunoprecipitated using HA-agarose beads (the bottom panel). Coimmunoprecipitation of GDI1 and GDI2 with the overexpressed HA-tagged proteins was examined by immunoblotting (the second panel from the bottom). Equal levels of the expression of GDI1/2 as well as HA-tagged proteins were shown in the top panels (input). GDI, GDP-dissociation inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together, these results show that Rab29 is not extracted from the membrane by GDIs not only in vitro but also under the physiological condition of cells.Rab29 is hydrophobic to a similar extent as other Rab proteinsIn considering why Rab29 is not regulated by GDIs, we focused on the geranylgeranylation which typically occurs at the carboxyl terminus of Rab proteins. It has been shown that geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins significantly enhances their binding to, and extraction by, GDIs (23Pylypenko O. Rak A. Durek T. Kushnir S. Dursina B.E. Thomae N.H. et al.Structure of doubly prenylated Ypt1:GDI complex and the mechanism of GDI-mediated Rab recycling.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that Rab29 may be deficient in binding to GDIs due to the lack of geranylgeranylation.Geranylgeranylation is the most hydrophobic modification among prenylation. Conjugation of one or two geranylgeranyl moieties on the carboxyl-terminal cysteine(s) greatly increases the hydrophobicity of the modified Rab proteins. Lysing cells with Triton X-114 (TX114) on ice and subsequently warming the cleared lysate up to 37 °C leads to the phase separation of TX114, resulting in the aqueous phase and the TX114 (detergent) phase. Here, in general, hydrophilic proteins are found in the aqueous phase, whereas proteins with hydrophobic modifications such as geranylgeranylation are found in the detergent phase (24Bordier C. Phase separation of integral membrane proteins in triton X-114 solution.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized this method to investigate the geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins. HEK293A cells or U2OS cells were subjected to phase separation using TX114. The validity of this separation was confirmed from the result showing that a hydrophilic protein DJ-1 was fractionated into the aqueous phase, while the transferrin receptor, which is a transmembrane protein modified by palmitoylation and is therefore hydrophobic, was fractionated into the detergent phase (25Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. Covalent binding of fatty acid to the transferrin receptor in cultured human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4715-4718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Rab29 was mostly fractionated into the detergent phase, as were the cases with other Rab proteins (Fig. 5). These results indicated that endogenous Rab29 is modified by a highly hydrophobic lipid modification.Figure 5Fractionation of various Rab proteins depending on their hydrophobicity using Triton X-114. HEK293A and U2OS cells were lysed in a buffer containing Triton X-114. Cleared lysates (input) were heated to 37 °C to cause phase separation of Triton X-114. The aqueous and detergent phases were subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. DJ-1 was used as a representative hydrophilic protein, whereas the transferrin receptor was used as a hydrophobic protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, HEK293A cells were fractionated by ultracentrifugation, and the resulting membrane fraction and cytosol fraction were separately subjected to TX114 phase separation. Both Rab10 in the cytosol fraction and Rab10 in the membrane fraction were found in the detergent phase (Fig. 6, A and B). This result indicated that Rab10 in the cytosol fraction is as hydrophobic as that in the membrane fraction, presumably existing as a complex with GDIs. On the other hand, endogenous Rab29 resided mainly in the membrane fraction, and approximately 60% of this was fractionated into the detergent phase, while about 40% was found in the aqueous phase (Fig. 6, A and B). From this result, it was suggested that the majority of membrane-bound Rab29 is hydrophobic due to lipid modification, while there is a minor pool of hydrophilic Rab29 in the membrane fraction. Similar results were obtained with A549 cells (Fig. 6, C and D), where we found that approximately 60% of Rab29 in the membrane fraction is hydrophilic.Figure 6Fractionation of Rab proteins in the cytosol and membrane fractions using Triton X-114. Post-nuclear supernatants of HEK293A (A and B), A549 (C and D), and HEK293A cells overexpressing HA-Rab10 or HA-Rab29 (E and F) were fractionated into the cytosol and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. Each fraction was further fractionated using Triton X-114 into aqueous and detergent phases and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. DJ-1 was used as a representative hydrophilic protein, whereas the transferrin receptor was used as a hydrophobic protein. Note that, for this experiment, equal amounts of protein, not volumes of the samples, were loaded for the cytosol and membrane fractions. The amount of Rab10 in the membrane fraction seems larger than that in the cytosol fraction, but this does not reflect the actual ratio of the amounts of Rab10 in the cytosol and membrane fractions as shown in Figure 1. Also, note that the transferrin receptor was observed both in the aqueous and detergent phases only when the cells were first mechanically homogenized for the fractionation by ultracentrifugation (A, C, and E). The band intensity of the Rab proteins was quantified, and the ratio of Rab in the detergent phase to total Rab (aqueous + detergent) was calculated.

The p-values and statistical tests used are summarized in Table S1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then overexpressed HA-Rab10 or HA-Rab29 in HEK293A cells and subjected the cells to fractionation by ultracentrifugation, followed by TX114 phase separation of each fraction. As for Rab10 and Rab29 in the membrane fraction, the fractionation pattern was similar to that of endogenous Rab10 and Rab29, with Rab10 almost completely being fractionated into the detergent phase, while a small part of Rab29 was found in the aqueous phase (Fig. 6, E and F). On the other hand, overexpressed Rab10 and Rab29 in the cytosol fraction showed a fractionation pattern different from that of endogenous ones. Specifically, overexpressed Rab10 in the cytosol was mainly found in the aqueous phase (Fig. 6, E and F). Also, when overexpressed, Rab29 is partially fractionated into the cytosol, and this was almost entirely fractionated into the aqueous phase (Fig. 6, E and F). As transient overexpression of proteins in cultured cells tends to produce immature proteins, we speculate that, upon overexpression, a larger portion of the Rab proteins lacking lipid modification came to exist in the cytosol fraction, leading to the increased hydrophilic rate in the TX114 phase separation.Evidence of geranylgeranylation of Rab29It has been well described that Rab proteins are geranylgeranylated on one or two cysteine residue(s), which is a prerequisite for their membrane localization. We further set out to investigate whether the lipid modification conferring hydrophobicity on Rab29 is geranylgeranylation as is with other Rab proteins. This was achieved by several methods.The geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins is catalyzed by an enzyme complex, RabGGTase, which transfers the geranylgeranyl moiety from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) to the thiol group of a cysteine residue. GGPP is synthesized from mevalonate, which is an intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, through the synthesis of geranyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate (Fig. 7A). Therefore, treating cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which synthesizes mevalonate, results in the depletion of GGPP and farnesyl diphosphate, leadin"
