https://openalex.org/W81397916,"The cleavage into large fragments of both normal and immune rabbit y-globulin by cysteine-activated papain was reported by Porter (1, 2). In the case of immune y-globulin the antibody activity was found associated with two of the three principal fragments isolated. Nisonoff et al. (3) have carried out the cleavage of rabbit immune y-globulin into similar fragments with a sedimentation constant of about 3.5 S by peptic digestion followed by reduction with cysteine. In this paper we describe an analogous two-stage cleavage of normal and immune rabbit -y-globulin by the consecutive action of a water-insoluble papain derivative and a reducing agent. The water-insoluble papain was prepared by a procedure similar to that employed by Bar-Eli and Katchalski (4) for the preparation of a water-insoluble trypsin. The use of water-insoluble papain permitted the termination of proteolysis at any given instant by filtration or centrifugation. The insoluble papain derivative, which could easily be freed of reducing agents, was found to act on proteins in the presence of negligible amounts of cysteine. It was thus possible to carry out the digestion of y-globulin without reduction of substrate or products. Immune y-globulin, hydrolyzed briefly under such conditions, although rendered susceptible to fragmentation by reduction, showed no alteration in its rate of sedimentation or in its ability to precipitate antigen. Antigen-antibody precipitates containing the papain-treated antibody dissolved on reduction to yield soluble complexes between antigen and fragments of antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2094699963,Phagocytosis of lipid-rich platelets by monocytes and the transformation of such cells into lipophages containing fat was observed in human thrombi. The lipophages are similar to lipophages in atherosclerotic plaques. This observation supports the idea that some atherosclerotic plaques are organized mural thrombi.

The relative rate of loss in desert reptiles, rodents, and anurans is about 1:10:40. The maximum rate of water loss is about 2.5 and 5 times the basal rate, respectively, in pocket mice and sand lizards. The ratio of loss from lung to loss from skin is about 84:16 in kangaroo rats and 70:30 in rattlesnakes."

A high concentration of acridine orange inactivates infectious nucleic acid even in darkness, while a mixture of nucleic acid with a low concentration of the dye must be exposed to visible light prior to inoculation for inactivation to occur."

https://openalex.org/W2026683398,THE cells of Escherichia coli contain a protease during their whole growth-cycle. This protease is inactive in living cells and its presence can be demonstrated only after disruption of the cell structure1. In connexion with the study of the function of this protease in the metabolism of intracellular proteins its localization in the cell was also investigated.

The carrageenans, although isolated from different sources, had essentially the same thermographic characteristics. Of the other compounds studied, such closely related polysaccharides as amylose and amylopectin showed widely different thermal behavior. Thermographic replication was highly satisfactory."

https://openalex.org/W2049950716,"INCREASING the number of donor groups in chelating agents can give rise to the formation of more stable chelates1–3 and, therefore, to a higher mobilization of internally deposited trivalent and other metal ions of higher valency. This has been demonstrated with ethylenediamine - NNN′N′ - tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriamine-NNN′N′N″-penta-acetic acid (DTPA)4,5, that is, with chelating agents with 6 and 8 donor groups respectively. For this reason extension of this work to the 10-dentate triethylenetetraamine - NNN′ N′ N″ N‴ - hexaacetic acid (TTHA) seemed to be worth while."

Experiments were, therefore, planned to find out if Fleming's bacteriolysin prevented the rise of temperature caused by exogenous and endogenous pyrogens in rabbits."
