https://openalex.org/W2094517081,"Limiting mTORC1 The mTORC1 protein kinase complex has important functions linking metabolism to cell growth and its functions are disrupted in common diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Bar-Peled et al. (p. 1100 ; see the Perspective by Shaw ) discovered regulatory components that help turn down signaling by mTORC1 when cells are deprived of amino acids. Two complexes of proteins, GATOR1 and GATOR2, have opposite effects on activity and cellular localization of mTORC1. Components of the GATOR1 complex negatively regulate mTORC1 and appear to function as tumor supressors. Cancers with loss of GATOR1 function may be particularly amenable to therapeutic strategies that limit activity of mTORC1."

However, large-area graphene films produced by means of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are polycrystalline and thus contain grain boundaries that can potentially weaken the material. We combined structural characterization by means of transmission electron microscopy with nanoindentation in order to study the mechanical properties of CVD-graphene films with different grain sizes. We show that the elastic stiffness of CVD-graphene is identical to that of pristine graphene if postprocessing steps avoid damage or rippling. Its strength is only slightly reduced despite the existence of grain boundaries. Indentation tests directly on grain boundaries confirm that they are almost as strong as pristine. Graphene films consisting entirely of well-stitched grain boundaries can retain ultrahigh strength, which is critical for a large variety of applications, such as flexible electronics and strengthening components."

In practice, however, this versatility is largely limited to products featuring a single stereocenter that accounts for the dissymmetry. Krautwald et al. (p. 1065 ; see the Perspective by Schindler and Jacobsen ) now report a pair of chiral catalysts—an iridium complex and an amine—that operate in concert to facilitate carbon-carbon bond formation, while retaining independent stereoselectivity toward their respective sides of the bond."

A data set was compiled that consisted of &gt;9000 seeds measured in 22 populations over a large area of Atlantic rainforest, including seven areas where large-seed dispersers (toucans, cracids, and large cotingas) were extinct and 15 areas where they are still common."

Milde et al. (p. 1076 ) studied the destruction of a skyrmion lattice with varying magnetic fields by imaging the surface magnetic structure. Magnetic force microscopy revealed a pairwise merging of skyrmions on the surface. Furthermore, in the bulk, a hedgehog-like spin structure with the properties of the elusive magnetic monopole was needed to ""zip"" together the corresponding skyrmion lines."

Williams et al. (p. 1068 , see the Perspective by Jerolmack ) report the detection of sedimentary conglomerates (pebbles mixed with sand and turned to rock) at Gale crater. The rounding of the rocks suggests abrasion of the pebbles as they were transported by flowing water several kilometers or more from their source."
https://openalex.org/W2100451067,"Observations by the Mars Science Laboratory Mast Camera (Mastcam) in Gale crater reveal isolated outcrops of cemented pebbles (2 to 40 millimeters in diameter) and sand grains with textures typical of fluvial sedimentary conglomerates. Rounded pebbles in the conglomerates indicate substantial fluvial abrasion. ChemCam emission spectra at one outcrop show a predominantly feldspathic composition, consistent with minimal aqueous alteration of sediments. Sediment was mobilized in ancient water flows that likely exceeded the threshold conditions (depth 0.03 to 0.9 meter, average velocity 0.20 to 0.75 meter per second) required to transport the pebbles. Climate conditions at the time sediment was transported must have differed substantially from the cold, hyper-arid modern environment to permit aqueous flows across several kilometers."

https://openalex.org/W2145579024,"Kinetochore Targeting Chromosomes must be segregated accurately during cell division. This is facilitated by the attachment of mitotic spindle microtubules to the kinetochore at the chromosomal centromere. The centromere is marked with the histone H3 variant CenH3 (CENP-A in human), and CENP-C forms part of the inner kinetochore. Kato et al. (p. 1110 ) used structural biology, biochemistry, and mutagenesis to show that CENP-C recognizes CENP-A chromatin via several different interactions. The CENP-C ""central domain"" makes close contact with the acidic patch of histones H2A/H2B, and the highly conserved ""CENP-C motif"" senses both the acidic patch and recognizes the hydrophobicity of the otherwise nonconserved CenH3 tail, supporting a conserved mechanism of centromere targeting by the kinetochore."
https://openalex.org/W2118400269,"One of the most frequently quoted ecosystem services of seagrass meadows is their value for coastal protection. Many studies emphasize the role of above-ground shoots in attenuating waves, enhancing sedimentation and preventing erosion. This raises the question if short-leaved, low density (grazed) seagrass meadows with most of their biomass in belowground tissues can also stabilize sediments. We examined this by combining manipulative field experiments and wave measurements along a typical tropical reef flat where green turtles intensively graze upon the seagrass canopy. We experimentally manipulated wave energy and grazing intensity along a transect perpendicular to the beach, and compared sediment bed level change between vegetated and experimentally created bare plots at three distances from the beach. Our experiments showed that i) even the short-leaved, low-biomass and heavily-grazed seagrass vegetation reduced wave-induced sediment erosion up to threefold, and ii) that erosion was a function of location along the vegetated reef flat. Where other studies stress the importance of the seagrass canopy for shoreline protection, our study on open, low-biomass and heavily grazed seagrass beds strongly suggests that belowground biomass also has a major effect on the immobilization of sediment. These results imply that, compared to shallow unvegetated nearshore reef flats, the presence of a short, low-biomass seagrass meadow maintains a higher bed level, attenuating waves before reaching the beach and hence lowering beach erosion rates. We propose that the sole use of aboveground biomass as a proxy for valuing coastal protection services should be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W1984100788,"Perennial plants live for more than 1 year and flower only after an extended vegetative phase. We used Arabis alpina, a perennial relative of annual Arabidopsis thaliana, to study how increasing age and exposure to winter cold (vernalization) coordinate to establish competence to flower. We show that the APETALA2 transcription factor, a target of microRNA miR172, prevents flowering before vernalization. Additionally, miR156 levels decline as A. alpina ages, causing increased production of SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE) transcription factors and ensuring that flowering occurs in response to cold. The age at which plants respond to vernalization can be altered by manipulating miR156 levels. Although miR156 and miR172 levels are uncoupled in A. alpina, miR156 abundance represents the timer controlling age-dependent flowering responses to cold."
https://openalex.org/W2124503501,"Allergic contact dermatitis is a common skin disease associated with inflammation and persistent pruritus. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in skin-innervating sensory neurons mediate acute inflammatory and pruritic responses following exogenous stimulation and may contribute to allergic responses. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPA1, but not TRPV1, inhibited skin edema, keratinocyte hyperplasia, nerve growth, leukocyte infiltration, and antihistamine-resistant scratching behavior in mice exposed to the haptens, oxazolone and urushiol, the contact allergen of poison ivy. Hapten-challenged skin of TRPA1-deficient mice contained diminished levels of inflammatory cytokines, nerve growth factor, and endogenous pruritogens, such as substance P (SP) and serotonin. TRPA1-deficient sensory neurons were defective in SP signaling, and SP-induced scratching behavior was abolished in Trpa1–/– mice. SP receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant inhibited both hapten-induced cutaneous inflammation and scratching behavior. These findings support a central role for TRPA1 and SP in the integration of immune and neuronal mechanisms leading to chronic inflammatory responses and pruritus associated with contact dermatitis.—Liu, B., Escalera, J., Balakrishna, S., Fan, L., Caceres, A.

https://openalex.org/W2154256736,"TB Control Programmes rely on passive case-finding to detect cases. TB notification remains low in Ethiopia despite major expansion of health services. Poor rural communities face many barriers to service access.A community-based intervention package was implemented in Sidama zone, Ethiopia. The package included advocacy, training, engaging stakeholders and communities and active case-finding by female Health Extension Workers (HEWs) at village level. HEWs conducted house-to-house visits, identified individuals with a cough for two or more weeks, with or without other symptoms, collected sputum, prepared smears and supervised treatment. Supervisors transported smears for microscopy, started treatment, screened contacts and initiated Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for children. Outcomes were compared with the pre-implementation period and a control zone. Qualitative research was conducted to understand community and provider perceptions and experiences. HEWs screened 49,857 symptomatic individuals (60% women) from October 2010 to December 2011. 2,262 (4·5%) had smear-positive TB (53% women). Case notification increased from 64 to 127/100,000 population/year resulting in 5,090 PTB+ and 7,071 cases of all forms of TB. Of 8,005 contacts visited, 1,949 were symptomatic, 1,290 symptomatic were tested and 69 diagnosed with TB. 1,080 children received IPT. Treatment success for smear-positive TB increased from 77% to 93% and treatment default decreased from 11% to 3%. Service users and providers found the intervention package highly acceptable.Community-based interventions made TB diagnostic and treatment services more accessible to the poor, women, elderly and children, doubling the notification rate and improving treatment outcome. This approach could improve TB diagnosis and treatment in other high burden settings."
https://openalex.org/W2104668127,"Evidence suggests that flavonoid-rich foods are capable of inducing improvements in memory and cognition in animals and humans. However, there is a lack of clarity concerning whether flavonoids are the causal agents in inducing such behavioral responses. Here we show that supplementation with pure anthocyanins or pure flavanols for 6 weeks, at levels similar to that found in blueberry (2% w/w), results in an enhancement of spatial memory in 18 month old rats. Pure flavanols and pure anthocyanins were observed to induce significant improvements in spatial working memory (p = 0.002 and p = 0.006 respectively), to a similar extent to that following blueberry supplementation (p = 0.002). These behavioral changes were paralleled by increases in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (R = 0.46, p<0.01), suggesting a common mechanism for the enhancement of memory. However, unlike protein levels of BDNF, the regional enhancement of BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus appeared to be predominantly enhanced by anthocyanins. Our data support the claim that flavonoids are likely causal agents in mediating the cognitive effects of flavonoid-rich foods."
https://openalex.org/W2160307012,"Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., Convolvulaceae) counts among the most widely cultivated staple crops worldwide, yet the origins of its domestication remain unclear. This hexaploid species could have had either an autopolyploid origin, from the diploid I. trifida, or an allopolyploid origin, involving genomes of I. trifida and I. triloba. We generated molecular genetic data for a broad sample of cultivated sweet potatoes and its diploid and polyploid wild relatives, for noncoding chloroplast and nuclear ITS sequences, and nuclear SSRs. Our data did not support an allopolyploid origin for I. batatas, nor any contribution of I. triloba in the genome of domesticated sweet potato. I. trifida and I. batatas are closely related although they do not share haplotypes. Our data support an autopolyploid origin of sweet potato from the ancestor it shares with I. trifida, which might be similar to currently observed tetraploid wild Ipomoea accessions. Two I. batatas chloroplast lineages were identified. They show more divergence with each other than either does with I. trifida. We thus propose that cultivated I. batatas have multiple origins, and evolved from at least two distinct autopolyploidization events in polymorphic wild populations of a single progenitor species. Secondary contact between sweet potatoes domesticated in Central America and in South America, from differentiated wild I. batatas populations, would have led to the introgression of chloroplast haplotypes of each lineage into nuclear backgrounds of the other, and to a reduced divergence between nuclear gene pools as compared with chloroplast haplotypes."

We examined the potential relationship between food insecurity and all-cause mortality among HIV-positive injection drug users (IDU) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) across British Columbia (BC).Cross-sectional measurement of food security status was taken at participant ART initiation. Participants were prospectively followed from June 1998 to September 2011 within the fully subsidized ART program. Cox proportional hazard models were used to ascertain the association between food insecurity and mortality, controlling for potential confounders.Among 254 IDU, 181 (71.3%) were food insecure and 108 (42.5%) were hungry. After 13.3 years of median follow-up, 105 (41.3%) participants died. In multivariate analyses, food insecurity remained significantly associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.07-3.53), after adjusting for potential confounders.HIV-positive IDU reporting food insecurity were almost twice as likely to die, compared to food secure IDU. Further research is required to understand how and why food insecurity is associated with excess mortality in this population. Public health organizations should evaluate the possible role of food supplementation and socio-structural supports for IDU within harm reduction and HIV treatment programs."
https://openalex.org/W2074499097,"Information theory is a powerful tool to express principles to drive autonomous systems because it is domain invariant and allows for an intuitive interpretation. This paper studies the use of the predictive information (PI), also called excess entropy or effective measure complexity, of the sensorimotor process as a driving force to generate behavior. We study nonlinear and nonstationary systems and introduce the time-local predicting information (TiPI) which allows us to derive exact results together with explicit update rules for the parameters of the controller in the dynamical systems framework. In this way the information principle, formulated at the level of behavior, is translated to the dynamics of the synapses. We underpin our results with a number of case studies with high-dimensional robotic systems. We show the spontaneous cooperativity in a complex physical system with decentralized control. Moreover, a jointly controlled humanoid robot develops a high behavioral variety depending on its physics and the environment it is dynamically embedded into. The behavior can be decomposed into a succession of low-dimensional modes that increasingly explore the behavior space. This is a promising way to avoid the curse of dimensionality which hinders learning systems to scale well."
https://openalex.org/W2088086306,"Background Although thrombocytopenia is a hematological disorder commonly reported in malarial patients, its mechanisms are still poorly understood, with only a few studies focusing on the role of platelets phagocytosis. Methods and Findings Thirty-five malaria vivax patients and eight healthy volunteers (HV) were enrolled in the study. Among vivax malaria patients, thrombocytopenia (<150,000 platelets/µL) was found in 62.9% (22/35). Mean platelet volume (MPV) was higher in thrombocytopenic patients as compared to non- thrombocytopenic patients (p = 0.017) and a negative correlation was found between platelet count and MPV (r = −0.483; p = 0.003). Platelets from HV or patients were labeled with 5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate (CMFDA), incubated with human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and platelet phagocytosis index was analyzed by flow cytometry. The phagocytosis index was higher in thrombocytopenic patients compared to non-thrombocytopenic patients (p = 0.042) and HV (p = 0.048). A negative correlation was observed between platelet count and phagocytosis index (r = −0.402; p = 0.016). Platelet activation was assessed measuring the expression of P-selectin (CD62-P) in platelets’ surface by flow cytometry. No significant difference was found in the expression of P-selectin between thrombocytopenic patients and HV (p = 0.092). After evaluating the cytokine profile (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-17) in the patients’ sera, levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ were elevated in malaria patients compared to HV. Moreover, IL-6 and IL-10 values were higher in thrombocytopenic patients than non-thrombocytopenic ones (p = 0.044 and p = 0.017, respectively. In contrast, TNF-α levels were not different between the three groups, but a positive correlation was found between TNF-α and phagocytosis index (r = −0.305; p = 0.037). Conclusion/Significance Collectively, our findings indicate that platelet phagocytosis may contribute to thrombocytopenia found in vivax malaria. Finally, we believe that this study opens new avenues to explore the mechanisms involved in platelet dysfunction, commonly found in vivax malaria patients."

https://openalex.org/W2028386769,"Human Rhinovirus (HRV) is associated with acute exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. In healthy individuals, innate viral recognition pathways trigger release of molecules with direct anti-viral activities and pro-inflammatory mediators which recruit immune cells to support viral clearance. Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) have critical roles in the establishment of neutrophilic inflammation, which is commonly seen in airways viral infection and thought to be detrimental in respiratory disease. We therefore investigated the roles of these molecules in HRV infection of primary human epithelial cells. We found that all three cytokines were released from infected epithelia. Release of these cytokines was not dependent on cell death, and only IL-1β and IL-18 release was dependent on caspase-1 catalytic activity. Blockade of IL-1 but not IL-18 signaling inhibited up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators and neutrophil chemoattractants but had no effect on virus induced production of interferons and interferon-inducible genes, measured at both mRNA and protein level. Similar level of virus mRNA was detected with and without IL-1RI blockade. Hence IL-1 signaling, potentially involving both IL-1β and IL-1α, downstream of viral recognition plays a key role in induction of pro-inflammatory signals and potentially in recruitment and activation of immune cells in response to viral infection instigated by the epithelial cells, whilst not participating in direct anti-viral responses."

https://openalex.org/W2118133665,"Aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion (ALVAL) has been used to describe the histological lesion associated with metal-on-metal (M-M) bearings. We tested the hypothesis that the lymphoid aggregates, associated with ALVAL lesions resemble tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). Histopathological changes were examined in the periprosthetic tissue of 62 M-M hip replacements requiring revision surgery, with particular emphasis on the characteristics and pattern of the lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry were used to study the classical features of TLOs in cases where large organized lymphoid follicles were present. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were undertaken to detect localisation of implant derived ions/particles within the samples. Based on type of lymphocytic infiltrates, three different categories were recognised; diffuse aggregates (51%), T cell aggregates (20%), and organised lymphoid aggregates (29%). Further investigation of tissues with organised lymphoid aggregates showed that these tissues recapitulate many of the features of TLOs with T cells and B cells organised into discrete areas, the presence of follicular dendritic cells, acquisition of high endothelial venule like phenotype by blood vessels, expression of lymphoid chemokines and the presence of plasma cells. Co-localisation of implant-derived metals with lymphoid aggregates was observed. These findings suggest that in addition to the well described general foreign body reaction mediated by macrophages and a T cell mediated type IV hypersensitivity response, an under-recognized immunological reaction to metal wear debris involving B cells and the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs occurs in a distinct subset of patients with M-M implants."

By employing microfluidic biochip technology, we have been able to separate these two processes and study the secretion pathways.Adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) cultured in a microfluidic system was investigated under perfusion conditions with an adipogenic medium or an adipogenic medium supplemented with supernatant from differentiating ASCs (conditioned medium). Conditioned medium increased adipogenic differentiation compared to adipogenic medium with respect to accumulation of lipid-filled vacuoles and gene expression of key adipogenic markers (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, PPARγ, LPL and adiponectin). The positive effects of conditioned medium were observed early in the differentiation process.Using different cell densities and microfluidic perfusion cell cultures to suppress the effects of cell-released factors, we have demonstrated the significant role played by auto- or paracrine signaling in adipocyte differentiation. The cell-released factor(s) were shown to act in the recruitment phase of the differentiation process."
https://openalex.org/W2018383629,"A large number of pathophysiological mechanisms are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which represent a new class of posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. To date, little is known about their role in oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease of unknown etiology which is being discussed as a potentially premalignant condition of oropharyngeal cancer. The aim of the present investigation was to assess the pathophysiological impact of miRNAs and to determine regulatory miRNA networks which are directly linked to potentially disease-associated target transcripts in OLP.Native tissue samples were collected from the oral mucosa of seven patients with OLP. The control group was composed of native tissue from elective oral surgery. The mRNA profiling was performed using the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Array while miRNA profiling was performed using the microRNA Galaxy Array. Subsequent validation of initial results was carried out using TaqMan real time PCR.We identified 24 differentially regulated miRNA and 2,694 regulated transcripts. Linking the miRNAs to their potential targets we found 11 potential miRNA-mRNA pairs, of which several are functionally related to premalignant as well as to inflammatory events.Our data shows miRNA associated with transcripts which are regulated when comparing OLP patients with healthy control individuals. This suggests that miRNAs may potentially regulate disease-relevant transcripts, proposing the concept of therapeutic interventions based on miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2034147787,"Biofilm-related infections can develop everywhere in the human body and are rarely cleared by the host immune system. Moreover, biofilms are often tolerant to antimicrobials, due to a combination of inherent properties of bacteria in their adhering, biofilm mode of growth and poor physical penetration of antimicrobials through biofilms. Current understanding of biofilm recalcitrance toward antimicrobial penetration is based on qualitative descriptions of biofilms. Here we hypothesize that stress relaxation of biofilms will relate with antimicrobial penetration. Stress relaxation analysis of single-species oral biofilms grown in vitro identified a fast, intermediate and slow response to an induced deformation, corresponding with outflow of water and extracellular polymeric substances, and bacterial re-arrangement, respectively. Penetration of chlorhexidine into these biofilms increased with increasing relative importance of the slow and decreasing importance of the fast relaxation element. Involvement of slow relaxation elements suggests that biofilm structures allowing extensive bacterial re-arrangement after deformation are more open, allowing better antimicrobial penetration. Involvement of fast relaxation elements suggests that water dilutes the antimicrobial upon penetration to an ineffective concentration in deeper layers of the biofilm. Next, we collected biofilms formed in intra-oral collection devices bonded to the buccal surfaces of the maxillary first molars of human volunteers. Ex situ chlorhexidine penetration into two weeks old in vivo formed biofilms followed a similar dependence on the importance of the fast and slow relaxation elements as observed for in vitro formed biofilms. This study demonstrates that biofilm properties can be derived that quantitatively explain antimicrobial penetration into a biofilm."

Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 plays a fundamental role in the mechanism of oxidant-induced vascular hyper permeability. However, the regulatory mechanism of caveolin-1 phosphorylation remains unclear. Here we identify a previously unexpected role for AMPK in inhibition of caveolin-1 phosphorylation under oxidative stress. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), inhibited oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of both caveolin-1 and c-Abl, which is the major kinase of caveolin-1, and endocytosis of albumin in human umbilical vein endothelial cell. These effects were abolished by treatment with two specific inhibitors of AICAR, dipyridamole, and 5-iodotubericidin. Consistently, knockdown of the catalytic AMPKα subunit by siRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of AICAR on oxidant-induced phosphorylation of both caveolin-1 and c-Abl. Pretreatment with specific c-Abl inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, and knock down of c-Abl significantly decreased the caveolin-1 phosphorylation after H2O2 exposure and abolished the inhibitory effect of AICAR on the caveolin-1 phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2018031638,"In ATP-binding cassette proteins, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) work as dimers to bind and hydrolyze ATP, but the molecular mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis is controversial. It is still unresolved whether hydrolysis leads to dissociation of the ATP-induced dimers or partial opening of the dimers such that the NBDs remain in contact during the hydrolysis cycle. We studied the bacterial lipid flippase MsbA by luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET). The LRET signal between optical probes reacted with single-cysteine mutants was employed to follow NBD association/dissociation in real time. The intermonomer distances calculated from LRET data indicate that the NBDs separate completely following ATP hydrolysis, even in the presence of mm MgATP, and that the dissociation occurs following each hydrolysis cycle.

To this end, we seek to identify agents that can reduce Aβ levels in the brain via novel mechanisms. We found that (20S)-Rg3, a triterpene natural compound known as ginsenoside, reduced Aβ levels in cultured primary neurons and in the brains of a mouse model of Alzheimer disease. The (20S)-Rg3 treatment induced a decrease in the association of presenilin 1 (PS1) fragments with lipid rafts where catalytic components of the γ-secretase complex are enriched. The Aβ-lowering activity of (20S)-Rg3 directly correlated with increased activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα), a lipid kinase that mediates the rate-limiting step in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate synthesis. PI4KIIα overexpression recapitulated the effects of (20S)-Rg3, whereas reduced expression of PI4KIIα abolished the Aβ-reducing activity of (20S)-Rg3 in neurons.

Aβ is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by a set of membrane-bound proteases termed β- and γ-secretases (3.O'Brien R.J. Wong P.C. Amyloid precursor protein processing and Alzheimer's disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Therapeutic strategies targeting AD currently under development include reducing Aβ generation, promoting Aβ clearance, and inhibiting Aβ aggregation (4.Mangialasche F. Solomon A. Winblad B.

Despite initial promise, the majority of these approaches suffered major setbacks in late stage clinical trials due to toxicity issues. Recent imaging studies revealed that extensive Aβ pathology precedes any detectable clinical symptoms by at least a decade (5.Bateman R.J. Xiong C. Benzinger T.L. Fagan A.M. Goate A. Fox N.C.

We have previously reported that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), a phospholipid that regulates key aspects of neuronal function (9.Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Phosphoinositides in cell regulation and membrane dynamics.Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar), is involved with cellular mechanisms underlying AD, such as the biogenesis of Aβ production as well as the synaptic action of Aβ (10.Landman N.

Synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 in the brain is predominantly mediated by phosphatidylinositol-phosphate kinase type 1γ, which phosphorylates PI(4)P on the D-5 position of the inositol ring (9.Di Paolo G.

Our previous study suggested that phosphoinositides may inhibit γ-secretase activity by regulating the interaction between the lipid substrate and enzyme complex (27.Osawa S. Funamoto S. Nobuhara M. Wada-Kakuda S. Shimojo M. Yagishita S. Ihara Y. Phosphoinositides suppress γ-secretase in both the detergent-soluble and -insoluble states.J. Biol.

Effects of membrane lipids on the activity and processivity of purified γ-secretase.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that PI(4,5)P2 influences the properties of the γ-secretase by either modification of the lipid environment or sequestration of γ-secretase component(s) in DRMs. Natural compounds have been the basis for traditional remedies but also have been a major source for diverse drug leads for modern medicine (31.Koehn F.E.

Natural compounds often produce cell or system level phenotypes via pleiotropic mechanisms, which may be ideal for the prevention and/or treatment of complex, chronic disorders, such as AD. However, elucidating the mechanisms of action for bioactive natural compounds has been one of the greatest challenges facing the field (33.Kim J. Lee H.J. Lee K.W.

Ginsenosides, the active components of ginseng, are triterpene glycoside compounds that exhibit structural variation (42.Baek S.H. Bae O.N. Park J.H. Recent methodology in ginseng analysis.J.

Ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg3 protect cultured rat cortical cells from glutamate-induced neurodegeneration.J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). More than 30 different ginsenosides have been identified to date, and a number of medical applications have been reported (35.Lü J.M. Yao Q. Chen C.

Recent methodology in ginseng analysis.J. Ginseng Res. 2012; 36: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Some ginsenosides have been shown to reduce the levels of Aβ; however, the mechanism underlying Aβ-lowering activity is not known (45.Chen F. Eckman E.A. Eckman C.B.

Ginseng-derived compounds ameliorate familial Alzheimer's disease pathological phenotypes via a phospholipase C-dependent mechanism.Alzheimers Dement. 2006; 2: S490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the present work, we identified a number of ginsenosides that have Aβ-reducing activity, including (20S)-Rg3, a component of heat-processed ginseng. We investigated the mechanism underlying the Aβ-reducing activity of (20S)-Rg3 and determined that it modulates the phosphoinositide synthetic pathway by increasing PI4KIIα activity. Our work provides evidence that the activity/levels of PI4KIIα and therefore modulation of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 levels in the neuronal membrane reduce Aβ biogenesis. Thus, our studies reveal a novel association of Aβ-producing machinery and the phosphoinositide pathway. Individual ginsenosides were purified from white ginseng or heat-processed ginseng as described previously (47.Park I.H. Kim N.Y. Han S.B. Kim J.M. Kwon S.W. Kim H.J. Park M.K. Park J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2029595157,"Lrig1 is the founding member of the Lrig family of transmembrane leucine-rich repeat proteins, which also includes Lrig2 and Lrig3. Lrig1 is a negative regulator of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, including ErbB and Met receptors, and promotes receptor degradation. Lrig1 has recently emerged as both a tumor suppressor and a key regulator of epidermal and epithelial stem cell quiescence. Despite this, little is known of the mechanisms by which Lrig1 is regulated. Lrig3 was recently reported to increase ErbB receptor expression suggesting that it may function in a manner opposite to Lrig1. In this study, we explore the interaction between Lrig1 and Lrig3 and demonstrate that Lrig1 and Lrig3 functionally oppose one another. Lrig3 opposes Lrig1 negative regulatory activity and stabilizes ErbB receptors. Conversely, Lrig1 destabilizes Lrig3, limiting Lrig3's positive effects on receptors and identifying Lrig3 as a new target of Lrig1. These studies provide new insight into the regulation of Lrig1 and uncover a complex cross-talk between Lrig1 and Lrig3."

Recently, it has been shown that BAG6 forms a stable complex with UBL4A and GET4 and functions in membrane protein targeting and protein quality control. The BAG6 sequence contains a canonical nuclear localization signal and is localized predominantly in the nucleus. However, GET4 and UBL4A are found mainly in cytoplasm. Whether GET4 and UBL4A are also involved in DDR in the context of the BAG6 complex remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that nuclear BAG6-UBL4A-GET4 complex mediates DDR signaling and damage-induced cell death. BAG6 appears to be the central component for the process, as depletion of BAG6 leads to the loss of both UBL4A and GET4 proteins and resistance to cell killing by DNA-damaging agents. In addition, nuclear localization of BAG6 and phosphorylation of BAG6 by ATM/ATR are also required for cell killing. UBL4A and GET4 translocate to the nucleus upon DNA damage and appear to play redundant roles in cell killing, as depletion of either one has no effect but co-depletion leads to resistance.

https://openalex.org/W1981310992,"The analysis of protein biomarkers in urine is expected to lead to advances in a variety of clinical settings. Several characteristics of urine including a low-protein matrix, ease of testing and a demonstrated proteomic stability offer distinct advantages over current widely used biofluids, serum and plasma. Improvements in our understanding of the urine proteome and in methods used in its evaluation will facilitate the clinical development of urinary protein biomarkers. Multiplexed bead-based immunoassays were utilized to evaluate 211 proteins in urines from 103 healthy donors. An additional 25 healthy donors provided serial urine samples over the course of two days in order to assess temporal variation in selected biomarkers. Nearly one-third of the evaluated biomarkers were detected in urine at levels greater than 1ng/ml, representing a diverse panel of proteins with respect to structure, function and biological role. The presence of several biomarkers in urine was confirmed by western blot. Several methods of data normalization were employed to assess impact on biomarker variability. A complex pattern of correlations with urine creatinine, albumin and beta-2-microglobulin was observed indicating the presence of highly specific mechanisms of renal filtration. Further investigation of the urinary protein biomarkers identified in this preliminary study along with a consideration of the underlying proteomic trends suggested by these findings should lead to an improved capability to identify candidate biomarkers for clinical development."
https://openalex.org/W2043499332,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a lipid second messenger located at the intersection of several lipid metabolism and cell signaling events including membrane trafficking, survival, and proliferation. Generation of signaling PA has long been primarily attributed to the activation of phospholipase D (PLD). PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine into PA. A variety of both receptor-tyrosine kinase and G-protein-coupled receptor stimulations have been shown to lead to PLD activation and PA generation. This study focuses on profiling the PA pool upon P2Y6 receptor signaling manipulation to determine the major PA producing enzymes. Here we show that PLD, although highly active, is not responsible for the majority of stable PA being produced upon UDP stimulation of the P2Y6 receptor and that PA levels are tightly regulated. By following PA flux in the cell we show that PLD is involved in an initial increase in PA upon receptor stimulation; however, when PLD is blocked, the cell compensates by increasing PA production from other sources. We further delineate the P2Y6 signaling pathway showing that phospholipase Cβ3 (PLCβ3), PLCδ1, DGKζ and PLD are all downstream of receptor activation. We also show that DGKζ is a novel negative regulator of PLD activity in this system that occurs through an inhibitory mechanism with PKCα. These results further define the downstream events resulting in PA production in the P2Y6 receptor signaling pathway."

One of the major products from TLR activation is production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL1), and type I interferons (IFN). IFN is key component to mount a proper and robust immune response to a viral infection (3.Samuel C.E. Antiviral actions of interferons.Clin. Microbiol.

Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8, is a member of the human γ-herpesviruses family. KSHV is believed to be an etiological factor for Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), and associated with several other B lymphocytes malignancies such as primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. As other herpesviruses, KSHV consists of two distinct phases: latent and lytic replication during its life cycle. During latency, the virus establishes persistent infection and only a small subset of genes are typically expressed. Under conditions of lytic replication, all the viral genes are activated in cascade mode and new viruses are packaged and released from cells (9.Moore P. Chang Y. Knipe D.M. Virology.

However, other reports suggest that TLR3 activation increases MHV68 viral replication in vivo (36.Gargano L.M. Forrest J.C. Speck S.H.

Previously, we found that KSHV RTA degrades TRIF protein through a proteasome pathway (21.Ahmad H. Gubbels R. Ehlers E. Meyer F. Waterbury T. Lin R. Zhang L.

The enhanced RTA protein expression by TRIF is at the translational efficiency of its mRNA. The downstream target of TRIF, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), may be involved in the process. Those data strongly suggest that KSHV usurps host innate immune system for its own benefits. Expression plasmids of KSHV RTA and its mutant (RTA-K152E), EBV RTA, pcDNA3.1-myc-TRIF, TRIF mutants (TRIF-Del, TRIF-N, and TRIF-C) were described previously (21.Ahmad H. Gubbels R. Ehlers E.

Those cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubation. 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was used to maintain the TLR-3 expression in WT11 cells. BC3 is a KSHV-positive PEL line and were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS. Effectene (Qiagen) was used for the transfection of 293T or WT11–9 cell lines following the manufacturer's recommendation. For BC3 cells, electroporation (320 V; 925 microfarads) was used for transfection along with other plasmids. One day after the transfection, the cells were used for the treatment of various concentrations of sodium butyrate. One day later, transfected cells were incubated with Dynabeads-CD4 beads for 20–30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation. CD4-positive cells were isolated by placing the test tubes in a magnetic separation device (Dynal magnet).

Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol extraction. cDNA was synthesized using 100 ng of RNA, oligo dT priming, and SuperScriptTM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). LGH4930 (5′-TTCGCCTGTTAGACGAAGC-3′) and LGH4929 (5′-GATTCGCAAGCTTCAGTCTCGGAAGTAATTACG-3′) primers were used for detection of RTA expression, and actin1 (5-TTCTACAATGAG CTGCGTGT-3′) and actin2 (5′-GCCAGACAGCACTGTGTTGG-3′) primers were used for actin control. 293T cells were transfected with various plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed, cultured in methionine-free DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% of dialyzed FBS for 30 min, and then labeled with of [35S]methionine (Perkin Elmer, 100 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF plus one tablet of protease inhibitor (Roche) per 10 ml) for 30 min on ice. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and allowing to air dry. The membrane was exposed overnight to a Kodak film to capture the 35S signal. The membrane was re-hydrated in 100% methanol, and Western blot was carried out with RTA antibody. The signal strengths were enumerated by the use of the Bio-Rad Software Quantity One (version 4.6.7). Effectene (Qiagen) was used for the transfection of 293T cells. The luciferase assays were performed using the assay kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To examine an effect of TRIF on RTA expression, equal amounts of RTA along with various amounts of TRIF plasmids were transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, TRIF protein expression is gradually decreased as reported (21.Ahmad H. Gubbels R. Ehlers E. Meyer F. Waterbury T. Lin R. Zhang L. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus degrades cellular Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing β-interferon (TRIF).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7865-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the steady state of RTA protein expression was increased upon TRIF expression. Of note, the expression of TRIF could be detected with longer exposure and more lysates (data not shown). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the prototype of human γ-herpesvirus, has a RTA homologue (EBV-R). We further tested if EBV-R was regulated by TRIF expression with similar approach. EBV-R protein expression was not increased by TRIF expression, and EBV-R did not degrade TRIF (Fig. 1B). In addition, the same phenomenon can be observed in other human cell lines, such as MCF7 and U2OS (data not shown). Because RTA degrades TRIF, whether the same pathway was used by TRIF to enhance the expression of RTA was examined. RTA-K152E weakly degraded TRIF, but the expression of the mutant was also enhanced by TRIF (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we tested if TRIF enhanced the RTA-mediated transactivation of reporter gene constructs. As shown in Fig. 1D, TRIF increased the activation of Pan as well as K14 promoter reporter constructs, probably through the enhancing the expression of RTA. Therefore, TRIF activation increased steady state levels of KSHV RTA protein, and the pathways for TRIF degradation and RTA enhancement seem to be different. TRIF is required for TLR-3 signaling (5.Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S.

Whether the activation of TLR-3 increases RTA protein expression in TLR-3-expressing cells (WT11) was tested (45.Sarkar S.N. Smith H.L. Rowe T.M. Sen G.C.

The RTA expression plasmid was transfected into the cells, and the cells were treated with dsRNA for the activation of TLR3. The activation of TLR3 led to the enhancement of the RTA expression (Fig. 2A). This enhancement was specific for KSHV, as EBV-R could not be enhanced by TLR3 activation (Fig. 2A). Therefore, TLR3 signal specifically enhanced KSHV RTA expression. To examine whether TRIF could enhance RTA under physiological conditions, KSHV latently infected PEL cell line, BC3, were transfected with various expression plasmids along with CD4 expression plasmids. BC3 was selected due to its transfection efficiency and relative tight control of the KSHV lytic replication. The cells were treated with sodium butyrate, and the transfected cells were enriched by CD4-magnetic bead selection as described before (50.Xu D. Brumm K. Zhang L.

https://openalex.org/W2040401427,"Identification of the intermediates and determination of their structures in the reduction of dioxygen to water by cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) are particularly important to understanding both O2 activation and proton pumping by the enzyme. In this work, we report the products of the rapid reaction of O2 with the mixed valence form (CuA(2+), heme a(3+), heme a3(2+)-CuB(1+)) of the enzyme. The resonance Raman results show the formation of two ferryl-oxo species with characteristic Fe(IV)=O stretching modes at 790 and 804 cm(-1) at the peroxy oxidation level (PM). Density functional theory calculations show that the protein environment of the proximal H-bonded His-411 determines the strength of the distal Fe(IV)=O bond. In contrast to previous proposals, the PM intermediate is also formed in the reaction of Y167F with O2. These results suggest that in the fully reduced enzyme, the proton pumping ν(Fe(IV)=O) = 804 cm(-1) to ν(Fe(IV)=O) = 790 cm(-1) transition (P→F, where P is peroxy and F is ferryl) is triggered not only by electron transfer from heme a to heme a3 but also by the formation of the H-bonded form of the His-411-Fe(IV)=O conformer in the proximal site of heme a3. The implications of these results with respect to the role of an O=Fe(IV)-His-411-H-bonded form to the ring A propionate of heme a3-Asp-399-H2O site and, thus, to the exit/output proton channel (H2O) pool during the proton pumping P→F transition are discussed. We propose that the environment proximal to the heme a3 controls the spectroscopic properties of the ferryl intermediates in cytochrome oxidases."

Rowlandius ubajara is known only from the Ubajara Cave, in the state of Ceará; R. potiguar is recorded from 20 caves of the Apodi Limestone Group, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. A remarkable dimorphism in male pedipalp length is described and analyzed in R. potiguar. The distribution of male pedipalp length is clearly bimodal in the species, but the two male morphs (homeomorphic and heteromorphic) present some overlap in the sizes of this structure. Moreover, males show a steeper allometry in pedipalp length than females, indicating that this trait is under a different selective regime in males and in females."
https://openalex.org/W2102266871,"Urinary albumin excretion is known to be independently associated with progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to identify predictors for progression in albuminuria in the general population.Data were used of the first 4 screening rounds of a community-based prospective cohort study (PREVEND). Included were 5,825 subjects that at baseline had no known renal disease or macroalbuminuria. Subjects were defined as having progressive albuminuria when they belonged to the quintile of subjects with highest absolute increase in urinary albumin excretion per year and a urinary albumin excretion during the last screening in which they participated of ≥150 mg/24 h. Change in urinary albumin excretion per year was calculated as last available urinary albumin excretion minus baseline UAE divided by follow-up time.During 9.3 years follow-up 132 subjects had progressive albuminuria. These subjects were significantly older, more often of male gender and had a worse cardiovascular risk profile. In a multivariable model, testing baseline values, significant predictors of progressive albuminuria were male gender (OR 2.23; p<0.001), age (OR 1.03; p<0.001), BMI (OR 1.06; p = 0.02) and baseline albuminuria (OR 5.71; p<0.001). Based on these findings a risk score was made to estimate a subject's risk for progressive albuminuria.A high baseline albuminuria is by far the most important predictor of progressive albuminuria. Thus, screening for baseline albuminuria will be more important than screening for cardiovascular risk factors in order to identify subjects at risk for progressive albuminuria."
https://openalex.org/W1987416662,"With remarkably few exceptions, the molecules mediating synaptic vesicle exocytosis at active zones are structurally and functionally conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates. Mover was found in a yeast-2-hybrid assay using the vertebrate-specific active zone scaffolding protein bassoon as a bait. Peptides of Mover have been reported in proteomics screens for self-interacting proteins, phosphorylated proteins, and synaptic vesicle proteins, respectively. Here, we tested the predictions arising from these screens. Using flotation assays, carbonate stripping of peripheral membrane proteins, mass spectrometry, immunogold labelling of purified synaptic vesicles, and immuno-organelle isolation, we found that Mover is indeed a peripheral synaptic vesicle membrane protein. In addition, by generating an antibody against phosphorylated Mover and Western blot analysis of fractionated rat brain, we found that Mover is a bona fide phospho-protein. The localization of Mover to synaptic vesicles is phosphorylation dependent; treatment with a phosphatase caused Mover to dissociate from synaptic vesicles. A yeast-2-hybrid screen, co-immunoprecipitation and cell-based optical assays of homomerization revealed that Mover undergoes homophilic interaction, and regions within both the N- and C- terminus of the protein are required for this interaction. Deleting a region required for homomeric interaction abolished presynaptic targeting of recombinant Mover in cultured neurons. Together, these data prove that Mover is associated with synaptic vesicles, and implicate phosphorylation and multimerization in targeting of Mover to synaptic vesicles and presynaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1972299108,"Migration has evolved as a strategy to maximise individual fitness in response to seasonally changing ecological and environmental conditions. However, migration can also incur costs, and quantifying these costs can provide important clues to the ultimate ecological forces that underpin migratory behaviour. A key emerging model to explain migration in many systems posits that migration is driven by seasonal changes to a predation/growth potential (p/g) trade-off that a wide range of animals face. In this study we assess a key assumption of this model for a common cyprinid partial migrant, the roach Rutilus rutilus, which migrates from shallow lakes to streams during winter. By sampling fish from stream and lake habitats in the autumn and spring and measuring their stomach fullness and diet composition, we tested if migrating roach pay a cost of reduced foraging when migrating. Resident fish had fuller stomachs containing more high quality prey items than migrant fish. Hence, we document a feeding cost to migration in roach, which adds additional support for the validity of the p/g model of migration in freshwater systems."
https://openalex.org/W2055764719,"In mammals, embryonic neural progenitors as well as adult neural stem cells can be prospectively isolated based on the cell surface expression of prominin-1 (CD133), a plasma membrane glycoprotein. In contrast, characterization of neural progenitors in non-mammalian vertebrates endowed with significant constitutive neurogenesis and inherent self-repair ability is hampered by the lack of suitable cell surface markers. Here, we have investigated whether prominin-1-orthologues of the major non-mammalian vertebrate model organisms show any degree of conservation as for their association with neurogenic geminative zones within the central nervous system (CNS) as they do in mammals or associated with activated neural progenitors during provoked neurogenesis in the regenerating CNS.We have recently identified prominin-1 orthologues from zebrafish, axolotl and chicken. The spatial distribution of prominin-1-positive cells--in comparison to those of mice--was mapped in the intact brain in these organisms by non-radioactive in situ hybridization combined with detection of proliferating neural progenitors, marked either by proliferating cell nuclear antigen or 5-bromo-deoxyuridine. Furthermore, distribution of prominin-1 transcripts was investigated in the regenerating spinal cord of injured axolotl.Remarkably, a conserved association of prominin-1 with germinative zones of the CNS was uncovered as manifested in a significant co-localization with cell proliferation markers during normal constitutive neurogenesis in all species investigated. Moreover, an enhanced expression of prominin-1 became evident associated with provoked, compensatory neurogenesis during the epimorphic regeneration of the axolotl spinal cord. Interestingly, significant prominin-1-expressing cell populations were also detected at distinct extraventricular (parenchymal) locations in the CNS of all vertebrate species being suggestive of further, non-neurogenic neural function(s).Collectively, our work provides the first data set describing a comparative analysis of prominin-1-positive progenitor cells across species establishing a framework for further functional characterization in the context of regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2145752824,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide hormone that suppresses Th1-mediated cellular immunity. We previously reported that VIP-knockout (VIP-KO) mice have enhanced cellular immune responses and increased survival following murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we tested whether treatment with a VIP receptor antagonistic peptide protects C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice from mCMV-infection. One week of daily subcutaneous injections of VIPhyb was non-toxic and did not alter frequencies of immune cell subsets in non-infected mice. VIPhyb administration to mCMV-infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice markedly enhanced survival, viral clearance, and reduced liver and lung pathology compared with saline-treated controls. The numbers of effector/memory CD8+ T-cells and mature NK cells were increased in VIPhyb-treated mice compared with PBS-treated groups. Pharmacological blockade of VIP-receptor binding or genetic blockade of VIP-signaling prevented the up-regulation of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression on DC and activated CD8+ T-cells, respectively, in mCMV-infected mice, and enhanced CD80, CD86, and MHC-II expression on conventional and plasmacytoid DC. VIPhyb-treatment increased type-I IFN synthesis, numbers of IFN-γ- and TNF-α-expressing NK cells and T-cells, and the numbers of mCMV-M45 epitope-peptide-MHC-I tetramer CD8+ T-cells following mCMV infection. VIP-treatment lowered the percentage of Treg cells in spleens compared with PBS-treated WT mice following mCMV infection, while significantly decreasing levels of serum VEGF induced by mCMV-infection. The mice in all treated groups exhibited similar levels of anti-mCMV antibody titers. Short-term administration of a VIP-receptor antagonist represents a novel approach to enhance innate and adaptive cellular immunity in a murine model of CMV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2111789298,"Because it is suspected that gene content may partly explain host adaptation and ecology of pathogenic bacteria, it is important to study factors affecting genome composition and its evolution. While recent genomic advances have revealed extremely large pan-genomes for some bacterial species, it remains difficult to predict to what extent gene pool is accessible within or transferable between populations. As genomes bear imprints of the history of the organisms, gene distribution pattern analyses should provide insights into the forces and factors at play in the shaping and maintaining of bacterial genomes. In this study, we revisited the data obtained from a previous CGH microarrays analysis in order to assess the genomic plasticity of the R. solanacearum species complex. Gene distribution analyses demonstrated the remarkably dispersed genome of R. solanacearum with more than half of the genes being accessory. From the reconstruction of the ancestral genomes compositions, we were able to infer the number of gene gain and loss events along the phylogeny. Analyses of gene movement patterns reveal that factors associated with gene function, genomic localization and ecology delineate gene flow patterns. While the chromosome displayed lower rates of movement, the megaplasmid was clearly associated with hot-spots of gene gain and loss. Gene function was also confirmed to be an essential factor in gene gain and loss dynamics with significant differences in movement patterns between different COG categories. Finally, analyses of gene distribution highlighted possible highways of horizontal gene transfer. Due to sampling and design bias, we can only speculate on factors at play in this gene movement dynamic. Further studies examining precise conditions that favor gene transfer would provide invaluable insights in the fate of bacteria, species delineation and the emergence of successful pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2165690068,"Objective The retina is subjected to tractional forces in various conditions. As the predominant glial element in the retina, Müller cells are active players in all forms of retinal injury and disease. In this study, we aim to identify patterns of gene expression changes induced by cyclic mechanical stretching in Müller cells. Methods Rat Müller cells were seeded onto flexible bottom culture plates and subjected to a cyclic stretching regimen of 15% equibiaxial stretching for 1 and 24 h. RNA was extracted and amplified, labeled, and hybridized to rat genome microarrays. The expression profiles were analyzed using GeneSpring software, and gene ontology analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to select, annotate, and visualize genes by function and pathway. The selected genes of interest were further validated by Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR). Results Microarray data analysis showed that at 1 and 24 h, the expression of 532 and 991 genes in the Müller cells significantly (t-test, p<0.05) differed between the mechanically stretched and unstretched groups. Of these genes, 56 genes at 1 h and 62 genes at 24 h showed more than a twofold change in expression. Several genes related to response to stimulus (e.g., Egr2, IL6), cell proliferation (e.g., Areg, Atf3), tissue remodeling (e.g., PVR, Loxl2), and vasculogenesis (e.g., Epha2, Nrn1) were selected and validated by qPCR. KEGG pathway analysis showed significant changes in MAPK signaling at both time points. Conclusions Cyclic mechanical strain induces extensive changes in the gene expression in Müller cells through multiple molecular pathways. These results indicate the complex mechanoresponsive nature of Müller cells, and they provide novel insights into possible molecular mechanisms that would account for many retinal diseases in which the retina is often subjected to mechanical forces, such as pathological myopia and proliferative vitreoretinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2062479599,"Plant vascular meristems are sets of pluripotent cells that enable radial growth by giving rise to vascular tissues and are therefore crucial to plant development. However, the overall dynamics of cellular determination and patterning in and around vascular meristems is still unexplored. We study this process in the shoot vascular tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana, which is organized in vascular bundles that contain three basic cell types (procambium, xylem and phloem). A set of molecules involved in this process has now been identified and partially characterized, but it is not yet clear how the regulatory interactions among them, in conjunction with cellular communication processes, give rise to the steady patterns that accompany cell-fate determination and arrangement within vascular bundles. We put forward a dynamic model factoring in the interactions between molecules (genes, peptides, mRNA and hormones) that have been reported to be central in this process, as well as the relevant communication mechanisms. When a few proposed interactions (unverified, but based on related data) are postulated, the model reproduces the hormonal and molecular patterns expected for the three regions within vascular bundles. In order to test the model, we simulated mutant and hormone-depleted systems and compared the results with experimentally reported phenotypes. The proposed model provides a formal framework integrating a set of growing experimental data and renders a dynamic account of how the collective action of hormones, genes, and other molecules may result in the specification of the three main cell types within shoot vascular bundles.

Investigating low adherence is of high importance from TB programmatic perspective. Though data on actual days of missed treatment exist, the effect of such on TB cure rates has not been investigated.TB operational research data were extracted for smear-positive pulmonary TB patients registered at Zomba Central hospital, Malawi from January 2007 to December 2008.Of the 524 patients, 302 (57.6%) were males and 340 (64.9%) fully adhered to treatment. Excluding 5 individuals with missing data on cure, four hundred and eighty-one (92.7%) were cured of TB, and of these 162 (33.7%) missed at least one day of treatment. Respectively, 49/64 (76.6%) and 71/76 (93.4%) of those who missed treatment in the intensive and continuation phases were cured of TB (p = 0.005). The adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that those who missed 15-29 days of treatment (OR = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.14) were less likely to be cured of TB compared with those who fully adhered.Treatment non-adherence was high and was observed even within the first 2 months of treatment. Thus, even at an earlier critical stage of treatment, simple algorithms need to be developed to identify and monitor patients at higher risk of non-adherence. Efforts on treatment compliance counselling should focus on enhanced counselling to improve adherence during the intensive treatment phase."
https://openalex.org/W1981693712,"To investigate the protective effects of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene transfer in a rat model of corneal graft rejection.We constructed a recombinant plasmid (pcDNA3.1-hIL-1ra) with high IL-1ra expression in eukaryotic cells. Using a Wistar-SD rat model of corneal graft rejection, we examined the effects of IL-1ra in vivo after cationic polymer jetPEI-mediated nonviral gene delivery. Four groups were included: negative controls (group I, n = 20), pcDNA3.1-hIL-1ra corneal stromal injection (group II, n = 34), pcDNA3.1-hIL-1ra anterior chamber injection (group III, n = 34), and 500 µg/ml IL-1ra protein subconjunctiva injection (group IV, n = 20). IL-1ra expression after transfection was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. The rejection indices of corneal grafts were analysed in the different groups. The expression levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), inflammatory chemokines including RANTES, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the grafts were determined by biochemical assays at different time points after corneal transplantation.Various degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration and graft neovascularisation were observed by histopathology. After injecting the pcDNA3.1-hIL-1ra plasmid into the cornea, IL-1ra mRNA and protein expression was detected in the corneal stroma and reached a peak on day 3. The graft survival curves indicated that the corneal transparency rates of grafts in the IL-1ra gene-treated group and the IL-1ra protein-treated group were higher compared with the untreated group (P<0.05). During the period of acute rejection, TGF-β1, RANTES, IL-1α and IL-1β levels in the grafts in the IL-1ra treatment groups were lower than the control group (P<0.05). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts were reduced significantly in the corneal grafts of groups II, III and IV compared with group I (P<0.05).Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene transfer treatment inhibits graft rejection after corneal transplantation through the downregulation of immune mediators."

JIL-1 can be divided into four main domains, including an NH2-terminal domain, two separate kinase domains, and a COOH-terminal domain. In this study, we characterize the domain requirements of the JIL-1 kinase for histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10) phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling in vivo. We show that a JIL-1 construct without the NH2-terminal domain is without H3S10 phosphorylation activity despite the fact that it localizes properly to polytene interband regions and that it contains both kinase domains. JIL-1 is a double kinase, and we demonstrate that both kinase domains of JIL-1 are required to be catalytically active for H3S10 phosphorylation to occur. Furthermore, we provide evidence that JIL-1 is phosphorylated at serine 424 and that this phosphorylation is necessary for JIL-1 H3S10 phosphorylation activity. Thus, these data are compatible with a model where the NH2-terminal domain of JIL-1 is required for chromatin complex interactions that position the kinase domain(s) for catalytic activity in the context of the state of higher order nucleosome packaging and chromatin structure and where catalytic H3S10 phosphorylation activity mediated by the first kinase domain is dependent on autophosphorylation of serine 424 by the second kinase domain.

JIL-1 can be divided into four main domains, including an NH2-terminal domain (NTD), two kinase domains (KDI and KDII), and a COOH-terminal domain (CTD) (6Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C.

It has previously been demonstrated that the CTD domain of JIL-1 is sufficient for proper chromatin localization and for rescue of the grossly perturbed polytene chromosome morphology in JIL-1 null mutants (3Wang C.

However, in these studies, the properties of the NTD or the relative contributions of the two kinase domains were not determined. Thus, in order to further characterize the domain requirements of the JIL-1 kinase for H3S10 phosphorylation and regulation of chromatin structure, we generated a series of mutated JIL-1 constructs and expressed them in a JIL-1 null mutant background. Our results showed that a JIL-1 construct without the NTD localizes properly to chromatin and rescues mutant polytene chromosome morphology. However, in immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analyses with H3S10ph antibody, no H3S10 phosphorylation could be detected, strongly suggesting that the NTD domain is required for H3S10 kinase activity. Furthermore, we mutated either or both kinase domains to render them “kinase-dead” and assessed their ability to phosphorylate H3S10. The results indicated that both kinase domains are required for kinase activity. In addition, using a LacI/lacO repeat-tethering system (13Deng H. Bao X. Cai W. Blacketer M.J. Belmont A.S. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Ectopic histone H3S10 phosphorylation causes chromatin structure remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2008; 135: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we provide evidence that only JIL-1 constructs with H3S10 phosphorylation activity have the capacity to induce a change in higher order chromatin structure from a condensed heterochromatin-like band state to a more open euchromatic interband state. The full-length LacI-JIL-1 construct (FL) was previously described by Deng et al. (13Deng H. Bao X. Cai W. Blacketer M.J. Belmont A.S. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Ectopic histone H3S10 phosphorylation causes chromatin structure remodeling in Drosophila.Development. 2008; 135: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). LacI-tagged constructs from residues 1–926 lacking the COOH-terminal domain of JIL-1 (ΔCTD), a construct from residues 261–1207 lacking the NH2-terminal domain (ΔNTD), and a COOH-terminal domain construct from residues 927–1207 were cloned into the pUAST vector with the in-frame DNA-binding domain of the LacI repressor from Escherichia coli at the NH2 terminus using standard methods (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). In addition, pUAST constructs were generated using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) to introduce K293A (KDI*) and K652A (KDII*) substitutions in the ATP-binding loops for each kinase domain as well as a double mutant combination (KDI*/KDII*). A QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) was used to introduce a S425A substitution into the first kinase domain of a full-length JIL-1 cDNA. Subsequently, the mutated JIL-1 cDNA was cloned into the pUASP-HA-FLAG gateway vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For protein purification, a TAP-tagged JIL-1 construct from residues 261–1207 lacking the COOH-terminal domain (TAP-JIL-1) was cloned into the pUAST-NTAP vector (15Veraksa A. Bauer A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Analyzing protein complexes in Drosophila with tandem affinity purification mass spectrometry.Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The TAP tag consists of calmodulin binding peptide and Protein A. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing at the Iowa State University sequencing facility. Fly stocks were maintained at 25 °C according to standard protocols (16Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1998Google Scholar).

All transgenic lines were generated by standard P-element transformation (BestGene, Inc.), and expression of the transgenes was driven using Sgs3-GAL4 or hsp70-GAL4 drivers introduced by standard genetic crosses. Recombinant JIL-1z2, hsp70-GAL4 chromosomes were generated as described by Ji et al. (20Ji Y. Rath U. Girton J. Johansen K.M. Johansen J.

The hsp70 promoter is leaky and was used without heat shock treatment as described previously (12Bao X. Cai W. Deng H. Zhang W. Krencik R. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M.

Expression levels of each of the JIL-1 constructs were monitored by immunoblot analysis as described below. All driver lines were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. Balancer chromosomes and markers are described by Lindsley and Zimm (21Lindsley D.L. Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). Viability assays were performed by crossing JIL-transgene/JIL-transgene; JIL-1z2/TM6 flies with JIL-1z2 Hsp70-GAL4/TM6 flies. In these crosses, the TM6 chromosome was identified by the Stubble marker. Consequently, the experimental genotypes could be distinguished from balanced heterozygotic flies by the absence of the Stubble marker. The expected Mendelian ratio of non-Stubble to Stubble flies assuming full rescue by the JIL-1 transgenes in the JIL-1 null background was 1:2 because TM6/TM6 is embryonic lethal. Thus, the percentage of rescue of adult viability for each transgene was calculated as observed non-Stubble flies × 200/observed Stubble flies. In each experiment, the degree of rescue was determined on the basis of the analysis of the genotypes from at least 300 surviving progeny. Standard polytene chromosome squash preparations were performed as described by Cai et al. (22Cai W. Jin Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M.

The appropriate species- and isotype-specific Texas Red-, TRITC-, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel/ICN, Southern Biotech) were used (1:200 dilution) to visualize primary antibody labeling. The final preparations were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.5% n-propyl gallate. The preparations were examined using epifluorescence optics on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were captured and digitized using a cooled Spot CCD camera. Images were imported into Photoshop, where they were pseudocolored, image-processed, and merged. In some images, non-linear adjustments were made to the channel with Hoechst labeling for optimal visualization of chromosomes. Protein extracts were prepared from adult flies or from dissected third instar larval salivary glands homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein separation by SDS-PAGE and electroblot transfer were performed according to standard procedures (14Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used the Bio-Rad Mini PROTEAN III system, electroblotting to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose with transfer buffer containing 20% methanol and in most cases including 0.04% SDS. Primary antibodies for immunoblot analysis included rabbit anti-H3S10ph (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-histone H3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-JIL-1 (6Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C.

The appropriate anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (1:3000) was used for visualization of primary antibody. Antibody labeling was visualized using chemiluminescent detection methods (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Pierce). The immunoblots were digitized using a flatbed scanner (Epson Expression 1680). For TAP-JIL-1 fusion protein purification, the expressed protein was purified from protein extracts of 200 third instar larval salivary glands homogenized in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein lysate was incubated with IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C on a rotation wheel. Bound protein beads were washed with lysis buffer five times. Subsequently, the bound proteins were separated on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue R250. The TAP-JIL-1 gel band was identified based on size and Coomassie staining intensity and cut out of the gel. The cut band was reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and sent to the University of California, Davis, Proteomics Core Facility for analysis with tandem mass spectrometry using standard methods. Tandem mass spectra were extracted, and charge states were deconvoluted and deisotoped by Scaffold version 3.5.1. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Sequest version 3.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequest was set up to search the Uniprot D. melanogaster database (November 2011; 55,391 entries) along with 101 common laboratory contaminant proteins, assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00 kDa and a parent ion tolerance of 20 ppm. Oxidation of methionine, acetylation of lysine, trimethylation of arginine, iodoacetamide derivative of cysteine, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine were specified in Sequest as variable modifications. Scaffold version 3.5.1 (Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 80.0% probability as specified by the Peptide Prophet algorithm (24Keller A. Nesvizhskii A.I. Kolker E. Aebersold R. Empirical statistical model to estimate accuracy of peptide identifications made by MS/MS and database search.Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 5383-5392Crossref PubMed Scopus (3885) Google Scholar). Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 80.0% probability and contained at least two identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (25Nesvizhskii A.I. Keller A. Kolker E. Aebersold R. A statistical model for identifying proteins by tandem mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 4646-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (3621) Google Scholar). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Using these parameters, a false discovery rate was calculated as 1.7% on the peptide level and 0% on the protein level. In order to further explore the relative contributions of the different JIL-1 domains to H3S10 phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling, we expressed four LacI-tagged JIL-1 UAS P-element insertion constructs transgenically in wild type and JIL-1 null mutant animals. FL, a construct without the COOH-terminal domain (ΔCTD), a construct without the NH2-terminal domain (ΔNTD), and a construct containing only the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) were made (Fig. 1A). A ΔNTD construct has not been previously characterized; however, the LacI-tagged FL, ΔCTD, and CTD constructs used in this study had properties identical to those reported for similar GFP- or CFP-tagged JIL-1 constructs (3Wang C.

A transgenic line was selected for each construct that expressed at levels comparable with those of endogenous JIL-1 using a hsp-70-GAL4 driver line as illustrated in Fig. 1B. FL rescued all aspects of the JIL-1 null mutant phenotype, including polytene chromosome morphology (Fig. 2B) and viability, and like endogenous JIL-1, FL was up-regulated on the male X chromosome (data not shown). The ΔCTD lacks the COOH-terminal sequences required for proper chromatin localization, leading to mislocalization of the protein (13Deng H. Bao X. Cai W. Blacketer M.J. Belmont A.S. Girton J.

However, it does retain its in vivo kinase activity (Fig. 1C), resulting in ectopic H3S10 phosphorylation (12Bao X. Cai W. Deng H. Zhang W. Krencik R. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M.

The ΔCTD rescues autosome polytene chromosome morphology (Fig. 2B) but only partially rescues that of the male X chromosome in JIL-1 null mutants (12Bao X. Cai W. Deng H. Zhang W. Krencik R.

In contrast, the CTD largely restores JIL-1 null mutant chromosome morphology (Fig. 2B), including that of the male X chromosome (12Bao X. Cai W. Deng H. Zhang W. Krencik R. Girton J. Johansen J.

Furthermore, when the CTD is expressed in a wild type background, it has a dominant negative effect and displaces endogenous JIL-1 (12Bao X. Cai W. Deng H. Zhang W. Krencik R. Girton J. Johansen J.

A, comparison of polytene chromosome squash preparations from wild type (wt) and JIL-1 null (z2/z2) third instar larval salivary glands labeled with JIL-1 antibody. B, polytene chromosome squash preparations from JIL-1 null (z2/z2) third instar larval salivary glands expressing the FL, the ΔCTD, the ΔNTD, and the CTD, respectively. Transgenic protein localization (in green) was identified using LacI antibody, H3K9 dimethylation (in red) was identified using H3K9me2 antibody, and DNA (in blue or gray) was labeled by Hoechst.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine the properties of a JIL-1 construct without the NH2-terminal domain, we expressed the ΔNTD in a JIL-1 null mutant background. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, the ΔNTD restored polytene chromosome morphology to or near the level in wild type preparations (Fig. 2A) and localized correctly to interband regions. Interestingly, in contrast to the ΔCTD, the ΔNTD was not able to phosphorylate H3S10 as documented by immunoblotting of salivary gland protein extracts in Fig. 1C. Furthermore, the polytene squash preparations from larvae expressing the ΔNTD showed th"

Models of opinion formation in a population of agents have proven a very useful tool to investigate these phenomena that arise independently of the heterogeneities across individuals and can be used to identify the factors that determine whether widespread consensus on an initial small majority is reached. Recently, we introduced a model in which individual agents can have conservative and partisan biases. Numerical simulations for finite populations showed that while the inclusion of conservative agents in a population enhances the population's efficiency in reaching consensus on the initial majority opinion, even a small fraction of partisans leads the population to converge on the opinion initially held by a minority. To further understand the mechanisms leading to our previous numerical results, we investigate analytically the noise driven transition from a regime in which the population reaches a majority consensus (efficient), to a regime in which the population settles in deadlock (non-efficient). We show that the mean-field solution captures what we observe in model simulations. Populations of agents with no opinion bias show a continuous transition to a deadlock regime, while populations with an opinion bias, show a discontinuous transition between efficient and partisan regimes. Furthermore, the analytical solution reveals that populations with an increasing fraction of conservative agents are more robust against noise than a population of naive agents because in the efficient regime there are relatively more conservative than naive agents holding the majority opinion. In contrast, populations with partisan agents are less robust to noise with an increasing fraction of partisans, because in the efficient regime there are relatively more naive agents than partisan agents holding the majority opinion."

Preparation for scientific inquiry is critical for the future of research, yet opportunities are rare in the early stages of education. This discrepancy can be resolved by immersing students in genuine research activities as early as possible. We have created an experience for high school students to engage in and contribute to ongoing research. We prepare students to formulate and test hypotheses using computational tools and data collected in our laboratory, or available from public repositories."
