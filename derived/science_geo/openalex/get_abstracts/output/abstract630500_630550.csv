https://openalex.org/W2933273758,"Late-onset ataxia is common, often idiopathic, and can result from cerebellar, proprioceptive, or vestibular impairment; when in combination, it is also termed cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We used non-parametric linkage analysis and genome sequencing to identify a biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene as the cause of familial CANVAS and a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia, particularly if sensory neuronopathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia coexist. The expansion, which occurs in the poly(A) tail of an AluSx3 element and differs in both size and nucleotide sequence from the reference (AAAAG)11 allele, does not affect RFC1 expression in patient peripheral and brain tissue, suggesting no overt loss of function. These data, along with an expansion carrier frequency of 0.7% in Europeans, implies that biallelic AAGGG expansion in RFC1 is a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia."
https://openalex.org/W2950709928,"Transcriptome-wide association studies using predicted expression have identified thousands of genes whose locally regulated expression is associated with complex traits and diseases. In this work, we show that linkage disequilibrium induces significant gene-trait associations at non-causal genes as a function of the expression quantitative trait loci weights used in expression prediction. We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (for example, 90%) that can be used to prioritize genes for functional assays. We illustrate our approach by using an integrative analysis of lipid traits, where our approach prioritizes genes with strong evidence for causality."
https://openalex.org/W2929679098,"Transposable elements (TEs) are an abundant and rich genetic resource of regulatory sequences1-3. Cryptic regulatory elements within TEs can be epigenetically reactivated in cancer to influence oncogenesis in a process termed onco-exaptation4. However, the prevalence and impact of TE onco-exaptation events across cancer types are poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed 7,769 tumors and 625 normal datasets from 15 cancer types, identifying 129 TE cryptic promoter-activation events involving 106 oncogenes across 3,864 tumors. Furthermore, we interrogated the AluJb-LIN28B candidate: the genetic deletion of the TE eliminated oncogene expression, while dynamic DNA methylation modulated promoter activity, illustrating the necessity and sufficiency of a TE for oncogene activation. Collectively, our results characterize the global profile of TE onco-exaptation and highlight this prevalent phenomenon as an important mechanism for promiscuous oncogene activation and ultimately tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2923280439,"We have previously developed a high-throughput bioengineered human cardiac organoid (hCO) platform, which provides functional contractile tissue with biological properties similar to native heart tissue, including mature, cell-cycle-arrested cardiomyocytes. In this study, we perform functional screening of 105 small molecules with pro-regenerative potential. Our findings reveal surprising discordance between our hCO system and traditional 2D assays. In addition, functional analyses uncovered detrimental effects of many hit compounds. Two pro-proliferative small molecules without detrimental impacts on cardiac function were identified. High-throughput proteomics in hCO revealed synergistic activation of the mevalonate pathway and a cell-cycle network by the pro-proliferative compounds. Cell-cycle reentry in hCO and in vivo required the mevalonate pathway as inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with a statin attenuated pro-proliferative effects. This study highlights the utility of human cardiac organoids for pro-regenerative drug development, including identification of underlying biological mechanisms and minimization of adverse side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2929968583,"Although successful detection of malignant tumors from histopathological images largely depends on the long-term experience of radiologists, experts sometimes disagree with their decisions. Computer-aided diagnosis provides a second option for image diagnosis, which can improve the reliability of experts' decision-making. Automatic and precision classification for breast cancer histopathological image is of great importance in clinical application for identifying malignant tumors from histopathological images. Advanced convolution neural network technology has achieved great success in natural image classification, and it has been used widely in biomedical image processing. In this paper, we design a novel convolutional neural network, which includes a convolutional layer, small SE-ResNet module, and fully connected layer. We propose a small SE-ResNet module which is an improvement on the combination of residual module and Squeeze-and-Excitation block, and achieves the similar performance with fewer parameters. In addition, we propose a new learning rate scheduler which can get excellent performance without complicatedly fine-tuning the learning rate. We use our model for the automatic classification of breast cancer histology images (BreakHis dataset) into benign and malignant and eight subtypes. The results show that our model achieves the accuracy between 98.87% and 99.34% for the binary classification and achieve the accuracy between 90.66% and 93.81% for the multi-class classification."
https://openalex.org/W2925077238,"New neurons arise from quiescent adult neural progenitors throughout life in specific regions of the mammalian brain. Little is known about the embryonic origin and establishment of adult neural progenitors. Here, we show that Hopx+ precursors in the mouse dentate neuroepithelium at embryonic day 11.5 give rise to proliferative Hopx+ neural progenitors in the primitive dentate region, and they, in turn, generate granule neurons, but not other neurons, throughout development and then transition into Hopx+ quiescent radial glial-like neural progenitors during an early postnatal period. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses of Hopx+ embryonic, early postnatal, and adult dentate neural progenitors further reveal common molecular and epigenetic signatures and developmental dynamics. Together, our findings support a ""continuous"" model wherein a common neural progenitor population exclusively contributes to dentate neurogenesis throughout development and adulthood. Adult dentate neurogenesis may therefore represent a lifelong extension of development that maintains heightened plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus."

To define candidates and their functions, we mutated zebrafish orthologs of 132 human schizophrenia-associated genes. We created a phenotype atlas consisting of whole-brain activity maps, brain structural differences, and profiles of behavioral abnormalities. Phenotypes were diverse but specific, including altered forebrain development and decreased prepulse inhibition. Exploration of these datasets identified promising candidates in more than 10 gene-rich regions, including the magnesium transporter cnnm2 and the translational repressor gigyf2, and revealed shared anatomical sites of activity differences, including the pallium, hypothalamus, and tectum. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered an essential role for the understudied transcription factor znf536 in the development of forebrain neurons implicated in social behavior and stress. This phenotypic landscape of schizophrenia-associated genes prioritizes more than 30 candidates for further study and provides hypotheses to bridge the divide between genetic association and biological mechanism.

This phenotypic landscape of schizophrenia-associated genes prioritizes more than 30 candidates for further study and provides hypotheses to bridge the divide between genetic association and biological mechanism. Neuropsychiatric disorders are highly heritable. The understanding of their underlying genetic predispositions has recently accelerated, providing new opportunities to decipher disease mechanisms and discover potential drug targets. However, progress has been limited in part because the dozens of loci associated with these disorders contain hundreds of candidate genes (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar). In particular, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked by genome-wide association study (GWAS) only define disease-associated genomic regions, which often span many genes (of which the culpable genes are unknown) or might include regulatory elements for distant genes (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L.

Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Many of the same risk loci are also associated with multiple neuropsychiatric disorders (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumIdentification of risk loci with shared effects on five major psychiatric disorders: a genome-wide analysis.Lancet. 2013; 381: 1371-1379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar, Gandal et al., 2018Gandal M.J.

Liang J. Vlasac I. Anderson S.G. Bechtold D.A. Bowden J. Emsley R. Gill S. Little M.A. Luik A.I. et al.Genome-wide association analyses of sleep disturbance traits identify new loci and highlight shared genetics with neuropsychiatric and metabolic traits.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This shared genetic predisposition indicates that some genes may contribute generally to brain health and development, while others may influence specific dimensions of disease manifestations. One of the richest of association datasets exists for schizophrenia (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar). In 2014, the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium identified 108 genomic loci at which common variants significantly associated with the disorder. Some identified genes align with hypotheses from previous research: for example, the implication of dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2, the target of many antipsychotic medications) may align with the dopamine hypothesis. The largest association signal, in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, appears to arise in part from the complement component 4 genes, which might contribute to excessive synaptic pruning (Sekar et al., 2016Sekar A. Bialas A.R. de Rivera H. Davis A. Hammond T.R. Kamitaki N. Tooley K. Presumey J. Baum M. Van Doren V. et al.Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumSchizophrenia risk from complex variation of complement component 4.Nature. 2016; 530: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). However, many associated genes have not been studied, particularly in the context of nervous system development and activity. To discover the mechanisms underlying polygenic illnesses such as schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disease, it would be useful to identify the in vivo functions of many associated genes; such analysis could also prioritize candidate genes for further analyses. We reasoned that zebrafish, a small and low-cost vertebrate (Rennekamp and Peterson, 2015Rennekamp A.J. Peterson R.T. 15 years of zebrafish chemical screening.Curr. Opin. Chem.

Although human neuropsychiatric illness cannot be phenocopied in zebrafish, and homozygous knockouts differ from the functionally subtle polymorphisms that commonly segregate in human populations, neuroanatomical and behavioral phenotypes relevant to human biology can be scored in zebrafish (Burgess and Granato, 2007bBurgess H.A.

To identify neurobiological functions and define candidate genes, we created mutants for 132 schizophrenia-associated genes and performed large-scale phenotypic analyses of brain activity, morphology and behavior. We established phenotypic databases, websites to share these datasets (genepile.com/scz_gwas108 and stackjoint.com/zbrain) (Video S1), and robust analysis tools to facilitate large-scale studies. Guided by these datasets, we identified promising candidates in multi-gene loci and discovered neurobiological roles for more than 30 genes, including several that were largely understudied. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxYTk0MWVmY2E4N2NhNWVkNDFhYjBkZThhN2Y0YzcyMiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3NzE5NDU1fQ.jSluiOBE8v6ypIS7FBh6BeDBv1TVg2x-lDcyLySnTMGh2F86YzPxQeoOmzAY3EwEV0YoVv-MI9J1NldKQuNsvMOHgoiFa8vi4HYiYhtcoK__Qek-v7gLhmVQuUjJjlAAbtbKHrHfthPvYh_0tzeIYbctbJ5sMcXWLODYVNmWQTtNjdMxdXgtRKxUc-Q7Q8fS440QKxtq-afQeP7FOdlv65dgDeNepI4g9MLp6HTAi-PTA40DZiDUGqf8Gwce49vUSUi11XHM_xo4kecLMnwFkt8dC0QMY1avpVlavuYL8CGfkYtbkJfBvOhSNer4YZcrn6U5AmbCdtsFImfGfZt2sg Download .mp4 (23.28 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Instructions for Using the Stackjoint Website, Related to STAR Methods We focused on the 108 genomic loci at which common variants exhibited genome-wide significant associations in the largest schizophrenia case/control analysis (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar), choosing 132 genes to mutate and phenotype in zebrafish (Figure 1A, Table S1, Table S2). For gene-rich loci, numerous candidate genes were individually mutated (Figure 1B). Criteria for choosing genes to mutate included nervous system expression (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3669) Google Scholar) and human data that further implicated them in neuropsychiatric illness, such as patient exome sequencing or postmortem brain analyses of gene expression or chromatin conformation (Fromer et al., 2016Fromer M.

While some candidates had known neurobiological functions, we mutated many minimally studied genes based only on nervous system expression (Table S1). Twenty-nine of the 132 genes were strongly implicated by multiple lines of previous research or were the only candidate within and neighboring their respective locus (Figure 1C), and therefore were considered “unambiguously associated” with schizophrenia (Figure 1D, Table S1). These included well-known genes such as calcium channel subunits and the NMDA receptor subunit grin2a, minimally characterized brain-expressed candidates from single-gene loci such as znf536 (Figure 1C) and znf804a, and genes implicated by CommonMind postmortem patient brain expression data (Fromer et al., 2016Fromer M.

For example, at locus 83 we mutated foxg1, even though it is almost 1 megabase from the associated region, instead of the closer prkd1 because (1) the region overlaps with a known FOXG1 enhancer (Allou et al., 2012Allou L.

The criteria for gene choices at every locus are described in Table S1. We used Cas9 and multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) to mutagenize a conserved part of each protein near the N terminus, predicted to result in substantial truncations (Figure 1E, Figure 1F, genepile.com/scz_gwas108). Only two homozygous mutants, cacna1c and slc32a1 (Stainier et al., 1996Stainier D.Y. Fouquet B. Chen J.N. Warren K.S. Weinstein B.M. Meiler S.E. Mohideen M.A. Neuhauss S.C. Solnica-Krezel L.

An additional 24 zebrafish mutants (18%) were lethal or underdeveloped by adulthood but appeared healthy at 6 dpf (Table S2). At this larval stage the animal is small enough for high-throughput studies, has complex behaviors (e.g., hunting, sleeping, learning, navigating), and major adult neuron types are present (Pandey et al., 2018Pandey S. Shekhar K. Regev A. Schier A.F. Comprehensive Identification and Spatial Mapping of Habenular Neuronal Types Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq.Curr. Biol. 2018; 28: 1052-1065 e1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More than half of all mutants had phenotypes in brain activity or behavior (Figure 1G, Table S2, Figure S1, Figure S2), including more than 75% of those for unambiguously associated genes (Figure 1H). The presence and severity of brain activity and behavioral phenotypes were often, but not always, correlated (Figure 1G, Figure 1I).Figure S2Quantification and Analysis. Defining Behavioral Phenotypes, Related to Figure 1, Figure 2, STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Determination of cutoff for the number of behavioral assays with a significant (< 0.05) p value. A total of 71 assays were analyzed (Figure 2, STAR Methods). The mutant mir137 was chosen as the lower end of the cutoff, having a significant phenotype in 28 of the 71 assays. This mutant has a repeatable increased velocity of motion, shown here for two time windows: heat stressor and dark flashes. A second example of a mutant at the cutoff is csmd1, which has a repeatable reduction in frequency of movement (shown here with day taps time window and entire assay). Data is expressed as mean ± SEM. Avoiding falsely designating a mutant as having a phenotype required determining a cutoff for the number of assays (out of 71) that must be significant (28). Our goal was a false-discovery rate of less than 10%, where 7 or less of the 71 assays would be significant false-positives for any comparison. However, multiple comparisons were performed for duplicated genes and when two heterozygous parents were crossed (i.e., homozygous larvae were compared both to heterozygous and to wild-type). Therefore, to correct for multiple comparisons we increased the cutoff to four times higher (28). This stringent cutoff may result in false negatives, but was confirmed to define mutants with specific and repeatable differences, such as shown here, as having a phenotype.(B) The 71 assays (described in detail in the STAR Methods) included Frequency of movement, Features of movement, and Location in the well for each of the 14 time sections and full 2-day assay, for a total of 45 baseline assays. The remaining 26 assays were stimulus-driven: prepulse, weak, and strong taps during the night and day (12 assays), tap habituation (4 assays, 3 day and one night), light flashes (2 assays, one day and one night), and dark flashes (8 assays; 4 blocks, beginning and end ten flashes analyzed separately). Each of the p values in the 71 assays is based on multiple “metrics,” which were merged to determine significance. Multiple metrics were required to be significant for the entire assay to achieve significance (see C). Two examples of each type of metric are shown for each of these assay types, and all metrics are described in the STAR Methods. One complete example of the output of the merging procedure is available in Table S3, with p values for the merged dataset and p values for each individual metric. These p values for the 71 assays do not take reproducibility across independent experiments into account (the lowest p value of all comparisons and experiments is shown). Reproducibility was accounted for in the dataset of 46 mutants that were tested more than once and were designated as having a phenotype (Figure 2G). If two runs had a significant p value in the same time window or same stimulus assay of the 71 tested assays, then the phenotype was considered reproducible and nine final values were generated.(C) Significance in each of the 71 assays required that multiple contributing and similar metrics (raw data) were significant. We determined how many individual metrics in an assay must be significant for the assay (of the 71 assays) to be scored as significant by comparing randomized groups of wild-type larvae. Three separate batches of wild-type larvae were put through the standard behavioral protocol and analysis. Three comparisons were conducted for each of the three batches (two comparisons with a total of 48 larvae and one with 96). Based on all nine wild-type larvae comparisons, we determined that if more than three (gray dashed line) individual p value metrics were significant, then less than 10% of 71 assays would be false positives. The merged p values for stimulus response (blue points) included many more metrics than Frequency, Features, and Location (green points) making them more prone to false positive outcomes. These assays represent close to half of the false positives, while they make up 1/3 of the assays (26/71). To further minimize such false positives in the stimulus response assays, the threshold was set to > 4 with the exception that it would be reduced to > 2 in the case that the exact same metric (e.g., velocity) were significant across two related assays (e.g., light flashes at night and during the day). This reduction in the cutoff was important because highly specific phenotypes, such as changes only in the latency of the dark flash response, were designated as non-significant when the cutoff value was set to 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S3Supporting data for Figure 2 and Figure 5 Behavioral Plots, Related to Figure 2, Figure 5Show full caption(A) Repeats for behavioral data in Figure 2.

The x axis label of the heatmap describes the genotypes being compared in each column; e.g., homhom corresponding to (-/-;-/-) or hethet corresponding to (+/-;+/-). The majority involve 5 comparisons because the parent crosses were either homhom x hethet or homhet x hethom. A small minority included less than 5 comparisons due to experimental limitations.(A) Behavioral phenotypes, as described for Figure 2F for 31 of the 33 duplicated genes. If a mutant was repeated, the lowest combined p value is shown here. The two mutants that were generated but not tested were foxg1b and bcl11bb because foxg1a and bcl11ba were found to have extremely strong (and lethal) phenotypes, and assays were completed with the “b” alleles as homozygous in the background of the “a” allele comparisons. We presume that the “a” orthologs of these two genes have more conserved functions, as their phenotypes resembled mammalian knockouts (Figure 3C).(B) Brain activity phenotypes, showing the signal in each of the four major brain regions with the color corresponding to the direction of the activity change in the brain activity maps. Prior to dividing the signal in each region by the total signal, the regions were scaled relative to each other based on their respective sizes (rhombencephalon = ∗1, diencephalon = ∗1.76, mesencephalon = ∗1.42, telencephalon = ∗4.36). The original whole brain signal was separately scaled across all mutants with a phenotype, indicating the relevance of the signal in each of the regions. Thirty of the 33 duplicated genes are included in the analysis, as bcl11b and foxg1 are missing (see panel A) and cacnb2b was identified as the ortholog with the much stronger (and lethal) phenotype compared to cacnb2a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S5Comparison between in situ RNA Localization and Brain Activity, Related to Figure 4Show full captionStacks of all RNA-FISH images are available on http://stackjoint.com/basic/ and are tagged as “Thyme, 2018.” Probe sequences are available on http://genepile.com/scz_gwas108.

https://openalex.org/W2922624791,"Autophagy is required in diverse paradigms of lifespan extension, leading to the prevailing notion that autophagy is beneficial for longevity. However, why autophagy is harmful in certain contexts remains unexplained. Here, we show that mitochondrial permeability defines the impact of autophagy on aging. Elevated autophagy unexpectedly shortens lifespan in C. elegans lacking serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase-1 (sgk-1) because of increased mitochondrial permeability. In sgk-1 mutants, reducing levels of autophagy or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening restores normal lifespan. Remarkably, low mitochondrial permeability is required across all paradigms examined of autophagy-dependent lifespan extension. Genetically induced mPTP opening blocks autophagy-dependent lifespan extension resulting from caloric restriction or loss of germline stem cells. Mitochondrial permeability similarly transforms autophagy into a destructive force in mammals, as liver-specific Sgk knockout mice demonstrate marked enhancement of hepatocyte autophagy, mPTP opening, and death with ischemia/reperfusion injury. Targeting mitochondrial permeability may maximize benefits of autophagy in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2929526317,"Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent that is commonly used to treat a broad range of cancers. However, significant cardiotoxicity, associated with prolonged exposure to doxorubicin, limits its continued therapeutic use. One strategy to prevent the uptake of doxorubicin into cardiac cells is the encapsulation of the drug to prevent non-specific uptake and also to improve the drugs’ pharmacokinetic properties. Although encapsulated forms of doxorubicin limit the cardiotoxicity observed, they are not without their own liabilities as an increased amount of drug is deposited in the skin where liposomal doxorubicin can cause palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Exosomes are small endogenous extracellular vesicles, that transfer bioactive material from one cell to another, and are considered attractive drug delivery vehicles due to their natural origin. In this study, we generated doxorubicin-loaded exosomes and demonstrate their rapid cellular uptake and re-distribution of doxorubicin from endosomes to the cytoplasm and nucleus resulting in enhanced potency in a number of cultured and primary cell lines when compared to free doxorubicin and liposomal formulations of doxorubicin. In contrast to other delivery methods for doxorubicin, exosomes do not accumulate in the heart, thereby providing potential for limiting the cardiac side effects and improved therapeutic index."
https://openalex.org/W2929898295,"Throughout mammalian neocortex, layer 5 pyramidal (L5) cells project via the pons to a vast number of cerebellar granule cells (GrCs), forming a fundamental pathway. Yet, it is unknown how neuronal dynamics are transformed through the L5→GrC pathway. Here, by directly comparing premotor L5 and GrC activity during a forelimb movement task using dual-site two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we found that in expert mice, L5 and GrC dynamics were highly similar. L5 cells and GrCs shared a common set of task-encoding activity patterns, possessed similar diversity of responses, and exhibited high correlations comparable to local correlations among L5 cells. Chronic imaging revealed that these dynamics co-emerged in cortex and cerebellum over learning: as behavioral performance improved, initially dissimilar L5 cells and GrCs converged onto a shared, low-dimensional, task-encoding set of neural activity patterns. Thus, a key function of cortico-cerebellar communication is the propagation of shared dynamics that emerge during learning."

The upstream UPR constituents pancreatic EIF2-α kinase (PERK) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) have been reported to mediate these effects, suggesting that UPR may stimulate autophagy via PERK and IRE1. However, how the UPR and its components affect autophagic activity has not been thoroughly examined. By analyzing the flux of LC3 through the autophagic pathway, as well as the sequestration and degradation of autophagic cargo, we here conclusively show that the classical ER stressor tunicamycin (TM) enhances autophagic activity in mammalian cells. PERK and its downstream factor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), were crucial for this induction, but surprisingly, IRE1 constitutively suppressed autophagic activity. TM-induced autophagy required autophagy-related 13 (ATG13), Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinases 1/2 (ULK1/ULK2), and GABA type A receptor–associated proteins (GABARAPs), but interestingly, LC3 proteins appeared to be redundant. Strikingly, ATF4 was activated independently of PERK in both LNCaP and HeLa cells, and our further examination revealed that ATF4 and PERK regulated autophagy through separate mechanisms. Specifically, whereas ATF4 controlled transcription and was essential for autophagosome formation, PERK acted in a transcription-independent manner and was required at a post-sequestration step in the autophagic pathway. In conclusion, our results indicate that TM-induced UPR activates functional autophagy, and whereas IRE1 is a negative regulator, PERK and ATF4 are required at distinct steps in the autophagic pathway.

Here, we used reconstituted 26S proteasomes with unnatural amino-acid-attached fluorophores in a series of FRET- and anisotropy-based assays to probe substrate-proteasome interactions, the individual steps of the processing pathway, and the conformational state of the proteasome itself. We develop a complete kinetic picture of proteasomal degradation, which reveals that the engagement steps prior to substrate commitment are fast relative to subsequent deubiquitination, translocation, and unfolding.

Specific protein degradation is essential for quality control, homeostasis, and the regulation of diverse cellular processes, such as the cell cycle and stress response (Chen et al., 2011Chen B.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6880) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, this degradation is primarily catalyzed by the 26S proteasome, which recognizes, unfolds, and degrades proteins that have been modified with lysine-attached poly-ubiquitin chains (Bard et al., 2018Bard J.A.M.

To accomplish its dual roles in quality control and signaling, the proteasome must be able to degrade certain proteins consistently and under tight kinetic constraints, while maintaining a high promiscuity necessary to process thousands of polypeptides with diverse characteristics, yet avoiding unregulated proteolysis of cellular proteins in general. This precise regulation is accomplished by the proteasome’s complex molecular architecture and a bipartite degradation signal for substrate recognition that consists of suitable poly-ubiquitin modifications and an unstructured initiation region of appropriate length and sequence composition (Fishbain et al., 2011Fishbain S.

Based on available structural and biochemical information, we can infer the processing steps necessary for substrate degradation, which include the binding of ubiquitin to a proteasomal receptor, insertion of the unstructured initiation region into the central processing pore, the removal of ubiquitin chains, and the unfolding and translocation of the polypeptide into the 20S core particle for proteolysis. Substrate access to the sequestered proteolytic active sites is controlled by the 19S regulatory particle that caps one or both ends of the 20S core (Groll et al., 2000Groll M. Bajorek M. Köhler A.

While the s1 state is the primary conformation adopted by the ATP-bound proteasome in the absence of protein substrate, the s3-like state appears more conducive to processive degradation and can be stabilized by stalling a substrate during translocation (de la Peña et al., 2018de la Peña A.H.

In this degradation-competent s3-like state, the central channel of the motor aligns with the N-ring and the entrance to the 20S core, and the ATPase ring is more planar with uniform interfaces between neighboring Rpt subunits (Matyskiela et al., 2013Matyskiela M.E.

Similar s3-like states have also been observed by incubating the proteasome with nucleotide analogs such as ATPγS (Śledź et al., 2013Śledź P. Unverdorben P. Beck F. Pfeifer G. Schweitzer A.

Despite this wealth of structural information, it remains elusive what induces the proteasome to switch from the s1 to the s3-like states, and how these distinct conformations are coordinated with the substrate-processing pathway. Furthermore, little is known about the relative timing and coordination of individual degradation steps, which limits our understanding of how the proteasome determines the turnover kinetics for particular substrates, how it can establish general protein homeostasis, and what step is rate limiting. Finally, numerous substrates have been observed to resist degradation by the proteasome, but the mechanisms underlying this discrimination are still unclear (Fishbain et al., 2011Fishbain S.

Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 14526-14539Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we reveal the complete kinetic picture of substrate processing by the 26S proteasome. We designed a series of fluorescence- and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assays to specifically measure the kinetics of individual degradation steps in a fully reconstituted and thus well-controlled system, without contamination by additional regulatory proteins such as the deubiquitinase Ubp6 (Hu et al., 2005Hu M. Li P. Song L. Jeffrey P.D. Chenova T.A. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Shi Y. Structure and mechanisms of the proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme USP14.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These novel tools allowed us to track the interactions between a substrate’s initiation region and the AAA+ motor, the conformational changes of the proteasome, substrate deubiquitination by Rpn11, and cleavage into peptides. Our results reveal the rate-limiting step of degradation, identify the trigger for the proteasome’s conformational switch from the s1 to the s3 state, and elucidate the regulation of Rpn11’s deubiquitination activity. Furthermore, we analyzed the degradation effects of varying substrate characteristics, including the stability of the folded domain, the number of ubiquitin chains, and the length and composition of the unstructured initiation region, offering new insights into how the proteasome selects and prioritizes its substrates in a complex cellular environment. To deconvolute individual steps of substrate degradation and track the coupled conformational changes of the proteasome, we sought to develop FRET-based assays sensitive to specific processing events. One requirement for these assays was the ability to site-specifically attach fluorophores to the 19S regulatory particle with minimal perturbations. We thus devised a method for the incorporation and labeling of 4-azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae base and lid sub-complexes using previously established heterologous expression systems (Figure 1A) (Amiram et al., 2015Amiram M.

To increase the labeling specificity, solvent-exposed cysteines were reversibly protected before reacting the incorporated AzF with a dibenzocyclooctyne-linked fluorophore (van Geel et al., 2012van Geel R.

Published cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the 26S proteasome revealed major conformational changes between the substrate-free and substrate-processing states, yet it remains unclear how these transitions are coupled to specific degradation steps. We identified the lid subunit Rpn9 and the N-terminal coiled coil of the base subunits Rpt4 and Rpt5 as promising positions for the placement of a donor-acceptor pair to directly monitor the proteasome conformational dynamics through FRET (Figure 1C). As the lid rotates relative to the base during the transition to a substrate-engaged state, the distance between Rpn9 and the N-terminal helix of Rpt5 decreases by almost 40 Å, and we predicted that the FRET efficiency for fluorophores at these positions would increase accordingly. Proteasomes were thus reconstituted using lid with donor-labeled Rpn9-S111AzF and base with acceptor-labeled Rpt5-Q49AzF, and bulk FRET efficiencies were measured under steady-state conditions (Figure 1D). Incubation with the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analog ATPγS has previously been shown to induce the substrate engaged-like s3 state (Śledź et al., 2013Śledź P. Unverdorben P. Beck F. Pfeifer G. Schweitzer A. Förster F. Baumeister W. Structure of the 26S proteasome with ATP-γS bound provides insights into the mechanism of nucleotide-dependent substrate translocation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 7264-7269Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and it correspondingly caused a significant increase in FRET compared to proteasome in ATP (Figure 1D). Interaction with ubiquitin-bound Ubp6 has also been found to shift the conformational equilibrium toward the substrate-engaged state (Aufderheide et al., 2015Aufderheide A. Beck F. Stengel F. Hartwig M. Schweitzer A. Pfeifer G. Goldberg A.L. Sakata E. Baumeister W. Förster F. Structural characterization of the interaction of Ubp6 with the 26S proteasome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ubp6 deubiquitinase controls conformational dynamics and substrate degradation of the 26S proteasome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which was confirmed by our assay showing an increase in FRET efficiency when catalytically inactive Ubp6 was added together with tetra-ubiquitin. There was no change in FRET, however, upon addition of 100 μM unanchored ubiquitin chains. Despite binding to proteasomal receptors, as indicated by their inhibition of substrate degradation (Figure S1B), these unanchored chains hence do not induce a conformational change of the proteasome. We then measured the FRET signal of actively degrading proteasomes and observed an increase similar to that of proteasomes trapped in the s3 state by ATPγS. The signal increased further upon addition of ubiquitinated substrate in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (oPA), an inhibitor of the deubiquitinating enzyme Rpn11 (Verma et al., 2002Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Role of Rpn11 metalloprotease in deubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteasome.Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Preventing Rpn11-mediated deubiquitination inhibits degradation by stalling substrate translocation through the central channel, most likely when the attached ubiquitin chain reaches the narrow entrance to the N-ring pore, thus trapping and synchronizing proteasomes in a substrate engaged state (Worden et al., 2017Worden E.J. Dong K.C. Martin A. An AAA Motor-Driven Mechanical Switch in Rpn11 Controls Deubiquitination at the 26S Proteasome.Mol. Cell. 2017; 67: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We conclude that actively processing proteasomes spend most of the time in an s3-like conformation. While the steady-state FRET-based assay confirmed that actively degrading proteasomes switch away from the s1 state, it provided no information about when this switch occurs. To determine the relationship between the conformational change and specific processing steps, and to gain insight into the overall coordination of substrate degradation, we developed a series of fluorescence-based assays for measuring detailed kinetics (Figure 2). Our model substrate, titin-I27V15P-23-K-35, was constructed from a titin-I27 domain containing the destabilizing V15P mutation and a C-terminal unstructured region with a single lysine for ubiquitin-chain attachment in a defined position, leaving a 3"

Here, we show that Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine, negatively regulates hair growth by signaling through JAK-STAT5 to maintain HFSC quiescence. Genetic deletion of the OSM receptor or STAT5 can induce premature HFSC activation, suggesting that the resting telogen stage is actively maintained by the hair follicle niche. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the OSM source is not intrinsic to the hair follicle itself and is instead a subset of TREM2+ macrophages that is enriched within the resting follicle and deceases immediately prior to HFSC activation. In vivo inhibition of macrophage function was sufficient to induce HFSC proliferation and hair cycle induction. Together these results clarify how JAK-STAT signaling actively inhibits hair growth."

Genomic features influenced outcome, with NPM1 mutations and HOXB9 overexpression being associated with a favorable prognosis and TP53, FLT3 or RB1 alterations associated with poor survival. Targetable signaling mutations were present in 45% of cases and included recurrent mutations of ALK and NTRK1, the latter of which drives erythroid leukemogenesis sensitive to TRK inhibition. This genomic landscape of AEL provides the framework for accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of this disease, and the rationale for testing targeted therapies in this high-risk leukemia."

Their muscle dysfunction and pathology is, however, less severe than in patients with DMD, which complicates preclinical studies. Recent discoveries indicate that disease severity is exacerbated when muscular dystrophy mouse models are generated on a DBA2/J genetic background. Knowledge on the natural history of animal models is pivotal for high-quality preclinical testing. However, for BL10-mdx mice on a DBA2/J background (D2-mdx), limited data are available. We addressed this gap in the natural history knowledge. First, we compared histopathological aspects in skeletal muscles of young D2-mdx, BL10-mdx, and wild-type mice. Pathology was more pronounced in D2-mdx mice and differed in severity between muscles within individuals. Secondly, we subjected D2-mdx mice to a functional test regime for 34 weeks and identified that female D2-mdx mice outperform severely impaired males, making females less useful for functional preclinical studies. Direct comparisons between 10- and 34-wk-old D2-mdx mice revealed that disease pathology ameliorates with age. Heart pathology was progressive, with some features already evident at a young age. This natural history study of the D2-mdx mouse will be instrumental for experimental design of future preclinical studies.-Van Putten, M., Putker, K., Overzier, M., Adamzek, W.

Our findings have profound implications for currently proposed control strategies aimed at suppressing mosquito populations. Blood feeding behavior has evolved independently in multiple insect taxa as a means to acquire the necessary nutrient resources for successful reproduction. Although increasing insect reproductive fitness, the evolution of this behavior has inadvertently provided a new and effective transmission route for a multitude of human pathogens, including the mosquito-borne dengue and Zika viruses as well as Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria. Unquestionably, the most lethal of these pathogens is Plasmodium falciparum, yearly killing more than 420,000 people, mostly young African children, via the bite of highly effective anopheline species (WHO, 2018WHOWorld Malaria Report. World Health Organization, 2018Google Scholar). The blood meal-triggered events that lead to egg development have been comprehensively characterized in the arboviral mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. In this species, blood feeding initiates the release of ovarian ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH) (Brown et al., 1998Brown M.R. Graf R. Swiderek K.M. Fendley D. Stracker T.H. Champagne D.E. Lea A.O.

Upon binding to its nuclear receptor, the heterodimer ecdysone receptor (EcR)/ultraspiracle (USP), 20E triggers a vast transcriptional program that promotes the accumulation of lipids and other nutrients in the ovaries via the function of the lipid transporter lipophorin (Lp) and the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg), leading to egg development (Raikhel, 1992Raikhel A.S.

In A. gambiae, the 2- to 3-day period needed for egg development is also critical for the successful establishment of Plasmodium parasite infection in the midgut (Mitchell and Catteruccia, 2017Mitchell S.N.

Med. 2017; 7: a025593Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Shortly after ingestion, within the blood meal, male and female gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote that then transforms during the next 21–24 h into a motile ookinete that traverses the midgut epithelium before encysting beneath the midgut basal lamina and differentiating into an oocyst. During this transition, the parasite is subject to attack by the mosquito innate immune system, including lysis triggered by the complement-like thioester-containing protein TEP1 (Blandin et al., 2004Blandin S.

After an additional 7–10 days, surviving Plasmodium oocysts rupture to release thousands of sporozoites that invade the salivary glands and are injected into another human host at the mosquito’s next blood meal. The time from ingestion to infectivity in the mosquito is known as the parasite extrinsic incubation period (EIP), and it is a key component of malaria transmission; faster parasites have a higher chance of being transmitted, given the short lifespan of Anopheles females (MacDonald, 1956MacDonald G.

During the initial phases of infection, Plasmodium parasites are exposed to rapidly changing physiological conditions largely regulated by the function of ecdysteroid hormones and may be substantially affected by this blood meal-induced physiological “storm.” However, whether they utilize available nutritional resources or compete for them with their mosquito hosts remains unclear.

Dabire R. Yameogo B. Da D.F. Michalakis Y. Cohuet A. Stress dependent infection cost of the human malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum on its natural vector Anopheles coluzzii.Infect. Genet. Evol. 2014; 25: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we show that development of P. falciparum parasites in the A. gambiae female is intimately linked to physiological processes modulated by 20E during egg development. By analyzing both egg and parasite numbers in individual females, we unveil an unexpected positive correlation between mosquito and parasite fitness that is dependent on 20E signaling. Although impairing oogenesis by multiple manipulations of 20E function decreases oocyst numbers, parasites respond to these metabolic changes by increasing their speed of development, becoming infectious sooner. Although faster growth depends on mosquito lipid resources via the lipid transporter Lp, it does not impair the mosquito oogenesis cycle, indicating that parasites use surplus nutrients that are not required for host reproduction. Thus, our data suggest that P. falciparum has adopted an evolutionary strategy that minimizes reproductive costs to its natural mosquito vector, partly explaining the formidable spread of these parasites in sub-Saharan Africa. These findings have important implications for malaria control strategies targeting mosquito reproduction. To determine whether Plasmodium infections are linked to the reproductive fitness of the mosquito vector, we infected A. gambiae (G3 strain) females with a P. falciparum culture (NF54 strain) and then counted both the number of eggs developed in the ovaries and the number of oocysts present in the midgut of each individual female 8 days post-infectious blood meal (pIBM). Surprisingly, when we plotted the paired egg-parasite data and performed a correlation analysis, we found that oogenesis and intensity of infection were positively correlated (Figure 1A), demonstrating a positive link between these two processes, in contrast to the theory of vector-parasite competition predicting costs of infection on mosquito reproduction (Schwenke et al., 2016Schwenke R.A. Lazzaro B.P. Wolfner M.F. Reproduction-Immunity Trade-Offs in Insects.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2016; 61: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This correlation was observed independent of mosquito size, approximated by measuring wing length (Spearman’s ρ = 0.3224, n = 106, p = 0.0007), and, therefore, independent of blood meal volume. To understand the nature of the egg-parasite correlation, we next explored whether successful establishment of P. falciparum infection depends on the presence of fully functional ovaries. To this end, we generated transgenic A. gambiae females (Δzpg) in which zero population growth (zpg), a gene essential for germ cell development (Tazuke et al., 2002Tazuke S.I. Schulz C. Gilboa L. Fogarty M. Mahowald A.P. Guichet A. Ephrussi A. Wood C.G. Lehmann R. Fuller M.T.

Magnusson K. Godfray H.C.J. Crisanti A. Catteruccia F. Spermless males elicit large-scale female responses to mating in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 13677-13681Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was mutated by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis (Figure 1B). As expected, Δzpg females had ablated or severely underdeveloped ovaries and largely failed to produce eggs after a blood meal (Figure 1C). When fed P. falciparum-infected blood, Δzpg mutant females that failed to develop eggs showed significantly fewer oocysts compared with control siblings (Figure 1D), and again, this effect was independent of body size (Mann-Whitney test: oocysts ÷ wing length3, U = 257.5, p = 0.0241). There was no difference in the prevalence of infection between the two groups (Figure 1D). The reduced oocyst load observed in Δzpg mutants suggests that parasite development relies on processes that are regulated by the correct function of ovarian tissues. Given the key role of 20E in oogenesis, we went on to assess whether the function of this steroid hormone affects parasite numbers. As a first step, we determined ecdysteroid levels in Δzpg mutant females 26 h and 36 h post-blood meal (pBM), around the peak of 20E synthesis (Redfern, 1982Redfern C.P.F. 20-Hydroxy-ecdysone and ovarian development in Anopheles stephensi.J. Insect Physiol. 1982; 28: 97-109Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and found severely reduced titers, as we had hypothesized, given that multiple steps of 20E synthesis occur in the ovaries (Figure 1E). To provide a direct link between 20E levels and Plasmodium infection, we then experimentally lowered ecdysteroid levels in A. gambiae by injecting wild-type females with ecdysone 22-oxidase (E22O), which oxidizes 20E (and its precursor E) in the C22 position, reducing its activity (Kamimura et al., 2012Kamimura M. Saito H. Niwa R. Niimi T. Toyoda K. Ueno C. Kanamori Y. Shimura S. Kiuchi M. Fungal ecdysteroid-22-oxidase, a new tool for manipulating ecdysteroid signaling and insect development.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 16488-16498Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Females injected with E22O showed a 4-fold decrease in ecdysteroid levels 26 h pBM (Figure 2A). Moreover, E22O injections prior to P. falciparum infection negatively affected egg development (Figure 2B) and also significantly reduced oocyst intensities, whereas the prevalence of infection remained unaffected (Figure 2C). These data provide additional evidence that 20E may regulate mosquito processes important for P. falciparum development. Although E22O-injected females had limited reproductive fitness and reduced parasite loads, these females maintained a positive correlation between eggs and oocysts (Spearman’s ρ = 0.2989, n = 109, p = 0.0016; Figure 2D). However, when we disrupted steroid hormone signaling, rather than 20E levels, by RNAi silencing of the heterodimeric nuclear receptor EcR/USP, this correlation was lost. Although we could still observe decreased egg and parasite loads in females injected with double-stranded RNA targeting EcR (dsEcR) compared with dsGFP-injected controls (dsCntrl) (Figures 3A and 3B ; STAR Methods), the number of oocysts in the midgut became unlinked from the number of eggs developed in the ovaries (Spearman’s ρ = 0.1737, n = 107, p > 0.05; Figure 3C). We verified that 20E signaling was successfully suppressed in dsEcR females by detecting reduced transcripts of Vg (Figure 3D), which is normally induced by 20E through its nuclear receptor after blood feeding (Raikhel, 1992Raikhel A.S. Vitellogenesis in mosquitoes.in: Harris K.F. Advances in Disease Vector Research. Springer, 1992: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, the correlation between eggs and oocysts was also lost after silencing the 20E co-receptor USP (Spearman’s ρ = 0.1556, n = 95, p > 0.05; Figure 3E), confirming that the positive interaction between mosquito and parasite fitness depends on signaling pathways controlled by 20E via its nuclear receptor. To establish when P. falciparum parasite numbers are reduced following disrupted 20E signaling, we analyzed earlier developmental stages in dsEcR and control females by microscopy. We dissected midguts 24 h and 48 h pIBM and, after eliminating the blood bolus, performed immunofluorescence assays using an antibody targeting the P. falciparum Pfs25 surface protein to determine the number of ookinetes crossing the midgut and the number of early oocysts, respectively. Although ookinete numbers were unaffected (Figure 4A), we detected a significant reduction in early oocysts in dsEcR females (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistent with the lack of an observed effect on ookinete numbers, co-silencing of TEP1, the major immune effector that kills ookinetes during midgut invasion, did not rescue the number of oocysts in dsEcR/dsTEP1 co-injected females (Figure 4D). 20E signaling, therefore, affects parasites during their transition into oocysts via TEP1-independent mechanisms. When analyzing Plasmodium infections in midguts 7–8 days pIBM, we noticed that dsEcR females had larger oocysts than controls, which was confirmed by measuring the cross-sectional area of individual oocysts (Figures 5A and 5B ). This effect was observed throughout oocyst development, as early as 5 days pIBM, the first time point when we could reliably measure parasite size. By 12 days pIBM, when some oocysts had burst to release sporozoites, there was no longer a difference between the two groups (Figure 5B). Increased size was not the result of reduced competition between parasites at lower intensities because we observed no correlation between oocyst size and numbers (dsEcR: Spearman’s ρ = 0.1103, n = 77, p > 0.05; dsGFP: Spearman’s ρ = 0.0444, n = 75, p > 0.05). Larger oocysts may represent faster-developing parasites or may be the consequence of an aberrant developmental program. To address this question, we analyzed sporozoite prevalence and intensity in female salivary glands over time. Consistent with accelerated oocyst growth, sporozoites were detectable earlier and in greater numbers after perturbing 20E signaling. EcR-silenced females were 2.67 times more likely to have sporozoites in the glands than controls 10 days pIBM (odds ratio: 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–6.25; Figure 5C), an early time point for sporozoite invasion of salivary glands. Infection intensities were also elevated in dsEcR females 12 days pIBM, whereas, by 14 days pIBM, the number of sporozoites was equal in both groups (Figure 5D). No difference was observed in the number of sporozoites per oocyst (Table S1), showing that the higher prevalence and intensity of infection observed in dsEcR females were due to accelerated growth rather than increased oocyst productivity. Faster parasite growth could potentially occur at the expense of sporozoite fitness, causing reduced infectivity to the human host. We therefore assessed whether sporozoites collected from the salivary glands of dsEcR females were infectious to primary human hepatocytes, a well-established in vitro method to measure P. falciparum infectivity to humans (Mazier et al., 1985Mazier D. Beaudoin R.L. Mellouk S. Druilhe P. Texier B. Trosper J. Miltgen F. Landau I. Paul C.

Sporozoites dissected from dsEcR females 12 days pIBM were as able to invade and infect primary human hepatocytes as controls, as determined by the quantification of exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs) (Figure 5E). Consistently, we did not find any differences in sporozoite gliding motility or cell invasion, demonstrating the equivalent fitness of these faster-developing sporozoites (Figures S1A and S1B). Sporozoites from EcR-silenced females remained as infective as controls at later time points (18 days pIBM) (Figures S1C–S1E). We used our prevalence data to extrapolate the length of sporogonic development in the two groups and found that the EIP50 (median time when 50% of mosquitoes are infectious) of EcR-silenced females was significantly reduced compared with controls (Figure 5F). Importantly, increased parasite growth was also detected in E22O-injected and Δzpg mutant females (Figures S2A and S2B). Moreover, E22O-injected females were 2.09 times more likely than controls to have sporozoites in their salivary glands 11–12 days pIBM, similar to our observations after EcR silencing (odds ratio: 95% CI = 1.04–4.23; Figure S2C). Altogether, these data demonstrate that reducing 20E function shortens the EIP of P. falciparum in A. gambiae, a trait critical for parasite transmission by the mosquito vector. What factors could be inducing faster oocyst development after 20E manipulations? Previous work determined that silencing the lipid transporter Lp affects oocyst size (Rono et al., 2010Rono M.K. Whitten M.M. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Levashina E.A. Marois E.

Bittencourt-Cunha P.R. Nunes R.D. Shahabuddin M. Silva-Neto M.A. The major insect lipoprotein is a lipid source to mosquito stages of malaria parasite.Acta Trop. 2009; 109: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the Lp expression profile of EcR-silenced and control females and found that although, in controls, Lp transcripts peaked 12 h pBM before declining (similar to findings in Ae. aegypti; Sun et al., 2000Sun J. Hiraoka T. Dittmer N.T. Cho K.-H. Raikhel A.S. Lipophorin as a yolk protein precursor in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti.Insect Biochem. Mol.

There is no effect on infection prevalence (Fisher’s Exact) (P = prevalence of infection). In all panels where applicable, n corresponds to the sample size. Because mis-regulated Lp implies altered lipid trafficking, we next determined the lipid profile of midgut tissues 24 h and 48 h pBM. dsEcR midguts had a significantly higher lipid content 48 h pBM (Figure 6B), a time point when early oocysts are beginning development. Specifically, four lipid species were enriched after EcR silencing: triacylglycerides (TAGs), diacylglycerides (DAGs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) (Figure 6B; Figure S4A). Impairing 20E signaling thus results in a significantly altered midgut lipid profile following a blood meal. Given the parallel increases in lipid levels and Lp expression in EcR-depleted females, we next assessed whether lipid trafficking by this lipid transporter was responsible for faster oocyst growth. We silenced Lp alone and in combination with EcR and analyzed egg and parasite numbers as well as oocyst size. Strikingly, co-silencing of Lp and EcR largely suppressed the increase in oocyst size observed in dsEcR-injected females (Figure 6C), implicating lipid species transported by this lipoprotein in parasite development. In addition, Lp silencing reduced egg and oocyst numbers (Figures S3B and S3C), as previously shown (Vlachou et al., 2005Vlachou D. Schlegelmilch T. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C.

Upstream projections from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) to the hippocampus activate hD2R cells and can also decrease food intake.

We investigated how pathogens circumvent this obstacle to colonize the host. Utilizing enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), we show that host-attached bacteria obtain nutrients from infected host cell in a process we termed host nutrient extraction (HNE). We identified an inner-membrane protein complex, henceforth termed CORE, as necessary and sufficient for HNE. The CORE is a key component of the EPEC injectisome, however, here we show that it supports the formation of an alternative structure, composed of membranous nanotubes, protruding from the EPEC surface to directly contact the host. The injectisome and flagellum are evolutionarily related, both containing conserved COREs. Remarkably, CORE complexes of diverse ancestries, including distant flagellar COREs, could rescue HNE capacity of EPEC lacking its native CORE. Our results support the notion that HNE is a widespread virulence strategy, enabling pathogens to thrive in competitive niches."
https://openalex.org/W2951033593,"To achieve accurate spatial auditory perception, subjects typically require personal head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and the freedom for head movements. Loudspeaker-based virtual sound environments allow for realism without individualized measurements. To study audio-visual perception in realistic environments, the combination of spatially tracked head mounted displays (HMDs), also known as virtual reality glasses, and virtual sound environments may be valuable. However, HMDs were recently shown to affect the subjects’ HRTFs and thus might influence sound localization performance. Furthermore, due to limitations of the reproduction of visual information on the HMD, audio-visual perception might be influenced. Here, a sound localization experiment was conducted both with and without an HMD and with a varying amount of visual information provided to the subjects. Furthermore, interaural time and level difference errors (ITDs and ILDs) as well as spectral perturbations induced by the HMD were analyzed and compared to the perceptual localization data. The results showed a reduction of the localization accuracy when the subjects were wearing an HMD and when they were blindfolded. The HMD-induced error in azimuth localization was found to be larger in the left than in the right hemisphere. When visual information of the limited set of source locations was provided, the localization error induced by the HMD was found to be negligible. Presenting visual information of hand-location and room dimensions showed better sound localization performance compared to the condition with no visual information. The addition of possible source locations further improved the localization accuracy. Also adding pointing feedback in form of a virtual laser pointer improved the accuracy of elevation perception but not of azimuth perception."

Physiologically, protease activity is often regulated by endogenous inhibitors. Several metalloprotease families are regulated by the tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP) family of inhibitors, which in humans consist of four members (TIMP1–4) (14Brew K. Nagase H. The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): An ancient family with structural and functional diversity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803 (20080133): 55-7110.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.01.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Whereas all four TIMPs inhibit many members of the matrix metalloprotease family, ADAMTS1, 2, 4, and 5 are only inhibited by TIMP-3 (14Brew K. Nagase H. The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): An ancient family with structural and functional diversity.Biochim. Biophys.

For ADAMTS7, like most other ADAMTS family members, inhibition by TIMPs has not been investigated. The substrate specificity of ADAMTS7 is poorly characterized. Only two proteins, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) and thrombospondin 1, have previously been reported as substrates, without identification of cleavage sites (10Kessler T. Zhang L. Liu Z.

Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of the substrate repertoire and cleavage sites of ADAMTS7 has not been conducted. Knowledge of the cleavage sites is important for the understanding of the functional consequences of proteolysis. It can also guide the design of (therapeutic) inhibitors that derive selectivity and potency from mimicking substrate residues flanking the cleavage site. It is essential to identify the physiological targets of ADAMTS7 to enable a causal link to be established between ADAMTS7 function and CAD/atherosclerosis. To this end, we used terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), which is a method that employs the labeling of neo–N termini generated by proteolysis to identify and quantify cleavage products by MS-based proteomics (LC-MS/MS) (16Kleifeld O. Doucet A. auf dem Keller U. Prudova A. Schilling O. Kainthan R.K. Starr A.E. Foster L.J. Kizhakkedathu J.N. Overall C.M. Isotopic labeling of terminal amines in complex samples identifies protein N-termini and protease cleavage products.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 (20208520): 281-28810.1038/nbt.1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To study the substrate specificity of ADAMTS7, we employed TAILS. For this, recombinant ADAMTS7 and truncated variants thereof were generated and expressed (Fig. 1). The truncated variant ADAMTS7-Mu, which consists of the first 10 N-terminal domains, was expressed at the highest levels and was therefore used in this study. As a control for proteolysis, we generated an inactive variant, ADAMTS7-Mu(E389Q) in which the glutamic acid in the active site of the MP domain (Glu-389) is mutated to glutamine, a mutation commonly made to render metzincin proteases inactive (2Gomis-Rüth F.X. Catalytic domain architecture of metzincin metalloproteases.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19201757): 15353-1535710.1074/jbc.R800069200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As a source of endogenously expressed extracellular matrix substrates we used human fibroblasts. These were co-cultured with HEK cells stably transfected with either ADAMTS7-Mu or the inactive ADAMTS7-Mu(E389Q) for 48 h and the conditioned medium was used for iTRAQ labeling of new N termini that are generated by proteolysis. Analysis of the LC-MS/MS results identified 45 extracellular and transmembrane proteins that exhibited evidence of increased proteolysis in the presence of ADAMTS7-Mu versus ADAMTS7-Mu(E389Q) (Table S1). This list of candidate substrates includes proteins with a wide range of functions, such as collagenous and noncollagenous ECM proteins, growth factors, proteases, and cell surface receptors. Interestingly, ADAMTS7 itself was among the candidate substrates (Table S2), suggesting autolytic reactions. Although enrichment of neo–N termini in the presence of active ADAMTS7 suggests that the new N terminus results from proteolysis by ADAMTS7, targets require verification, as indirect effects such as the up-regulation or activation of other proteases provide alternative explanations. To verify that ADAMTS7 cleaves itself, as suggested by TAILS, we reassessed the Western blotting of one of the truncated ADAMTS7 variants, ADAMTS7-T4, which also showed potential evidence of autolysis (Fig. 1C). This variant lacks the highly glycosylated mucin-like domain, which greatly reduces the molecular weight (MW) of any C-terminal fragment arising from autolysis that can be detected with an anti-myc tag antibody (Ab). On Western blotting of ADAMTS7-T4, detecting with an anti-myc Ab, a band corresponding to the zymogen (>110 kDa), which has the Prodomain still attached, was resolved from the mature, active form (<110 kDa), which has the Prodomain removed (Fig. 2A). An unexpected, low-MW band of 45 kDa, we hypothesized, could be a product of autolysis. This band would correspond to a C-terminal cleavage product generated by autolysis in the Spacer domain. To confirm the identity of these bands, ADAMTS7-T4 was incubated with furin, a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase which is responsible for Prodomain removal in the ADAMTS family (1Somerville R.P. Longpré J.M. Apel E.D. Lewis R.M. Wang L.W. Sanes J.R. Leduc R. Apte S.S. ADAMTS7B, the full-length product of the ADAMTS7 gene, is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan containing a mucin domain.J.

The >110-kDa band, corresponding to the ADAMTS7 zymogen, disappeared after incubation with furin (Fig. 2A). In addition, the mature form (<110 kDa) and the suspected autolytic cleavage product (45 kDa), were both absent when the furin inhibitor Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK was added during expression. Moreover, a mutant in which the furin cleavage sites were mutated, FCSM (R68A/R70A/R232A/R236A), also showed the >110-kDa band (zymogen) only, which confirms that the Prodomain maintains latency and thus prevents generation of the 45-kDa autolytic cleavage product. The inactive ADAMTS7-T4(E389Q) variant also lacked the 45-kDa band, further confirming its generation depends on ADAMTS7 activity. To identify the scissile bond that is targeted in this autolytic reaction, we isolated the 45-kDa cleavage product for N-terminal sequencing. The N-terminal sequence was identified as “AANFL,” which matches an abundant autolytic product identified by TAILS (AANFLALR) (Table S2). This new N terminus is generated by autolysis at the Glu-732–Ala-733 bond in the Spacer domain. Interestingly, the adjacent and similar Glu-729–Val-730 bond is also a major target, as demonstrated by abundant VAEAANFLALR peptide identified by TAILS. As both the Glu-729–Val-730 and the Glu-732–Ala-733 bonds contain a glutamic acid residue in the P1 position, we mutated these to alanine to investigate the preference of ADAMTS7 for a glutamic acid residue in P1. The mutant ADAMTS7-T4(E729A/E732A) showed markedly reduced autolysis (Fig. 2B), showing that glutamic acid residues are better accommodated in the S1 pocket of ADAMTS7, compared with alanine. However, a faint 45-kDa band was still visible, showing that Ala in P1 permits proteolysis, but at a reduced rate. To visualize the location of these autolytic cleavage sites in the structure of ADAMTS7, we modeled the structure of the N-terminal domains of ADAMTS7 (MP-Spacer) using the structure of ADAMTS13 as a template. This revealed that the Glu-729–Val-730 and Glu-732–Ala-733 bonds are both present in what is predicted to be the surface-exposed β3-β4 loop of the Spacer domain, which is in line with their susceptibility to proteolysis (Fig. 3). This also suggests that the autolytic reaction may have functional consequences as this Spacer region contains a substrate-binding exosite in ADAMTS13 (18Pos W. Crawley J.T. Fijnheer R. Voorberg J.

In addition to the autolytic cleavage fragments, TAILS identified 45 other extracellular matrix proteins that exhibited evidence of increased proteolysis in the presence of active ADAMTS7 (Table S1). To confirm that these findings were a direct consequence of proteolysis by ADAMTS7, we selected candidate substrates for further study. Selection was based on the nature of the scissile bonds, the location of the cleavage within the protein, potential functional consequences of proteolysis, and tissue distribution. Two related proteins, the latent TGF-β–binding proteins (LTBP) 3 and 4 were cleaved at Glu-Val and Glu-Ala, respectively, matching the most prominent and confirmed autolytic cleavage sites in ADAMTS7 (Glu-729–Val-730 and Glu-732–Ala-733). A sequence alignment of the two proteins showed LTBP3 and LTBP4 were both cleaved in the same linker region, between the first EGF-like domain and the hybrid domain (Fig. 4A). That the cleavage appeared to occur in a linker region between domains suggested that proteolysis is expected to separate the two cleavage fragments. For LTBP4, this could potentially affect the function of LTBP4 in elastic fiber formation/organization. Physiologically, LTBP4 contributes to the deposition of tropoelastin on fibrillin-1 microfibrils (21Noda K. Dabovic B. Takagi K. Inoue T. Horiguchi M. Hirai M. Fujikawa Y. Akama T.O. Kusumoto K.

This occurs by binding of the N-terminal domains of LTBP4 to the fibulin-5/tropoelastin complex and binding of the C-terminal domains of LTBP4 to fibrillin-1 (22Robertson I.B. Horiguchi M. Zilberberg L. Dabovic B. Hadjiolova K. Rifkin D.B. Latent TGF-β-binding proteins.Matrix Biol. 2015; 47 (25960419): 44-5310.1016/j.matbio.2015.05.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cleavages by ADAMTS7, therefore, have the potential to separate the fibulin-5/elastin–binding region from its fibrillin-1–binding region, thereby disrupting its essential bridging function. Importantly, LTBP4 is also co-expressed with ADAMTS7 in the adult heart and lung (23Sterner-Kock A. Thorey I.S. Koli K. Wempe F. Otte J. Bangsow T. Kuhlmeier K. Kirchner T. Jin S. Keski-Oja J. Disruption of the gene encoding the latent transforming growth factor-β binding protein 4 (LTBP-4) causes abnormal lung development, cardiomyopathy, and colorectal cancer.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (12208849): 2264-227310.1101/gad.229102Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we decided to further investigate the apparent proteolysis of LTBP4 by ADAMTS7. An N-terminal fragment of LTBP4 (LTBP4S-A) that lacks domains C-terminal of the hybrid domain was expressed in HEK293T cells and the conditioned medium incubated with ADAMTS7-T8, ADAMTS7-Mu, or the inactive variant ADAMTS7-Mu(E389Q). Analysis by nonreducing Western blotting showed LTBP4S-A cleavage when incubated with ADAMTS7-Mu or ADAMTS7-T8 but not with the inactive control ADAMTS7-Mu(E389Q) (Fig. 4B). Coomassie Blue–stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified LTBP4S-A cleaved by 10 nm purified ADAMTS7-T8 showed multiple cleavage fragments after 8-h incubation (Fig. 4C). These results show that LTBP4 is cleaved by low nanomolar concentrations of ADAMTS7 and is therefore a potential physiological substrate. The presence of multiple bands following digestion of LTBP4 by ADAMTS7 suggests the presence of additional cleavage sites. Therefore, cleaved and uncleaved LTBP4S-A were labeled with tandem mass tags (TMT) at the N termini and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. TMT-labeled peptides (Table S3) revealed a total of 12 scissile bonds, predominantly containing hydrophobic residues Ala, Val, and Leu in P1′ (Fig. 4D), strongly suggesting these are the preferred residues in P1′ for ADAMTS7. P1 residues included Glu, but also Arg, Ala, Pro, and Gly. Inhibition of ADAMTS7 by endogenous metalloprotease inhibitors (TIMPs) has not been investigated. We therefore investigated if LTPB4S-A cleavage by ADAMTS7 can be specifically inhibited by TIMP members. This revealed that of the four TIMPs, TIMP-4 is the most potent inhibitor of ADAMTS7 (Fig. 5A). TIMP-3 showed moderate inhibition and TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 little to no inhibition. To quantify these differences, proteolysis was monitored by densitometry of LTBP4S-A on SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue. This showed that in this assay the apparent inhibition constant Ki(app) for TIMP-4 was 13 nm, compared with 49 nm for TIMP-3 and >100 nm for TIMP-2 (Fig. 5B). These findings confirm that for ADAMTS7, contrary to other ADAMTS family members, TIMP-4 is the most potent inhibitor. Recently, ADAMTS7 has emerged as a modifier of CAD (7Bauer R.C. Tohyama J. Cui J. Cheng L. Yang J. Zhang X. Ou K. Paschos G.K. Zheng X.L. Parmacek M.S. Rader D.J. Reilly M.P.

However, its substrate specificity is poorly defined and knowledge of cleavage sites is required to understand its physiological role. Here, for the first time, we report scissile bonds targeted by ADAMTS7. These include the autolytic cleavage sites Glu-732–Ala-733 and Glu-729–Val-730. We also identified LTBP4 as a novel substrate for ADAMTS7. In LTBP4, the P1′ residues were also predominantly Ala and Val, suggesting they are favored in P1′. Several different LTBP4 residues were found in P1, including Glu, Ala, Arg, and Pro. However, mutagenesis of the ADAMTS7 residues Glu-729 and Glu-730 to Ala reduced autolysis, which shows that ADAMTS7 prefers Glu over Ala at the P1 position. Together, these results shed light on the previously unknown cleavage site specificity of ADAMTS7. This may also benefit the development of small molecule inhibitors, which generally target the so-called specificity pocket (S1′) in metalloproteases (25Fabre B. Ramos A. de Pascual-Teresa B. Targeting matrix metalloproteinases: Exploring the dynamics of the s1′ pocket in the design of selective, small molecule inhibitors.J. Med.

It is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a potentially fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans for which only limited treatment options and no licensed vaccine are available. In 2018, the unusually large seasonal Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria emphasized the relevance of the virus for public health in West Africa where Lassa fever is endemic (1Tambo E. Adetunde O.T.

The virus particle consists of only four structural proteins and a lipid envelope as well as a segmented single-stranded RNA genome in negative orientation. LASV replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell. The key player during viral genome replication and transcription is the ∼250-kDa viral L protein. Most data on the L protein were generated using cell-based assays like the LASV minireplicon system. This assay was used to propose a cap-snatching endonuclease in the N-terminal region of the LASV L protein (3Lelke M. Brunotte L. Busch C. Günther S. An N-terminal region of Lassa virus L protein plays a critical role in transcription but not replication of the virus genome.J.

In addition, minireplicon experiments confirmed an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain that had been predicted in the center of the L protein (5Vieth S. Torda A.E. Asper M. Schmitz H.

More recently, experiments with recombinant L protein of the New World arenavirus Machupo provided first insight into promoter binding and basic features of RNA synthesis by the protein (8Kranzusch P.J.

Machupo virus L protein also possesses terminal transferase activity as described for RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of positive-strand flaviviruses (9Kranzusch P.J. Whelan S.P.

The viral genome comprises two segments (S and L), whereby each segment encodes for two proteins. The two open reading frames per RNA segment are in ambisense orientation and separated by a highly structured intergenic region (11Auperin D.D. Romanowski V. Galinski M. Bishop D.H. Sequencing studies of Pichinde arenavirus S RNA indicate a novel coding strategy, an ambisense viral S RNA.J. Virol. 1984; 52 (6492264): 897-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the 5′-end and 3′-end of each genome segment contain 19 terminal nucleotides (nt) that are highly conserved among the arenaviruses and represent the promoter sequences (12Hass M. Westerkofsky M. Müller S. Becker-Ziaja B. Busch C. Günther S. Mutational analysis of the Lassa virus promoter.J. Virol. 2006; 80 (17005649): 12414-1241910.1128/JVI.01374-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Due to complementarity of the 5′ and 3′ termini, the promoter presumably forms a double strand. During genome replication and transcription, the L protein synthesizes three distinct RNA species: (i) antigenomic complementary RNA (cRNA), (ii) genomic viral RNA (vRNA), and (iii) capped, nonpolyadenylated viral mRNA. Viral transcription depends on short, capped RNA primers probably derived from cellular mRNAs by a mechanism called cap snatching (13Raju R. Raju L. Hacker D. Garcin D. Compans R. Kolakofsky D. Nontemplated bases at the 5′ ends of Tacaribe virus mRNAs.Virology. 1990; 174 (2294647): 53-5910.1016/0042-6822(90)90053-TCrossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Polyak S.J. Zheng S.

In contrast, it is assumed that genome replication is initiated de novo by a prime-and-realign mechanism similar to the initiation of influenza virus cRNA synthesis and Hantaan virus genome replication (14Polyak S.J.

An incoming GTP molecule is bound opposite to a C base at position +2 of the template strand and extended to a GC dinucleotide. The latter is realigned to positions −1 and +1 of the template and serves there as primer for elongation. A main argument for this hypothesis has been the existence of a nontemplated G at the 5′-ends of arenavirus vRNA and cRNA that would originate from the translocated dinucleotide (11Auperin D.D. Romanowski V. Galinski M. Bishop D.H. Sequencing studies of Pichinde arenavirus S RNA indicate a novel coding strategy, an ambisense viral S RNA.J.

In an in vitro RNA synthesis assay using purified Machupo virus L protein, the observed product was about 1 nucleotide longer than the template, indicating that the L protein and no other viral or cellular protein is responsible for the attachment of the nontemplated G (9Kranzusch P.J. Whelan S.P. Arenavirus Z protein controls viral RNA synthesis by locking a polymerase-promoter complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mutational analysis of the highly conserved 19-nt promoter sequences using the LASV minireplicon system suggests that positions 1–12 interact in a base-specific manner with the replication complex, whereas at positions 13–19 only the base pairing between 3′ and 5′ termini is important for the function (12Hass M.

Atomic structures of bat influenza A and influenza B virus polymerase complexes as well as La Crosse orthobunyavirus L protein revealed a separate binding pocket for the 5′-promoter strand outside the polymerase active site in a so-called hook conformation (19Gerlach P.

However, there is no evidence for formation of a 5′-hook structure during arenavirus replication so far. As the L protein plays a central role during viral replication and transcription, it represents a promising drug target. Although basic enzymatic properties have been described for the L protein of Machupo virus, details of the molecular mechanisms during replication and transcription are still unknown. Here, we present the expression of LASV L protein in insect cells using a baculovirus system, purification of the protein, and establishment and use of in vitro assays to investigate L protein functions, specifically mechanistic details of the interaction with the promoter and the replication initiation. The presented experimental systems and data on the recombinant LASV L protein provide a basis for more detailed functional studies as well as high-throughput screening of antiviral compounds targeting the polymerase of LASV in the future. The L protein of LASV has been extensively studied in cell-based minireplicon systems (3Lelke M. Brunotte L. Busch C. Günther S.

Here, we focus on biochemical characterization of recombinantly expressed LASV L protein (strain Bantou 289). Initially, we still used the LASV minireplicon system to explore in which positions covalent modifications for protein purification (i.e. affinity tags) are compatible with L protein function. The standard modifications are small peptides, which are linked to the N or C terminus of the L protein, and it is important to mention that both N- and C-terminal modifications have a serious effect on the functionality of the L protein (Fig. 1A). We therefore also included internal insertions in positions, which have been described as flexible interdomain linkers (23Brunotte L. Lelke M. Hass M. Kleinsteuber K. Becker-Ziaja B. Günther S. Domain structure of Lassa virus L protein.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (20980514): 324-33310.1128/JVI.00721-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The insertions contained the amino acid sequence of the StrepII-tag binding to the Strep-Tactin matrix. L proteins containing a StrepII-tag at internal positions (after residues 407, 464, 771, and 937, respectively) were as functional as WT protein in the minireplicon system, whereas L protein with a C-terminal tag was about 50% less active (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal tag reduced activity even by 90%. Therefore, we generated baculovirus constructs for expression in insect cells of L proteins containing internal tags or the C-terminal tag for purification. The L proteins with StrepII-tag after residue 407 (L-Strep407) and at the C terminus (L-StrepC) were successfully expressed in insect cells using the EMBacY baculovirus expression system (24Fitzgerald D.J. Berger P. Schaffitzel C. Yamada K. Richmond T.J. Berger I. Protein complex expression by using multigene baculoviral vectors.Nat.

However, recombinant baculoviruses for expression of L proteins with internal StrepII-tag after residues 464, 771, and 937, respectively, could not be produced. The expression level for the C-terminally tagged L protein was considerably higher than for the internally tagged protein. The L proteins were purified by Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography followed by heparin affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. The size-exclusion chromatography also revealed a difference in the oligomerization behavior of both proteins: whereas the C-terminally tagged L protein eluted as monomer, the internally tagged L protein eluted as dimer (Fig. 1B). We used the purely monodisperse and monomeric C-terminally tagged L protein to perform small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments (Fig. 1C). The SAXS model features a compact core domain with a hollow center, which is decorated with at least one protruding subdomain. The low-resolution structure of the LASV L protein has a similar overall shape as crystal structures of the heterotrimeric influenza polymerase complex (Fig. 1D) (20Pflug A. Guilligay D. Reich S. Cusack S. Structure of influenza A polymerase bound to the viral RNA promoter.Nature. 2014; 516 (25409142): 355-36010.1038/nature14008Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 21Reich S.

The influenza virus structure could be superimposed with the SAXS envelope, showing that the size and basic shape of the Lassa L and the influenza polymerase complex are comparable. Due to the presence of flexible protruding domains attached to the polymerase core, which were observed in various positions in individual SAXS models, more detailed structural information cannot be derived from the averaged model calculated from the SAXS data. Nevertheless, the SAXS data suggest a conserved architecture of Lassa and influenza virus polymerase complexes. As the dimer conformation of the internally tagged L protein was not purely monodisperse, we refrained from the calculation of a SAXS envelope to avoid the description of potential artifacts (Fig. 1C). To characterize the enzymatic properties of L protein, we performed in vitro RNA synthesis assays with both L-Strep407 and L-StrepC. The L protein was incubated in the presence of a 19-nt template corresponding to the 3′-promoter strand of the LASV genome and NTPs (including radiolabeled [α-32P]GTP). In the standard assay, the complementary 19-nt 5′-promoter strand was added in advance as previous experiments with influenza virus have shown an enhancing effect if both promoter strands are present in the RNA polymerase assay (21Reich S. Guilligay D. Pflug A. Malet H. Berger I. Crépin T. Hart D. Lunardi T. Nanao M. Ruigrok R.W. Cusack S. Structural insight into cap-snatching and RNA synthesis by influenza polymerase.Nature. 2014; 516 (25409151): 361-36610.1038/nature14009Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized RNA product was visualized after denaturing PAGE by autoradiography. Pilot experiments confirmed that neither the 3′-vRNA promoter/template strand nor the 5′-vRNA promoter strand alone was sufficient to drive synthesis of clearly detectable amounts of RNA, whereas incubation with both strands resulted in clear signals in the in vitro assay (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the minireplicon data, the internally tagged L protein was more active than the C-terminally tagged version (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3′ + 5′ Strep407 and 3′ + 5′ StrepC). Therefore, L-Strep407 was used in all future experiments. The assay yielded minor reaction products between 20 and 30 nt in length (smear) and a distinct major product of >30 nt. The main product was longer than expected from the length of the template, which presumably is an artifact due to missing termination signals. The assay contains only physically separated short promoter strands rather than the continuous RNA genome comprising all necessary cis-acting signals. An L-Strep407 mutant with exchange of a catalytic residue implicated in RNA polymerization (D1331A) was inactive, demonstrating the specificity of our assay (Fig. 2A). The LASV L protein possesses temperature dependence with an optimum at ∼30–37 °C but remains surprisingly active at temperatures >50 °C (Fig. 2B, left panel). The main RNA product was already detected after short incubation time (half-maximum after ∼10 min), and saturation was reached after 20 min (Fig. 2B, right panel). Although template and NTPs were present in excess, a longer incubation time did not result in larger amounts of product. This might indicate that under our reaction conditions the newly synthesized strand is not released from the catalytic site, and thus L protein is blocked for further rounds of polymerization. Inhibition of L protein activity by the small Z protein has been described for LASV and Machupo virus using the minireplicon system and an in vitro assay, respectively (9Kranzusch P.J. Whelan S.P. Arenavirus Z protein controls viral RNA synthesis by locking a polymerase-promoter complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (22106304): 19743-1974810.1073/pnas.1112742108Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Hass M. Gölnitz U. Müller S. Becker-Ziaja B. Gunther S. Replicon system for Lassa virus.J.

Zandonatti M. Liu T. Li S. Woods Jr, V.L. Saphire E.O. Crystal structure of the oligomeric form of Lassa virus matrix protein Z.J. Virol. 2016; 90 (26912609): 4556-456210.1128/JVI.02896-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and purified the monomeric form of the protein (Fig. S4). Using our assay, we confirmed its inhibitory effect on RNA synthesis by the LASV L protein (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Z protein required a specific stoichiometry relative to the L protein. At equimolar concentrations of Z and L protein (1 μm each), almost no inhibition was observed. A reduction in polymerase activity was only observed when the Z protein was present in excess (70% inhibition at 2:1 ratio). LASV Z protein carrying mutation W35A was unable to inhibit polymerase activity (Fig. S5). As this mutation has been described to hamper L–Z interaction (28Loureiro M.E. Wilda M. Levingston Macleod J.M. D'Antuono A. Foscaldi S. Marino Buslje C. Lopez N. Molecular determinants of arenavirus Z protein homo-oligomerization and L polymerase binding.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21957305): 12304-1231410.1128/JVI.05691-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), our data support the hypothesis that Z protein inhibits polymerase function by direct interaction with the L protein. Finally, we tested whether the L protein is able to initiate genome replication de novo or whether it requires a primer. The RNA synthesis efficiency of L-Strep407 in the absence (unprimed) or presence of GpC or CpG primers was comparable (Fig. 2D). Thus, the minimal substrates for initiation of replication and RNA polymerization by L protein are NTPs. Reguera et al. (29Reguera J. Gerlach P. Rosenthal M. Gaudon S. Coscia F. Günther S. Cusack S. Comparative structural and functional analysis of bunyavirus and arenavirus cap-snatching endonucleases.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 (27304209)e100563610.1371/journal.ppat.1005636Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) studied the isolated LASV cap-snatching endonuclease domain; however, they could not detect RNA cleavage activity in their in vitro assays. As the endonuclease may require activation by another region of the L protein, we performed RNA cleavage experiments with L-Strep407 and L-StrepC. However, as with the isolated endonuclease, no decrease in the amount of input RNA under the tested conditions was observed (Fig. 2E). A bunyaviral cap-snatching endonuclease was used as a positive control for our assay and showed the expected activity (Fig. 2E, Pos.).

Despite this, a functional description of the transduction process by the terminals, in physiological conditions, has not been fully achieved. Here, we studied how nociceptive terminals in vivo convert noxious stimuli into propagating signals. By monitoring noxious-stimulus-induced Ca2+ dynamics from mouse corneal terminals, we found that initiation of Na+ channel (Nav)-dependent propagating signals takes place away from the terminal and that the starting point for Nav-mediated propagation depends on Nav functional availability. Acute treatment with the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) resulted in a shift of the location of Nav involvement toward the terminal, thus increasing nociceptive excitability. Moreover, a shift of Nav involvement toward the terminal occurs in corneal hyperalgesia resulting from acute photokeratitis. This dynamic change in the location of Nav-mediated propagation initiation could underlie pathological pain hypersensitivity."

The related enzyme CYP3A5 is also expressed in adult liver and has broader age and tissue distributions. However, CYP3A5 expression is low in most Caucasians because of the prevalence of an allele that leads to an incorrectly spliced mRNA and premature termination of translation. When expressed, CYP3A5 expands metabolic capabilities and can augment CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism, thereby reducing drug efficacy and potentially requiring dose adjustments. The extensive role of CYP3A4 in drug metabolism reflects in part the plasticity of the substrate-free enzyme to enlarge its active site and accommodate very large substrates. We have previously shown that the structure of the CYP3A5–ritonavir complex differs substantially from that of the CYP3A4–ritonavir complex. To better understand whether these differences are conserved in other CYP3A5 structures and how they relate to differential plasticity, we determined the X-ray crystallographic structure of the CYP3A5 substrate-free complex to 2.20 Å resolution. We observed that this structure exhibits a much larger active site than substrate-free CYP3A4 and displays an open substrate access channel. This reflected in part a lower trajectory of the helix F–F′ connector in CYP3A4 and more extensive π–CH interactions between phenylalanine residues forming the roof of the active-site cavity than in CYP3A5.

https://openalex.org/W2952668598,"The brain must make sense of external stimuli to generate relevant behavior. We used a combination of in vivo approaches to investigate how the cerebellum processes sensory-related information. We found that the inferior olive encodes contexts of sensory-associated external cues in a graded manner, apparent in the presynaptic activity of their axonal projections (climbing fibers) in the cerebellar cortex. Individual climbing fibers were broadly responsive to different sensory modalities but relayed sensory-related information to the cortex in a lobule-dependent manner. Purkinje cell dendrites faithfully transformed this climbing fiber activity into dendrite-wide Ca2+ signals without a direct contribution from the mossy fiber pathway. These results demonstrate that the size of climbing-fiber-evoked Ca2+ signals in Purkinje cell dendrites is largely determined by the firing level of climbing fibers. This coding scheme emphasizes the overwhelming role of the inferior olive in generating salient signals useful for instructing plasticity and learning."

The reaction of oxygen with the ferrous heme-NO species is part of a futile cycle that does not directly contribute to NO synthesis but allows a population of inactive enzyme molecules to return to the catalytic cycle, and thus, enables a steady-state NO synthesis rate. Previously, we have reported that this reaction does involve the reaction of oxygen with the NO-bound ferrous heme complex, but the mechanistic details of the reaction, that could proceed via either an inner-sphere or an outer-sphere mechanism, remained unclear.

Scale-up efforts have targeted men who have sex with men (MSM), but patterns of racial disparities in PrEP use have begun to emerge. African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities in Canada and USA are also disproportionately affected by HIV, and there is lack of guidance regarding PrEP implementation in this priority population.ACB men from Toronto, Canada were recruited in community settings by peers. Participants completed a detailed socio-behavioural questionnaire. Biological samples were collected and tested for sexually transmitted infections. Willingness to accept PrEP was assessed in relation to actual and self-perceived risk of acquiring HIV, as well as demographic and behavioural variables.424 ACB men were included in the analysis. ACB MSM were more likely to accept PrEP than ACB men only reporting sex with women (MSW; 50.0% vs. 23.6%). The most common reasons for PrEP non-acceptance were concerns regarding side-effects and low self-perceived risk. PrEP acceptance was lowest among younger men (12.5%) and those born in Canada (15.2%). Men with a high self-perceived HIV risk were more likely to accept PrEP (41.3% vs. 22.7% of men with a low self-perceived risk), but only 25.4% of men who were defined as being at high-risk, self-identified themselves as such.Most ACB MSW were unlikely to accept PrEP, largely due to low self-perceived HIV risk, but PrEP acceptance among ACB MSM was similar to other contemporaneous Toronto MSM communities. PrEP acceptance was particularly low among younger ACB men and those born in Canada. Tailored strategies will be needed to effectively implement PrEP in Toronto ACB communities."

We measured both PAs diameter in patients with 22q11.2DS without cardiac defects, comparing these data to a normal control group. Moreover, we measured the PAs diameter in Tbx1 mutant mice. Finally, a cell fate mapping in Tbx1 mutants was used to study the expression of this gene in the morphogenesis of PAs.We evaluated 58 patients with 22q11.2DS without cardiac defects. The control group consisted of 54 healthy subjects, matched for age and sex. All cases underwent a complete transthoracic echocardiography. Moreover, we crossed Tbx1+/- mice and harvested fetuses. We examined the cardiovascular phenotype of 8 wild type (WT), 37 heterozygous (Tbx1+/-) and 6 null fetuses (Tbx1-/-). Finally, we crossed Tbx1Cre/+mice with R26RmT-mG Cre reporter mice to study Tbx1 expression in the pulmonary arteries.The echocardiographic study showed that the mean of the LPA/RPA ratio in 22q11.2DS was smaller (0.80 ± 0.12) than in controls (0.97 ± 0.08; p < 0.0001). Mouse studies resulted in similar data as the size of LPA and RPA was not significantly different in WT embryos, but in Tbx1+/- and Tbx1-/- embryos the LPA was significantly smaller than the RPA in both mutants (P = 0.0016 and 0.0043, respectively). We found that Tbx1 is expressed near the origin of the PAs and in their adventitia.Children with 22q11.2DS without cardiac defects show smaller LPA compared with healthy subjects. Mouse studies suggest that this anomaly is due to haploinsufficiency of Tbx1. These data may be useful in the clinical management of children with 22q11.2DS and should guide further experimental studies as to the mechanisms underlying PAs development."

Here, using an array of techniques and approaches, including cell biology, RT-quantitative PCR, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and ChIP assays, we show that the extracellular domain of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (EpEX) significantly increases the levels of pluripotency factors through a signaling cascade that includes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and Lin-28 homolog A (LIN28) and enhances the proliferation of human bone marrow MSCs.

Later, these strings of extra information can help retrieve the learned content as demonstrated by experiments where contextual cues from an encoding situation facilitate remembering and improve memory performance when reinstated during retrieval. This context-dependent memory effect has been investigated over the course of several decades and has been demonstrated with many different types of contexts. Based on this, the widely held belief is that context-dependent memory is a strong and robust effect, with transferable substance for everyday learning and potential clinical applications. Here we report the results of a multi-study design investigating the influence of reinstated visual contexts on memory performance. Data from 120 participants were included in three studies comprising a variety of visual cues. We show convincingly that even rich, salient and fully surrounding visual contexts provided by virtual reality are not sufficient to induce effects of context-dependency in a free recall memory task. We also investigated contextual modulation of oscillatory brain activity in order to test the effect of reinstated neural contexts, which failed to evoke a robust effect when re-tested in an internal conceptual replication study. Moreover, a Bayesian sequential statistical analysis revealed moderate to strong evidence against the hypothesis that reinstatement of visual contexts benefits free recall memory tasks indicating that effects are small and may not be suitable for transfer into everyday learning."

The activity of OSBP at MCS is regulated by phosphorylation, but whether this applies to ORPs is unknown. Here we report the functional characterization of a unique proline/serine-rich phosphorylation motif (S762SPSSPSS769) in the lipid binding OSBP-related domain of full-length ORP4L and a truncated variant ORP4S. Phosphorylation was confirmed by mass spectrometry and [32P]PO4 incorporation, and in silico and in vitro assays using purified ORP4L identified putative proline-directed kinases that phosphorylate the site. The functional significance of the phospho-site was assessed by mutating serine 762, S763, S766 and S768 to aspartate or alanine to produce phosphomimetic (S4D) and phosphorylation-deficient (S4A) mutants, respectively. Solution binding of 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol by recombinant ORP4L-S4D and -S4A was similar to wild-type but ORP4L-S4D more effectively extracted cholesterol from liposomes. ORP4L homo-dimerization was unaffected by phosphorylation but gel filtration of ORP4L-S4D indicated that the native conformation was affected. Confocal microscopy revealed that ORP4L-S4D also strongly associated with bundled vimentin filaments, a feature shared with ORP4S which lacks the PH and dimerization domains. We conclude that phosphorylation of a unique serine/proline motif in the ORD induces a conformation change in ORP4L that enhances interaction with vimentin and cholesterol extraction from membranes."

Their abundance and function have been linked to a range of physiologic and pathologic processes. In aged monkey muscle, miR-451a and miR-144-3p were far more abundant than in young monkey muscle. This observation led us to hypothesize that miR-451a and miR-144-3p may influence muscle homeostasis. To test if these conserved microRNAs were implicated in myogenesis, we investigated their function in the mouse myoblast line C2C12. The levels of both microRNAs declined with myogenesis; however, only overexpression of miR-451a, but not miR-144-3p, robustly impeded C2C12 differentiation, suggesting an inhibitory role for miR-451a in myogenesis. Further investigation of the regulatory influence of miR-451a identified as one of the major targets Sparc mRNA, which encodes a secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) that functions in wound healing and cellular differentiation. In mouse myoblasts, miR-451a suppressed Sparc mRNA translation. Together, our findings indicate that miR-451a is downregulated in differentiated myoblasts and suggest that it decreases C2C12 differentiation at least in part by suppressing SPARC biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2928706828,"Objective Patients with persistent poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) despite engagement in clinic-based care are at particularly high risk for diabetes complications and costs. Understanding this population’s demographics, comorbidities and care utilization could guide strategies to address PPDM. We characterized factors associated with PPDM in a large sample of Veterans with type 2 diabetes. Methods We identified a cohort of Veterans with medically treated type 2 diabetes, who received Veterans Health Administration primary care during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. PPDM was defined by hemoglobin A1c levels uniformly >8.5% during fiscal year (FY) 2012, despite engagement with care during this period. We used FY 2012 demographic, comorbidity and medication data to describe PPDM in relation to better-controlled diabetes patients and created multivariable models to examine associations between clinical factors and PPDM. We also constructed multivariable models to explore the association between PPDM and FY 2013 care utilization. Results In our cohort of diabetes patients (n = 435,820), 12% met criteria for PPDM. Patients with PPDM were younger than better-controlled patients, less often married, and more often Black/African-American and Hispanic or Latino/Latina. Of included comorbidities, only retinopathy (OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63,1.73) and nephropathy (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19,1.34) demonstrated clinically significant associations with PPDM. Complex insulin regimens such as premixed (OR 10.80, 95% CI: 10.11,11.54) and prandial-containing regimens (OR 18.74, 95% CI: 17.73,19.81) were strongly associated with PPDM. Patients with PPDM had higher care utilization, particularly endocrinology care (RR 3.56, 95% CI: 3.47,3.66); although only 26.4% of patients saw endocrinology overall. Conclusion PPDM is strongly associated with complex diabetes regimens, although heterogeneity in care utilization exists. While there is evidence of underutilization, inadequacy of available care may also contribute to PPDM. Our findings should inform tailored approaches to meet the needs of PPDM, who are among the highest-risk, highest-cost patients with diabetes."

The aim of our study was to assess the diagnostic impact of TAB histology in patients with suspected GCA on hospital admission. Methods A prospectively maintained database was queried for all TABs performed between 1-1-2000 until 31-12-2017 at the University Hospital of Ioannina. Thus, inclusion criteria were made on the grounds of every patient that underwent a TAB during the above-mentioned period, regardless of demographic, clinical and laboratory data. Results Two hundred forty-five TABs were included (149 females and 96 males), with a mean age of 64.5 (±3.5) years. The mean symptoms duration until admission to the hospital was 8.6 (±1.3) weeks and all had elevated acute phase reactants on admission. The reasons of admission were fever of unknown origin (FUO) in 114 (46.5%) patients, symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in 84 (34.3%), new headache in 33 (13.5%), anemia of chronic disease (ACD) in 8 (3.32%) and eye disturbances in 6 (2.5%) patients. Positive results were found in 49 (20%) TABs. More specifically, in 14% of patients with FUO, 21% in those with PMR, while in patients with a new headache the percentage was 27%. Finally, 5 out of 6 (83.3%) of patients with ocular symptoms and only one (12.5%) of those suffering from ACD. Visual manifestations and FUO are correlated with a positive TAB. Conclusion It seems that TAB is useful in assisting with GCA diagnosis, but lacks sensitivity."

The association of absolute weight and sex difference with graft failure was explored in an outpatient cohort of deceased-donor transplant recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between 2000 and 2012. Graft failure was defined as repeated need for dialysis or death with a functioning graft. Recipient and donor sex pairings were classified as sex concordant (MDMR/FDFR) or discordant (MDFR/FDMR). These classes were further stratified into four groups according to recipient-to-donor weight mismatch ≥10 kg (recipient > donor) or <10 kg (recipient < donor). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were applied to evaluate the time to graft loss adjusting for donor, immunologic, surgical, organizational, and recipient predictors. Sex-concordant transplant pairings <10 kg weight difference served as the reference group. Among 826 transplant recipients, 154 developed graft failure (18.6%). Median graft survival time was 3.9 years; first quartile (0.2-1.2), second quartile (1.2-2.9), third quartile (2.9-5.8), and fourth quartile (5.8-12.4). After multivariable adjustment, the highest relative hazard for graft failure was observed for sex-discordant transplant pairings with a ≥10 kg weight difference between recipient and donor (compared to the reference group MDMR/FDFR with weight difference <10 kg, MDMR/FDFR with weight difference ≥10 kg, hazard ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.32-p = 0.029; MDFR/FDMR with weight difference <10 kg, hazard ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.68-p = 0.507, and MDFR/FDMR with weight difference ≥10 kg, hazard ratio 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.15-3.48-p = 0.014). A recipient-to-donor weight mismatch of ≥10 kg was associated with an increased risk of graft loss or recipient death with a functioning graft. Concurrent sex discordance seemed to enhance this effect as indicated by an increase in the hazard ratio. We detected no significant tendency for increasing recipient-to-donor weight differences from 2000 to 2012."
https://openalex.org/W2935593844,"Lipopolysaccharides are anchored to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by a hydrophobic moiety known as lipid A, which potently activates the host innate immune response. Lipid A of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, displays unusual structural asymmetry with respect to the length of the acyl chains at the 3 and 3′ positions, which are 3OH-C10 and 3OH-C14 chains, respectively. Both chains are attached by the acyltransferase LpxA, the first enzyme in the lipid A biosynthesis pathway, which, in B. pertussis, has limited chain length specificity. However, this only partially explains the strict asymmetry of lipid A. In attempts to modulate the endotoxicity of B. pertussis lipid A, here we expressed the gene encoding LpxA from Neisseria meningitidis, which specifically attaches 3OH-C12 chains, in B. pertussis. This expression was lethal, suggesting that one of the downstream enzymes in the lipid A biosynthesis pathway in B. pertussis cannot handle precursors with a 3OH-C12 chain. We considered that the UDP-diacylglucosamine pyrophosphohydrolase LpxH could be responsible for this defect as well as for the asymmetry of B. pertussis lipid A. Expression of meningococcal LpxH in B. pertussis indeed resulted in new symmetric lipid A species with 3OH-C10 or 3OH-C14 chains at both the 3 and 3′ positions, as revealed by MS analysis. Furthermore, co-expression of meningococcal lpxH and lpxA resulted in viable cells that incorporated 3OH-C12 chains in B. pertussis lipid A. We conclude that the asymmetry of B. pertussis lipid A is determined by the acyl chain length specificity of LpxH."

Previous studies have reported the effect of combined tDCS and PES on corticospinal excitability; when compared to single stimulation, combined stimulation increases cortical excitability. In contrast, another study reported that the effect of tDCS is attenuated by PES; hence, there is no consensus opinion on the effect on combined stimulation. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the effect of combined tDCS and PES on corticospinal excitability. In Experiment 1, the combined stimulation of anodal tDCS and PES (anodal tDCS + PES) was performed, and in Experiment 2, a combined stimulation with PES, after cathodal tDCS (PES after cathodal tDCS), was performed using a homeostatic metaplasticity theoretical model. In Experiment 1, anodal tDCS produced a significant increase from baseline in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude 10 min after stimulation, but no significant changes in MEP amplitude were observed with PES or the anodal tDCS + PES condition. Experiment 2 showed a significant decrease in MEP amplitude immediately after cathodal tDCS, and a significant increase in MEP amplitude 15 min after PES, but no significant change in MEP amplitude was observed with sequential PES following cathodal tDCS. In conclusion, our data indicate that PES with anodal tDCS suppressed the effect of tDCS. Also, PES after cathodal tDCS did not induce homeostatic metaplasticity and increase corticospinal excitability."

Paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal AF differ significantly in various aspects. Impact of cardiac hemodynamics on systemic embolism might also differ between the 2 distinct AF entities. This study was performed to evaluate the influence of cardiac hemodynamics on systemic embolism in both paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal AF. Consecutive AF patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) in Korea University Medical Center Anam Hospital between June 1998 and February 2018 were analyzed. Among 2,801 patients who underwent first-time RFCA, a total of 231 patients had either previous ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or arterial embolism. In paroxysmal AF, LA diameter, LA volume (measured with magnetic resonance imaging), left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, E/e', LAA flow velocity, and prevalence of spontaneous echocontrast (SEC) and dense SEC were significantly different between patients with and without thromboembolic events. However, only E/e' was different between patients with and without thromboembolic events in non-paroxysmal AF. The influence of LA diameter, LA volume, LV EF, LAA flow velocity, and dense SEC on thromboembolic events was significantly moderated by the type of AF. In conclusion, paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal AF might have a different mechanism responsible for thrombus formation and consequent embolic events. Relative contribution of hemodynamic parameters and other factors such as atrial myopathy to thromboembolic events in paroxysmal versus non-paroxysmal AF needs further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2931418358,"Blood fluidity is reportedly influenced by the volume and function of blood cells and plasma and is a predictor of primary cardiovascular events in patients with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Heavy alcohol consumption was shown to be associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases. Acetaldehyde (ACD), an oxidizing substance formed from ethanol, reportedly stimulates monocyte adhesion, causes abnormalities in the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, and decreases RBC deformability. In addition, it was reported that blood ACD levels are reduced in mice pretreated with L-cysteine. However, there are no studies on the effect of ACD and/or L-cysteine on blood fluidity. In the present study, we evaluated whether ACD impairs blood fluidity. In addition, the effect of L-cysteine on blood fluidity impaired by ACD was examined. Blood samples were obtained from 10 healthy, non-smoking, male volunteers (age: 23.4 ± 1.2 years, body mass index: 21.8 ± 2.6 kg/m2). ACD or ACD and L-cysteine were added to the blood samples before each experiment. We measured the passage time of 100 μL blood and RBC suspension using Kikuchi’s microchannel method. Percentage of microchannel obstruction and the number of adherent white blood cells (WBCs) on microchannel terrace were counted. The blood passage time, percentage of microchannel obstruction, and numbers of adherent WBCs on the microchannel terrace increased after adding ACD in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas they decreased after adding ACD and L-cysteine in a L-cysteine concentration-dependent manner. No significant effects were observed in passage time for 100 μL RBC suspension after adding ACD and L-cysteine. This study suggested that blood fluidity impaired by ACD might improve after adding L-cysteine."

Boon Chock and Earl Stadtman while working on the regulation of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health. After becoming a tenured scientist at the same institute, my group discovered, purified, and cloned the first three prototypical members of the phospholipase C family and uncovered the mechanisms by which various cell-surface receptors activate these enzymes to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. We also discovered the family of peroxiredoxin (Prx) enzymes that catalyze the reduction of H2O2, and we established that mammalian cells express six Prx isoforms that not only protect against oxidative damage but also mediate cell signaling by modulating intracellular H2O2 levels. To validate the signaling role of H2O2, we showed that epidermal growth factor induces a transient increase in intracellular H2O2 levels, and the essential cysteine residue of protein-tyrosine phosphatases is a target for specific and reversible oxidation by the H2O2 produced in such cells. These observations led to a new paradigm in receptor signaling, in which protein tyrosine phosphorylation is achieved not via activation of receptor tyrosine kinases alone but also through concurrent inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases by H2O2. Our studies revealed that Prx isozymes are extensively regulated via phosphorylation as well as by hyperoxidation of the active-site cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid, with the reverse reaction being catalyzed by sulfiredoxin. This reversible hyperoxidation of Prx was further shown to constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life. I learned biochemistry from P.

In May 1961, a month after I entered Seoul National University College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as a chemistry major, the fledgling democracy in Korea ended with a military coup. A series of intense antigovernment demonstrations ensued and persisted throughout the 1960s. Our college campus was the center for the student antigovernment movement. Streets surrounding the campus were frequently filled with soldiers and shrouded in clouds of tear gas, and many classes were canceled. However, the classes taught by Professors Kyu Won Choi (analytical chemistry) and Se Hun Chang (physical chemistry) were seldom canceled. These professors, like many others since the Korean independence in 1945, had been teaching without Ph.D. degrees, but they had recently returned to Korea after earning their doctorates in the United States. Chemistry majors were mocked as the most subservient students on campus. Textbooks used in class were in English, but most students could not afford to buy these books printed in the United States or even cheaper versions printed with the copyright in Japan. Instead, they bought pirated versions printed in Taiwan. The professors encouraged us to go to the United States for graduate studies. Many of us who attended the chemistry department in the 1960s recall how lucky we were to be taught by two such passionate professors with a vision for the future. I took the Korean equivalent of ROTC courses and was commissioned after graduation in 1965 as a second lieutenant in the Korean Army with a specialty in ammunition supply. I was assigned to an infantry division located near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Given that I wanted to go to graduate school in the United States after my 2 years of military service, I had to take the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) while I was in the army. The last chance to take the tests to fulfill the 1967 admission requirements was September of 1966. In that month, there were several instances of North Korean agent infiltration through the area controlled by our infantry division, and all officers were ordered to stay near the military base. I could not take days off to take the tests in Seoul. Next January, I received letters denying me financial assistance from all the graduate schools to which I had applied. One of these graduate schools was Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where Gilbert Castellan, the author of a physical chemistry textbook used in our undergraduate course, was a faculty member in the chemistry department. I had a cousin, Jhoon Goo Rhee, who was widely recognized as the “Father of American Taekwondo” for introducing this martial art to the United States. After learning that I was not accepted to Catholic University, my cousin went there to meet Richard Timmons, a young assistant professor of chemistry in charge of graduate admissions. I was then admitted to a teaching assistant slot not taken by another applicant, and I arrived in Washington in June 1967. Richard Timmons later told me that he was most impressed with my cousin, who he had seen several times on local television. I chose to do my Ph.D. thesis under the direction of John Eisch, who had recently joined the department as head after moving from the University of Michigan and who was the author of a textbook titled The Chemistry of Organometallic Compounds. In the meantime, I married Young Kyu Park, another graduate student whom I met at Catholic University. (The infiltration of North Korean agents thus turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me.) The goal of my Ph.D. project was to elucidate the mechanism of the hydroalumination of alkynes, and the research progressed well. Early in 1971, my thesis advisor told me to write up my results and prepare for graduation in the fall. As my writing skills were not well-honed, this progressed at a painfully slow pace. I would constantly look for excuses to do more experiments. I gave up the prospect of graduating that fall and moved to the State University of New York (SUNY) in Binghamton with John Eisch, who joined the university as chair of the chemistry department. Although I had not formally received my Ph.D. degree, I was appointed to a postdoctoral fellow position. I finally and successfully defended my thesis in 1972, and my work in the Eisch laboratory resulted in eight publications in respected journals. While I was preparing for my thesis defense, John Eisch asked me about my future plans. I told him that I intended to return to Korea and to undertake the total synthesis of ginsenosides, triterpene saponins found in the ginseng root, which is considered an herbal panacea in Korea. At that time, I did not comprehend very well the importance of research in an academic career and was not well-prepared to answer Eisch's question. From time to time, I followed publications on ginseng coming out of a research institute at the University of Tokyo as well as a research institute in Vladivostok, in the former Soviet Union. Russia's interest in ginsenosides stemmed from the finding of its scientists that these compounds could improve the performance of astronauts and athletes. Knowing how poorly prepared I was for the difficult task of natural product synthesis, Dr. Eisch gently advised me to apply for a postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to get more training in enzymology and natural products. The logic behind his advice was that the synthesis of complex molecules like ginsenosides is possible only through a combination of bulk chemistry and the stereospecific action of enzymes. He also mentioned that Richard Timmons from Catholic University was spending a sabbatical at a renowned enzymology lab at NIH, the Laboratory of Biochemistry, within the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), headed by Earl Stadtman. When Richard Timmons heard of my desire to apply for a postdoctoral fellowship at NIH, he introduced me to P. Boon Chock, who had just joined the Laboratory of Biochemistry in a tenure-track position. The latter agreed to be a sponsor for my NIH postdoctoral fellowship application, and, with his generous help, I was accepted for the position. The regulation of glutamine synthetase (GS) 2The abbreviations used are: GSglutamine synthetasePrxperoxiredoxinPLCphospholipase CEGFepidermal growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorATaseadenylyltransferaseUTaseuridylyltransferaseTrxthioredoxinSrxsulfiredoxinPTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseRBCred blood cellSHSrc homologyGPxGSH peroxidaseACTHadrenocorticotropic hormone. in E. coli was a focus of study in Earl Stadtman’s laboratory around the time of my arrival (1Stadtman E.R. The story of glutamine synthetase regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11585846): 44357-4436410.1074/jbc.R100055200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Many later-renowned scientists studied this subject while training in the Stadtman laboratory. I learned fast kinetics from P. Boon Chock, who had done postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Manfred Eigen—a recipient of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on measurement of fast chemical reactions—at the Max Planck Institute in Göttingen. I applied the stopped-flow technique to study the kinetics of the GS reaction. glutamine synthetase peroxiredoxin phospholipase C epidermal growth factor platelet-derived growth factor adenylyltransferase uridylyltransferase thioredoxin sulfiredoxin protein-tyrosine phosphatase red blood cell Src homology GSH peroxidase adrenocorticotropic hormone. Studies in the 1960s and early 1970s by Stadtman's group revealed that GS activity is regulated via a bicyclic cascade involving reversible adenylylation (attachment of an AMP moiety) and uridylylation (attachment of a UMP moiety) of protein tyrosine residues (1Stadtman E.R. The story of glutamine synthetase regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11585846): 44357-4436410.1074/jbc.R100055200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the 1970s, GS and glycogen phosphorylase provided the two best-known examples of post-translational regulation, the former via nucleotidylation of tyrosine in bacteria and the latter via phosphorylation of serine and threonine in hepatocytes. As I gradually learned enzymology and became acquainted with a number of interesting discoveries made on the NIH campus, my ideas on research and a career began to change. In particular, the story behind how Stadtman’s group discovered the nucleotidylation of GS influenced me strongly. They observed that the catalytic activity of GS varied widely depending on the conditions of E. coli growth. From their observations that different GS preparations showed small differences in UV absorbance at 260 nm, they postulated the existence of a nucleotide adduct (2Shapiro B.M. Kingdon H.S. Stadtman E.R. Regulation of glutamine synthetase. VII. Adenylyl glutamine synthetase: a new form of the enzyme with altered regulatory and kinetic properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58 (4860756): 642-64910.1073/pnas.58.2.642Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by the demonstration that treatment of some preparations with snake venom phosphodiesterase induced the release of AMP and a change in the catalytic properties of GS, thus leading to the discovery of a novel regulatory mechanism based on the adenylylation of tyrosine. Subsequently, they found that adenylyltransferase (ATase) could catalyze both the adenylylation and deadenylylation of GS (3Kingdon H.S. Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. Regulation of glutamine synthetase. 8. ATP:glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes alterations in the regulatory properties of glutamine synthetase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

They further showed that, like GS, PII exists in two forms: in this case, an unmodified form that in the presence of l-glutamine stimulates the adenylylation of GS, and a uridylylated form (PII-UMP) that in the absence of l-glutamine and in the presence of α-ketoglutarate stimulates the deadenylylation of GS (4Brown M.S. Segal A. Stadtman E.R. Modulation of glutamine synthetase adenylylation and deadenylylation is mediated by metabolic transformation of the P II-regulatory protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68 (4399832): 2949-295310.1073/pnas.68.12.2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). I joined the research project at this stage of its development. GS is composed of 12 identical subunits, and GS activity is inversely proportional to the state of adenylylation, with the average number of covalently bound adenylyl groups per molecule (n) ranging from 0 to 12. The adenylylation and deadenylylation reactions are regulated by l-glutamine and α-ketoglutarate, which have pronounced reciprocal effects. Theoretical analysis predicted that, in the presence of all adenylylation–deadenylylation cycle components, the value of n will achieve a steady state that will vary as a function of effector concentrations, with at least 28 kinetic or equilibrium constants being required to describe the reaction cycle. I eventually determined these constants with the help of P. Boon Chock (5Rhee S.G. Park R. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Allosteric regulation of monocyclic interconvertible enzyme cascade systems: use of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase as an experimental model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75 (28522): 3138-314210.1073/pnas.75.7.3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), benefitting from his strong theoretical background. This steady work provided the path to my being granted a tenured senior scientist position in 1979 (Fig. 1). The determination of these constants required the purification of large amounts of GS, ATase, and PII proteins as well as the partial purification of uridylyltransferase (UTase) for preparation of PII-UMP. GS is a relatively abundant protein, and its purification had been well established. For isolation of the other proteins, however, we had to grow kilogram quantities of E. coli and subject the cell homogenates to industrial-scale column chromatography. The preparation of PII was especially difficult, given the extremely low abundance of this protein. We achieved a major breakthrough with the finding that most proteins, but not PII, in E. coli homogenates are precipitated by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 26% (v/v). This procedure, whose effectiveness was because PII does not contain any cysteine residues, allowed enrichment of PII by several-hundredfold. Although I was delighted with the discovery of this magical step for PII purification, I became highly unpopular in our building as a result of the unpleasant odor caused by the use of liter quantities of β-mercaptoethanol. Even though I tried to perform the attendant tasks under a chemical fume hood and during the weekend as much as possible, the centrifugation and dialysis of large volumes of material inevitably polluted the entire corridor, with the stench lingering into the workweek. Even my 4-year-old daughter held her nose and tried to stay away from me when I came home. I was warned several times by chemical safety officers on the NIH campus. Looking back, I feel I was somewhat ruthless but that I was lucky to have patient and understanding colleagues. Late in 1979, Emilio Garcia joined my laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow from the University of California at Davis. Taking advantage of the fact that PII was now readily available, Emilio and I purified UTase (6Garcia E. Rhee S.G. Cascade control of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. Purification and properties of PII uridylyltransferase and uridylyl-removing enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258 (6130097): 2246-2253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification was facilitated by the use of an E. coli strain that harbors multiple copies of the UTase gene and overproduces the enzyme by a factor of 25. This strain was selected by screening the Clarke and Carbon collection of 2000 E. coli strains that carry ColE1 plasmids containing small random segments of the bacterial chromosome. Using the purified enzyme, which comprises a single polypeptide, we showed that it catalyzes the uridylylation as well as the deuridylylation of PII, similar to the bifunctionality exhibited by ATase (Fig. 2). One day in 1982, Earl Stadtman came to my office and casually mentioned that it might be time for me to move on to a new area of research, adding that he would continue to get undeserved credit for the work I published as long as I continued to work on GS. He also mentioned that he was gradually shifting his focus to the role of protein oxidation and degradation in aging. I sensed he was telling me that I had become too complacent with my work—around that time we had cloned all four genes for the protein components of the GS regulatory cascade (GS, ATase, PII, and UTase), and we continued to publish follow-up papers on the regulation of GS in E. coli. Appreciative of his generosity and wisdom, which he had shared with many of his trainees (Stadtman mentored two Nobel laureates, multiple members of the National Academy of Sciences, and many current leaders in the biomedical community), I took his advice seriously, and I decided to look for a new research topic. One easy choice was to study GS in yeast, which had been shown by others to be subject to complex regulation as in E. coli, but not through either nucleotidylation or phosphorylation. Kanghwa Kim joined my lab as a postdoctoral fellow from Korea in 1983 and devoted his full efforts to this topic. Although our studies in this area were largely unfruitful, an astute observation made by Kanghwa during the purification of yeast GS led us to discover a family of unconventional antioxidant enzymes, which we later named peroxiredoxins. This discovery led me to concentrate my last 20 years of research on the intracellular messenger function of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its regulation by peroxiredoxins (more on this later). Ultimately, although intrigued by the similarities and dissimilarities between the GS enzymes of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, I was not satisfied with our progress on regulation of the yeast enzyme, and I continued to look for a new area of investigation. While attending a number of NIH and national conferences in 1984 and 1985, I noticed certain sessions were crowded and often overflowed to the entrance. Curious about what was drawing such interest, I stepped out of my immediate area of research and was introduced to the two newly crowned second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Through further reading, I came to comprehend that these two messengers are generated as a result of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C (PLC) in response to the activation of various cell-surface receptors, that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, and that diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (7Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Inositol trisphosphate, a novel second messenger in cellular signal transduction.Nature. 1984; 312 (6095092): 315-32110.1038/312315a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4246) Google Scholar, 8Nishizuka Y. The role of protein kinase C in cell surface signal transduction and tumour promotion.Nature. 1984; 308 (6232463): 693-69810.1038/308693a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar). I also learned that one critical question that remained regarding this bifurcating signaling pathway was how various receptors are coupled to PLC. I felt that purification of PLC and the cloning of its cDNA would be necessary to address this question. Several earlier studies suggested that the coupling of receptor function to PLC is mediated by an unspecified G protein, in a manner analogous to the modulation of adenylate cyclase via the G proteins Gs and Gi, which couple receptor function to synthesis of the second messenger cAMP (9Gilman A.G. G proteins and dual control of adenylate cyclase.Cell. 1984; 36 (6321035): 577-57910.1016/0092-8674(84)90336-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Alfred Gilman's finding that adenylate cyclase is an intrinsic membrane protein strongly suggested that the association of PLC with the plasma membrane would also be a prerequisite for its regulation by cell-surface receptors. Indeed, PLC activity had been detected in various membrane preparations by several investigators. Nevertheless, we decided to purify PLC from the cytosolic fraction of bovine brain because the cytosolic fraction showed a much higher phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing activity than did the membrane fraction. Several people I later met at various meetings asked me why I pursued the seemingly unrewarding purification of cytosolic PLC. The answer was ignorance—I simply did not know enough about G proteins and adenylate cyclase at that time to try to account for the coupling of PLC function to cell-surface receptors. Just as I was launching this project, two postdoctoral fellows, Sung Ho Ryu (in late 1985) and Pan-Ghill Suh (in early 1986), joined my laboratory. They were not at all familiar with G proteins, adenylate cyclase, or, for that matter, PLC. I am sure that if they had been fully informed about what they were getting into, they would have said no to my suggestion. Fortunately, I at least had the prior experience of purifying GS, and I felt both physically and mentally prepared to embark on the large-scale purification of PLC. Early each Monday morning, one of us would drive 50 miles round trip to purchase 16 fresh bovine brains from the J. W. Treuth & Sons slaughterhouse in Catonsville, MD, near Baltimore. It was usually past midnight by the time we had prepared a cytosolic fraction and started to apply it to an ion-exchange chromatography column, which yielded three partially resolved peaks of PLC activity. After processing 400 bovine brains through five chromatography steps, we succeeded in 1986 to 1987 in purifying to homogeneity three distinct forms of PLC with molecular masses of 150, 145, and 85 kDa. We initially named these bovine brain enzymes PLC-I, PLC-II, and PLC-III, respectively (10Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Cho K.S. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Bovine brain cytosol contains three immunologically distinct forms of inositolphospholipid-specific phospholipase C.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84 (3477795): 6649-665310.1073/pnas.84.19.6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Two small incidents (although perhaps not small from the perspective of the NIH safety officers) occurred at this time. We use to homogenize one brain at a time in a Waring blender with 1 liter of buffer containing two protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. After a number of weeks of this operation, we all began to complain that it was rather dark in the cold room and asked building maintenance to change the fluorescent light bulbs. One of us then noticed that our pupils were all markedly constricted. Although we had thought that we were dealing with the neurotoxic diisopropyl fluorophosphate (a cholinesterase inhibitor) with extreme care, we were performing the fume-generating homogenization process 16 times in 1 day in a poorly ventilated cold room. Fortunately, after we stopped using diisopropyl fluorophosphate, our vision returned to normal. A second incident, which took longer to resolve, occurred while we were preparing 32P-labeled phosphoinositide for use in our PLC assay. While harvesting yeast grown in a medium containing [32P]orthophosphate, a bottle broke inside the centrifuge. My license for isotopes was suspended, and the centrifuge was sealed for several months. By 1988, we had cloned the cDNAs corresponding to the three bovine brain PLC enzymes (11Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cloning and sequence of multiple forms of phospholipase C.Cell. 1988; 54 (3390863): 161-16910.1016/0092-8674(88)90548-XAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As we and others purified and cloned more PLC enzymes, it became apparent that bovine PLC-I, -II, and -III were the first three prototypical members of a PLC family, with each type of PLC actually comprising two to four different proteins. Conversely, a 62-kDa PLC purified from guinea pig uterus in 1987 appeared to be distinct from the three types of PLC purified from bovine brain (12Bennett C.F. Balcarek J.M. Varrichio A. Crooke S.T. Molecular cloning and complete amino-acid sequence of form-I phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.Nature. 1988; 334 (3398923): 268-27010.1038/334268a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We therefore started to use Greek letters to designate the PLC enzymes with distinct primary structures, assigning the letters according to the chronological order of their purification—α for the 62-kDa enzyme, β for the 150-kDa enzyme, γ for the 145-kDa enzyme, and δ for the 85-kDa enzyme—and we assigned Arabic numerals to be placed after the Greek letters to designate subfamily members (13Rhee S.G. Regulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70 (11395409): 281-31210.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ revealed that, although these three types of enzyme showed a low overall sequence similarity, they shared marked similarity in two regions designated X (∼150 amino acids) and Y (∼120 amino acids). We therefore predicted that the X and Y regions constitute the catalytic site, with this prediction ultimately being corroborated when the crystal structure of PLC-δ was determined. Whereas PLC-β and PLC-δ contain short sequences of 50–70 amino acids separating the X and Y regions, PLC-γ has a long sequence of 400 amino acids separating the two regions that contain both Src homology (SH) 2 and SH3 domains, the domains first identified as noncatalytic regions common to a variety of Src-family tyrosine kinases (14Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C: complete cDNA and protein sequences and sequence homology to tyrosine kinase-related oncogene products.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85 (2840660): 5419-542310.1073/pnas.85.15.5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PLC-γ was the first nontyrosine kinase protein found to harbor SH2 and SH3 domains. The subsequent identification of SH2 and SH3 domains in several other proteins that do not possess tyrosine kinase activity contributed substantially to our understanding of the role of protein–protein interactions in signal transduction pathways. Surprisingly, the sequence of PLC-α showed no similarity to those of the other PLC enzymes. The isolated cDNA was subsequently found to encode a protein-disulfide isomerase devoid of PLC activity. The putative PLC-α cDNA was obtained with the use of an antibody directed against the 62-kDa uterus enzyme. Apparently, however, the enzyme preparation was contaminated with a protein-disulfide isomerase that is highly antigenic. The PLC-α protein was subsequently shown to be a fragment of PLC-δ1 (15Taylor G.D. Fee J.A. Silbert D.F. Hofmann S.L.

As I have already mentioned, an important issue in the area of receptor signaling concerned the mechanism by which PLC activity is coupled to various receptors. Although we had the PLC clones in hand and not being familiar with cell-surface receptors, we were unsure how best to tackle this question. Luckily, as the result of fruitful collaboration with Graham Carpenter, Joseph Schlessinger, Tony Hunter, and Gordon Guroff, we were able to show that treatment of a number of cell types with epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or nerve growth factor induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, but not that of PLC-β1 or PLC-δ1, and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 correlated well with the increa"

The pathogenesis of PIS remains to be elucidated and specific treatments have not been established; therefore, prognosis is generally poor. The purpose of our study was to isolate and characterize PIS cells from a specimen resected from a patient with PIS. The surgical specimen was minced and incubated, and spindle-shaped and small cells were successfully isolated and designated as PIS-1. PIS-1 cells at passages 8-9 were used for all in vitro and in vivo experiments. Immunocytochemistry showed that PIS-1 cells were positive for vimentin, murine double minute 2, and CD44 and negative for α-smooth muscle actin, CD31, von Willebrand factor, and desmin. PIS-1 cells exhibited the hallmarks of malignant cells including the potential for autonomous proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, invasion, genetic instability, and tumorigenicity in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The PIS-1 cells highly expressed tyrosine kinase receptors such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Pazopanib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suppressed the proliferation of PIS-1 cells in vitro and the growth of tumors formed from xenografted PIS-1 cells. A PIS cell line was thus successfully established. The PIS-1 cells highly expressed tyrosine kinase receptors, which may be a target for treatment of PIS."
https://openalex.org/W2929415846,"Background Cardiovascular disease is common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). Up to 80% of children with SLE develop kidney disease, which is also associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and death compared to those without renal involvement. Hepcidin is an iron-regulatory protein which may contribute to atherosclerosis and is elevated in autoimmune disease. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a validated indicator of arterial stiffness, an early marker of cardiovascular risk, and is increased in children with SLE versus healthy controls. Our objective was to quantify hepcidin and PWV in children with SLE and investigate if those with biopsy-proven LN have higher hepcidin levels and higher PWV compared to those without kidney disease. Methods Cross-sectional analysis with hepcidin was measured via ELISA assay in 16 children aged 10–21 years with SLE recruited from a single center. Subjects were classified as having LN if histologic evidence of the disease was documented on a clinical renal biopsy. Serum hepcidin was quantified using a validated competitive enzyme-linked immunoassay. Carotid-femoral PWV was measured using applanation tonometry. Wilcoxon rank sum testing was used to compare median levels of hepcidin, PWV, and other continuous variables by nephritis status. Results The cohort (n = 16) was 93.8% female and 68.8% African-American with mean (SD) 16 (3.6) years. 37.5% (n = 6) had LN. Overall median (IQR) hepcidin was 34.4 (18.9, 91.9) ng/ml, and PWV 4.4 (4, 4.6) meters/second. Although significance was limited by small sample size, both hepcidin and PWV were higher in the subjects with LN. Median (IQR) hepcidin in subjects with LN was 71.5 (26.4, 116.4) ng/ml compared to 27.9 (18.7, 59.7) ng/ml in those with SLE(p = 0.19). Similarly, median (IQR) PWV in those with LN was 4.4 (4.4, 4.9) meters/second compared to 3 (3.75, 4.55) meters/second in those with without kidney involvement (p = 0.10). Conclusion PWV and serum hepcidin were higher in subjects with LN compared to those with SLE alone, suggesting that elevated hepcidin levels may be associated with morbid CV changes in children with LN. This association, along with identification of additional predictors of arterial stiffness in patients with LN, warrants further investigation."

These validation studies indicate that cutoffs of MESC score in the Oxford Classification may not be generalizable. Thus, we aimed to improve the clinical value of MESC scores by modifying the cutoff points. A total of 104 patients with IgAN were diagnosed from 2001 to 2012 vai renal biopsy and retrospectively evaluated at Nagoya University Hospital. The cutoff point for modified (M´E´S´C´) was determined using the receiver operating characteristic curve in association with renal outcome in the training cohort. Clinical values of the Oxford MESTC vs M´E´S´C´ cutoff points were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression in association with poor renal outcome in the validation and the entire cohort. Of 104 patients, 12.5% reached poor renal outcome over a median of 6.25 [4.16–9.61] years of follow-up. The modified cutoffs were defined as ≥40%, ≥10%, ≥20%, and ≥5% in the glomeruli for M´E´S´, and C´ respectively. In univariate analysis, E´, S ´, and T were significantly associated with poor renal outcome, whereas Oxford MESC, M´, and C´ in the training and validation cohort were not associated with poor renal outcome. Using multivariate analysis in the presence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), only E´ was a significant predictive factor for poor renal outcome. The E´ with modified cutoff point of 10% significantly improved predictive value for poor renal outcome in IgAN. Therefore, the clinical value of modified cutoff points for M´E´S´C´ scores should be validated with various cohort studies in different regions."

https://openalex.org/W2952180951,"Cultured cell populations are composed of heterogeneous cells, and previous single-cell lineage tracking analysis of individual HeLa cells provided empirical evidence for significant heterogeneity of the rate of cell proliferation and induction of cell death. Nevertheless, such cell lines have been used for investigations of cellular responses to various substances, resulting in incomplete characterizations. This problem caused by heterogeneity within cell lines could be overcome by investigating the spatiotemporal responses of individual cells to a substance. However, no approach to investigate the responses by analyzing spatiotemporal data is currently available. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal responses of individual HeLa cells to cytotoxic, sub-cytotoxic, and non-cytotoxic doses of the well-characterized carcinogen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Although cytotoxic doses of MNNG are known to induce cell death, the single-cell tracking approach revealed that cell death occurred following at least four different cellular events, suggesting that cell death is induced via multiple processes. We also found that HeLa cells exposed to a sub-cytotoxic dose of MNNG were in a state of equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell death, with cell death again induced through different processes. However, exposure of cells to a non-cytotoxic dose of MNNG promoted growth by reducing the cell doubling time, thus promoting the growth of a sub-population of cells. A single-cell lineage tracking approach could dissect processes leading to cell death in a spatiotemporal manner and the results suggest that spatiotemporal data obtained by tracking individual cells can be used as a new type of bioinformatics data resource that enables the examination of cellular responses to various external substances."

For such immune disorders, anti-cytokine therapies are at the forefront of treatment options, and anti-TNF therapies based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or soluble TNF receptors (TNFRs) have been extensively employed. One such commonly used therapy is etanercept, a fusion protein containing the ligand-binding domain of TNFR2 fused to the Fc domain of a human IgG1 (1Murray K.M. Dahl S.L. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor receptor (p75) Fc fusion protein (TNFR:Fc) in rheumatoid arthritis.Ann.

Poxviruses encode proteins that antagonize host-immune responses, including virally encoded cytokine-binding proteins that are secreted from infected cells (3Alcami A.

Elucidating the mechanisms whereby viral proteins antagonize their host targets sheds light on viral pathogenesis but can also reveal important details about the host proteins themselves. Since viruses have been engaging with our immune system for millennia, highly evolved host-targeting viral proteins can contain useful information that could potentially be used therapeutically to target inflammation (4Lysakova-Devine T. Keogh B. Harrington B. Nagpal K. Halle A. Golenbock D.T. Monie T. Bowie A.G.

CrmD has been known for some time (3Alcami A. Viral mimicry of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors.Nat. Rev.

It has been presumed that, like other TNFRs, CrmD binds to TNFSF cytokines via its cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), which are characteristic of both viral and host TNFRs. The authors previously showed that CrmD binds to and neutralizes hTNF, but—unusually for a soluble TNFR—is not capable of neutralizing the closely related TNFSF member lymphotoxin-α (hLTα) (5Pontejo S.M. Alejo A. Alcami A. Comparative biochemical and functional analysis of viral and human secreted tumor necrosis factor (TNF) decoy receptors.J. Biol.

This was of interest since understanding the molecular determinants explaining hTNF and hLTα targeting by TNFRs could be useful in refining etanercept, which binds to both hTNF and hLTα. A new version of etanercept with reduced affinity for hLTα could reduce side effects due to LTα binding and also maintain the host-defense activity of LTα against pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis for those patients taking anti-TNF therapy (6Roach D.R. Briscoe H. Saunders B. France M.P. Riminton S. Britton W.J. Secreted lymphotoxin-alpha is essential for the control of an intracellular bacterial infection.J. Exp.

To do this, they expressed and purified CrmD and associated mutant proteins from recombinant baculoviruses and used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to assay the binding of CrmD to mouse and human TNFSF cytokines and to mouse chemokines. The authors also used functional assays to check whether changes in binding affinity correlated with changes in inhibition of TNFSF-mediated cytotoxicity or chemokine-mediated chemotaxis. These approaches yielded a number of new insights into how CrmD antagonizes both TNFSF cytokines (through its N-terminal CRD domains) and chemokines (through its C-terminal domain) (2Pontejo S.M. Sanchez C. Ruiz-Argüello B. Alcami A. Insights into ligand binding by a viral tumor necrosis factor (TNF) decoy receptor yield a selective soluble human type 2 TNF receptor.J. Biol.

In terms of the TNFSF targets, it was known that CRD2 and CRD3 contain the main ligand-binding determining residues of TNFRs (7Zhang G. Tumor necrosis factor family ligand-receptor binding.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14 (15093829): 154-16010.1016/j.sbi.2004.03.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the mutagenesis analysis of CrmD focused on two regions within these domains—the 50s loop in CRD2 and the 90s loop in CRD3. Thus, mutations of 50s and 90s loop residues were assayed by SPR for binding affinities for four different CrmD ligands—mTNF, hTNF, mLTα, and hLTα. Key discoveries from these experiments included showing the importance of a groove in CRD2 formed under the 50s loop, and of specific residues in CRD3, for binding to all four CrmD ligands tested. Importantly, the authors also found residues in CRD3 that when mutated decreased the binding affinity for all ligands except hLTα. Interestingly, other ligand-specific differences between the CrmD mutants included the observation that altering residues in the 50s and 90s loops, and the connecting region between them, affected mTNF binding without significantly impinging on the binding to the other ligands, suggesting that CrmD was optimized for mTNF binding. They also noticed that many of the mTNF-specific binding determinants appeared to obstruct hLTα binding, suggesting a selective pressure on CrmD to maintain mTNF, but not hLTα binding, consistent with its role in the mouse-specific pathogen ectromelia virus (ECTV). Reduced binding activity against TNFSF cytokines often, but not always, was found to correlate with reduced functional activity in blocking TNFSF-mediated cytotoxicity. Of relevance to etanercept was the observation that one 90s loop CrmD mutant, E116A/F117A/E118A, displayed a strong gain of both anti-hLTα activity and hLTα binding affinity. It was then hypothesized that transfer of this EFE motif into etanercept might reduce its affinity for hLTα. Sequence alignment showed that the EFE motif mapped to the residues Ala127-Leu128-Ser129 in the etanercept 90s loop (Fig. 1). However, examination of a TNFR2:TNF co-crystal structure showed that the Ser129 residue did not face the ligand interface, which was also the case for Glu118 in the CrmD model. Thus, in order to potentially transfer a minimal hLTα-blocking motif into etanercept, the authors made an etanercept A127E/L128F mutant. Remarkably, this mutant did indeed display strongly reduced neutralizing activity toward hLTα (60-fold reduced compared with WT protein), and only very mildly reduced neutralizing activity toward hTNF (3-fold reduced compared with WT protein), even though the binding affinity for hLTα was not significantly affected in the mutant. Thus, they successfully transferred viral molecular information into etanercept to favorably modify its activity profile. This paper demonstrates the value of understanding highly evolved viral cytokine-binding proteins in order to refine anti-cytokine therapeutics. Poxviruses and clinicians “want” the same thing, namely to be able to dampen down the host’s inflammatory response, and in both cases it makes sense to have a diversity of tools at one’s disposal for this. Clinical anti-TNFs are mainly mAbs, which are effective, but do have limitations. Etanercept represents an alternative TNF-targeting strategy, and “viral refinement” may make it more mainstream, and a similar approach could be used for other anti-cytokine therapies. It is likely that there is a lot that viruses can still teach us about targeting cytokines, and this paper should encourage a renewed interest in re-examining other known viral cytokine-binding proteins to mine them for useful therapeutic information.
