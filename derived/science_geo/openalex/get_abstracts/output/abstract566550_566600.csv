https://openalex.org/W2517176893,"Elongation of rod-shaped bacteria is mediated by a dynamic peptidoglycan-synthetizing machinery called the Rod complex. Here we report that, in Bacillus subtilis, this complex is functional in the absence of all known peptidoglycan polymerases. Cells lacking these enzymes survive by inducing an envelope stress response that increases the expression of RodA, a widely conserved core component of the Rod complex. RodA is a member of the SEDS (shape, elongation, division and sporulation) family of proteins, which have essential but ill-defined roles in cell wall biogenesis during growth, division and sporulation. Our genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that SEDS proteins constitute a family of peptidoglycan polymerases. Thus, B. subtilis and probably most bacteria use two distinct classes of polymerase to synthesize their exoskeleton. Our findings indicate that SEDS family proteins are core cell wall synthases of the cell elongation and division machinery, and represent attractive targets for antibiotic development."

Akt-mTOR signaling is one of the key cellular pathways essential for brain development and autophagy regulation. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of human fetal neural stem cells (fNSCs) causes inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway, leading to defective neurogenesis and aberrant activation of autophagy. By screening the three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins present in ZIKV, we found that two, NS4A and NS4B, cooperatively suppress the Akt-mTOR pathway and lead to cellular dysregulation. Corresponding proteins from the closely related dengue virus do not have the same effect on neurogenesis. Thus, our study highlights ZIKV NS4A and NS4B as candidate determinants of viral pathogenesis and identifies a mechanism of action for their effects, suggesting potential targets for anti-ZIKV therapeutic intervention.

Zika virus (ZIKV), a reemerging arthropod-bone flavivirus, was initially isolated from Rhesus macaque in Uganda as early as 1947, while the first human infection was reported in 1954 (Dick, 1952Dick G.W.A.

Although sexually transmitted cases have been recently documented, ZIKV is most commonly transmitted through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes (Musso et al., 2015Musso D. Roche C. Robin E.

Individuals infected by ZIKV typically develop a mild or unapparent dengue-like disease (Duffy et al., 2009Duffy M.R. Chen T.-H. Hancock W.T. Powers A.M. Kool J.L. Lanciotti R.S. Pretrick M. Marfel M. Holzbauer S. Dubray C. et al.Zika virus outbreak on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 2536-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). However, mounting evidence has linked ZIKV infection to neurological defects in newborns (De Carvalho et al., 2016De Carvalho N.S. De Carvalho B.F. Fugaça C.A. Dóris B. Biscaia E.S. Zika virus infection during pregnancy and microcephaly occurrence: a review of literature and Brazilian data.Braz. J. Infect. Dis. 2016; 20: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ZIKV was detected in the amniotic fluids of pregnant women as well as in the brain tissues of microcephalic fetuses, suggesting that ZIKV can potentially cross the placental barrier to infect fetuses (Calvet et al., 2016Calvet G. Aguiar R.S. Melo A.S.O. Sampaio S.A. de Filippis I. Fabri A.

In addition, an increased rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome was noted following the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia from 2013 to 2014 (Cauchemez et al., 2016Cauchemez S. Besnard M. Bompard P. Dub T. Guillemette-Artur P. Eyrolle-Guignot D. Salje H. Van Kerkhove M.D. Abadie V.

The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Heymann et al., 2016Heymann D.L. Hodgson A. Sall A.A. Freedman D.O. Staples J.E. Althabe F. Baruah K. Mahmud G. Kandun N. Vasconcelos P.F.C. et al.Zika virus and microcephaly: why is this situation a PHEIC?.Lancet. 2016; 387: 719-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that ZIKV causes microcephaly and other birth defects. Although ZIKV infection impairs the growth of neurospheres and brain organoids derived from iPSCs (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P. Loiola E.C. Madeiro da Costa R. Higa L.M. Trindade P. Delvecchio R.

In particular, dengue virus (DENV), a closely related member of the flaviviridae family, has not been linked to either microcephaly or defects in neurogenesis (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P. Loiola E.C. Madeiro da Costa R. Higa L.M. Trindade P. Delvecchio R. Nascimento J.M. Brindeiro R. Tanuri A. Rehen S.K. Zika virus impairs growth in human neurospheres and brain organoids.Science. 2016; 352: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), suggesting that ZIKV’s neuropathology might be causally linked to those differences in its sequence from dengue. Neurogenesis, the key process by which neurons are differentiated from neural stem cells (NSCs) or neural progenitor cells (NPCs), is most active during prenatal development and responsible for populating the growing brain with neurons (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Genetic defects that are associated with neurogenesis and migration often result in human developmental neurological disorders including microcephaly (Ming and Song, 2011Ming G.L. Song H. Adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain: significant answers and significant questions.Neuron. 2011; 70: 687-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). A number of key cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, are essential for neurogenesis from NSCs, as well as for subsequent migration and maturation (Lee, 2015Lee Y. Roles of mTOR Signaling in Brain Development.Exp. Neurobiol. 2015; 24: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wahane et al., 2014Wahane S.D. Hellbach N. Prentzell M.T. Weise S.C. Vezzali R. Kreutz C. Timmer J. Krieglstein K. Thedieck K. Vogel T. PI3K-p110-alpha-subtype signalling mediates survival, proliferation and neurogenesis of cortical progenitor cells via activation of mTORC2.J. Neurochem. 2014; 130: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that activating mutations in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may occur in brain overdevelopment syndromes, which include megalencephaly-capillary malformation and megalencephaly-polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (Mirzaa et al., 2013Mirzaa G.M. Rivière J.-B. Dobyns W.B. Megalencephaly syndromes and activating mutations in the PI3K-AKT pathway: MPPH and MCAP.Am. J. Med. Genet. C. Semin. Med. Genet. 2013; 163C: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, mTOR inhibition in the developing brain causes microcephaly (Cloëtta et al., 2013Cloëtta D. Thomanetz V. Baranek C. Lustenberger R.M. Lin S. Oliveri F. Atanasoski S. Rüegg M.A. Inactivation of mTORC1 in the developing brain causes microcephaly and affects gliogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7799-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Upstream to mTOR, Akt is the central signaling molecule in the PI3K pathway, and it plays critical roles in brain development as well as synaptic plasticity (Franke, 2008Franke T.F. PI3K/Akt: getting it right matters.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6473-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Non-functional Akt mutation leads to microcephaly in humans (Mirzaa et al., 2013Mirzaa G.M. Rivière J.-B. Dobyns W.B. Megalencephaly syndromes and activating mutations in the PI3K-AKT pathway: MPPH and MCAP.Am. J. Med. Genet. C. Semin. Med. Genet. 2013; 163C: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), while activating Akt mutation causes megalencephaly (Nellist et al., 2015Nellist M. Schot R. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Neuteboom R.F. van der Louw E.J.T.M. Lequin M.H. Bindels-de Heus K. Sibbles B.J. de Coo R. Brooks A. Mancini G.M.

Nikkel S.M. et al.Finding of Rare Disease Genes (FORGE) Canada ConsortiumDe novo germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant-negative Akt also blocks neuronal production from human NSCs isolated from fetuses in vitro (Guo et al., 2013Guo H. Zhao Z. Yang Q. Wang M. Bell R.D. Wang S. Chow N. Davis T.P. Griffin J.H. Goldman S.A. Zlokovic B.V. An activated protein C analog stimulates neuronal production by human neural progenitor cells via a PAR1-PAR3-S1PR1-Akt pathway.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 6181-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hence, human pathogens, including DNA viruses, have been found to hijack the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway for their successful replication in mammalian cells (Buchkovich et al., 2008Buchkovich N.J. Yu Y. Zampieri C.A. Alwine J.C. The TORrid affairs of viruses: effects of mammalian DNA viruses on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Yet despite the common outcomes of ZIKV infection and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibition, no causal association between the two has yet been reported. Flaviviruses, such as DENV, Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and ZIKV, have been shown to modulate cellular autophagy to benefit their replication in host cells (Hamel et al., 2015Hamel R. Dejarnac O. Wichit S. Ekchariyawat P. Neyret A. Luplertlop N. Perera-Lecoin M. Surasombatpattana P. Talignani L. Thomas F. et al.Biology of Zika Virus Infection in Human Skin Cells.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 18036-18043Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy, often referred to as autophagy, is an important catabolic process involving the formation of double-membrane vesicles, called autophagosomes, which sequester cytoplasmic damaged organelles, protein aggregates, or invading intracellular pathogens for degradation (Levine et al., 2011Levine B. Mizushima N. Virgin H.W. Autophagy in immunity and inflammation.Nature. 2011; 469: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). The mTOR kinase serves as a gatekeeper for autophagy induction: the activation of mTOR by Akt and MAPK signaling suppresses autophagy, and the inactivation of mTOR by AMPK and p53 signaling promotes autophagy. Autophagy is also an active cellular protective mechanism against viral infection; viruses thus try to modulate autophagy to benefit their life cycles. Certain herpesviruses suppress autophagy by their viral proteins to establish persistent infection (Liang et al., 2013Liang Q. Chang B. Brulois K.F. Castro K. Min C.-K. Rodgers M.A. Shi M. Ge J. Feng P. Oh B.-H. Jung J.U. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K7 modulates Rubicon-mediated inhibition of autophagosome maturation.J.

Immunol. 2012; 3: 170Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, certain flaviviruses such as ZIKV and DENV have recently been reported to hijack autophagy to similarly support viral replication (Hamel et al., 2015Hamel R. Dejarnac O. Wichit S. Ekchariyawat P. Neyret A. Luplertlop N. Perera-Lecoin M. Surasombatpattana P. Talignani L. Thomas F. et al.Biology of Zika Virus Infection in Human Skin Cells.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 8880-8896Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, Heaton and Randall, 2010Heaton N.S. Randall G. Dengue virus-induced autophagy regulates lipid metabolism.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 422-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Specifically, DENV NS4A upregulates autophagy in epithelial cells (McLean et al., 2011McLean J.E. Wudzinska A. Datan E. Quaglino D. Zakeri Z. Flavivirus NS4A-induced autophagy protects cells against death and enhances virus replication.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 22147-22159Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unknown whether ZIKV infection induces autophagy through a similar mechanism to DENV. Nevertheless, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying ZIKV-induced autophagy activation in host cells may shed insight on its pathogenesis. Recent reports using human NSCs have demonstrated the vulnerability of these cells to ZIKV infection (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P. Loiola E.C. Madeiro da Costa R. Higa L.M. Trindade P.

Hyg. 2016; 94: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These suggest the direct cause of ZIKV for human microcephaly via intrauterine infection and defective neurogenesis. However, no analogous studies have been performed on native human fetal tissues or NSCs, largely due to the limited availability of fetal human tissue. Here, we utilized two primary isolates of fNSCs, recovered from second trimester human fetuses, a gestational period of great ZIKV vulnerability in human brain development, to study how ZIKV infection impairs fetal brain development. We found that ZIKV infection of human fNSCs results in the inhibition of neurosphere growth and neurogenic differentiation potential, as well as the induction of autophagy. Further screening for ZIKV proteins revealed that the cooperation of NS4A and NS4B strongly suppresses host Akt-mTOR signaling, potentially leading to the impairment of neurogenesis of human fNSCs and the upregulation of autophagy, synergistically promoting viral replication. In order to model ZIKV infection in human fNSCs (Guo et al., 2013Guo H. Zhao Z. Yang Q. Wang M. Bell R.D. Wang S. Chow N. Davis T.P. Griffin J.H. Goldman S.A. Zlokovic B.V.

Consistent with NSCs derived from human iPSCs (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P. Loiola E.C. Madeiro da Costa R. Higa L.M. Trindade P. Delvecchio R. Nascimento J.M. Brindeiro R. Tanuri A. Rehen S.K.

At 3 days post-infection (dpi), mock-treated fNSCs in suspension culture formed neurospheres that had an average size of 81.7 μm (Figures 1C–1E). However, MR766-, IbH30656-, or H/PF/2013-infected fNSCs at MOI 0.01 formed fewer neurospheres with smaller average sizes of 54.3 μm, 51.2 μm, or 52.6 μm, respectively (Figures 1D and 1E). Immunohistological analysis on 7 dpi neurospheres showed the presence of ZIKV E antigen within the neurospheres (Figures 1F and S1D). In addition, ZIKV-infected neurospheres contained more apoptotic cells than mock-infected neurospheres, as shown by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) (Figure 1G). Correlation analysis between neurosphere sizes and cell death from 30 mock-treated and 30 ZIKV-infected neurospheres showed that ZIKV infection augmented the death of fNSCs in the neurospheres, in proportion to their size (Figure S1E). While ZIKV infection did not alter the expression of neural stem cell markers, e.g., Nestin and SOX2 (Figures 1F and 1G), it led to the progressive reduction of fNSC proliferation as reflected by BrdU incorporation (Figure S1F). These results show that ZIKV infection not only induces the death of human fNSCs but also impairs their proliferation and clonal expansion in neurospheres. The endoplasmic reticulum provides a membrane platform for the biogenesis of flavivirus replication complex, and autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets is required for efficient flavivirus replication (Heaton and Randall, 2010Heaton N.S. Randall G. Dengue virus-induced autophagy regulates lipid metabolism.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 422-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). To determine changes in the level of autophagy upon ZIKV infection, we examined the light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II conversion and the formation of LC3 punctate structure in ZIKV-infected fNSCs. Infection with ZIKV strains MR766 and IbH30656 efficiently induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and LC3 puncta formation of fNSCs in the presence or absence of lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Figures 1H–1I and S1G–S1I). The p62/SQSTM level also decreased due to ZIKV-mediated autophagosome maturation (Figures 1H and S1G). Similar results were obtained from HeLa cells and MEFs (Figures S1J–S1L and S2A–S2D). To investigate the role of autophagy in ZIKV infection, we assessed ZIKV replication using Atg3 knockout (KO) MEFs, in which autophagy is completely defective due to the loss of the Atg3 E2 enzyme. ZIKV replication was reduced by approximately 7-fold in Atg3 KO MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs (Figures S2E and S2F). In addition, ZIKV-infected Atg3 KO MEFs showed no detectable LC3-I to LC3-II conversion (Figure S1L). Similar results were obtained in Atg5 KO MEFs, and Atg3 or Atg13 knockdown fNSCs (Figures S2G–S2I). Accordingly, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin promoted ZIKV load in both fNSCs and HeLa cells, whereas the inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA or chloroquine impaired ZIKV load (Figures 1J, S2J, and S2K). These results indicate that ZIKV infection induces autophagy in fNSCs, which in turn leads to increased ZIKV replication and viral load. Previous reports (Garcez et al., 2016Garcez P.P. Loiola E.C.

Like other flavivirus family members, ZIKV is expected to encode ten viral proteins including three structural and seven non-structural proteins (NSs). To determine which viral proteins might play inhibitory roles in cell proliferation and neurosphere formation, human fNSCs were transduced with lentivirus containing each ZIKV gene and examined for neurosphere formation (Figures S3A–S3C). Expression of each ZIKV protein was detected by immunoblotting at 2 dpi (Figure S3D), and the size and number of neurospheres were measured at 7 dpi. Interestingly, human fNSCs expressing NS4A or NS4B exhibited impaired neurosphere formation (Figure 2A), as reflected in their reduced efficiency of neurosphere production from standard aliquots of 1 × 105 fNSCs (Figure 2B). Moreover, the majority of neurospheres (>90%) were less than 100 μm in diameter (Figure 2C), and the average neurosphere size significantly reduced by 40.3% or 32.3%, respectively, when NS4A or NS4B was expressed (Figure S3C). Remarkably, co-expression of NS4A and NS4B resulted in further inhibition of neurosphere formation, with the near absence of neurospheres with diameters of 100 μm or higher and a reduction of average neurosphere size by 52.0% (Figures 2A–2C and S3A–S3C). Unlike ZIKV NS4A and NS4B, co-expression of DENV NS4A and NS4B did not cause the significant inhibition of neurosphere formation under the same conditions (Figures S3E–S3G). BrdU incorporation analysis showed that expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B also altered the proliferation rates of fNSCs (Figures 2D–2F) without affecting the expression of fNSCs markers, including SOX2 (Figure 2A). Specifically, the expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B led to a 48.9%, 44.1%, or 64.7% reduction of fNSC proliferation, respectively, compared to the vector control (Figure 2D). In addition, immunostaining for Nestin and Ki-67 showed that expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B led to a ∼43%, ∼28%, or ∼63% reduction of Nestin+- and Ki-67+-positive proliferating fNSCs, respectively, compared with that of vector control (Figures 2E and 2F). More interestingly, when fNSCs were cultured on poly-L-ornithine- and laminin-coated surface for 10 days to induce their differentiation into neuronal cells (Guo et al., 2013Guo H. Zhao Z. Yang Q. Wang M. Bell R.D. Wang S. Chow N. Davis T.P. Griffin J.H. Goldman S.A. Zlokovic B.V.

Upon expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B, the differentiation rates to the β3-tubulin-positive neuronal cells and GFAP-positive astrocytes were reduced by approximately 25%–54% and 28%–51%, respectively (Figures 2H and 2J). However, expression of NS4A, NS4B, or NS4A-NS4B did not lead to apoptotic cell death in fNSCs, suggesting that expression of NS4A and NS4B is not toxic to cells (Figure S3H). Collectively, these data demonstrate that mitotic neurogenesis of fNSCs is selectively and substantially impaired by ZIKV NS4A and NS4B when these proteins are ectopically expressed individually and in combination. Since ZIKV infection induces autophagy in multiple cell types, we attempted to determine which viral proteins trigger"
https://openalex.org/W2511090954,"Disorders resulting from mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta gene (HBB; which encodes β-globin), mainly sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia, become symptomatic postnatally as fetal γ-globin expression from two paralogous genes, hemoglobin subunit gamma 1 (HBG1) and HBG2, decreases and adult β-globin expression increases, thereby shifting red blood cell (RBC) hemoglobin from the fetal (referred to as HbF or α2γ2) to adult (referred to as HbA or α2β2) form. These disorders are alleviated when postnatal expression of fetal γ-globin is maintained. For example, in hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), a benign genetic condition, mutations attenuate γ-globin-to-β-globin switching, causing high-level HbF expression throughout life. Co-inheritance of HPFH with β-thalassemia- or SCD-associated gene mutations alleviates their clinical manifestations. Here we performed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing of human blood progenitors to mutate a 13-nt sequence that is present in the promoters of the HBG1 and HBG2 genes, thereby recapitulating a naturally occurring HPFH-associated mutation. Edited progenitors produced RBCs with increased HbF levels that were sufficient to inhibit the pathological hypoxia-induced RBC morphology found in SCD. Our findings identify a potential DNA target for genome-editing-mediated therapy of β-hemoglobinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2509928882,"Class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane proteins that mediate a wide variety of physiological functions, including vision, neurotransmission and immune responses. They are the targets of nearly one-third of all prescribed medicinal drugs such as beta blockers and antipsychotics. GPCR activation is facilitated by extracellular ligands and leads to the recruitment of intracellular G proteins. Structural rearrangements of residue contacts in the transmembrane domain serve as 'activation pathways' that connect the ligand-binding pocket to the G-protein-coupling region within the receptor. In order to investigate the similarities in activation pathways across class A GPCRs, we analysed 27 GPCRs from diverse subgroups for which structures of active, inactive or both states were available. Here we show that, despite the diversity in activation pathways between receptors, the pathways converge near the G-protein-coupling region. This convergence is mediated by a highly conserved structural rearrangement of residue contacts between transmembrane helices 3, 6 and 7 that releases G-protein-contacting residues. The convergence of activation pathways may explain how the activation steps initiated by diverse ligands enable GPCRs to bind a common repertoire of G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2510683315,"Methionine-1 (M1)-linked ubiquitin chains regulate the activity of NF-κB, immune homeostasis, and responses to infection. The importance of negative regulators of M1-linked chains in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the M1-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN is essential for preventing TNF-associated systemic inflammation in humans and mice. A homozygous hypomorphic mutation in human OTULIN causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory condition termed OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Four independent OTULIN mouse models reveal that OTULIN deficiency in immune cells results in cell-type-specific effects, ranging from over-production of inflammatory cytokines and autoimmunity due to accumulation of M1-linked polyubiquitin and spontaneous NF-κB activation in myeloid cells to downregulation of M1-polyubiquitin signaling by degradation of LUBAC in B and T cells. Remarkably, treatment with anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies ameliorates inflammation in ORAS patients and rescues mouse phenotypes. Hence, OTULIN is critical for restraining life-threatening spontaneous inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2515872577,"Neutrophils, eosinophils and 'classical' monocytes collectively account for about 70% of human blood leukocytes and are among the shortest-lived cells in the body. Precise regulation of the lifespan of these myeloid cells is critical to maintain protective immune responses and minimize the deleterious consequences of prolonged inflammation. However, how the lifespan of these cells is strictly controlled remains largely unknown. Here we identify a long non-coding RNA that we termed Morrbid, which tightly controls the survival of neutrophils, eosinophils and classical monocytes in response to pro-survival cytokines in mice. To control the lifespan of these cells, Morrbid regulates the transcription of the neighbouring pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2l11 (also known as Bim), by promoting the enrichment of the PRC2 complex at the Bcl2l11 promoter to maintain this gene in a poised state. Notably, Morrbid regulates this process in cis, enabling allele-specific control of Bcl2l11 transcription. Thus, in these highly inflammatory cells, changes in Morrbid levels provide a locus-specific regulatory mechanism that allows rapid control of apoptosis in response to extracellular pro-survival signals. As MORRBID is present in humans and dysregulated in individuals with hypereosinophilic syndrome, this long non-coding RNA may represent a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders characterized by aberrant short-lived myeloid cell lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2508292514,"Overexpression of exogenous fate-specifying transcription factors can directly reprogram differentiated somatic cells to target cell types. Here, we show that similar reprogramming can also be achieved through the direct activation of endogenous genes using engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators. We use this approach to induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes (BAM factors) to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. This direct activation of endogenous genes rapidly remodeled the epigenetic state of the target loci and induced sustained endogenous gene expression during reprogramming. Thus, transcriptional activation and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are sufficient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this approach may facilitate reprogramming with transient methods that avoid genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2509252213,"Telomerase maintains genome integrity by adding repetitive DNA sequences to the chromosome ends in actively dividing cells, including 90% of all cancer cells. Recruitment of human telomerase to telomeres occurs during S-phase of the cell cycle, but the molecular mechanism of the process is only partially understood. Here, we use CRISPR genome editing and single-molecule imaging to track telomerase trafficking in nuclei of living human cells. We demonstrate that telomerase uses three-dimensional diffusion to search for telomeres, probing each telomere thousands of times each S-phase but only rarely forming a stable association. Both the transient and stable association events depend on the direct interaction of the telomerase protein TERT with the telomeric protein TPP1. Our results reveal that telomerase recruitment to telomeres is driven by dynamic interactions between the rapidly diffusing telomerase and the chromosome end."

In this study, we describe an unbiased approach based on the differential single-cell gene expression analysis of mesenchymal osteolineage cells close to, and further removed from, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to identify candidate niche factors. Mesenchymal cells displayed distinct molecular profiles based on their relative location. We functionally examined, among the genes that were preferentially expressed in proximal cells, three secreted or cell-surface molecules not previously connected to HSPC biology-the secreted RNase angiogenin, the cytokine IL18, and the adhesion molecule Embigin-and discovered that all of these factors are HSPC quiescence regulators. Therefore, our proximity-based differential single-cell approach reveals molecular heterogeneity within niche cells and can be used to identify novel extrinsic stem/progenitor cell regulators. Similar approaches could also be applied to other stem cell/niche pairs to advance the understanding of microenvironmental regulation of stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2508267303,"The heterogeneous breast cancers can be classified into different subtypes according to their histopathological characteristics and molecular signatures. Foxa1 expression is linked with luminal breast cancer (LBC) with good prognosis, whereas Twist1 expression is associated with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) with poor prognosis owing to its role in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasiveness and metastasis. However, the regulatory and functional relationships between Twist1 and Foxa1 in breast cancer progression are unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that in the estrogen receptor (ERα)-positive LBC cells Twist1 silences Foxa1 expression, which has an essential role in relieving Foxa1-arrested migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, Twist1 binds to Foxa1 proximal promoter and recruits the NuRD transcriptional repressor complex to de-acetylate H3K9 and repress RNA polymerase II recruitment. Twist1 also silences Foxa1 promoter by inhibiting AP-1 recruitment. Twist1 expression in MCF7 cells silenced Foxa1 expression, which was concurrent with the induction of EMT, migration, invasion and metastasis of these cells. Importantly, restored Foxa1 expression in these cells largely inhibited Twist1-promoted migration, invasion and metastasis. Restored Foxa1 expression did not change the Twist1-induced mesenchymal cellular morphology and the expression of Twist1-regulated E-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin and Slug, but it partially rescued Twist1-silenced ERα and cytokeratin 8 expression and reduced Twist1-induced integrin α5, integrin β1 and MMP9 expression. In a xenografted mouse model, restored Foxa1 also increased Twist1-repressed LBC markers and decreased Twist1-induced BLBC markers. Furthermore, Twist1 expression is negatively correlated with Foxa1 in the human breast tumors. The tumors with high Twist1 and low Foxa1 expressions are associated with poor distant metastasis-free survival. These results demonstrate that Twist1's silencing effect on Foxa1 expression is largely responsible for Twist1-induced migration, invasion and metastasis, but less responsible for Twist1-induced mesenchymal morphogenesis and expression of certain EMT markers."
https://openalex.org/W2515313544,"Current hemagglutinin (HA)-based seasonal influenza vaccines induce vaccine strain-specific neutralizing antibodies that usually fail to provide protection against mismatched circulating viruses. Inclusion in the vaccine of highly conserved internal proteins such as the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1) was shown previously to increase vaccine efficacy by eliciting cross-reactive T-cells. However, appropriate delivery systems are required for efficient priming of T-cell responses. In this study, we demonstrated that administration of novel self-amplifying mRNA (SAM®) vectors expressing influenza NP (SAM(NP)), M1 (SAM(M1)), and NP and M1 (SAM(M1-NP)) delivered with lipid nanoparticles (LNP) induced robust polyfunctional CD4 T helper 1 cells, while NP-containing SAM also induced cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Robust expansions of central memory (TCM) and effector memory (TEM) CD4 and CD8 T cells were also measured. An enhanced recruitment of NP-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells was observed in the lungs of SAM(NP)-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology, and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge. Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of RNA (SAM(M1-NP)) and protein (monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIIV)) was feasible, induced simultaneously NP-, M1- and HA-specific T cells and HA-specific neutralizing antibodies, and enhanced MIIV efficacy against a heterologous challenge. In conclusion, systemic administration of SAM vectors expressing conserved internal influenza antigens induced protective immune responses in mice, supporting the SAM® platform as another promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum universal influenza vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2507528796,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have increased our knowledge of loci associated with a range of human diseases. However, applying such findings to elucidate pathophysiology and promote drug discovery remains challenging. Here, we created isogenic human ESCs (hESCs) with mutations in GWAS-identified susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes. In pancreatic beta-like cells differentiated from these lines, we found that mutations in CDKAL1, KCNQ1, and KCNJ11 led to impaired glucose secretion in vitro and in vivo, coinciding with defective glucose homeostasis. CDKAL1 mutant insulin+ cells were also hypersensitive to glucolipotoxicity. A high-content chemical screen identified a candidate drug that rescued CDKAL1-specific defects in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the FOS/JUN pathway. Our approach of a proof-of-principle platform, which uses isogenic hESCs for functional evaluation of GWAS-identified loci and identification of a drug candidate that rescues gene-specific defects, paves the way for precision therapy of metabolic diseases."

Methods We used data from 18 European and North American HIV cohort studies contributing to the Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration. We followed up patients from ten years after start of combination antiretroviral therapy. We estimated overall and cause-specific mortality rate ratios for age, sex, transmission through injection drug use, AIDS, CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA. Results During 50,593 person years 656/13,011 (5%) patients died. Older age, male sex, injecting drug use transmission, AIDS, and low CD4 count and detectable viral replication ten years after starting combination antiretroviral therapy were associated with higher subsequent mortality. CD4 count at ART start did not predict mortality in models adjusted for patient characteristics ten years after start of antiretroviral therapy. The most frequent causes of death (among 340 classified) were non-AIDS cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular, and liver-related disease. Older age was strongly associated with cardiovascular mortality, injecting drug use transmission with non-AIDS infection and liver-related mortality, and low CD4 and detectable viral replication ten years after starting antiretroviral therapy with AIDS mortality. Five-year mortality risk was <5% in 60% of all patients, and in 30% of those aged over 60 years. Conclusions Viral replication, lower CD4 count, prior AIDS, and transmission via injecting drug use continue to predict higher all-cause and AIDS-related mortality in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for over a decade. Deaths from AIDS and non-AIDS infection are less frequent than deaths from other non-AIDS causes."
https://openalex.org/W2508579481,"Postoperative recurrence and metastasis have crucial roles in the poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Previous studies have indicated that gastric cancer originates from cancer stem cells (CSCs), and some investigators have found that a particular subset of CSCs possesses higher metastatic capacity. However, the specific mechanism remains uncertain. In the present study, we aimed to explore the biological functions of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) in gastric cancer metastasis and the distinct IL-17-induced transformation of quiescent gastric CSCs. Our results showed that invasive gastric CSCs were CD26+ and CXCR4+ and were closely associated with increased metastatic ability. The quiescent gastric CSCs, which were CD26− and CXCR4−, were exposed to appropriate concentrations of IL-17; this resulted in the decreased expression of E-cadherin and the increased expression of vimentin and N-cadherin. In addition, the upregulation of IL-17 both in vitro and in vivo resulted in a significant induction of invasion, migration and tumor formation ability in gastric CSCs compared with the control group, which was not treated with IL-17. Further experiments indicated that the activation of the downstream phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor pathway was facilitated by IL-17. On the contrary, the downregulation of STAT3 by the specific inhibitor Stattic significantly reversed the IL-17-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated properties of quiescent gastric CSCs. Moreover, tumorigenesis and metastasis were suppressed. Taken together, we suggest that IL-17 is positively correlated with the transformation of quiescent gastric CSCs into invasive gastric CSCs and that targeting IL-17 may emerge as a possible novel therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2512791434,"The needs of the body can direct behavioral and neural processing toward motivationally relevant sensory cues. For example, human imaging studies have consistently found specific cortical areas with biased responses to food-associated visual cues in hungry subjects, but not in sated subjects. To obtain a cellular-level understanding of these hunger-dependent cortical response biases, we performed chronic two-photon calcium imaging in postrhinal association cortex (POR) and primary visual cortex (V1) of behaving mice. As in humans, neurons in mouse POR, but not V1, exhibited biases toward food-associated cues that were abolished by satiety. This emergent bias was mirrored by the innervation pattern of amygdalo-cortical feedback axons. Strikingly, these axons exhibited even stronger food cue biases and sensitivity to hunger state and trial history. These findings highlight a direct pathway by which the lateral amygdala may contribute to state-dependent cortical processing of motivationally relevant sensory cues."

https://openalex.org/W2509143425,"Abstract Cells contain hundreds of proteins that require iron cofactors for activity. Iron cofactors are synthesized in the cell, but the pathways involved in distributing heme, iron-sulfur clusters, and ferrous/ferric ions to apoproteins remain incompletely defined. In particular, cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxins and BolA-like proteins have been identified as [2Fe-2S]-coordinating complexes in vitro and iron-regulatory proteins in fungi, but it is not clear how these proteins function in mammalian systems or how this complex might affect Fe-S proteins or the cytosolic Fe-S assembly machinery. To explore these questions, we use quantitative immunoprecipitation and live cell proximity-dependent biotinylation to monitor interactions between Glrx3, BolA2, and components of the cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly system. We characterize cytosolic Glrx3·BolA2 as a [2Fe-2S] chaperone complex in human cells. Unlike complexes formed by fungal orthologs, human Glrx3-BolA2 interaction required the coordination of Fe-S clusters, whereas Glrx3 homodimer formation did not. Cellular Glrx3·BolA2 complexes increased 6–8-fold in response to increasing iron, forming a rapidly expandable pool of Fe-S clusters. Fe-S coordination by Glrx3·BolA2 did not depend on Ciapin1 or Ciao1, proteins that bind Glrx3 and are involved in cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly and distribution. Instead, Glrx3 and BolA2 bound and facilitated Fe-S incorporation into Ciapin1, a [2Fe-2S] protein functioning early in the cytosolic Fe-S assembly pathway. Thus, Glrx3·BolA is a [2Fe-2S] chaperone complex capable of transferring [2Fe-2S] clusters to apoproteins in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2524199583,"MicroRNA-7 (miR-7)has been characterized as an anti-oncogenic microRNA (miRNA) in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism for the regulation of miR-7 production in tumors remains unclear. Here, we identified nuclear factor 90 (NF90) and NF45 complex (NF90-NF45) as negative regulators of miR-7 processing in HCC. Expression of NF90 and NF45 was significantly elevated in primary HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. To examine which miRNAs are controlled by NF90-NF45, we performed an miRNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of HCC cell lines. Depletion of NF90 resulted in elevated levels of mature miR-7, whereas the expression of primary miR-7-1 (pri-miR-7-1) was decreased in cells following knockdown of NF90. Conversely, the levels of mature miR-7 were reduced in cells overexpressing NF90 and NF45, although pri-miR-7-1 was accumulated in the same cells. Furthermore, NF90-NF45 was found to bind pri-miR-7-1 in vitro. These results suggest that NF90-NF45 inhibits the pri-miR-7-1 processing step through the binding of NF90-NF45 to pri-miR-7-1. We also found that levels of the EGF receptor, an oncogenic factor that is a direct target of miR-7, and phosphorylation of AKT were significantly decreased in HCC cell lines depleted of NF90 or NF45. Of note, knockdown of NF90 or NF45 caused a reduction in the proliferation rate of HCC cells. Taken together, NF90-NF45 stimulates an elevation of EGF receptor levels via the suppression of miR-7 biogenesis, resulting in the promotion of cell proliferation in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2507823183,"Recurrent mutations in core splicing factors have been reported in several clonal disorders, including cancers. Mutations in SF3B1, a component of the U2 splicing complex, are the most common. SF3B1 mutations are associated with aberrant pre-mRNA splicing using cryptic 3' splice sites (3'SSs), but the mechanism of their selection is not clear. To understand how cryptic 3'SSs are selected, we performed comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes to splicing and gene expression associated with SF3B1 mutations in patient samples as well as an experimental model of inducible expression. Hundreds of cryptic 3'SS were detectable across the genome in cells expressing mutant SF3B1. These 3'SS are typically sequestered within RNA secondary structures and poorly accessible compared with their corresponding canonical 3'SS. We hypothesized that these cryptic 3'SS are inaccessible during normal splicing catalysis and that this constraint is overcome in spliceosomes containing mutant SF3B1. This model of secondary structure-dependent selection of cryptic 3'SS was found across multiple clonal processes associated with SF3B1 mutations (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia). We validated our model predictions in mini-gene splicing assays. Additionally, we found deregulated expression of proteins with relevant functions in splicing factor-related diseases both in association with aberrant splicing and without corresponding splicing changes. Our results show that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a distinct splicing program shared across multiple clonal processes and define a biochemical mechanism for altered 3'SS choice."
https://openalex.org/W2518463519,"Several mitochondrial tRNA mutations have been associated with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. However, the pathophysiology of these tRNA mutations remains poorly understood. In this report, we identified the novel homoplasmic 14692A→G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNAGlu gene among three Han Chinese families with maternally inherited diabetes and deafness. The m.14692A→G mutation affected a highly conserved uridine at position 55 of the TΨC loop of tRNAGlu. The uridine is modified to pseudouridine (Ψ55), which plays an important role in the structure and function of this tRNA. Using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a Chinese family, we demonstrated that the m.14692A→G mutation caused loss of Ψ55 modification and increased angiogenin-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage in mutant tRNAGlu. The destabilization of base-pairing (18A-Ψ55) caused by the m.14692A→G mutation perturbed the conformation and stability of tRNAGlu. An approximately 65% decrease in the steady-state level of tRNAGlu was observed in mutant cells compared with control cells. A failure in tRNAGlu metabolism impaired mitochondrial translation, especially for polypeptides with a high proportion of glutamic acid codons such as ND1, ND6, and CO2 in mutant cells. An impairment of mitochondrial translation caused defective respiratory capacity, especially reducing the activities of complexes I and IV. Furthermore, marked decreases in the levels of mitochondrial ATP and membrane potential were observed in mutant cells. These mitochondrial dysfunctions caused an increasing production of reactive oxygen species in the mutant cells. Our findings may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness, which is primarily manifested by the deficient nucleotide modification of mitochondrial tRNAGlu."
https://openalex.org/W2518331578,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely accepted as a class of gene expression regulators which post-translationally regulate protein expression. These small noncoding RNAs have been proved closely involved in the modulation of various pathobiological processes in cancer. In this research, we demonstrated that miR-148a expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues in comparison with the matched normal mucosal tissues, and its expression was statistically associated with lymph node metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-148a inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and inhibited tumor formation in vivo. Subsequently, we identified cholecystokinin B receptor (CCK-BR) as a direct target of miR-148a using western blot and luciferase activity assay. More importantly, siRNA-induced knockdown of CCK-BR elicited similar anti-oncogenic effects (decreased proliferation and migration) as those induced by enforced miR-148a expression. We also found that miR-148a-mediated anti-cancer effects are dependent on the inhibition of STAT3 and Akt activation, which subsequently regulates the pathways involved in cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-148a serves as a tumor suppressor in human gastric carcinogenesis by targeting CCK-BR via inactivating STAT3 and Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2513505388,"Our previous studies demonstrated that Jab1/Csn5 overexpression is correlated with low survival rates in cancer patients, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, and contributes to NPC’s resistance to radiotherapy and cisplatin by regulating DNA damage and repair pathways. However, the molecular mechanism by which Jab1/Csn5 expression is upregulated in NPCs has yet to be determined. In the present study, we identified the upstream regulator of Jab1/Csn5 expression and demonstrated its role in intrinsic resistance of NPC cells to treatment with cisplatin. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) expression correlates with and contributes to Jab1/Csn5 transcription. Consistently, silencing of Stat3 in tumors reduced Jab1/Csn5 expression, thereby sensitizing NPC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, Stat3 transcriptionally regulated Jab1/Csn5. Furthermore, high mRNA expression levels of Stat3 or Jab1 in colon cancer, breast cancer and glioblastoma are associated with significantly shorter survival times from the R2 online database. These findings identify a novel Stat3-Jab1/Csn5 signaling axis in cancer pathogenesis with therapeutic and prognostic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2517673187,"Background The growing number of identified genetic disease risk variants across dog breeds challenges the current state-of-the-art of population screening, veterinary molecular diagnostics, and genetic counseling. Multiplex screening of such variants is now technologically feasible, but its practical potential as a supportive tool for canine breeding, disease diagnostics, pet care, and genetics research is still unexplored. Results To demonstrate the utility of comprehensive genetic panel screening, we tested nearly 7000 dogs representing around 230 breeds for 93 disease-associated variants using a custom-designed genotyping microarray (the MyDogDNA® panel test). In addition to known breed disease-associated mutations, we discovered 15 risk variants in a total of 34 breeds in which their presence was previously undocumented. We followed up on seven of these genetic findings to demonstrate their clinical relevance. We report additional breeds harboring variants causing factor VII deficiency, hyperuricosuria, lens luxation, von Willebrand’s disease, multifocal retinopathy, multidrug resistance, and rod-cone dysplasia. Moreover, we provide plausible molecular explanations for chondrodysplasia in the Chinook, cerebellar ataxia in the Norrbottenspitz, and familiar nephropathy in the Welsh Springer Spaniel. Conclusions These practical examples illustrate how genetic panel screening represents a comprehensive, efficient and powerful diagnostic and research discovery tool with a range of applications in veterinary care, disease research, and breeding. We conclude that several known disease alleles are more widespread across different breeds than previously recognized. However, careful follow up studies of any unexpected discoveries are essential to establish genotype-phenotype correlations, as is readiness to provide genetic counseling on their implications for the dog and its breed."

Survivors remain at risk of metabolic decompensations and severe long term complications, notably renal failure and neurological impairment. We generated clinically relevant mouse models of MMAuria using a constitutive Mut knock-in (KI) allele based on the p.Met700Lys patient mutation, used homozygously (KI/KI) or combined with a knockout allele (KO/KI), to study biochemical and clinical MMAuria disease aspects. Transgenic Mutki/ki and Mutko/ki mice survive post-weaning, show failure to thrive, and show increased methylmalonic acid, propionylcarnitine, odd chain fatty acids, and sphingoid bases, a new potential biomarker of MMAuria. Consistent with genetic dosage, Mutko/ki mice have lower Mut activity, are smaller, and show higher metabolite levels than Mutki/ki mice. Further, Mutko/ki mice exhibit manifestations of kidney and brain damage, including increased plasma urea, impaired diuresis, elevated biomarkers, and changes in brain weight. On a high protein diet, mutant mice display disease exacerbation, including elevated blood ammonia, and catastrophic weight loss, which, in Mutki/ki mice, is rescued by hydroxocobalamin treatment. This study expands knowledge of MMAuria, introduces the discovery of new biomarkers, and constitutes the first in vivo proof of principle of cobalamin treatment in mut-type MMAuria.

Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) 2The abbreviations used are: MUT, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MMA, methylmalonic acid; MMAuria, methylmalonic aciduria; KI, knock-in; Cbl, cobalamin; AdoCbl, 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin; 2-MC, 2-methylcitrate; C3, propionylcarnitine; OHCbl, hydroxocobalamin; C2, acetylcarnitine; Lcn2, lipocalin-2; HP, high protein; PE, precursor-enriched; RC, reference chow; KO, knockout. is a homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of l-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA by using vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) in the cofactor form (5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, AdoCbl). In this anaplerotic reaction, several metabolic pathways, including the breakdown of branched chain amino acids, odd chain fatty acids, and the side chain of cholesterol, converge on the propionate pathway. The vital importance of this enzyme is demonstrated by the severe inborn error of metabolism methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria), which is caused by mutations in the MUT gene (mut-type MMAuria, OMIM no. 251000) or by defects of AdoCbl synthesis. Dysfunction of MUT leads to an accumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA), 2-methylcitrate (2-MC), propionylcarnitine (C3), and other metabolites in body fluids and tissues (1Kölker S. Schwab M.

Although the clinical symptoms observed in mut-type MMAuria patients are variable, they often present in the newborn period with ketoacidosis, lethargy, and failure to thrive, leading to coma or even death if untreated. In surviving patients, the chronic course involves organ-specific complications, the most common being neurological impairment and chronic kidney disease, manifesting as tubulointerstitial nephritis and renal tubular acidosis. End stage renal disease, occurring as early as the second decade of life in patients with severe MMAuria, is frequently seen (3Hörster F. Baumgartner M.R. Viardot C. Suormala T. Burgard P. Fowler B.

Rare Dis. 2014; 9: 130Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In addition to symptomatic care, there are a few rational treatment approaches, including reduction of protein intake, carnitine and Cbl supplementation to decrease the flux through the propionate pathway, and the formation of toxic metabolites (6Baumgartner M.R.

Although this treatment appears to partly improve metabolic control in some cases, most patients still suffer severe long term complications. The first effort to generate a mouse model of mut-type MMAuria was made in 2003, when a Mut knockout (KO) model on C57BL/6 background resulted in neonatal lethality of all homozygous (KO/KO) pups (7Peters H. Nefedov M. Sarsero J. Pitt J. Fowler K.J. Gazeas S. Kahler S.G. Ioannou P.A. A knock-out mouse model for methylmalonic aciduria resulting in neonatal lethality.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52909-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Later, Peters et al. (8Peters H.L. Pitt J.J. Wood L.R. Hamilton N.J. Sarsero J.P. Buck N.E. Mouse models for methylmalonic aciduria.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e40609Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) expressed varying copy numbers of the intact human MUT locus on the KO background and demonstrated a copy number-dependent rescue of the KO lethality. They also developed another transgenic model containing an introduced stop codon on the human MUT locus crossed to the KO background, resulting in a severe MMAuria phenotype (9Buck N.E. Dashnow H.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 13552-13557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to provide a long term rescue of lethality. However, whereas these models have proven to be useful to study some aspects and rescue of disease, no model to date has been able to provide an accurate depiction of the patient situation. Neonatal or early lethality hamper long term follow-up studies and the understanding of chronic disease manifestation, whereas transgenic rescue of Mut does not resemble the pathologic situation, where a patient carries the same genetic defect in all cells. To devise a model of MMAuria reflective of the patient situation using a known human mutation and amenable to the study of the long term disease course, we opted to knock-in (KI) a hypomorphic allele based on a patient missense mutation. From our previous in-depth MUT missense mutation characterization (14Forny P. Froese D.S. Suormala T. Yue W.W. Baumgartner M.R. Functional characterization and categorization of missense mutations that cause methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) deficiency.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we identified p.Met700Lys (c.2099T>A human cDNA; p.Met698Lys in mouse) as an ideal candidate for this allele because of the residual enzymatic activity and in vitro response to hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) found in MUT protein carrying this mutation. p.Met700Lys has been detected heterozygously in four MMAuria patients in conjunction with severe mutations (15Acquaviva C. Benoist J.F. Pereira S. Callebaut I. Koskas T. Porquet D. Elion J.

Molecular genetic characterization of 151 mut-type methylmalonic aciduria patients and identification of 41 novel mutations in MUT.Hum. Mutat. 2016; 37: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but at least three of these patients have had an intermediate disease course with a relatively later age of onset (between 14 days and 6 months) (16Forny P. Schnellmann A.-S. Buerer C. Lutz S. Fowler B. Froese D.S. Baumgartner M.R. Molecular genetic characterization of 151 mut-type methylmalonic aciduria patients and identification of 41 novel mutations in MUT.Hum. Mutat. 2016; 37: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), supporting the potential of this mutation to cause moderate MMAuria. To assess the effect of genetic dosage on the phenotype and to generate a more severe disease model, the new KI mutation was combined with a KO allele (7Peters H. Nefedov M. Sarsero J. Pitt J. Fowler K.J. Gazeas S. Kahler S.G. Ioannou P.A. A knock-out mouse model for methylmalonic aciduria resulting in neonatal lethality.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52909-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we present a thorough characterization of these newly generated Mutki/ki and Mutko/ki mouse models, which survive long term and at the same time recapitulate the key biochemical and clinical features of MMAuria. To characterize the selected KI mutation, we tested the biochemical properties of the human mutation p.Met700Lys (hs-p.Met700Lys) and the equivalent mutation in mouse (mm-p.Met698Lys). Separate constructs incorporating each allele were overexpressed in human fibroblasts carrying a homozygous null allele of MUT to determine enzyme activity and kinetics. In both, the residual activity was reduced to a few percent of wt (Table 1) with an almost 100-fold increased Km for AdoCbl (Table 1). These nearly identical biochemical results for the human and mouse equivalent mutations led us to conclude that the mm-p.Met698Lys mutation would be expected to produce an intermediate phenotype of MMAuria, similar to its hs-p.Met700Lys counterpart.TABLE 1Human and mouse mutant proteins show similar enzyme parameters when expressed in a mut0 patient cell lineHumanMousewtp.M700Kwtp.M698KActivity100.0 ± 22.43.46 ± 0.38100.0 ± 32.16.04 ± 0.24Km2.59 ± 0.87575.6 ± 46.08.70 ± 0.02463.6 ± 37.3 Open table in a new tab To generate the knock-in p.Met698Lys mutation, a targeting vector was designed to replace thymine with adenine at position c.2093 of Mut (based on NM_008650.3). The construct (Fig. 1A) was used for embryonic stem cell (C57BL/6-derived) targeting, and a positive clone was confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 1B), which was used for blastocyst injection. Screening for positive germ line transmission was done by PCR genotyping (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Additionally, Mutko/ki mice were generated as a second disease model by crossing the previously established Mutko/wt mice (7Peters H. Nefedov M. Sarsero J. Pitt J. Fowler K.J. Gazeas S. Kahler S.G. Ioannou P.A. A knock-out mouse model for methylmalonic aciduria resulting in neonatal lethality.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52909-52913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with our Mutki/ki mice and followed by PCR genotyping of the KO allele (Fig. 1C, lower panel). To determine the direct consequences of the missense change on Mut transcript, stability, and function, we investigated Mut expression and activity in various tissues. In wt mice, we found Mut expression to be lower in brain than in liver or kidney (Fig. 1D), similar to previously published results (17Ballhausen D. Mittaz L. Boulat O. Bonafé L. Braissant O. Evidence for catabolic pathway of propionate metabolism in CNS: expression pattern of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase α-subunit in developing and adult rat brain.Neuroscience. 2009; 164: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The KI allele did not result in an appreciable decrease of Mut transcript levels in all tissues tested; however, mice with one KO allele had ∼50% of Mut transcript levels compared with wt (Fig. 1E), likely indicative of nonsense-mediated decay. At the protein level, the amount of the homozygous Mutki/ki protein was significantly reduced compared with controls, suggesting an unstable mutant protein, whereas the KO/KI Mut protein showed similar reduction (Fig. 1F). Mut activity from wt mice significantly varied among tissue types, with the highest activities in kidney, liver, and heart (Fig. 1G). Activities from KI/KI and KO/KI mice were greatly decreased in all of the tissues tested (Fig. 1H), comparable with the in vitro measurements (Table 1). Furthermore, a gene dosage-dependent decrease of enzyme activity was identified, with Mutko/ki activity slightly lower than Mutki/ki in most tissues (Fig. 1H). As expected, ∼50% of residual activity was maintained in the Mutki/wt and Mutko/wt animals, reflecting the activity of the remaining wt allele (Fig. 1H). Mice homozygous for the targeted point mutation (Mutki/ki) were viable and, when crossed with heterozygous Mutki/wt mice, reproduced at the expected Mendelian ratio of ∼50% per genotype (51% Mutki/wt, 49% Mutki/ki, litters = 33). Breeding of Mutko/ki also resulted in viable animals and displayed the expected Mendelian distribution of the genotypes (51% Mutko/ki, 49% Mutki/wt, litters = 36). Mice of both genotypes survived over 1 year, allowing us to monitor long term development. At early stages of life, Mutki/ki and Mutko/ki mice were largely indistinguishable from their heterozygous littermates (Mutki/wt) and wt control mice. However, after the age of ∼100 days in females and ∼150 days in males (Fig. 2A), mice of both genotypes showed signs of significant growth retardation. The difference in body weight between littermate control (Mutki/wt) and Mutko/ki female mice was 30% after ∼1 year (Fig. 2A), whereas food intake remained constant (e.g. relative food intake at the age of 218 days in Mutki/wt was 0.079 grams of chow normalized to body weight in grams, S.D. ± 0.043 and in Mutko/ki 0.078 ± 0.048). In this cohort, C3 (normalized to acetylcarnitine (C2)) in blood and MMA in urine were constantly elevated over the entire time span investigated (Fig. 2, B and C). Survival was the same in all three groups (all mice still alive after 1 year except for one Mutki/ki and one Mutko/ki, both of which died during blood collection). To gain further insight into the consequences of the clearly reduced Mut enzymatic activity, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of hallmark metabolites of MMAuria (18Kölker S. Okun J.G. Methylmalonic acid: an endogenous toxin?.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at 35 days of age. MMA was found elevated in a genetic dosage-dependent manner in tissues, urine and dried blood, with the highest levels found in Mutko/ki mice (Fig. 2D). Although Mutki/ki animals showed considerably lower levels, they were still significantly elevated compared with controls (Fig. 2D). C3 levels (normalized to C2) showed the same trend (Fig. 2E). Mutki/wt and Mutko/wt did not show any elevations, suggesting that one functional wt allele is sufficient to cope with the demands of the propionate pathway (Fig. 2, D and E). Ammonia levels, which are elevated during metabolic crisis in patients, were normal (Fig. 2F), suggesting that these animals did not suffer from acute crises on normal chow. Similar to patients (19Perry T.L. Urquhart N. Hansen S. Studies of the glycine cleavage enzyme system in brain from infants with glycine encephalopathy.Pediat.

Dis. 2015; 38: 1041-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), both Mutko/ki and Mutki/ki showed elevated glycine levels (Fig. 2G), whereas other amino acid levels were mostly unchanged. In addition to classic metabolites, we performed a comprehensive analysis of fatty acids and sphingoid bases. We found increased levels of odd chain fatty acids, including the 17-carbon chain length fatty acid, which has recently been proposed as a biomarker of MMAuria (22Malvagia S. Haynes C.A. Grisotto L.

Further, we show here for the first time an elevation of odd chain length sphingoid bases in plasma (Fig. 2I) and tissues (Fig. 2J), possibly as a consequence of the increased odd chain fatty acids, whereas levels of even chain sphingoid bases remained normal (Fig. 2I). Specific fatty acid and sphingoid base levels are freely available upon request. We investigated whether Mutko/ki mice suffer from similar long term complications as patients with MMAuria,e.g. renal dysfunction. When normalized to body weight, Mutko/ki mice consistently produced less urine during adulthood than littermate controls (Mutki/wt) (Fig. 3A), although water intake was not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. 3B). Consistent with renal dysfunction, these mice also had increased plasma urea throughout the time course measured (Fig. 3C), which has been observed in the context of a decreased glomerular filtration rate (24Schwartz G.J. Muñoz A. Schneider M.F. Mak R.H. Kaskel F. Warady B.A. Furth S.L. New equations to estimate GFR in children with CKD.J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar). Renal tubular dysfunction in these animals was evidenced by disturbed excretion of several electrolytes in urine (Fig. 3D). Kidney damage was further supported by increased levels of the biomarker lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) in kidney tissue (Fig. 3E). Of note, light microscopy examination of hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of kidneys from Mutki/wt and Mutko/ki mice (female, 1 year old) did not reveal any structural abnormalities (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4.Histological analysis by hematoxylin-eosin staining of kidney (A) and brain (B) sections from Mutki/wt and Mutko/ki female mice at the age of 1 year.

Current concepts in organic acidurias: understanding intra- and extracerebral disease manifestation.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2013; 36: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), often manifesting as movement disorder because of lesions in the basal ganglia, and in acute metabolic crisis brain edema may be observed. In the Mutko/ki mice we observed an increase in brain weight at the age of 1 month as well as 1 year (Fig. 3F), which may be suggestive of brain edema. Although brain histology was normal in the basal ganglia (Fig. 4B), we also identified an up-regulation in Lcn2 at the mRNA and protein level (Fig. 3G). Together, the initial characterization of both the brain and kidney, in combination with the metabolites already identified in these organs, suggest an initial dysfunction in each, which has not yet manifested at the gross level. An increased throughput of the propionate pathway in patients with MMAuria,e.g. caused by a catabolic state or an augmented protein intake, often results in metabolic decompensation (crisis). To replicate this state in our MMAuria mouse models and exacerbate their clinical phenotype, we used dietary challenge. Mice were fed a high protein (HP) diet, as used previously (13Manoli I. Sysol J.R. Li L. Houillier P. Garone C. Wang C. Zerfas P.M. Cusmano-Ozog K. Young S. Trivedi N.S. Cheng J. Sloan J.L. Chandler R.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. et al.Targeting proximal tubule mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates the renal disease of methylmalonic acidemia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 13552-13557Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), or a precursor-enriched (PE) diet comprised of increased levels of precursor amino acids of propionate pathway metabolites, i.e. isoleucine, valine, and threonine. Upon initiation of both diets at the age of 2 months, both Mutko/ki and Mutki/ki mice experienced rapid weight loss, which was so severe that the study had to be terminated after 3 days (Fig. 5A). The effect exerted by the PE diet appeared to be stronger than the HP diet, as shown by the more pronounced weight loss (Fig. 5A), likely reflecting the 2-fold higher isoleucine, valine, and threonine content in the PE diet (70, 84, and 53 g/kg compared with 35, 42, and 27 g/kg, respectively). Brain weight (normalized to body weight) was increased in Mutko/ki mice under both diets, which was not the case on reference chow (RC: isoleucine, 10 g/kg; valine, 12 g/kg; threonine, 7.6 g/kg) at this age (Fig. 5B). Investigation of the plasma before and after the diet change revealed, from both diets, further elevated levels of MMA, C3, and for the first time in these mice, increased ammonia levels in Mutki/ki and Mutko/ki mice (Fig. 5, C–E), consistent with the induction of metabolic crisis. Further investigation of MMA and 2-MC concentrations in the brain, kidney, and liver demonstrated a gene dosage-dependent increase of both metabolites in mice on either diet, compared with mice on the control diet (RC) (Fig. 5, F–H). Indeed, although these metabolites were already elevated in Mutko/ki and Mutki/ki mice on RC (e.g. brain levels of MMA in Mutko/ki were 4.4 times higher than in Mutki/wt; Fig. 5F), they were further increased up to 53-fold when the diet was changed to HP or PE (Fig. 5F). To attempt to mitigate the effects exerted by the HP diet, we treated the mice with daily i.p. injections of OHCbl (0.3 μg/g) for a week before and continuously during the dietary challenge. These injections resulted in nearly doubled levels of plasma Cbl (Fig. 6A), indicating efficient uptake of the vitamin into the blood stream. Mutki/ki mice appeared to be partially protected by this treatment, as, in contrast to mice on the HP diet alone (Fig. 5A), OHCbl-treated Mutki/ki mice did not show significant weight loss (Fig. 6B). Further, elevations in C3 and ammonia were markedly delayed, although they increased considerably, along with MMA, by the study's end (Fig. 6, C–E). Mutko/ki mice showed a less obvious but slight protective effect. Their weight loss was delayed compared with their untreated counterparts (compare Fig. 5A, HP, and Fig. 6B), and they did not have the significantly increased brain weight (Fig. 6F) seen previously (Fig. 5B). However, they did show immediate and striking increases in metabolite levels (Fig. 6, C–E) suggesting they remained metabolically compromised. In this study, we aimed to generate novel mouse models of MMAuria that survive through adulthood but show clear biochemical and clinical signs of disease. To achieve these models, we knocked in a missense mutation to the mouse Mut gene. This constitutive KI allele causes Mut deficiency, which is further aggravated by combination with a KO allele. The most striking phenotypic sign in our mice was growth retardation, which is likely a correlate of failure to thrive described in human patients (3Hörster F. Baumgartner M.R. Viardot C. Suormala T.

In some cases the activity of the interacting protein is stimulated by SSB. All of the proteins that interact with SSB to date have a role in some aspect of DNA metabolism. Therefore, an interaction with the C terminus of SSB provides an increasingly reliable indicator of DNA metabolic function. The radD gene (formerly yejH) was recently implicated in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks after radiation or chemical damage (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M.

Escherichia coli genes and pathways involved in surviving extreme exposure to ionizing radiation.J. Bacteriol. 2014; 196: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of the RadD protein includes all seven of the motifs associated with a superfamily 2 (SF2) helicase (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although there is little homology outside of these regions, the helicase motifs align well to other E. coli SF2 helicases including RecG and RecQ. RadD also contains a putative zinc finger motif in the C terminus that could aid in binding to DNA substrates. Both the ATPase and zinc binding domains are necessary for the rescue of DNA repair activities of radD deletion strains in vivo (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here, we present the first biochemical characterization of the RadD protein. Although helicase activity was not observed, RadD hydrolyzes ATP in the absence of DNA. This activity is stimulated by the SSB protein, specifically the C-terminal amino acid residues of SSB. The RadD and SSB proteins interact in vivo and directly in vitro. The previous study and this work, taken together, suggest that SSB likely recruits and activates RadD in the cell during DNA repair. Based on the sequence similarity of RadD to known DNA metabolism proteins and a recent study implicating RadD in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we natively purified the RadD protein and screened for likely activities and interactions. A number of assays for helicase activity, including a variety of both DNA and RNA substrates, produced no positive results and thus are not reported. Presented here are results that demonstrate DNA-independent ATPase activity for RadD as well as an interaction with the SSB C terminus. As a predicted SF2 helicase (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), RadD contains the classic Walker A and Walker B motifs (SF2 motifs I and II) that bind and hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. Distantly related sequences in the α- and β-subunits of ATP synthase, myosin, kinases and other ATP-requiring enzymes and a common nucleotide binding fold.EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). The relative location of the SF2 motifs is outlined in Fig. 1A. To test for ATP hydrolysis activity, RadD was incubated with ATP in a coupled spectrophotometric assay for ATP hydrolysis. As expected, RadD was able to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 1). Further testing of buffer conditions revealed that RadD hydrolyzes ATP most efficiently in the presence of the chloride anion (Fig. 1B), peaking at a concentration of 0.5 m KCl (Fig. 1C) and at a pH above 7.5 (Fig. 1D). Surprisingly, RadD displayed a very high basal rate of hydrolysis, with an apparent kcat of up to 600 min−1 (in 0.5 m KCl, Fig. 1C), even in the absence of any DNA substrate. Conditions below 0.2 m salt were not tested, as the RadD protein spontaneously precipitates. For further study, potassium glutamate and pH 7.5 were chosen as the most physiologically relevant conditions. RadD hydrolysis activity increased linearly with increasing enzyme (Fig. 1E) and is, therefore, likely to act as a monomer. RadD failed to show any self-interaction in a yeast two-hybrid assay, further supporting this idea. Titration of the ATP substrate under physiologically relevant conditions resulted in a Km of 0.85 ± 0.11 μm and Vmax of 35.69 ± 1.48 μm min−1 (Fig. 1F, Table 1). A RadD variant containing a mutated Walker A motif (K37R) failed to show significant ATPase activity, as expected (Fig. 1G).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of RadD ATP hydrolysisProteinsKmVmaxμmμm min−1RadD0.85 ± 0.1135.69 ± 1.48RadD + SSB0.63 ± 0.0964.56 ± 3.10RadD + SSB-C100.40 ± 0.04380.21 ± 2.25 Open table in a new tab To find potential interaction partners of RadD, a tandem affinity purification assay was implemented (2Page A.N.

The resulting complexes were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Aside from RadD itself, the most prominent protein was SSB, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, with 13 unique peptides and 61% sequence coverage (Table 2). Several other proteins pulled down in the complex were metabolic DNA binding proteins, including RNA polymerase (subunits β and β'), two topoisomerases, and the nucleoid-associating factors dps, H-NS, and SeqA (Table 2). As an SSB tetramer can interact with more than one protein at a time, some of the proteins detected may be co-associated with SSB. In particular, Top3 and RecQ are known to interact with SSB (1Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. SSB as an organizer/mobilizer of genome maintenance complexes.Crit. Rev. Biochem.

The DNA binding and activation domain fusions of each protein were then transformed pairwise into the reporter yeast strain. When grown on selective media, colonies appeared when the RadD and SSB vectors were both present in the yeast (Fig. 2A) but not when empty vectors were used. A much stronger signal was observed when ssb was fused to the activation domain and radD to the binding domain, although signal is also observable in the opposite orientation. The yeast two-hybrid results indicate that RadD and SSB proteins interact in the context of a cell. To test for a direct interaction in vitro, the two proteins were overexpressed and natively purified to homogeneity. It was previously demonstrated that SSB precipitates at low concentrations of ammonium sulfate, and specific protein interactors will co-precipitate into the pellet (15Marceau A.H. Ammonium sulfate co-precipitation of SSB and interacting proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 922: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar). RadD is clearly enriched in the pellet when SSB is present (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, SSB protein lacking the C-terminal eight amino acids (SSBΔC8), which are critical for interaction of all previously described interacting proteins (1Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. SSB as an organizer/mobilizer of genome maintenance complexes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), failed to enrich RadD in the ammonium sulfate pellet (Fig. 2B). The demonstrable interaction of SSB with RadD led directly to tests for a functional interaction. Increasing concentrations of SSB were added to the RadD ATPase reaction, and a clear concentration-dependent stimulation effect was observed (Fig. 3A). The storage buffer used for SSB contains glycerol and sodium chloride, both of which can independently cause a slight increase in RadD ATPase rate. Therefore, all reactions involving SSB were adjusted to contain the same amount of glycerol and salt, leading to a slightly higher than expected hydrolysis rate even in the 0 μm SSB sample. An SSB variant lacking the C-terminal eight amino acids (SSBΔC8) shows the same level of stimulation as SSB storage buffer alone (Fig. 3B). In all cases where the SSB interaction has been characterized, the SSB-interacting proteins bind SSB through its C-terminal eight amino acid residues (1Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. SSB as an organizer/mobilizer of genome maintenance complexes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To further determine if this region was sufficient for the ATPase stimulation observed in Fig. 3, a peptide containing the last 10 amino acids of SSB (WMDFDDDIPF) was added to the RadD ATPase reactions. Indeed, this SSB tail peptide alone was sufficient to stimulate RadD ATP hydrolytic reaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C), reaching saturation at a lower concentration than full-length SSB (30 μm versus 50 μm). Peptides with the same amino acid composition but in random order (WDFMDDPFID) or with the penultimate phenylalanine (critical for most protein-SSB interactions (1Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. SSB as an organizer/mobilizer of genome maintenance complexes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar)) missing (WMDFDDDIP) were unable to stimulate RadD ATPase activity even at the highest concentration used (30 μm, Fig. 3D). The addition of full-length SSB (10 μm) led to a clear decrease in Km (26%) and increase in Vmax (1.8-fold) of ATP hydrolysis by RadD (Fig. 3E, Table 1). The addition of SSB C-terminal peptide shifted Km and Vmax more dramatically than full-length protein, roughly halving Km and doubling Vmax (Fig. 3E, Table 1). The concentration of SSB or SSB tail peptide needed to induce stimulation of RadD activity was far in excess of the concentration of RadD (30–50 μm versus 200 nm), suggesting a fairly weak interaction. To determine the dissociation constant (KD) between the two proteins, fluorescence polarization was used with a labeled SSB tail peptide and increasing concentrations of RadD. However, the apparent dissociation constant exceeded the concentration of our preparation of RadD, and we could only determine that it is >10 μm (Fig. 3F), which is consistent with our ATPase results. Other proteins shown to interact with SSB are also typically in the low micromolar range (χψ subunits of polymerase III, KD = 2.7 μm; RecQ, KD = 6.4 μm; PriA, KD = 2.4 μm; Exo I, Ka = 7.1 μm; uracil DNA glycosylase, Ka = 5.9 μm; Refs. 16Glover B.P.

As RadD is a predicted helicase that interacts with SSB, its ability to interact with DNA was evaluated. When incubated with a single-stranded oligonucleotide (poly-dT100), RadD forms a stable higher order complex in the presence or absence of nucleotide cofactor (Fig. 4A). More of the larger complex that does not enter the gel (super shifted) was formed in the absence of nucleotide. A shifted complex (within the gel but above substrate level) formed more readily in the presence of ATP versus ATPγS or ADP, but the differences are slight. No strong interaction was seen with other DNA or RNA substrates. In contrast to wild type RadD protein, the RadD K37R mutant, which is not able to bind ATP, did not show the formation of the smaller, in-gel complex with the addition of ATP, as expected (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the addition of SSB C-terminal peptide at relative levels similar to those seen to stimulate RadD ATPase activity (10–30 μm SSB-Ct versus 200 nm RadD in ATPase; 30–150 μm SSB-Ct versus 2 μm RadD in this EMSA) clearly abrogated the single-stranded DNA binding (Fig. 4C), suggesting that RadD has two distinct modes of action: DNA binding versus ATPase activity. This is consistent with SSB-Ct stimulating RadD ATPase activity in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3). To confirm that RadD interacts with single-stranded DNA in solution and is not simply the product of aggregation in the gel wells, a fluorescence polarization assay was used. In this assay, bound molecules tumble more slowly in solution. As with the SSB-Ct interaction (Fig. 3F), RadD displays an interaction with poly-dT100 when RadD >1 μm but does not reach saturation (Fig. 4D). Despite this stable interaction, circular single-stranded DNA (M13mp18) does not stimulate the ATP hydrolysis rate of RadD (Fig. 4E). In the presence of both SSB and RadD, single-stranded DNA appears to confer a slight stimulation (Fig. 4E), with the maximal rate seen at approximately two 65-nt DNA binding sites per SSB tetramer (∼300 μm nucleotides). For this assay, RadD levels were lowered to 100 nm to increase the relative ratio of SSB and DNA to RadD; thus the overall rates appear lower. Many proteins involved in DNA replication, repair, replication restart, recombination, and other DNA metabolic functions interact with the C terminus of SSB (1Shereda R.D. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M.

The present work adds RadD to the list of proteins coordinated by SSB. Because there are currently no proteins known to interact with SSB that do not use DNA as a substrate in some fashion, RadD presumably also plays a role in DNA metabolism. Previous genetic studies (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Baharoglu Z. Babosan A. Mazel D.

This work presents the first biochemical characterization of the RadD protein. We show for the first time that RadD is an active ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme, with a DNA-independent hydrolysis rate (kcat) of up to 600 min−1. The rate of hydrolysis increases with the addition of SSB, or SSB tail peptide, in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, this is the first reported instance of protein activity being stimulated by the tail peptide alone. This suggests that binding of the SSB C terminus to RadD causes a conformational shift that increases the turnover rate of RadD. Both the Km and Vmax of RadD ATP hydrolysis are strongly affected by this interaction (Km is halved, and Vmax is doubled), supporting this idea. This stimulation is somewhat lower when full-length SSB is used, indicating that tail access is somewhat limited by the additional domains of the protein. The conformational shift of RadD induced by interaction with SSB also appears to abrogate its DNA binding activity, suggesting that DNA binding and ATPase activity are two separate modes of RadD action. RadD may bind to exposed single-stranded DNA and await a neighboring bound SSB to stimulate its activity, and/or protein clearing activity by RadD may reveal a section of single-stranded DNA, which RadD would bind and then cease its motor activity (Fig. 5C). A small decrease in RadD ATP hydrolysis is seen with an increasing concentration of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 4E), consistent with this idea. The addition of single-stranded DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of RadD only when SSB was present, in which case it is likely that SSB binds the DNA. It would appear that the SSB-DNA complex provides further stimulation than SSB alone, but this difference was quite small and may not be physiologically relevant. Given the results of our biochemical assays, the in vivo role of RadD is likely in stabilizing DNA intermediates and/or clearing protein blocks ahead of replication or repair processes rather than direct DNA remodeling. Previous genetic data demonstrated a role for RadD in responding to DNA damaging agents (10Chen S.H. Byrne R.T. Wood E.A. Cox M.M. Escherichia coli radD (yejH) gene: a novel function involved in radiation resistance and double-strand break repair.Mol. Microbiol. 2015; 95: 754-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of RadD was necessary for this effect, with an ATPase-dead RadD displaying a dominant negative effect in response to UV. This role also showed overlap with the functions of RadA, a RecA paralogue involved in homologous recombination (22Beam C.E. Saveson C.J. Lovett S.T. Role for radA/sms in recombination intermediate processing in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6836-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Cooper D.L. Lovett S.T. Recombinational branch migration by the RadA/Sms paralog of RecA in Escherichia coli.Elife. 2016; 5: e10807Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and RecG, a superfamily 2 helicase involved in stabilizing recombination intermediates and preventing origin-independent replication (24Mawer J.S. Leach D.R. Branch migration prevents DNA loss during double-strand break repair.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Rudolph C.J. Upton A.L. Stockum A. Nieduszynski C.A. Lloyd R.G. Avoiding chromosome pathology when replication forks collide.Nature. 2013; 500: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The stable DNA binding of RadD suggests that RadD may also be involved in stabilizing DNA intermediates formed by lesions along DNA. As the ATP hydrolysis activity of RadD is DNA-independent and has not been linked to any DNA remodeling, it is also possible that RadD is involved in protein clearing during DNA replication or repair. Indeed, there is evidence in Vibrio cholerae that RadD (YejH) clears RNA polymerase from UV-induced DNA lesions (21Baharoglu Z. Babosan A. Mazel D. Identification of genes involved in low aminoglycoside-induced SOS response in Vibrio cholerae: a role for transcription stalling and Mfd helicase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 2366-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and an interaction with both RpoB and RpoC was seen in our TAP tag assay (Table 2). SSB would assist in this process by binding to the single-stranded DNA exposed by stalled replication forks, after encountering either a DNA lesion or a stalled RNA polymerase, and recruiting and activating RadD to help prevent DNA loss and clear the blockage (Fig. 5). Although Mfd normally performs this function, it may be overwhelmed in the presence of extensive damage. Further experiments will be necessary to clarify the role of RadD in DNA metabolism. The open reading frame of E. coli radD was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into cloning vector pCN70 to produce an expression vector encoding RadD with an N-terminal dual affinity “TAP” tag (includes protein A and calmodulin peptide binding domains separated by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site). E. coli K12 strain MG1655 (DE3) transformed with pTAP-RadD was grown at 37 °C in 4 liters of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to midlog phase (A600 of ∼0.5), induced by the addition of 1 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (6 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 4 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 4 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 19.5 mg/liter benzamidine, 8.7 mg/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute), and lysed by sonication. Tandem affinity purification was performed as described previously (2Page A.N. George N.P. Marceau A.H. Cox M.M. Keck J.L. Structure and biochemical activities of Escherichia coli MgsA.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12075-12085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except the TCA precipitation pellet was resuspended in buffer, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for identification of peptides (University of Wisconsin Mass Spectrometry facility). The open reading frame of E. coli radD was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET21a resulting in plasmid pEAW724. Changes were made for better codon usage in codons 4, 5, and 584. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) of pEAW724 using primers consisting of the radD gene bases 98–125, and their complement, were used to create the radD K37R mutant. The AAA bases coding for the lysine at amino acid 37 were changed to CGT to code for an arginine. The resulting plasmid, designated pEAW755, was directly sequenced to confirm the presence of the radD K37R mutant. The Rosetta (DE3) strain was transformed with the pEAW724, and cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.5. RadD expression was induced by the addition of 0.8 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in sucrose solution (25% (w/v) sucrose, 250 mm Tris chloride (pH 7.7), 7 mm EDTA, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm E-64) and lysed by sonication and the addition of 1.6 g/liter of lysozyme. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. RadD was precipitated by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4. The (NH4)2SO4 pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris chloride (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (R-buffer) containing 800 mm (NH4)2SO4 and applied to a butyl-Sepharose column. RadD was eluted using a linear gradient from 1 m to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4 in R-buffer. RadD containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed into P buffer (20 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and loaded onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column. RadD came off late in the wash. Fractions containing RadD were dialyzed into R-buffer + 200 mm NaCl and loaded onto a source-15Q column. RadD flowed through but a peak containing nuclease came off in gradient before being run over a size exclusion (S300) column. The resulting RadD was dialyzed into R-buffer +200 mm NaCl, aliquoted, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at −80 °C. The purified protein was >95% pure by gel and free of any detectable nuclease activity. The purification of RadD K37R was identical, except that plasmid pEAW755 was used for expression. The concentration was determined utilizing the extinction coefficient 5.59 × 104 m−1cm−1 for both proteins. SSB was purified as previously (26Lohman T.M. Overman L.B. Two binding modes in Escherichia coli single strand binding protein-single stranded DNA complexes: modulation by NaCl concentration.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration was determined utilizing the extinction coefficient 2.38 × 104 m−1cm−1. Co-precipitation experiments were performed as described previously (15Marceau A.H. Ammonium sulfate co-precipitation of SSB and interacting proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 922: 151-153PubMed Google Scholar), and pellet fractions were suspended in 30 μl of loading buffer before SDS-PAGE on 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The open reading frame of E. coli radD was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into pGAD-C3 and pGBD-ADC3 (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This created an N-terminal fusion with either the GAL4 activation or binding domain. Plasmids containing the open reading frame of ssb with the GAL4 activation or binding domain were a gift from Aimee Marceau. The plasmids were designated pGAD-protein name or pGBD-protein name. The vectors were transformed into pJK69-4A (27James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in various combinations to test for interaction with RadD. Cultures of pJK69-4A were grown in YPD (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) at 30 °C with shaking. One ml of overnight night culture was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 5000 × g. The supernatant was removed, and 125 μl of solution A (80% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20% 1 m lithium acetate), 5 μl of carrier DNA (herring testes DNA), and 3 μl of each vector was added to each tube. The cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 1 h, with vortexing every 10 min. The cells were spun at 5000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 2% glucose and plated on Leu−/Trp− SD medium. The transformed cells were grown at 30 °C for several days. Transformants were then selected and grown overnight in Leu−/Trp− SD liquid medium. Cells were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in an equal volume of 2% glucose and then serially diluted (1:10). The dilutions were spot plated on His−/Ade− SD plates and grown at 30 °C for several days. A positive protein-protein interaction was assessed by growth of the experimental transformants and no growth of the negative controls (empty plasmids). A coupled spectrophotometric enzyme assay (28Morrical S.W. Lee J. Cox M.M. Continuous association of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA binding protein with stable complexes of recA protein and single-stranded DNA.Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) was used to measure the ATPase activities of RadD. The assays were carried out in a Varian Cary 300 dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller and a 12-position cell changer. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris acetate (80% cation), 1 mm DTT, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20% (w/v) glycerol, an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate), a coupling system (3 mm NADH and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase), and purified RadD (200 nm, unless otherwise noted). Increasing concentrations of RadD protein or equivalent volumes of storage buffer were incubated with 50 nm fluorescein-labeled poly-dT100 oligonucleotide in a buffer of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm nucleotide (as appropriate) for 30 min at 37 °C. Ficoll was added to each sample before running on a TBE (Tris/boric acid/EDTA) acrylamide gel for 1–2 h at 100V. Increasing concentrations of RadD protein or equivalent volumes of storage buffer were incubated with 0.5 nm fluorescein amidite-labeled SSB C-terminal polypeptide or 10 nm fluorescein-labeled poly-dT100 oligonucleotide in a buffer of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was determined using a Beacon instrument. S. H. C. conducted most of the experiments, analyzed the results, and wrote most of the paper. R. T.

https://openalex.org/W2518309820,"The Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is the most destructive insect pest of corn in China. Susceptibility to the Cry1F toxin derived from Bacillus thuringiensis has been demonstrated for ACB, suggesting the potential for Cry1F inclusion as part of an insect pest management program. Insects can develop resistance to Cry toxins, which threatens the development and use of Bt formulations and Bt crops in the field. To determine possible resistance mechanisms to Cry1F, a Cry1F-resistant colony of ACB (ACB-FR) that exhibited more than 1700-fold resistance was established through selection experiments after 49 generations of selection under laboratory conditions. The ACB-FR strain showed moderate cross-resistance to Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac of 22.8- and 26.9-fold, respectively, marginally cross-resistance to Cry1Ah (3.7-fold), and no cross-resistance to Cry1Ie (0.6-fold). The bioassay responses of progeny from reciprocal F1 crosses to different Cry1 toxin concentrations indicated that the resistance trait to Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac and Cry1F has autosomal inheritance with no maternal effect or sex linked. The effective dominance (h) of F1 offspring was calculated at different concentrations of Cry1F, showing that h decreased as concentration of Cry1F increased. Finally, the analysis of actual and expected mortality of the progeny from a backcross (F1 × resistant strain) indicated that the inheritance of the resistance to Cry1F in ACB-FR was due to more than one locus. The present study provides an understanding of the genetic basis of Cry1F resistance in ACB-FR and also shows that pyramiding Cry1F with Cry1Ah or Cry1Ie could be used as a strategy to delay the development of ACB resistance to Bt proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2514921994,"Astringency perception, as an essential parameter for high-quality red wine, is principally elicited by condensed tannins in diversified chemical structures. Condensed tannins, which are also known as proanthocyanidins (PAs), belong to the flavonoid class of polyphenols and are incorporated by multiple flavan-3-ols units according to their degree of polymerization (DP). However, the influence of DP size of PAs on astringency perception remains unclear for decades. This controversy was mainly attributed to the lack of efficient strategies to isolate the PAs in non-galloylated forms and with individual degree size from grape/wine. In the present study, the astringency intensity of purified and identified grape oligomeric tannins (DP ranged from 1 to 5) was firstly explored. A novel non-solid phase strategy was used to rapidly exclude the galloylated PAs from the non-galloylated PAs and fractionate the latter according to their DP size. Then, a series of PAs with individual DP size and galloylation were purified by an approach of preparative hydrophilic interaction chromatography. Furthermore, purified compounds were identified by both normal phase HPLC-FLD and reverse phase UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF. Finally, the contribution of the astringency perception of the individual purified tannins was examined with a salivary protein binding ability test. The results were observed by HPLC-FLD and quantified by changes in PA concentration remaining in the filtrate. In summary, a new approach without a solid stationary phase was developed to isolate PAs according to their DP size. And a positive relationship between the DP of PAs and salivary protein affinity was revealed."

A plant-based HPV vaccine is an alternative to the currently available virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, and would be much less expensive. We optimized methods to express HPV16 L1 protein and purify VLPs from tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves transfected with the magnICON deconstructed viral vector expression system. L1 proteins were extracted from agro-infiltrated leaves using a series of pH and salt mediated buffers. Expression levels of L1 proteins and VLPs were verified by immunoblot and ELISA, which confirmed the presence of sequential and conformational epitopes, respectively. Among three constructs tested (16L1d22, TPL1d22, and TPL1F), TPL1F, containing a full-length L1 and chloroplast transit peptide, was best. Extraction of HPV16 L1 from leaf tissue was most efficient (> 2.5% of total soluble protein) with a low-salt phosphate buffer. VLPs were purified using both cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient and size exclusion chromatography. Electron microscopy studies confirmed the presence of assembled forms of HPV16 L1 VLPs. Collectively; our results indicated that chloroplast-targeted transient expression in tobacco plants is promising for the production of a cheap, efficacious HPV16 L1 VLP vaccine. Studies are underway to develop plant VLPs for the production of a cervical cancer vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2492681647,"Fe-S clusters, essential cofactors needed for the activity of many different enzymes, are assembled by conserved protein machineries inside bacteria and mitochondria. As the architecture of the human machinery remains undefined, we co-expressed in Escherichia coli the following four proteins involved in the initial step of Fe-S cluster synthesis: FXN42–210 (iron donor); [NFS1]·[ISD11] (sulfur donor); and ISCU (scaffold upon which new clusters are assembled). We purified a stable, active complex consisting of all four proteins with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. Using negative staining transmission EM and single particle analysis, we obtained a three-dimensional model of the complex with ∼14 Å resolution. Molecular dynamics flexible fitting of protein structures docked into the EM map of the model revealed a [FXN42–210]24·[NFS1]24·[ISD11]24·[ISCU]24 complex, consistent with the measured 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of its four components. The complex structure fulfills distance constraints obtained from chemical cross-linking of the complex at multiple recurring interfaces, involving hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, or hydrophobic interactions between conserved residues. The complex consists of a central roughly cubic [FXN42–210]24·[ISCU]24 sub-complex with one symmetric ISCU trimer bound on top of one symmetric FXN42–210 trimer at each of its eight vertices. Binding of 12 [NFS1]2·[ISD11]2 sub-complexes to the surface results in a globular macromolecule with a diameter of ∼15 nm and creates 24 Fe-S cluster assembly centers. The organization of each center recapitulates a previously proposed conserved mechanism for sulfur donation from NFS1 to ISCU and reveals, for the first time, a path for iron donation from FXN42–210 to ISCU."
https://openalex.org/W2507601502,"Chromatin remodelling is essential for cardiac development. Interestingly, the role of histone chaperones has not been investigated in this regard. HIRA is a member of the HUCA (HIRA/UBN1/CABIN1/ASF1a) complex that deposits the variant histone H3.3 on chromatin independently of replication. Lack of HIRA has general effects on chromatin and gene expression dynamics in embryonic stem cells and mouse oocytes. Here we describe the conditional ablation of Hira in the cardiogenic mesoderm of mice. We observed surface oedema, ventricular and atrial septal defects and embryonic lethality. We identified dysregulation of a subset of cardiac genes, notably upregulation of troponins Tnni2 and Tnnt3, involved in cardiac contractility and decreased expression of Epha3, a gene necessary for the fusion of the muscular ventricular septum and the atrioventricular cushions. We found that HIRA binds GAGA rich DNA loci in the embryonic heart, and in particular a previously described enhancer of Tnni2/Tnnt3 (TTe) bound by the transcription factor NKX2.5. HIRA-dependent H3.3 enrichment was observed at the TTe in embryonic stem cells (ESC) differentiated toward cardiomyocytes in vitro. Thus, we show here that HIRA has locus-specific effects on gene expression and that histone chaperone activity is vital for normal heart development, impinging on pathways regulated by an established cardiac transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2514050708,"Background A form of systemic vasculitis, Kawasaki disease (KD) occurs most frequently in children under the age of five years old. Previous studies have found that Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) correlates with KD, although the related mechanisms are still unknown. CD40L may also be a marker of vasculitis in KD, so this study focuses on PGE2 and CD40L expression in KD. Materials and Methods This study consisted of a total of 144 KD patients, whose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)/coronary arterial lesion (CAL) formation resistance was evaluated. PGE2 levels were evaluated in vitro to study the effect of CD40L on CD4+ T lymphocytes. Results PGE2 levels significantly increased after IVIG treatment (p<0.05), especially in patients who responded to initial IVIG treatment (p = 0.004) and for patients without CAL formation (p = 0.016). Furthermore, an in vitro study revealed that IVIG acted as a trigger for PGE2 expression in the acute-stage mononuclear cells of KD patients. According to our findings, both IVIG and PGE2 can impede surface CD40L expressions on CD4+ T lymphocytes (p<0.05). Conclusions The results of this study are among the first to find that plasma PGE2 is correlated with the prevention of IVIG resistance and CAL formation through CD40L in KD."
https://openalex.org/W2509199566,"Noise can enhance perception of tactile and proprioceptive stimuli by stochastic resonance processes. However, the mechanisms underlying this general phenomenon remain to be characterized. Here we studied how externally applied noise influences action potential firing in mouse primary sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia, modelling a basic process in sensory perception. Since noisy mechanical stimuli may cause stochastic fluctuations in receptor potential, we examined the effects of sub-threshold depolarizing current steps with superimposed random fluctuations. We performed whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured neurons of mouse dorsal root ganglia. Noise was added either before and during the step, or during the depolarizing step only, to focus onto the specific effects of external noise on action potential generation. In both cases, step + noise stimuli triggered significantly more action potentials than steps alone. The normalized power norm had a clear peak at intermediate noise levels, demonstrating that the phenomenon is driven by stochastic resonance. Spikes evoked in step + noise trials occur earlier and show faster rise time as compared to the occasional ones elicited by steps alone. These data suggest that external noise enhances, via stochastic resonance, the recruitment of transient voltage-gated Na channels, responsible for action potential firing in response to rapid step-wise depolarizing currents."
https://openalex.org/W2516898003,"Background Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) result in considerable morbidity and mortality. However, there are no objective biomarkers to diagnose AECOPD. Methods We used multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry to quantify 129 distinct proteins in plasma samples from patients with COPD. This analytical approach was first performed in a biomarker cohort of patients hospitalized with AECOPD (Cohort A, n = 72). Proteins differentially expressed between AECOPD and convalescent states were chosen using a false discovery rate <0.01 and fold change >1.2. Protein selection and classifier building were performed using an elastic net logistic regression model. The performance of the biomarker panel was then tested in two independent AECOPD cohorts (Cohort B, n = 37, and Cohort C, n = 109) using leave-pair-out cross-validation methods. Results Five proteins were identified distinguishing AECOPD and convalescent states in Cohort A. Biomarker scores derived from this model were significantly higher during AECOPD than in the convalescent state in the discovery cohort (p<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic cross-validation area under the curve (CV-AUC) statistic was 0.73 in Cohort A, while in the replication cohorts the CV-AUC was 0.77 for Cohort B and 0.79 for Cohort C. Conclusions A panel of five biomarkers shows promise in distinguishing AECOPD from convalescence and may provide the basis for a clinical blood test to diagnose AECOPD. Further validation in larger cohorts is necessary for future clinical translation."

Timp-3 is expressed at multiple sites of extensive tissue remodelling. This extends to bone where its role, however, remains largely unresolved. In this study, we have used Micro-CT to assess bone mass and architecture, histological and histochemical evaluation to characterise the skeletal phenotype of Timp-3 KO mice and have complemented this by also examining similar indices in mice harbouring a Timp-3 transgene driven via a Col-2a-driven promoter to specifically target overexpression to chondrocytes. Our data show that Timp-3 deficiency compromises tibial bone mass and structure in both cortical and trabecular compartments, with corresponding increases in osteoclasts. Transgenic overexpression also generates defects in tibial structure predominantly in the cortical bone along the entire shaft without significant increases in osteoclasts. These alterations in cortical mass significantly compromise predicted tibial load-bearing resistance to torsion in both genotypes. Neither Timp-3 KO nor transgenic mouse growth plates are significantly affected. The impact of Timp-3 deficiency and of transgenic overexpression extends to produce modification in craniofacial bones of both endochondral and intramembranous origins. These data indicate that the levels of Timp-3 are crucial in the attainment of functionally-appropriate bone mass and architecture and that this arises from chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages."

All students who referred intention to choose a certain medical specialty were considered as participants.Of the 11073 surveyed students, 9235 indicated the name of a specific specialty. The specialties chosen most often in the fifth year were General Surgery (13.0%), Pediatrics (11.0%), Internal Medicine (10.3%) and Obstetrics/Gynecology (9.0%). For women, the top choices were Pediatrics (15.8%), Obstetrics/Gynecology (11.0%), Cardiology (8.7%), General Surgery (8.6%), and Oncology (6.4%). In the adjusted analysis, the female gender was associated with the choice of Obstetrics/Gynecology (RP: 2.75; IC95%: 2.24-3.39); Pediatric Surgery (RP: 2.19; IC95%: 1.19-4.00), Dermatology (RP: 1.91; IC95%:1.24-2.93), Pediatrics (RP: 1.83; IC95%: 1.56-2.17), and Oncology (RP: 1.37; IC95%: 1.10-1.71).There is an association between the female gender and the intention to choose Obstetrics/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Pediatric Surgery, Dermatology, and Oncology. We recommend conducting studies that consider other factors that can influence the choice of a medical specialty."
https://openalex.org/W2516676992,"The psychological investigation of heroism is relatively new. At this stage, inductive methods can shed light on its main aspects. Therefore, we examined the social representations of Hero and Everyday Hero by collecting word associations from two separate representative samples in Hungary. We constructed two networks from these word associations. The results show that the social representation of Hero is more centralized and it cannot be divided into smaller units. The network of Everyday Hero is divided into five units and the significance moves from abstract hero characteristics to concrete social roles and occupations exhibiting pro-social values. We also created networks from the common associations of Hero and Everyday Hero. The structures of these networks show a moderate similarity and the connections are more balanced in case of Everyday Hero. While heroism in general can be the source of inspiration, the promotion of everyday heroism can be more successful in encouraging ordinary people to recognize their own potential for heroic behavior."

It can grow in media containing yeast extract and peptone (YP), yeast nitrogen base (YNB) + glutamate (YNB + Glu), or YNB + aspartate (YNB + Asp). Methanol expression regulator 1 (Mxr1p), a zinc finger transcription factor, is essential for growth in these media. Mxr1p regulates the expression of several genes involved in the utilization of amino acids as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. These include the following: (i) GDH2 encoding NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase; (ii) AAT1 and AAT2 encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferases, respectively; (iii) MDH1 and MDH2 encoding mitochondrial and cytosolic malate dehydrogenases, respectively; and (iv) GLN1 encoding glutamine synthetase. Synthesis of all these enzymes is regulated by Mxr1p at the level of transcription except GDH2, whose synthesis is regulated at the level of translation. Mxr1p activates the transcription of AAT1, AAT2, and GLN1 in cells cultured in YP as well as in YNB + Glu media, whereas transcription of MDH1 and MDH2 is activated in cells cultured in YNB + Glu but not in YP. A truncated Mxr1p composed of 400 N-terminal amino acids activates transcription of target genes in cells cultured in YP but not in YNB + Glu. Mxr1p binds to Mxr1p response elements present in the promoters of AAT2, MDH2, and GLN1. We conclude that Mxr1p is essential for utilization of amino acids as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, and it is a global regulator of multiple metabolic pathways in P. pastoris."

Only some genetic markers associated with drug-resistant TB are known. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a promising tool for distinguishing between re-infection and persistent infection in isolates taken at different times from a single patient, but has not yet been applied in MDR and XDR-TB. We aim to detect genetic markers associated with drug resistance and distinguish between reinfection and persistent infection from MDR and XDR-TB patients based on WGS analysis. Samples of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 7), serially isolated from 2 MDR cases and 1 XDR-TB case, were retrieved from Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok. The WGS analysis used an Illumina Miseq sequencer. In cases of persistent infection, MDR-TB isolates differed at an average of 2 SNPs across the span of 2–9 months whereas in the case of reinfection, isolates differed at 61 SNPs across 2 years. Known genetic markers associated with resistance were detected from strains susceptible to streptomycin (2/7 isolates), p-aminosalicylic acid (3/7 isolates) and fluoroquinolone drugs. Among fluoroquinolone drugs, ofloxacin had the highest phenotype-genotype concordance (6/7 isolates), whereas gatifloxcain had the lowest (3/7 isolates). A putative candidate SNP in Rv2477c associated with kanamycin and amikacin resistance was suggested for further validation. WGS provided comprehensive results regarding molecular epidemiology, distinguishing between persistent infection and reinfection in M/XDR-TB and potentially can be used for detection of novel mutations associated with drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2509818852,"The genome sequences of Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV) isolates from three accessions of hawthorns (Crataegus pinnatifida) grown at Shenyang Agricultural University were determined using Illumina RNA-seq. To confirm the assembly data from the de novo sequencing, two ACLSV genomic sequences (SY01 and SY02) were sequenced using the Sanger method. The SY01 and SY02 sequences obtained with the Sanger method showed 99.5% and 99.7% nucleotide identity with the transcriptome data, respectively. The genome sequences of the hawthorn isolates SY01, SY02 and SY03 (GenBank accession nos. KM207212, KU870524 and KU870525, respectively) consisted of 7,543, 7,561 and 7,545 nucleotides, respectively, excluding poly-adenylated tails. Sequence analysis revealed that these hawthorn isolates shared an overall nucleotide identity of 82.8–92.1% and showed the highest identity of 90.3% for isolate YH (GenBank accession no. KC935955) from pear and the lowest identity of 67.7% for isolate TaTao5 (GenBank accession no. EU223295) from peach. Hawthorn isolate sequences were similar to those of ‘B6 type’ ACLSV. The relationship between ACLSV isolates largely depends upon the host species. This represents the first comparative study of the genome sequences of ACLSV isolates from hawthorns."
https://openalex.org/W2517017657,"Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 (MDA-7/IL-24) exhibits cytotoxic effects on tumor cells while sparing untransformed cells, and Bcl-x(L) is reported to efficiently block the induction of cell death by MDA-7/IL-24. The expression of Bcl-x(L) is regulated at the level of RNA splicing via alternative 5' splice site selection within exon 2 to produce either the pro-apoptotic Bcl-x(s) or the anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L). Our laboratory previously reported that Bcl-x RNA splicing is dysregulated in a large percentage of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. Therefore, we investigated whether the alternative RNA splicing of Bcl-x pre-mRNA was modulated by MDA-7/IL-24, which would suggest that specific NSCLC tumors are valid targets for this cytokine therapy. Adenovirus-delivered MDA-7/IL-24 (Ad.mda-7) reduced the viability of NSCLC cells of varying oncogenotypes, which was preceded by a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-x(L)/Bcl-x(s) mRNA and Bcl-x(L) protein expression. Importantly, both the expression of Bcl-x(L) and the loss of cell viability were rescued in Ad.mda-7-treated cells incubated with Bcl-x(s) siRNA. In addition, NSCLC cells ectopically expressing Bcl-x(s) exhibited significantly reduced Bcl-x(L) expression, which was again restored by Bcl-x(s) siRNA, suggesting the existence of a novel mechanism by which Bcl-x(s) mRNA restrains the expression of Bcl-x(L). In additional mechanistic studies, inhibition of SRC and PKCδ completely ablated the ability of MDA-7/IL-24 to reduce the Bcl-x(L)/(s) mRNA ratio and cell viability. These findings show that Bcl-x(s) expression is an important mediator of MDA-7/IL-24-induced cytotoxicity requiring the SRC/PKCδ signaling axis in NSCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2518478694,"Despite being an important target of conservation concern and horticultural interest, Lebanese irises yet have a confusing taxonomic history and species' delimitation is often considered problematic, more especially among royal irises (Iris section Oncocyclus). Indeed, these irises of exceptionally large and spectacular flowers have radiated across Caucasus and eastern Mediterranean giving rise to a number of strict endemic taxa, many of them being considered under threat. Whilst efforts have mostly focused on clarifying the evolutionary relationships in the group based on morphological and molecular data, karyological and cytogenetic characters have been comparatively overlooked. In this study, we established for the first time the physical mapping of 35S rDNA loci and heterochromatin, and obtained karyo-morphological data for ten Lebanese Iris species belonging to four sections (Iris, Limniris, Oncocyclus and Scorpiris). Our results evidenced distinctive genomic profiles for each one of the sections, where Oncocyclus irises, while having the lowest chromosome numbers, exhibit both the highest number of 35S loci and CMA3+ sites. The continental radiation of royal irises has been accompanied by a relative karyological and cytogenetic stasis, even though some changes were observed regarding karyotype formula and asymmetry indexes. In addition to that, our results enabled taxonomic differentiation between I. germanica and I. mesopotamica-two taxa currently considered as synonyms-and highlighted the need for further studies on populations of I. persica and I. wallasiae in the Eastern Mediterranean Region."
https://openalex.org/W2507428290,"Heart disease (HD) remains the leading cause of death among Mississippians; however, despite the importance of the condition, trends in HD mortality in Mississippi have not been adequately explored. This study examined trends in HD mortality among adults in Mississippi from 1980 through 2013 and further examined these trends by race and sex. We used data from Mississippi Vital Statistics (1980–2013) to calculate age-adjusted HD mortality rates for Mississippians age 25 or older. Cases were identified using underlying cause of death codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9: 390–398, 402, 404–429) and Tenth Revision (ICD-10), including I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20-I51. Joinpoint software was used to calculate the average annual percent change in HD mortality rates for the overall population and by race and sex. Overall, the age-adjusted HD mortality rate among Mississippi adults decreased by 36.5% between 1980 and 2013, with an average annual percent change of -1.60% (95% CI -2.00 to -1.30). This trend varied across subgroups: HD mortality rates experienced an average annual change of -1.34% (95% CI -1.98 to -0.69) for black adults; -1.60% (95% CI -1.74 to -1.46) for white adults; -1.30% (95% CI -1.50 to -1.10) for all women, and -1.90% (95% -2.20 to -1.50) for all men. From 1980 to 2013, there was a continuous decrease in HD mortality among adult Mississippians. However, the magnitude of this reduction differed by race and sex."
https://openalex.org/W2510950495,"It is well established that emotions are organized around two motivational systems: the defensive and the appetitive. Individual differences are relevant factors in emotional reactions, making them more flexible and less stereotyped. There is evidence that health professionals have lower emotional reactivity when viewing scenes of situations involving pain. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the rating of pictures of surgical procedure depends on their personal/occupational relevance. Fifty-two female Nursing (health discipline) and forty-eight Social Work (social science discipline) students participated in the experiment, which consisted of the presentation of 105 images of different categories (e.g., neutral, food), including 25 images of surgical procedure. Volunteers judged each picture according to its valence (pleasantness) and arousal using the Self-Assessment Manikin scale (dimensional approach). Additionally, the participants chose the word that best described what they felt while viewing each image (discrete emotion perspective). The average valence score for surgical procedure pictures for the Nursing group (M = 4.57; SD = 1.02) was higher than the score for the Social Work group (M = 3.31; SD = 1.05), indicating that Nursing students classified those images as less unpleasant than the Social Work students did. Additionally, the majority of Nursing students (65.4%) chose ""neutral"" as the word that best described what they felt while viewing the pictures. In the Social Work group, disgust (54.2%) was the emotion that was most frequently chosen. The evaluation of emotional stimuli differed according to the groups' personal/occupational relevance: Nursing students judged pictures of surgical procedure as less unpleasant than the Social Work students did, possibly reflecting an emotional regulation skill or some type of habituation that is critically relevant to their future professional work."
https://openalex.org/W2518348665,"Integrin adhesome proteins bind each other in alternative manners, forming within the cell diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites with distinct properties. An intriguing question is how such modular assembly of adhesion sites is achieved correctly solely by self-organization of their components. Here we address this question using high-throughput multiplexed imaging of eight proteins and two phosphorylation sites in a large number of single focal adhesions. We found that during the assembly of focal adhesions the variances of protein densities decrease while the correlations between them increase, suggesting reduction in the noise levels within these structures. These changes correlate independently with the area and internal density of focal adhesions, but not with their age or shape. Artificial neural network analysis indicates that a joint consideration of multiple components improves the predictability of paxillin and zyxin levels in internally dense focal adhesions. This suggests that paxillin and zyxin densities in focal adhesions are fine-tuned by integrating the levels of multiple other components, thus averaging-out stochastic fluctuations. Based on these results we propose that increase in internal protein densities facilitates noise suppression in focal adhesions, while noise suppression enables their stable growth and further density increase-hence forming a feedback loop giving rise to a quality-controlled assembly."
