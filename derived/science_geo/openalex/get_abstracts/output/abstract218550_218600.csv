https://openalex.org/W179735311,"Publisher Summary This chapter describes the measurement of pyridine nucleotides by enzymatic cycling. The coenzyme to be determined is made to catalyze an enzymatic dismutation between two substrates. After several thousand cycles, one of the products is measured. The nucleotides during cycling are used at concentrations well below their Michaelis constants and consequently, reaction rates are proportional to nucleotide concentrations. It is found that as pyruvate formation during cycling is not strictly linear with DPN concentration, standards of DPN + are included which increase in steps of two to cover the range of assay. Blanks and standards are carried through the entire procedure and are treated as nearly as possible to the samples being analyzed. The cycling procedure is not as flexible as that for TPN, owing primarily to a fall-off in rate as pyruvate accumulates. The TPN cycle is proportional within a 100-fold range of coenzymes with the same cycling reagent. It is found that the DPN cycle is proportional without too much departure from linearity over a 20-fold range."

https://openalex.org/W2398916566,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the determination of D-mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase and D-sorbitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Aerobacter aerogenes. The assay method depends on the increase in light absorbance at 340 mμ when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is reduced in the presence of either D-mannitol 1-phosphate or D-sorbitol 6-phosphate. The two enzymes, D-mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase and D-sorbitol 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, are completely different enzymes as determined by their physical, chemical, and catalytic properties. The enzyme unit is that amount, which will produce a change of 0.01 in optical density at 340 mμ during the 30- to 90-second interval. Protein is determined by the biuret phenol method. Specific activity is expressed as units per milligram of protein. In the course of purification procedure for D-mannitol 1-P dehydrogenase, Aerobacter aerogenes ATCC 8724 is grown for approximately 20 hours with vigorous aeration at 30° in a synthetic medium that contained 0.54% KH2PO4, 0.12% (NH4)2SO4, 0.04% MgSO4·7 H2O, and 1.5% D-mannitol. The cells were grown in 25-liter batches. In the course of purification procedure for D-sorbitol 6-P dehydrogenase, cells are grown as described for D-mannitol 1-P dehydrogenase, except that the medium contains 1.5% D-sorbitol as a carbon source for growth."

The spirochetes appear pure in the underlying agar, owing to their ability to grow through the filter. Their passage through the 10-mmicro filters may be attributed to the instability of this pore size on storage."

It decreases linearly with distance from cell bodies, the activity of the terminal part of the nerve being about 30 to 40 percent lower than that of its most proximal part."

https://openalex.org/W2065452659,THE erythropoietic activity in the plasma of rabbits made anaemic with phenylhydrazine can be isolated as an acid glycoprotein. A dialysed and lyophilized ethanol fraction from heat-coagulated plasma consistently gives us a potent stable highly water-soluble preparation. Six laboratories have found good correlation in a comparative assay of a batch prepared by us1. Further di-ethyl-amino-ethyl cellulose column fractionation removes 40–50 per cent of inert protein and results in the active glycoprotein previously described2.

Indeed the small size of fungus chromosomes and the limitations of techniques of staining make difficult the unequivocal identification of chromosomes as such in many published records."

https://openalex.org/W2094777157,"IN the course of histochemical investigations on the human eccrine sweat gland alkaline phosphatase reactivity in the luminal portion of the ampulla was observed1. This observation has been repeated frequently, and it has been noted that this reactivity may continue into the proximal part of the coiled duct. Dr. G. H. Findlay of Pretoria suggested that this phenomenon might represent deposition of alkaline phosphatase, if the enzyme were present in sweat. We have found no reference to enable us to answer this question. A random sample of sweat was accordingly collected from a normal male volunteer half an hour after the onset of profuse sweating in a ‘hot box’. It contained 2.9 King–Armstrong units of alkaline phosphatase."
