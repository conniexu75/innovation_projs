We found that ribosomal protein S6 (S6), which exerts translational control of protein synthesis and is required for cell growth, is hyperphosphorylated in the smooth muscle-like cell lesions of LAM patients compared with smooth muscle cells from normal human blood vessels and trachea. Smooth muscle (SM) cells derived from these lesions (LAMD-SM) also exhibited S6 hyperphosphorylation, constitutive activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), and increased basal DNA synthesis. In parallel, TSC2−/− smooth muscle cells (ELT3) and TSC2−/− epithelial cells (ERC15) also exhibited hyperphosphorylation of S6, constitutive activation of p70S6K, and increased basal DNA synthesis. Re-introduction of wild type tuberin into LAMD-SM, ELT3, and ERC15 cells abolished phosphorylation of S6 and significantly inhibited p70S6K activity and DNA synthesis. Rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, inhibited hyperphosphorylation of S6, p70S6K activation, and DNA synthesis in LAMD-SM cells. Interestingly, the basal levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt/protein kinase B, and p42/p44 MAPK activation were unchanged in LAMD-SM and ELT3 cells relative to levels in normal human tracheal and vascular SM. These data demonstrate that tuberin negatively regulates the activity of S6 and p70S6K specifically, and suggest a potential mechanism for abnormal cell growth in LAM.

These lesions promote cystic destruction of the lung and lead to loss of pulmonary function, for which there is no therapy (6Taveira-DaSilva A.M. Hedin C. Stylianou M.P. Travis W.D. Matsui K.

The molecular mechanisms promoting LAM cell proliferation remain largely unknown (7Cheadle J.P. Reeve M.P. Sampson J.R. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 97-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Genetic studies demonstrate that somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor TSC2 gene are associated with pulmonary LAM (8Franz D.N. Brody A. Meyer C. Leonard J. Chuck G. Dabora S. Sethuraman G.

A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), using antisense oligonucleotides, showed that tuberin negatively regulates the G1/S transition of immortalized rat fibroblast cell line Rat1. Mutations in the Drosophila homolog ofTSC2 gene increased cell growth and shortened of G1 phase of the cell cycle, which was comparable with results obtained by overexpressing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), Myc, or Ras (12Ito M.

Mice lacking tuberin die as embryos and show hypoplasia of the liver and developmental abnormalities of other abdominal organs (15Onda H. Lueck A. Marks P.W. Warren H.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 16Kobayashi E. Minowa O. Kuno J. Mitani H. Hino O. Noda T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1206-1211PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous mice develop cysts and slow growing tumors in a variety of tissues. The Eker rat, a model for hereditary renal cancer, has an insertion in the TSC2 locus resulting in a tuberin mutation and tumor development in multiple organs (17Yeung R. Xiao G. Jin F. Lee W. Testa J. Knudson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11413-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Kobayashi T. Nishizawa M. Hirayama Y. Kobayashi E. Hino O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2608-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, as in the human disease, loss or mutation ofTSC2 modulates cell proliferation. TSC2 encodes a 1784-amino acid 200-kDa protein, tuberin, that contains a region with sequence similarity to the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rap1 GTPase (19European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis ConsortiumCell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). The putative GAP domain has been reported to increase the intrinsic GTPase activity of both Rab5 and Rap1A GTPases (20Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 21Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Further downstream, tuberin modulates the transcriptional activity of AP1 and the steroid hormone receptor family (22Henry K.W. Yuan X. Koszewski N.J. Onda H. Kwiatkowski D.J. Noonan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20535-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Tsuchiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O.

However, little else is known about how tuberin is regulated or about its other downstream signaling targets. Given the phenotypic similarity between loss of TSC2 and overexpression of PI 3-kinase in Drosophila (25Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that deregulation of PI 3-kinase effectors might be important for the abnormal cell proliferation associated withTSC2 deficiency. One critical downstream target of PI 3-kinase, p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), affects cell and organ size inDrosophila (26Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Activation of p70S6K and its subsequent phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 are required for biosynthesis of the cellular translational apparatus, a critical component for cell growth and proliferation. Conditional deletion of the S6 gene in the liver of adult mice abrogates cell proliferation and cyclin E expression despite the formation of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes (27Volarevic S. Steward M.J. Lefderman B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The central role of p70S6K and ribosomal protein S6 in cellular proliferation has been further demonstrated by the use of rapamycin, a macrolide that specifically and directly inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an obligated upstream activator of p70S6K (28Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar, 29Sabatini D.M. Erjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Tempst P.

Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that tuberin specifically regulates the activity of p70S6K and ribosomal protein S6. S6 hyperphosphorylation and p70S6K activation and increased DNA synthesis were observed in LAM tissue samples, primary LAM-derived smooth muscle (LAMD-SM) cultures, and established cell lines lacking the functional tuberin protein. These effects were reversed by the re-introduction of tuberin. Surprisingly, other signaling molecules such as PI 3-kinase, Akt, and MAPK were unaffected by cellular levels of tuberin. These results suggest that tuberin may modulate its effects on cellular proliferation through specific modulation of the p70S6K pathway. LAMD-SM cells were dissociated from LAM nodules obtained from the lungs of LAM patients who have undergone lung transplant. LAM tissue was obtained in compliance with the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved protocol and the protocol approved by NHLBI, National Institutes of Health LAM Registry Tissue Committee. Briefly, nodules was subjected to an enzymatic digestion in 10 ml of M199 medium containing 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and 3 mg/ml elastase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 60 min in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. The cell suspension was filtered and then washed with equal volumes of cold DF8 medium consisting of equal amounts of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1.6 × 10−6mferrous sulfate, 1.2 × 10−5 units/ml vasopressin, 1.0 × 10−9m triiodothyronine, 0.025 mg/ml insulin, 1.0 × 10−8m cholesterol, 2.0 × 10−7m hydrocortisone, and 10 pg/ml transferrin supplemented with 10% FBS. Aliquots of the cell suspension were plated at a density of 1.0 × 104cells/cm2 on tissue culture plates covered with Vitrogen (Cohesion Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The cells were cultured in DF8 medium and were passaged twice a week. LAMD-SM cells in subculture during the third through twelfth cell passages were used. All experiments were performed using in parallel three primary cell lines derived from two LAM patients. LAMD-SM-1 cell line represents the total population of cells derived from one nodule of one patient. LAMD-SM-2 and LAMD-SM-7 are clonal lines, two of eight clones that were derived from a LAM nodule of another patient. Each cell line was characterized on the basis of TSC2 mutational analysis, tuberin expression, smooth muscle α-actin expression, the level of DNA synthesis, and HMB45 immunoreactivity. TSC2 gene mutational analysis of these cell lines was performed on DNA and RNA samples by two methods. First, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the entire coding region of the TSC2 mRNA was performed using a set of eight primer pairs to generate eight overlapping fragments (31Dabora S.L. Jozwiak S. Franz D.N. Roberts P.S. Nieto A. Chung J. Choy Y.S. Reeve M.P. Thiele E. Egelhoff J.C. Karprzyk-Obara J. Domanska-Pakiela D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 64-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). These fragments were subjected to bi-directional sequencing and compared with the TSC2 consensus sequence using the program Sequencher version 2.0. Analysis of selected individual exons of TSC2 by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing was also performed as described (31Dabora S.L. Jozwiak S. Franz D.N. Roberts P.S. Nieto A. Chung J. Choy Y.S. Reeve M.P. Thiele E. Egelhoff J.C. Karprzyk-Obara J. Domanska-Pakiela D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 64-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of morphological, biochemical, and functional characteristics demonstrated similarities between LAMD-SM-1, LAMD-SM-2, and LAMD-SM-7 cell lines. Morphologically LAMD-SM cells were spindle-like with high levels of basal DNA synthesis (see “Results”), and they showed positive immunoreactivity to anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibody (data not shown) and tuberin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (See “Results”). However, LAMD-SM cells showed no immunoreactivity for HMB-45 (DAKO Co., Carpinteria, CA) (data not shown), which showed positive immunostaining of the epithelioid cells in LAM nodules (data not shown) (3Matsui K. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Travis W.D. Moss J. Ferrans V.J. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2000; 124: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar, 4Matsui K. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Valencia J. Travis W.D. Moss J. Ferrans V.J. Am.

All assays were performed on cells maintained for 48 h in serum-free DF basal media containing 1% bovine serum albumin before starting the experiment. A TSC2−/− ELT3 smooth muscle cell line was derived from the Eker rat uterine leiomyoma (33Howe S.R. Gottardis M.M. Everitt J.I. Goldsworthy T.L. Wolf D.C. Walker C.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1568-1579PubMed Google Scholar). The TSC2−/− ERC15 cell line was derived from a Eker rat renal carcinoma (34Hino O. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Freed J.J. Testa J.R. Brown D.J. Vilensky M. Yeung R.S. Tartof K.D. Knudson A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The TSC2+/+ TRKE2 cell line was derived from rat primary kidney epithelial cells (35Walker C.L. Ginsler J. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ELT3, ERC15, and TRKE2 cells were maintained in DF8 medium (33Howe S.R. Gottardis M.M. Everitt J.I. Goldsworthy T.L. Wolf D.C. Walker C.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1568-1579PubMed Google Scholar). Human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, human pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, and human lung fibroblasts (HLF) were used as TSC2+/+ cell lines. Expression of tuberin in these cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with anti-tuberin antibody (data not shown). ASM and VSM cells and HLF were dissociated from human trachea, human pulmonary artery, and human lung, respectively, which were obtained from human lung transplant donors and were previously described (36Panettieri R.A.

Krymskaya V.P. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 283: L354-L363Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). ASM cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 with 10% FBS; VSM were maintained in Ham's F-12 with 10% FBS supplemented with 15 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (BD Biosciences), HLF were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. All assays were performed on cells maintained for 48 h in serum-free medium before starting the experiment. ELT3 and ERC15 were maintained in serum-free DF8 basal media containing 1% bovine serum albumin; ASM and VSM cells were in serum-free Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Microinjection was performed using Eppendorf Microinjection System (Hamburg, Germany). Briefly, cells plated on 2-well glass chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and maintained in serum-free medium were microinjected with pEGFP or pEGFP-TSC2 plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP-tagged tuberin, respectively, or with inhibitory anti-VPS34 antibody, which specifically recognize and inhibit class III PI 3-kinase (38Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) simultaneously with dextran Rhodamine Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to identify microinjected cells. Eighteen hours after injection of plasmids or 30 min after the injection of antibody, the cells were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) for 15 min, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 0.5% TSA Fluoresce™ System blocking reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (S235) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; 1:50) or anti-GFP, rabbit serum (Molecular Probes; 1:200 dilution) and then secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugate, 1:400 dilution, or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes) 1:400) for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cells were visualized on the Bio-Rad 1024-MP confocal microscopic system or Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope under appropriate filters. LAM tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or immunohistochemically with anti-smooth muscle α-actin clone 1A4 fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma), primary anti-phospho-ribosomal protein S6 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and secondary Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes) antibodies. Negative controls included omission of the primary antibody or replacement of the primary antibody with isotype matched IgG. Plasmids were prepared using EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Transient transfection was performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-TSC2 (21Xiao G.H.

Cells were maintained for 48 h in serum-free media before the immunoblot, p70S6K activity, or DNA synthesis assays. Transient transfection of pcDNA-TSC2 plasmid was verified by immunoblot assay using anti-tuberin (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Near confluent cells, grown on 2-well glass chamber slides, were maintained for 48 h in serum-free medium, then after 16 h, 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), a thymidine analogue, was added to all wells. Twenty-four hours after the addition of BrdUrd, the cell monolayers were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After denaturation of DNA with 4 n HCl for 3 min at room temperature, the monolayers were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) and then with 10 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 37 °C to detect BrdUrd-positive cells. The cells were then incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml) in 0.9% NaCl to detect the total number of nuclei. The cells were examined using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse E400) under 200× magnification with the appropriate fluorescent filters. Mitotic index was defined as the percentage of BrdUrd-positive nuclei/field/total number of cells/field. A total of 200 cells were counted/each condition in each experiment. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold TBS and lysed in p70S6K lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 2.5 mmNa4P2O7·10 H2O, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)) or radioimmune precipitation buffer-TBS lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-base HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C. Frozen tissue samples were homogenized with radioimmune precipitation buffer-TBS lysis buffer and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein contents were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysate, adjusted to protein content, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The blots were exposed to either anti-p70 S6 kinase, anti-tuberin (C20) sc-893 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389), anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase (Thr-421/Thr-424), anti-S6 ribosomal protein, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-phospho p42/p44 MAPK (Thr-202/Thr-204), or anti-p42/p44 MAPK (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) antibodies. All antibodies were in TBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST), and all incubations were overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in TBST, the nitrocellulose filters were exposed to either anti-rabbit, anti-mouse (Boehringer-Mannheim) or anti-sheep (Upstate Biotechnology) horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies. Filters were washed five times in TBST and visualized using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Image analysis was performed using the Gel-Pro analyzer program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). In vitro p70S6K activity assay was performed as described previously (40Masuda-Robens J.M. Krymskaya V.P., Qi, H. Chou M.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-free medium-maintained cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7 × 10 H2O, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of anti-p70S6K antibody with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were collected by 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold cell lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, and twice with an assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol (Sigma)). The immunoprecipitates/protein A-Sepharose beads were then resuspended in assay dilution buffer containing 50 μm substrate peptide, 4 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 0.4 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 20 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose filters, which were washed 3 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and 1 time with acetone. The radioactivity of samples was measured using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity assays were performed as previously described (41Krymskaya V.P.

The cells were washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm Na3VO4 (pH 7.5)) and lysed in lysis buffer (wash buffer plus 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (42Krymskaya V.P. Hoffman R. Eszterhas A. Ciocca V. Panettieri R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L1220-L1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology) (2 μg/ml), anti-p85 (2 μg/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-p110α (2 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p110β (2 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Protein A-Sepharose, 50 μl, was then added to the lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 times in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl, and 2 times in TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)). All solutions contained 0.2 mm vanadate. Sonicated phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) in Tris-HCl/EGTA (0.2 mg/ml, final concentration) was added to immunoprecipitates, and the phosphorylation reactions were started by the addition of MgCl2, ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi/sample) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl and extracted with 160 μl of chloroform-methanol (1:1). Lipids were separated on oxalate-coated TLC plates (Merck) using a solvent system of chloroform-methanol-water-ammonium hydroxide (60:40:11.3:2) and then detected by autoradiography. The position of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate was determined by the position of a phosphatidylinositol phosphate standard that is separated on a TLC in parallel and developed in iodine vapor. Data points from individual assays represent the mean values ± S.E. Statistically significant differences among groups were assessed with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Bonferroni Dunn test), with values of p < 0.05 sufficient to reject the null hypothesis for all analyses. All experiments were designed with matched control conditions within each experiment to enable statistical comparison as paired samples. Because somatic mutation of the tumor suppressor TSC2 gene is associated with LAM disease, mutational analysis of the gene in LAMD-SM cells derived from LAM patients was performed and compared with the location of the mutation in the Eker rat and the mutations inDrosophila affecting cell growth. The TSC2 gene, comprising 41 exons, encodes for tuberin, a 200-kDa protein with predicted leucine zipper motive at amino acids 81–98 (exon 3), two small coiled-coil domains at amino acids 346–371 (exon 10) and 1008–1021 (exon 26), and a small region of homology to the Rap1 GAP at amino acids 1593–1631 (exons 34–38) (19European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis ConsortiumCell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar, 43Halley D.J.J.

Analysis of LAMD-SM-1 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR indicated the presence of the rare variant C2580T in exon 22 of TSC2. This polymorphism has been seen previously at a frequency of 0.5% in TSC2(zk.bwh.harvard.edu/projects/tsc/polymorphisms.html), suggesting that it was present in hemizygous state in LAMD-SM-1 cells and that there was loss of one TSC2 allele due to a large genomic deletion.

High Raf activity induces growth arrest and differentiation in these cells, whereas high PI3K/Akt activity correlates with cell survival and proliferation. Here we show that the Raf-Akt cross-talk is regulated in a concentration- and ligand-dependent manner. High doses of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activate Akt quickly and strongly enough to suppress Raf kinase activity via phosphorylation of Ser-259, whereas low doses of IGF-I do not trigger this cross-talk but are still mitogenic. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a differentiation-inducing stimulus, potently activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway but only weakly activates PI3K/Akt and does not trigger the cross-talk. Thus, the herein analyzed parameters such as ligand type, concentration, and time course may contribute to the cellular response of either proliferation or differentiation.

For a recent review see Kolch (1Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). A downstream effector of Ras is Raf-1. Raf-1 is a serine/threonine kinase (2Moelling K. Heimann B. Beimling P. Rapp U.R. Sander T. Nature. 1984; 312: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) that can be activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, among them insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)1 that activates the type 1 IGF surface receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase mainly implicated in the induction of proliferation (3Stewart A.J. Johnson M.D. May F.E. Westley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21172-21178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Raf-1 activation itself is complex and involves membrane recruitment, phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues as well as on tyrosine residues, and binding of 14-3-3 protein family members. Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates the MEK-ERK kinase pathway (4Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar), which trigger biological responses via direct impact on gene expression. Another important pathway that is triggered by IGF-I or insulin via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate, IRS-1, is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. PI3K is activated by binding of its p85 regulatory subunit to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. Activation of PI3K increases the amounts of membrane-localized phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. One of the crucial downstream targets of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt (12Downward J. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Akt is recruited to the membrane by direct binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to the PI3K-produced phospholipids (13Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Upstream kinases such as 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) activate Akt by phosphorylation on Thr-308 (14Alessi D.R. James S.R. Sownes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P. Reece C. Cohen P.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Active Akt causes a variety of biological effects, including suppression of apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several targets along pro-apoptotic pathways such as the Bcl-2 family member BAD (16del Peso L.

Moreover, it regulates glucose uptake by a largely uncharacterized mechanism and controls the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) (19Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). For a comprehensive review see Scheid and Woodgett (20Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Whereas only one direct downstream target is known for Raf-1 many proven or putative targets exist for Akt. The targets share a characteristic phosphorylation sequence within a highly conserved motif (RXRXX(S/T)), which we have previously characterized within the Raf-1 sequence. It is located in the regulatory domain of Raf-1 with Ser-259 being the target within the Akt phosphorylation motif (RQRSTS259). Based on these findings we have recently established that the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-Akt pathways cross-talk on the level of Raf-1 and Akt (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 22Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nuñez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33630-336377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have shown that Akt directly phosphorylated Raf-1 on Ser-259 and resulted in a decrease in Raf-1 activity (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Raf-1 is due to the phosphorylation-dependent binding of the 14-3-3 protein, a negative regulator of Raf-1. In MCF-7 cells, the inactivation of the cross-talk between the two pathways switched the biological response from proliferation to cell cycle arrest. Stimulation with 100 ng/ml IGF-I and the concomitant pharmacological inhibition of PI3K (and indirectly of Akt) with LY294002 led to an increase of Raf-1-kinase and ERK activity because the inhibitory effect of the cross-talk was suppressed. The cross-talk between the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-Akt pathways was also demonstrated in other cellular systems. In the work of Rommelet al. (22Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nuñez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), the relative contributions of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and the PI3K-Akt pathway activities were assessed during myotube differentiation of C2C12 cells. Enforced activation of Akt or inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway promoted differentiation and therefore myotube formation, whereas enforced Raf-1 activity blocked differentiation in the precursor myoblast stage. Intriguingly, the cross-talk was only observed in post-differentiation myotubes and not in myoblasts, where Akt activity or its inhibition had no influence on the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. This suggests a regulation of the cross-talk, in this particular case with a cell stage specificity. Recently, a cross-talk between Akt and Raf has been also shown in neonatal vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells from rat (23Reusch H.P. Zimmermann S. Schaefer M. Paul M. Moelling K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33630-336377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Early passage cells expressed various levels of α-actin and muscle myosin depending on their developmental or differentiation stage. We showed that platelet-derived growth factor, a potent mitogen, induced a sustained activation of PI3K-Akt and allowed only a transient activation of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK, because activated Akt was able to phosphorylate and terminate Raf-1 kinase activity. This cross-talk correlated with proliferation of VSM cells. Thrombin in turn induced differentiation markers such as myosin indicating differentiation of VSM cells. Thrombin induced a strong and biphasic phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, whereas Akt was only partially and transiently phosphorylated. Cross-talk or description of the balance between PKB/Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling has recently been shown by other groups to depend on the kind of agonist and the cellular background. Besides the work done in MCF-7, C2C12, and VSM cells (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 22Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S.

However, both pathways have also been shown to act in parallel. Hence, in intestinal epithelial cells PI3K and Raf synergized for cellular proliferation and transformation (25Sheng H. Shao J. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14498-14504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) whereas certain tumor cells or primary tumors featured constitutively overexpressed Akt (26Sun M.

In rat PC12 cells, B-Raf and c-Raf synergized for sustained ERK activity, which correlated with differentiation as has been described earlier (28York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P.

Depending on the cellular background and type of stimulus, Raf alone can be antiapoptotic even independently of its kinase activity by interaction with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) (33Chen J. Fujii K. Zhang L. Roberts T. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7783-7788Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), or it can be proapoptotic (34Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P.

The role of the MAP kinase in MCF-7 cells stimulated by insulin or TPA/PMA has been analyzed by others (35Alblas J. Slager-Davidov R. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. van der Burg B. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Bartucci M. Morelli C. Mauro L. Ando′ S. Surmacz E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6747-6754PubMed Google Scholar).

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) characterized the kinetics of induction of immediate early genes and showed that insulin induced JNK whereas TPA did not. The inhibitory effect of TPA on cell cycle entry could be reverted by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059, indicating that ERK effectors function as inhibitors of proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Here we analyzed the kinetics of the two pathways, Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt, upon stimulation by IGF-I and PMA using different ligand concentrations. We focused on analyzing the cross-talk between the two pathways. The MCF-7 cell line (human mammary gland carcinoma; purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum (Seratec Co., Goettingen, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (both Invitrogen). MCF-7 cells were seeded onto 100-mm Falcon tissue culture dishes and grown to a confluency of about 75%. 24 h before stimulation the cells were starved in phenol red- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12. The medium was changed a second time 12 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times with either 100 ng/ml IGF-I (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 10 ng/ml IGF-I, or 100 ng/ml PMA (Calbiochem) with or without prior incubation with 20 μmLY294002 (Calbiochem). Cells were lysed for 10 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 135 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μm pepstatin, Trasylol (500,000 Kallikrein® inactivator units) 1:1000, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). For protein detection, primary antibodies used were specific for Raf phosphorylated on Ser-259, for activated Akt or for activated ERK (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA). Primary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped, blocked, and reprobed with antibodies to Raf (R19120; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or to ERK (C14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Stimulation was performed as described, and cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Raf (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K.

Beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm MnCl2) supplemented with 10 μm ATP (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 27.8 μg/ml unactivated MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). The Raf kinase prefers Mn2+ over Mg2+, in contrast to the ERK kinase and protein kinase C (2, see Upstate Biotechnology Catalogue 2001), thus increasing the Raf kinase specificity. The kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, 200 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol). The proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and MEK phosphorylation was assayed using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Cells were lysed as described previously (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 22Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nuñez L.

Subsequently, ERK-2 was precipitated from cellular lysates using an ERK-2 specific antibody (C-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase reactions were performed for 15 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer, adjusted to 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). The kinase reactions were separated on 12.5% SDS-gels. Finally, the dried gels were exposed and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Growth properties of proliferating cells have been determined for MCF-7 cells treated with low and high concentrations of IGF-I in their growth medium. After about 24 h of treatment cells incubated with both low IGF-I (10 ng/ml) and high IGF-I (100 ng/ml) started to proliferate. At later time points, the proliferation rate was higher at higher IGF-I concentrations (not shown). As previously shown, PMA (100 ng/ml) showed no growth-promoting effects (Fig.1) presumably due to expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21cip1 via the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). It has been shown by others that a proliferative stimulus keeps the activity of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway under control to prevent growth arrest by ERK-dependent up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors (37Chen D. Heath V. O'Garra A. Johnston J. McMahon M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate how this control is achieved we analyzed the activity of the two signaling pathways Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt after stimulation with low and high doses of IGF-I. Fig.2A shows the phosphorylation state of the Akt target site Ser-259 of Raf-1 in cells stimulated with high doses of IGF-I (100 ng/ml), which led to a rapid increase of Ser-259 phosphorylation (lane 3), visualized by a phospho-specific antibody. Inhibition of Akt by LY294002, an inhibitor of the Akt upstream kinase PI3K (38Sanchez-Margalet V Goldfine I.D. Vlahos C.J. Sung C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suppresses this increase in phosphorylation (lane 4). Over time, the phosphorylation of Ser-259 diminishes (lane 5). Because increased phosphorylation of Ser-259 of Raf-1 is usually associated with a decrease in the Raf-1 kinase activity, we next measured its activity in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.2B). After starvation, MCF-7 cells were stimulated for 3, 5, or 10 min with 100 ng/ml IGF-I with or without concomitant inhibition of PI3K/Akt by LY294002. Endogenous Raf was immunoprecipitated, and its activity toward a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of MEK (GST-MEK) was assayed. The radioactivity incorporated into glutathioneS-transferase-MEK was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. High doses of IGF-I cause a transient, ∼2-fold activation of Raf-1 kinase activity peaking around 3 to 5 min (lanes 3 and 5). Concomitant inhibition of PI3K-Akt increases Raf-1 kinase activity by about 50% at every time point measured. This increase in Raf-1 kinase activity is transmitted to its downstream targets ERK-1 and -2 as demonstrated by using ERK activation-specific antibodies (Fig. 2C). The ERK activity mirrors the activity of Raf-1, although with slightly delayed kinetics due to the downstream position of ERK. Thus, the peak of ERK activation lies around 10 min (lane 7). Both the Raf-1 and ERK kinase activities are higher in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 2, B and C). At later time points the ERK activity decreased (lanes 9–12). Under the same conditions strong activation of Akt is visible and persistent. Even after 90 min of stimulation, no decrease in Akt activity is detectable (data not shown). At all time points analyzed, Akt activity can be potently suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Thus, the Raf-Akt cross-talk apparently takes place after immediate and strong activation of Akt, which phosphorylates Raf and thereby negatively controls the activity of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to allow proliferation. Interestingly also stimulation with low doses of IGF-I (10 ng/ml) allowed MCF-7 cells to proliferate (see Fig. 1). However, low IGF-I induced a rather low activation of Raf-1 kinase activity (1.5- to 2-fold), which was independent of LY294002 when assayed in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.3B). Low IGF-I concentration did not induce detectable above basal phosphorylation of Ser-259, and not unexpectedly LY294002 did not affect this level either (Fig.3A). By using the same phosphorylation-specific antibodies as above, ERK and Akt activation were also measured at low doses of IGF-I (Fig.3C). In contrast to the findings with high doses of IGF-I, we observed a much lower phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 with a peak at 5–10 min, which was inhibited by LY294002 during early time points (3–30 min). This paradox has been detected before (31Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 39Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Kranitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and several explanations have been postulated. In agreement with others, we conclude, that PI3K must play several distinct roles in the regulation of the ERK pathway, both positive or negative. We show here that this can depend on the strength of the incoming signal (see also Ref.31Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In keeping with previous findings, we show that low doses of mitogen do not trigger the Raf-Akt cross-talk via phosphorylation of Ser-259 and that in a weakly stimulated Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway the PI3K-Akt pathway has no inhibitory effect on the Raf-1 kinase, i.e.there is no cross-talk. After having established that the cross-talk depended on the ligand concentrations, we addressed the question of ligand specificity and the biological outcome. In contrast to exposure to proliferation-inducing IGF-I, MCF-7 cells, which were treated with phorbol esters such as PMA, underwent growth arrest (Fig. 1) driven at least in part by an ERK-dependent induction of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21cip1 (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 37Chen D. Heath V. O'Garra A. Johnston J. McMahon M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar). PMA (100 ng/ml) induced some phosphorylation of Ser-259 on Raf-1 (Fig.4A) over various exposure periods. Importantly, the absence or presence of LY294002 did not significantly alter the degree of phosphorylation suggesting that PI3K-Akt was not involved. Likewise, LY294002 did not significantly influence the Raf-1 kinase nor ERK activity (Fig. 4, B and C). As has been shown in various cell systems before, PMA strongly stimulated the Raf-1 kinase activity (4- to 5-fold) (Fig.4B) and persisted at a high level for up to 90 min (data not shown). Inhibition of PI3K-Akt by LY294002 had no influence on the PMA-mediated Raf-1 kinase activation. This finding differed from the results obtained by stimulation with high doses of IGF-I (Fig. 2, B and C). The ERK activation reached a very high level immediately after PMA stimulation and was sustained over all time points measured (Fig.4C). These results confirm former findings stating that PMA is a strong inducer of ERK activity (39Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Kranitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PMA treatment also led to some activation of Akt, however, delayed and even reduced when compared with low doses of IGF-I. Our results further showed that PMA-induced activation of Akt occurred via PI3K, because it was completely suppressed by LY294002. Yet the inhibitor had no significant influence on Raf-1 or the ERK activity, demonstrating that a cross-talk between Akt and Raf-1 did not take place during PMA-induced growth arrest. Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways have been previously analyzed after stimulation with two different ligands, IGF-I and PMA, on one single cell type (MCF-7) (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Moreover, two different cellular stages of muscle cell differentiation (C2C12 cells) were analyzed in another study (22Rommel C. Clarke B.A. Zimmermann S. Nuñez L. Rossman R. Reid K. Moelling K. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1738-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and a third investigation probed again two different ligands, platelet-derived growth factor and thrombin, on neonatal vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells (23Reusch H.P. Zimmermann S. Schaefer M. Paul M. Moelling K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33630-336377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). From these results, we concluded that a cross-talk between Akt and Raf depends on the type of ligand and the cellular background or stage of differentiation. In MCF-7 cells high Raf activity induced cellular growth arrest by activating a cell-cycle inhibitor p21cip1. Similarly, high Raf activity correlated with differentiation of VSM cells, where a biphasic ERK activity was induced. In contrast, high Raf kinase activity was expressed in undifferentiated proliferating myoblasts. Our results show that the Raf-Akt cross-talk is regulated in a concentration- and ligand-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells. A possible explanation for the mechanism of this regulation is provided by the kinetics of activation of the two pathways. High doses of mitogenic stimuli activate Akt in a fast and sufficiently strong way to down-regulate the Raf kinase activity (Figs. 2 and5A). Here, spatial factors like co-localization of the two kinases may play an important role because both are recruited to the plasma membrane already early during activation (13Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 40Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 41Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Because Raf kinase activation and recruitment to the plasma membrane occur at slightly later time points than that of Akt, Akt can counteract the Raf-1 kinase activation by directly phosphorylating its Ser-259, which inhibits the Raf-1 kinase and thereby prevents induction of cell-cycle inhibitors (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Thus, under these conditions the Raf-Akt cross-talk prevents ERK-dependent growth arrest and shifts the biological response toward proliferation. Low doses of mitogen cause a lower activity of Raf-1 and the ERK kinase activities, and the cross-talk does not take place. In this case, the Akt activation is delayed but strong enough to cause an albeit slower proliferation (Fig. 1). Because no cross-talk occurs, we postulate that the observed Akt activation is not potent enough to inhibit Raf-1 (Figs. 3 and 5B). Under these circumstances the Raf activation may not have been sufficient to induce cell-cycle inhibitors in an ERK-dependent manner. PMA, a purely growth-arresting stimulus of MCF-7 cells, causes a dramatic difference in the kinetics of Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt activities (Figs. 4 and 5C). Because Akt is only poorly activated it is not able to down-regulate the Raf-1 kinase activity and does not counteract the induction of cell-cycle inhibitors such as p21cip1, which was induced by PMA within 30 min and is expressed for at least 3 days as was shown for MCF-7 cells previously (21Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). This appears to be a prerequisite for differentiation of MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, the growth-arrested MCF-7 cells do not undergo apoptosis in the presence of differentiation-inducing ligands such as PMA. This may be due to the weak activation of PI3K/Akt and its weak anti-apoptotic potential. A similar situation is also observed in T-lymphocytes where protein kinase C activation also mediates survival through activation of PI3K in the absence of IL-2 for example (42Gomez J. de la Hera A. Silva A. Pitton C. Garcia A. Rebello A. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). These instances, however, seem to be dependent on the cell type, because Akt activation by phorbol esters is not observed in other cell lines such as NIH3T3, COS7, or HEK293 cells (15Andjelkovic M. Maira S.M. Cron P. Parker P.J. Hemmings B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).2 The influence of PI3K on ERK activity is complex. Our findings indicate a dependence on concentration, ligand type, and time course. At high insulin concentrations the ERK activity is increased by inhibition of PI3K-Akt due to the Raf-Akt cross-talk. Yet PI3K can also have the opposite effect, namely inhibition of ERK activity by LY294002 (37Chen D. Heath V. O'Garra A. Johnston J. McMahon M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar,38Sanchez-Margalet V Goldfine I.D. Vlahos C.J. Sung C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated here as well, however, only at later time points when the ERK activity is becoming weaker (Fig.5A, 60and 90 min). The weak ERK activity under low IGF-I conditions also exhibits such a paradox, a reduction of ERK activity by LY294002 is shown in Figs. 3C and 5B with no cross-talk and no influence on the Raf-1 kinase by LY294002 (Fig. 3, A and B). This would imply a previously postulated “permissive” influence of PI3K on ERK, which has also been observed by others (31Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 39Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T. Armstrong E.A. Abraham R.T. Kranitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7002-7010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 44Jun T. Gjoerup O. Roberts T.M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 13: PE1Google Scholar). PI3K may lead to ERK activation through Rac or PAK and by low or intermediate growth factor concentrations that activate ERK by Ras-Raf independent pathways (31Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). This would imply a positive influence of PI3K on downstream effectors of the Raf-1 kinase, a phenomenon that has also been detected by others (45Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells have also been studied with regard to signal transduction to the nucleus. The convergence of various signaling pathways on diverse transcriptional activators may contribute to the broad spectrum of cellular responses depending on the cell type. Not only is the balance between Akt- and Raf-dependent signal transduction pathways relevant for the cellular response, additional signaling arms may have to be considered as well. One of them is the IκB-NF-κB-mediated pathway, which leads to repression of gene expression following stimulation with phorbol esters (46Rippe R.A. Schrum L.W. Stefanovic B. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, matrix attachment may lead to signaling effects via an integrin-induced pathway, which can contribute to ERK phosphorylation (45Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that ligand-type, ligand concentration, intensity of signaling, and time courses contribute to Akt-Raf cross-talks possibly converging at the level of spatial proximity of the two kinases. Such antagonistic pathways may have evolved to ensure survival of cells and to protect them from a hyperactive, apoptosis-inducing Raf-1. Even retroviruses have evolved their own mechanism to down-tune Raf-1 kinase activity to ensure cell survival by fusion to gag, which results in a low specific activity of the kinase (47Lovric J. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1109-1116PubMed Google Scholar). The excellent technical assistance of A. Schauerte is gratefully acknowledged. We thank Dr. J.

The nonphosphorylated forms of the FOXO homologs of DAF-16 localize to the nucleus of mammalian cells where they function as transcription factors. The phosphorylation of FOXO proteins on two or three serine or threonine residues by Akt, however, promotes their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in their exclusion from the nucleus and in consequent inhibition of target gene transcription (16Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Anat. 2000; 197: 571-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that FOXO family members might regulate mammalian genes that contribute to the cellular response to stress. To study the functional properties of the FOXO family, we have generated cell lines in which the expression of a constitutively active form of mouse AFX (AFX-TM) that is resistant to phosphorylation by Akt is inducible. In the present study, we have discovered that oxidative stress, FOXOs, and GADD45 are linked. Our results indicate that FOXOs play a key role in the regulation of G2 checkpoint in response to oxidative stress. Mouse AFX and FKHRL1 cDNAs were kindly provided by T. Furuyama. FLAG epitope was attached to the NH2 terminus of AFX or FKHRL. The cDNAs for AFX-TM and FKHRL1-TM, in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites of AFX (Thr32, Ser187, and Ser252) and FKHRL1 (Thr32, Ser252, and Ser314) are mutated to alanine, were generated with the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pCAGGS and pCXN2 (17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by J. Miyazaki. The pCXP plasmid was created by ligating a fragment of the puromycin resistance gene from pPGK-puro into pCAGGS. The plasmid pBS246-EGFP1 was constructed by inserting a fragment of the EGFP-poly(A) gene from pIRES-EGFP (CLONTECH) into pBS246 (Invitrogen). The plasmid pCXP-Lox-EGFP was generated by inserting a fragment of LoxP-EGFP-pA-LoxP from pBS246-EGFP into pCXP. The cDNA for FLAG-tagged AFX-TM was subcloned into pCXP-Lox-EGFP to generate pCXP-Lox-EGFP-AFX-TM. The GADD45 promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids were kindly provided by T. Sakai (18Takahashi S.

C2C12 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. C2C12 cells were transfected with linearized pCXP-Lox-EGFP-AFX-TM and selected with puromycin (1.5 μg ml−1), and then two EGFP-expressing cell lines, C2C12-AFX-TM-7−19 and C2C12-AFX-TM-7−15, were obtained. The adenoviruses Ax-CANCre and Axlw1, which encode Cre recombinase (Ad-cre) and represent the corresponding empty virus (Ad-control), respectively, were obtained from RIKEN. The Ad-p27 virus, which encodes mouse p27Kip1, was kindly provided by K. Nakayama. Cells were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were treated with H2O2 at the indicated concentrations for 1 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then cultured for the indicated times. Cells were labeled for 30 min with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), fixed with 70% ethanol, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to BrdUrd (BD PharMingen), and counterstained with propidium iodide. The cellular content of DNA was determined by flow cytometry with a FACScalibur instrument, and data were analyzed with CELL Quest software (BD PharMingen). For DNA chip analysis, total RNA was extracted from cells infected with Ad-cre or Ad-control at 0, 24, 36, and 48 h after infection by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was subjected to in vitrotranscription in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics) and was hybridized to oligonucleotide arrays (Murine Genome U74A, U74B, and U74C; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Fluorescence intensities were captured with a laser confocal scanner (Hewlett-Packard) and were analyzed with the Microarray Suite Version 4.0 software (Affymetrix). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and subjected to hybridization with32P-labeled AFX or GADD45 cDNA probes. Cells were lysed in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1× Complete Mini (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After boiling for 5 min, the cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the FLAG epitope (Sigma), to GADD45 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or to α-tubulin (Sigma). Cells were transfected with variousGADD45 reporter plasmids (18Takahashi S. Saito S. Ohtani N. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1187-1195PubMed Google Scholar) together with phRG-TK (Promega) and expression vectors for AFX, AFX-TM, FKHRL1, or FKHRL1-TM. Cell lysates were then prepared and assayed for luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega); transfection efficiency was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity derived from phRG-TK. The C2C12-AFX-TM cells, in which the expression of AFX-TM is inducible, was infected with Ad-cre to induce AFX-TM (Fig.1A). Both AFX-TM mRNA and protein were detected 24 h after infection with Ad-cre but not after infection with Ad-control (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Induction of AFX-TM expression resulted in marked inhibition of cell growth (Fig. 1C), and flow cytometric analysis revealed that cell cycle progression was blocked at G1 and G2-M phases (Fig. 1D). The observation that phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10 was reduced in AFX-TM-expressing cells is indicative of cell cycle arrest in G2 (data not shown). Given that forced expression of AFX-TM induces p27Kip1 expression (19Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), we investigated whether p27Kip1 was responsible for the G2 arrest of cells expressing AFX-TM. Despite the marked accumulation of p27Kip1 apparent in C2C12 cells infected with Ad-p27, these cells did not arrest in G2 (data not shown), suggesting that other factors are responsible for G2 arrest of AFX-TM-expressing cells. To search for endogenous genes whose expression might be affected by the induction of AFX-TM, we subjected total RNA isolated from C2C12-AFX-TM cells at various times after infection with Ad-cre or Ad-control to hybridization with high density mouse oligonucleotide arrays. The abundance of AFX mRNA itself exhibited a 10-fold increase 24 h after infection with Ad-cre. Stress-inducible genes such as those for GADD45 (growth arrest- and DNAdamage-inducible protein, the mRNA for which showed a 4-fold increase in abundance), PA26 (20Velasco-Miguel S. Buckbinder L.

We selected GADD45 for further investigation because this gene is implicated in inhibition of cell growth, G2-M arrest, and DNA repair (22Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D. Khan M.A. Kontny H.U., Yu, L.

Northern and immunoblot analyses confirmed that the amounts of GADD45 mRNA and protein, respectively, were markedly increased in C2C12-AFX-TM cells as a result of infection with Ad-cre but not in response to infection with Ad-control (Fig. 2,A and B). We examined the promoter region of human GADD45 for DNA sequences similar to consensus binding motifs of FOXO family members (28Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Two putative binding motifs were identified at positions −1114 and −507 relative to the transcription initiation site. To determine whether AFX promotes transcription of GADD45, we subjected C2C12 cells to transient transfection both with a luciferase reporter plasmid (18Takahashi S. Saito S. Ohtani N. Sakai T. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1187-1195PubMed Google Scholar), pG45-1326, which contains nucleotides −1326 to +289 of the humanGADD45 promoter region, as well as with various FOXO expression plasmids. Ectopic expression of wild-type AFX (AFX-WT), AFX-TM, FKHRL1-WT, or FKHRL1-TM resulted in marked increases in luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). AFX-WT or AFX-TM also induced marked increases in luciferase activity in C2C12 or HeLa cells transfected with the reporter plasmid pG45-817, which contains only one of the putative FOXO binding motifs (that at position −507); however, luciferase expression from pG45-234, which lacks both putative FOXO binding motifs, was relatively little affected by AFX-WT or AFX-TM (Fig. 2, D and E). These results thus suggest that the putative FOXO binding motif at position −507 is important for activation of the GADD45 promoter by FOXO family members. To verify this observation, we mutated the FOXO binding motif at position −507 in pG45-817, thereby generating pG45-817-m, and introduced the mutant plasmid into C2C12 or HeLa cells. Mutation of this site resulted in inhibition of the activation of the GADD45 promoter induced by AFX-WT or AFX-TM in both cell lines (Fig. 2, Dand E). To evaluate the relationship between oxidative stress and FOXO family members in mammalian cells, we investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on GADD45 promoter activity in HeLa cells transiently transfected with pG45-817 or pG45-817-m. Exposure of cells to H2O2 resulted in a dose-dependent induction of luciferase activity in cells transfected with pG45-817, and this effect was less pronounced in cells transfected with pG45-817-m (Fig.3A), suggesting that oxidative stress activates GADD45 transcription and that this effect is mediated by FOXO proteins. We next investigated whether oxidative stress induces expression of endogenous GADD45 in C2C12 and HeLa cells. Exposure of either cell line to H2O2 resulted in marked increases in the amounts of both GADD45 mRNA (data not shown) and protein (Fig. 3,B and C). Given that p53 is inactivated by the human papillomavirus E6 protein in HeLa cells, these results indicate that oxidative stress increases the expression of GADD45 by a FOXO-dependent, but p53-independent, pathway. Our data showing that AFX-TM induces G2 arrest (Fig. 1) and the previous observation that GADD45 induces G2 arrest by interacting with and inhibiting the kinase activity of Cdc2 (22Wang X.W. Zhan Q.

Determination of the cell cycle profile of C2C12 cells after exposure to H2O2 indeed revealed that oxidative stress induced arrest of the cells in G2-M (Fig. 3, Dand E). Our data demonstrate that members of the FOXO family of transcription factors function in the regulation of stress-inducible genes, such as GADD45, by oxidative stress. DAF-16 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to certain types of oxidative stress in C. elegans (29Henderson S.T. Johnson T.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1975-1980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress might therefore also result in the nuclear localization of FOXO family members and thereby trigger the activation of stress-inducible genes such as GADD45. GADD45 participates in the cellular response to DNA damage, including activation of a cell cycle checkpoint (22Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D. Khan M.A. Kontny H.U., Yu, L. Hollander M.C.

Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We have now shown that oxidative stress induces the expression ofGADD45 through the action of FOXO family members, resulting in the arrest of cell growth in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Among FOXO family members, FKHRL1 is abundant in postmitotic neurons of adult mouse brain. 2Y. Okada, K. Yoshida-Araki, N. Motoyama, and H. Sawa, unpublished data. Given that the brain is exposed to high levels of endogenously produced reactive oxygen species, the FKHRL1-mediated induction of stress-inducible genes such as GADD45 by such species might serve to protect postmitotic neurons from oxidative stress. Consistent with our data, the activation of FOXO proteins has recently been shown to contribute to cellular resistance to oxidative stress (30Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Our results thus show that one function of forkhead transcription factors, the regulation of genes that underlie stress resistance, is conserved from nematodes to mammals."

Loss of either of the passengers inner centromere protein (INCENP) or the Aurora B kinase results in chromosome segregation defects and failures in cytokinesis. Furthermore, INCENP and Aurora B have identical localization patterns during mitosis and directly bind each other in vitro. These results led to the hypothesis that INCENP is a direct substrate of Aurora B. Here we show that theCaenorhabditis elegans Aurora B kinase AIR-2 specifically phosphorylated the C. elegans INCENP ICP-1 at two adjacent serines within the carboxyl terminus. Furthermore, the full length and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of ICP-1 stimulated AIR-2 kinase activity. This increase in AIR-2 activity required that AIR-2 phosphorylate ICP-1 because mutation of both serines in the AIR-2 phosphorylation site of ICP-1 abolished the potentiation of AIR-2 kinase activity by ICP-1. Thus, ICP-1 is directly phosphorylated by AIR-2 and functions in a positive feedback loop that regulates AIR-2 kinase activity. Since the Aurora B phosphorylation site within INCENP and the functions of INCENP and Aurora B have been conserved among eukaryotes, the feedback loop we have identified is also likely to be evolutionarily conserved.

One class of proteins that has recently been implicated in coordinating spindle mechanics is the chromosomal passenger proteins (1Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This class is composed of the inner centromeric protein INCENP1 (2Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Eckley D.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the unidentified autoimmune antigen TD-60 (3Andreassen P.R. Palmer D.K. Wener M.H. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 523-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Aurora B kinase (4Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the inhibitor-of-apoptosis repeat-containing protein Survivin/BIR-1 (5Uren A.G. Wong L. Pakusch M. Fowler K.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Passenger proteins have been grouped together based upon their shared subcellular localization; they associate with centromeres at metaphase, move to the central spindle microtubules at or just prior to anaphase, and remain at the cytokinesis remnant at the completion of telophase (1Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins are strategically positioned during mitotic progression to play important roles in regulating mitotic spindle dynamics. We are therefore interested in determining the specific function of chromosomal passenger proteins. INCENP was first identified through a screen of monoclonal antibodies that were raised against chromosome-associated proteins fractionated from chicken cell extracts (7Cooke C.A. Heck M.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2053-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies with INCENP antibodies revealed the dynamic translocation of INCENP from metaphase chromosomes to the central spindle microtubules at anaphase. Expression of various INCENP truncation constructs in tissue culture cells delineated specific domains of INCENP that are required for its association with microtubules, chromosomes, centromeres, and the central spindle (2Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Eckley D.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A function for INCENP was first revealed by studies showing that expression of a mutant INCENP that is unable to bind microtubules prevents proper chromosome alignment and inhibits the completion of cytokinesis in tissue culture cells (2Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Eckley D.M. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice homozygous for a null allele of the murine INCENP orthologue die very early in development due to defects in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (8Cutts S.M. Fowler K.J. Kile B.T. Hii L.L. O'Dowd R.A. Hudson D.F. Saffery R. Kalitsis P. Earle E. Choo K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1145-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Depletion of the Caenorhabditis elegans andDrosophila INCENP orthologues by RNA interference again led to defects in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (9Kaitna S. Mendoza M. Jantsch-Plunger V. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Alignment of INCENP homologues from a variety of species identified a conserved region at the carboxyl terminus, the IN box, which is also found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sli15, an essential protein that is required for proper chromosome segregation in budding yeast (9Kaitna S. Mendoza M. Jantsch-Plunger V. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Kim J.H. Kang J.S. Chan C.S. J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1075-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that INCENP is required for chromosome congression at metaphase, for chromosome segregation at anaphase, and late in mitosis for the completion of cytokinesis. These roles are consistent with the evolutionarily conserved dynamic localization pattern of INCENP during mitosis. Loss of Aurora B kinase expression or activity leads to a phenotype similar to loss of INCENP expression in a variety of organisms. The Aurora/Ipl1 family of protein kinases consists of three subclasses, Aurora A, B, and C, that have been implicated in different aspects of mitotic spindle dynamics (1Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 13Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D.

The Aurora A kinases localize to centrosomes and are required for centrosome maturation and spindle stability (15Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H.

The Aurora B kinases display a localization pattern typical of chromosomal passenger proteins and are required for chromosome segregation and the completion of cytokinesis (4Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 21Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The Aurora C class is found only in mammals and localizes to the centrosomes at anaphase where it performs an unknown function (22Kimura M. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7334-7340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Importantly, both the Aurora A and B kinases are oncogenic when overexpressed and are found at elevated levels in a variety of human cancers (23Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 24Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K., Ng, L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The budding yeast Aurora kinase Ipl1 interacts both physically and genetically with Sli15, a protein that has since been recognized to be an INCENP homologue (9Kaitna S. Mendoza M. Jantsch-Plunger V. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 11Kim J.H. Kang J.S. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be highly conserved as the INCENP and Aurora B proteins from C. elegans and Drosophila have been shown to physically associate in vitro, and both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from Xenopus egg and HeLa cell extracts (9Kaitna S. Mendoza M. Jantsch-Plunger V. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 1075-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Furthermore, INCENP has been shown to be required for targeting Aurora B to metaphase chromosomes in C. elegans and Drosophila (9Kaitna S. Mendoza M. Jantsch-Plunger V. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1172-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 10Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), while further studies in Drosophila showed that Aurora B is required for the accumulation of INCENP at centromeres and for the translocation of INCENP to the central spindle at anaphase (10Adams R.R. Maiato H. Earnshaw W.C. Carmena M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 865-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The results described above suggest that INCENP may act as a targeting subunit to localize Aurora B to metaphase chromosomes (12Adams R.R. Wheatleya S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M. Smythe C. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1075-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recently it was found that the Ipl1 kinase binds to and phosphorylates Sli15 at the carboxyl terminus, a region of the protein that contains the highly conserved IN box (25Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of Sli15 and Ipl1 produces an increase in Ipl1 kinase activity toward other substrates (25Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of the Aurora B-INCENP interaction, at least in part, may be to potentiate Aurora B kinase activity. We therefore chose to explore whether this mechanism is evolutionary conserved and identify whether phosphorylation of INCENP by Aurora B affects the ability of INCENP to potentiate Aurora B kinase activity. Construction of GST-AIR-2 has been described previously (26Rogers E. Bishop J.D. Waddle J.A. Schumacher J.M. Lin R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). GST-AIR-1 was created by PCR amplification of the AIR-1 coding region from a C. elegans cDNA library. The PCR product was cloned into pCR II-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX 6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-ICP-1 was created by PCR amplification of the C. eleganscDNA yk329a11. The PCR product was cloned into pCR II-TOPO and then subcloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX 6P-1. GST-ICP-1M and -C were similarly created by PCR amplification from the same cDNA, cloned into pCR II-TOPO, and subcloned intoBamHI/NotI-digested pGEX 6P-1. GST-ICP-1N was created by double digesting GST-ICP-1 withBamHI/AvaI, gel-purifying the resulting 715-bp fragment containing the first 238 codons of ICP-1, and ligating the fragment into BamHI/XhoI-digested pGEX 6P-1. All site-directed mutants were created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis at the indicated codons by a method described elsewhere (26Rogers E. Bishop J.D. Waddle J.A. Schumacher J.M. Lin R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLys S by overnight induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. 15 ml of bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 700 μl of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 40 mm HEPES, 0.2% Triton-X-100, pH 7.6) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and briefly sonicated on ice. The sonicates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were added to 10 μl of glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated on ice for 2 h. The beads were thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6 and resuspended in 30 μl of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm glutathione). Kinase reactions were performed at room temperature for 10 min in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 nm ATP, 30 μCi (3 Ci/μmol) of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) with ∼100 ng of GST-AIR-2, 100 ng of GST-AIR-2ts, or 100 ng of GST-AIR-1 with 20 ng of GST-ICP-1, and/or 100 ng of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) in a total volume of 15 μl. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 7 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose. Radioactive phosphate incorporation was visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Protein loading was determined by staining membranes with Ponceau S and/or probing with ICP-1- and AIR-2-specific antibodies. The AIR-2 antibody has been previously described (4Schumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and the ICP-1 antibody will be described elsewhere. 2J. D. Bishop and J. M. Schumacher, unpublished data. To determine whether the C. elegans INCENP ICP-1 is an in vitro substrate of the C. elegansAurora B kinase AIR-2, we tested the ability of recombinant GST-AIR-2 to phosphorylate recombinant GST-ICP-1 in vitro. We have previously demonstrated that purified bacterially expressed GST-AIR-2 is active in vitro as it undergoes autophosphorylation and can specifically phosphorylate the meiotic cohesin REC-8 (26Rogers E. Bishop J.D. Waddle J.A. Schumacher J.M. Lin R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, the GST-AIR-2 kinase underwent autophosphorylation and could phosphorylate the generic substrate MBP (Fig. 1, lane 1). The kinase activity was specific to GST-AIR-2 and not caused by a contaminating bacterial activity as preparations of a kinase-inactive GST-AIR-2 mutant corresponding to the in vivo mutationor207ts (27Severson A.F. Hamill D.J. Carter J.C. Schumacher J.M. Bowerman B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1162-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (GST-AIR-2ts) did not autophosphorylate and had no activity toward MBP (Fig. 1, lane 2). Purified GST-ICP-1 alone, or in the presence of GST-AIR-2ts, similarly exhibited no phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 6). However, in the presence of GST-AIR-2, GST-ICP-1 became strongly phosphorylated (Fig. 1, lane 5). To determine whether ICP-1 is a specific substrate of the AIR-2 kinase, we asked whether GST-ICP-1 could also be phosphorylated by a GST fusion protein corresponding to the C. elegans Aurora A kinase AIR-1 (18Schumacher J.M. Ashcroft N. Donovan P.J. Golden A. Development. 1998; 125: 4391-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although GST-AIR-1 was able to undergo autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate MBP (Fig. 1,lane 3), the AIR-1 kinase did not phosphorylate GST-ICP-1 (Fig. 1, lane 7). ICP-1 is therefore a specific in vitro substrate of the AIR-2 kinase. To determine the AIR-2 phosphorylation site in GST-ICP-1, we created three GST fusion proteins consisting of approximately the amino-terminal third (ICP-1N, residues 1–238), middle third (ICP-1M, residues 209–456), and carboxyl-terminal third (ICP-1C, residues 414–622) of ICP-1 (Fig.2 A). GST-ICP-1C was strongly phosphorylated by GST-AIR-2, whereas GST-ICP-1N was weakly phosphorylated, and phosphorylation of GST-ICP-1M was not detectable (Fig. 2 B). The observed phosphorylation was specific as none of the proteins were phosphorylated by GST-AIR-2ts. Therefore, GST-ICP-1 is phosphorylated by GST-AIR-2 most strongly at residues within the carboxyl-terminal fragment; however, the amino-terminal fragment also contains at least one site that is weakly phosphorylated by GST-AIR-2. Within ICP-1C there are several serine and threonine residues that are potential AIR-2 phosphorylation sites, including several highly conserved serines in the IN box (Fig.3 A). Site-directed mutagenesis of serines 598 and 599 to alanines significantly diminished the phosphorylation of GST-ICP-1C (Fig. 3 B). Ser-598 and Ser-599 appear to be additively phosphorylated as each single mutant was phosphorylated less strongly than GST-ICP-1C but more strongly than the double mutant ICP-1C (S598A/S599A). Mutation of these same residues in the full-length GST-ICP-1 protein revealed that these sites are also responsible for the majority of phosphate incorporation as GST ICP-1 (S598A/S599A) was significantly less phosphorylated by GST-AIR-2 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). The remaining signal is likely to be a result of phosphorylation at residues in the amino terminus as seen with GST-ICP-1N. Thus, serines 598 and 599 appear to be the primary sites through which the AIR-2 kinase specifically phosphorylates ICP-1.Figure 4Wild-type GST-ICP-1 and GST-ICP-1C, but not the S598A/S599A mutants, stimulate GST-AIR-2 kinase activity.

Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the ability to augment Aurora B kinase activity is evolutionarily conserved between yeast and nematode INCENPs. The effect of GST-ICP-1 on GST-AIR-2 activity was measured by assessing the level of GST-AIR-2-mediated MBP phosphorylation in the presence and absence of GST-ICP-1. GST-ICP-1 significantly increased MBP phosphorylation by GST-AIR-2 (Fig. 4,A, lanes 2 and 3, and B); however, it did not increase MBP phosphorylation by GST-AIR-1 (Fig.4 A, lanes 9 and 10). To determine the specific domain of ICP-1 that is required for the enhancement of AIR-2 kinase activity, we tested the ability of the GST-ICP-1N, -M, and -C fragments to stimulate GST-AIR-2 phosphorylation of MBP. Addition of GST-ICP-1C resulted in a significant increase in GST-AIR-2 activity, whereas GST-ICP-1N and GST-ICP-1M did not (Fig. 4,A, lanes 2 and 5–7, andB). Since the ICP-1C domain contains the primary AIR-2 phosphorylation site (Ser-598 and Ser-599), we asked whether these residues were necessary for ICP-1-mediated enhancement of AIR-2 kinase activity. Neither GST-ICP-1 (S598A/S599A) nor GST-ICP-1C (S598A/S599A) was able to stimulate GST-AIR-2 phosphorylation of MBP above base-line levels (Fig. 4, A, lanes 4 and 8, andB). These results suggest that ICP-1 must be phosphorylated by AIR-2 for ICP-1 to enhance AIR-2 kinase activity. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that metazoan INCENPs are specific substrates of Aurora B kinases. Furthermore, we have identified residues within C. elegansINCENP that are phosphorylated by C. elegans Aurora B. Although the majority of the INCENP primary amino acid sequence is divergent, the Aurora B phosphorylation site is highly conserved across a range of species. This suggests that this site is critically important for INCENP function. The data presented here confirm and extend previous results from budding yeast (25Kang J. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 763-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that C. elegansINCENP has the ability to up-regulate the kinase activity of Aurora B and that the conserved IN box domain in the carboxyl terminus of INCENP is necessary for this effect. This stimulation is specific for Aurora B as the C. elegans Aurora A kinase was not stimulated by ICP-1. Furthermore, we show that the ability of INCENP to augment Aurora B activity is dependent on the presence of phosphorylated serine residues within the IN box. The simplest conclusion from these data is that phosphorylation of these residues by the Aurora B kinase is required for INCENP to stimulate Aurora B kinase activity. However, it is formally possible that the serine to alanine mutations perturb the folding or function of GST-ICP-1 in a manner unrelated to phosphorylation at these sites. However, when these critical serines were mutated individually, the resulting proteins retained an ability to stimulate AIR-2 kinase activity at a level that is intermediate between GST-ICP-1 and the serine double mutant (data not shown). These results correlate the level of ICP-1 phosphorylation with the level of AIR-2 stimulation, supporting the conclusion that loss of phosphorylation, rather than an overall folding problem, is responsible for the inability of GST-ICP-1 (S598A/S599A) to stimulate AIR-2 kinase activity. The mechanism by which phosphorylated INCENP up-regulates the Aurora B kinase remains to be determined. It will be interesting to address whether Aurora B activity is increased toward a large number of substrates or only a small subset. As INCENP appears to act as a targeting subunit for Aurora B it will be important to determine whether serines 598 and 599 are also required for the localization of the Aurora B kinase in vivo.

Proteins to be targeted into the nucleus usually contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which interact with importin α. Importin α binds to importin β, which docks the protein complex to nuclear pores, and the complex translocates into the nucleus. Here we show that baculovirus-produced and -activated STAT1 homodimers and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers directly interacted with importin α5 (NPI-1). This interaction was very stable and was dependent on lysines 410 and 413 of STAT1. Only STAT dimers that had two intact NLS elements, one in each monomer, were able to bind to importin α5. STAT-importin α5 complexes apparently consisted of two STAT and two importin α molecules. STAT NLS-dependent colocalization of importin α5 with STAT1 or STAT2 was seen in the nucleus of transfected cells. γ-Activated sequence DNA elements efficiently inhibited STAT binding to importin α5 suggesting that the DNA and importin α binding sites are close to each other in STAT dimers.

Presently seven mammalian STAT proteins have been described. Binding of cytokines to their specific cell surface receptors leads to the activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway (1Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R.

Activated JAKs in turn tyrosine-phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 at Tyr-701 and Tyr-690, respectively, which results in dimerization and nuclear translocation of STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. In the nucleus STATs interact with IRF-9/p48 protein to form ISGF3 complexes, which bind to well conserved interferon-stimulated response elements in the promoter regions of IFN-α/β-responsive genes and activate transcription (5Fu X.-Y.

Binding of type II IFN (IFN-γ) to its receptor leads to the activation of JAK1 and JAK2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (also at Tyr-701). Activated STAT1 forms homodimers, which translocate into the nucleus and bind to GAS elements and activate transcription of IFN-γ-inducible genes (1Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3383) Google Scholar, 2Stark G.R.

Although the structure-function relationships of STATs have been carefully analyzed, the mechanisms of nuclear import of this important group of transcription factors have remained less well characterized. Recently we and others have shown that STAT1 and STAT2 have an arginine/lysine-rich nuclear localization signal (NLS) that mediates their nuclear translocation in dimeric complexes (9Melén K.

Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Proteins to be imported into the nucleus usually contain a mono- or bipartite basic-type NLS, which binds to a specific NLS receptor, importin α (12Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J.

The N-terminal importin β binding (IBB) domain of importin α interacts with importin β (15Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), which mediates the docking of NLS-containing cargo-importin α/β complex to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore, and the complex translocates into the nucleus (16Görlich D.

IFN-γ-induced nuclear import of STAT1 has been suggested to be dependent on one importin α subtype, importin α5 (20Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and the RanGTPase (21Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31017-31020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the elements that regulate STAT-importin α5 interactions have remained elusive. In the present work we show, by using a baculovirus-reconstituted STAT activation system, that homodimeric STAT1 or heterodimeric STAT1-STAT2 complexes directly interact with importin α5. The interaction of STAT dimers with importin α is very stable and is dependent on NLS situated in the DNA binding domain of STATs. The STAT-importin α5 complex consists of two importin α and two STAT molecules. STAT-binding GAS oligonucleotides efficiently prevent the binding of dimeric STATs with importin α. We also demonstrate by confocal microscopy that wild type STATs colocalize with importin α, whereas NLS-mutated STATs do not. Monolayers and suspension cultures ofSpodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells that were used for baculovirus expression were maintained in TNM-FH medium as described previously (22Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex.

Human Tyk2 cDNA in baculovirus expression plasmid pVL1392 was kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Pellegrini (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France). Recombinant Tyk2 baculovirus was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells (22Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn.

Influenza A (PR8) virus NP gene was inserted into the BamHI site of pAcYM1 expression plasmid, and recombinant viruses were obtained by plaque purification as described previously (22Summers M.D. Smith G.E.

Influenza A virus NP was produced similarly. Virus-infected Sf9 cells were collected, and whole cell extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer) on ice for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by passing them through a syringe. Cell extracts were clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min). Human importin α5 and human importin β were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins in BL21 cells under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Bacteria were lysed in IP buffer with 5 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, briefly sonicated, and clarified by Eppendorf centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 5 min). Bacterial cell extracts containing GST-importin proteins were allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose for 60 min at +4 °C in IP buffer followed by washing two times. Baculovirus cell extracts containing STATs or influenza A NP were allowed to bind to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin α5 or GST-importin β for 2 h at +4 °C in IP buffer followed by washing three times with IP buffer. To study the stability of STAT-importin α5 complexes high NaCl or urea concentrations were used in the washing buffers. Sepharose beads were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore, Bedford, MA) followed by staining with primary and secondary antibodies (9Melén K.

To study whether the GAS DNA element was able to inhibit STAT binding to importin α, increasing amounts (from 40 ng to 5 μg) of IRF-1 GAS (5′-GATCTCAGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGACGGCA) or NF-κB consensus (5′-GATCCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT) oligonucleotides were preincubated (30 min at room temperature) with cell extracts containing activated STAT1 proteins followed by STAT1 binding to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin α5. Sepharose-importin α5-bound proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells or E. coli lysates were gel filtrated in the above lysis buffer using a 24-ml Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) (AmershamBiosciences) gel filtration column. To study STAT-importin α5 complex formation STAT protein-containing baculovirus cell extracts were mixed with E. coli cell extracts containing GST-importin α5. Proteins in gel filtration fractions were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters followed by staining with anti-GST, anti-STAT1, anti-phospho-STAT1, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as described above. To estimate the relative amounts of STAT and importin α5 proteins in STAT1/STAT2-importin α5 complexes, the proteins in gel filtration fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Quantitation of Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands was carried out with the Kodak electrophoresis documentation and analysis system 120. The MW-GF-200 kit for molecular weights (Sigma) was used as gel filtration markers. HuH7 cells were grown on glass coverslips or transfected with importin α and wt or mutant FLAG-STAT1- or FLAG-STAT2 pCDNA 3.1(+) gene constructs (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At 48 h after the transfection the cells were treated with human leukocyte IFN-α (1000 IU/ml; Ref. 28Cantell K. Hirvonen S. Kauppinen H.-L. Myllylä G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 78: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) for 30 min. Cells were fixed and stained as described previously (29Melén K. Keskinen P. Ronni T. Sareneva T. Lounatmaa K. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23478-23486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-phospho(tyrosine)-STAT1, anti-STAT2 (monoclonal anti-FLAG), and rabbit anti-importin α5 antibodies and FITC- and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells positive for STAT or importin α5 protein were visualized on a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. To study possible interactions of wild type or NLS-mutated STATs with importins we used a baculovirus expression system to reconstitute the STAT activation system. We created a Tyk2 baculovirus construct that was found to express Tyk2 protein in relatively high levels. Coinfection of Sf9 cells with recombinant Tyk2 baculovirus and STAT1, STAT2, or NLS mutant STAT1 protein-expressing baculoviruses resulted in efficient expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of wt STAT1, wt STAT2, and STAT1 K410A,K413A proteins, whereas the STAT1 Y701A mutant protein completely lacked tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Tyrosine-phosphorylated wt STAT1 or STAT1 K410A,K413A formed dimers (result not shown and Ref. 9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which enabled us to analyze potential interactions of dimeric STAT complexes with importins. IFN-induced nuclear import of STAT1 has been suggested to be mediated by importin α5 (20Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We recently proposed that STAT proteins have a well conserved arginine/lysine-rich NLS in their DNA binding domain that regulates their nuclear import (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To study whether this element is involved in direct binding of STATs to importins in vitro we carried out binding experiments with E. coli-produced GST-importin fusion proteins and baculovirus-expressed STAT proteins. Wt or mutant STAT baculovirus constructs were expressed alone or together with Tyk2 baculovirus construct, cell extracts were prepared, and STATs were allowed to bind to glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-importin α5 followed by identification of importin α5-bound STATs by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. wt STAT1 homodimers or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers bound strongly to importin α5 (Fig.2). STAT1 Y701A protein (monomeric), STAT1 NLS-mutated homodimeric STAT1 K410A,K413A, or heterodimeric STAT1 K410A,K413A-STAT2 complexes completely failed to bind to importin α5 (Fig. 2). Tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT2 was also devoid of importin α5 binding activity suggesting that STAT2 can only dimerize with STAT1. No binding of STATs to importin β was seen (see Fig. 7 and results not shown).FIG. 7Inhibition of STAT1 dimer binding to importin α5 by IRF-1 GAS oligonucleotides.Sf9 cell extracts containing activated STAT1 dimers were preincubated with different amounts of IRF-1 GAS oligonucleotide (from 40 ng to 5 μg) for 30 min followed by binding to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin α5 (GST-imp-α5) in the presence of the same amount of IRF-1 GAS DNA. Consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide was used as control DNA. Plain Sepharose (S) and Sepharose-importin β (GST-imp-β) beads were used as control beads. Sepharose-bound proteins were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and stained in Western blotting with anti-phospho(tyrosine)-STAT1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the stability of STAT-importin α5 complex we washed Sepharose-bound importin α-STAT complexes with buffers containing high concentrations of NaCl or urea. Some reduction in the amounts of importin α5-bound STAT1 or STAT1/STAT2 dimers was seen after washing with 1 or 2 m NaCl, whereas 2 m urea was not able to disrupt the STAT-importin α complex (Fig.3). In higher urea concentrations Sepharose-bound STATs were released, but apparently this was due to the release of GST-importin α fusion protein from the resin (Fig. 3). Influenza A virus NP that is known to bind to importin α5 (26O'Neil R.E. Palese P. Virology. 1995; 206: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control in binding stability experiments. Biochemical evidence suggested that STAT1 binding to importin α5 takes place via lysine residues at positions 410 and 413 of the STAT1 protein. To study whether the arginine/lysine-rich NLS of STAT1 or STAT2 regulates STAT interactions with importin α5 also in cultured cells we carried out colocalization experiments with transfected STAT and importin α5 gene constructs. We used confocal laser microscopy to analyze the colocalization of wt and NLS-mutated STATs in transfected human HuH7 hepatoma cells. In transiently transfected and IFN-α-treated (1000 IU/ml, 45 min) cells tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 clearly colocalized with STAT2 in the cell nucleus (Fig. 4). When nuclear import-defective STAT1 K410A,K413A or STAT2 R409A,K415A were cotransfected with heterologous wt STAT gene constructs no IFN-α-induced nuclear accumulation of STATs was seen. However, mutant and wt STAT forms colocalized in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 4) suggesting that STAT1 and STAT2 directly interact with each other. The data indicates that NLS-defective STAT1 functions as a dominant negative for nuclear import of wt STAT2 and vice versa. Next we transfected HuH7 cells with importin α5 and wt or NLS-mutated STAT gene constructs. Transfected cells were treated with IFN-α for 45 min, and the cells were fixed and stained with STAT- and importin α5-specific antibodies. wt STAT1 or STAT2 was found to colocalize with importin α5 especially in the cell nucleus. Such a colocalization was not observed between importin α5 and NLS-mutated STAT1 K410A,K413A proteins (Fig. 5) suggesting that STAT1-importin α5 interaction is mediated by lysines 410 and 413 of STAT1 also in living cells. Similar results were observed with NLS-mutated STAT2 R409A,K415A protein. While in IFN-α-stimulated cells wt STAT2 was transported into the nucleus with intrinsic STAT1, the NLS-mutated STAT2 was not (Fig. 5). As shown above we have demonstrated that dimeric STATs bind to importin α5 in an NLS-dependent manner (Fig. 2). To estimate the molecular size and protein composition of importin α5-STAT complexes we carried out comigration experiments using gel filtration. We mixed Tyk2-activated STAT cell extracts with E. coli-produced importin α5 and analyzed the migration pattern of these complexes by FPLC using a Superose 12 gel filtration column. First GST-importin α5 (by itself) was subjected to gel filtration analysis, and it was found in fractions corresponding to 70–90-kDa proteins (Fig. 6A) indicating that importin α existed as a monomer. Unphosphorylated STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 dimers eluted in the range of 90 and 160–200 kDa, respectively (Fig. 6A). To estimate the size of importin α5-STAT1/STAT2 complex we allowed phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 dimers to bind to Sepharose-immobilized GST-importin α5 followed by washing and elution of the proteins from the resin by glutathione. Purified importin α5-STAT1/STAT2 complex was analyzed by gel filtration, and it was found to elute in fractions corresponding to 300–350-kDa proteins. These fractions contained all three proteins (Fig. 6B). Based on gel filtration analysis it is difficult to precisely estimate the molecular size (and thus the composition) of importin α5-STAT1/STAT2 complexes. Therefore, we analyzed the protein composition of gel filtration fractions corresponding to the major peak (at 300–350 kDa) of importin α5-STAT1/STAT2 complex by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Since the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining is in relation to the amount of the protein in gel we directly quantitated the STAT1, STAT2, and GST-importin α5 protein-specific bands. In the importin α5-STAT1/STAT2 complex the relative amounts of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins were equal, whereas the complex contained twice as much GST-importin α5 compared with each of the STAT proteins (Fig. 6C). This suggests that the complex is composed of two STAT molecules (STAT1 and STAT2) and two importin α5 molecules. Based on structural and experimental data the functional NLS of STAT1 is situated immediately adjacent to the STAT1 DNA binding site (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that STAT1-specific GAS DNA elements would compete with the binding of STAT complexes to importin α. Preincubation of activated STAT1 with different concentrations of GAS oligonucleotide clearly inhibited the binding of STAT1 dimers to Sepharose-immobilized importin α5. Consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide that was used as a control DNA did not inhibit STAT1 binding to importin α5 (Fig.7). In the present work we have demonstrated that activated STAT dimers are able to directly bind to two importin α5 (NPI-1) molecules with relatively high affinity. STAT1-importin α5 interaction was regulated by dimerization of STATs and by a lysine-rich element in the DNA binding domain of STAT1 since the mutation of lysines 410 and 413 to alanines completely abolished STAT1 binding to importin α5. By confocal laser microscopy we also found that in IFN-α-stimulated cells STAT1 and STAT2 colocalized with importin α5 in the cell nucleus. Consistent with biochemical analysis NLS-mutated STAT1 or STAT2 failed to show colocalization with importin α5. In addition, we observed that STAT1-specific GAS oligonucleotide was able to inhibit STAT1-importin α interaction suggesting that STAT1 binding sites to importin α5 or target DNA elements are very close to each other. It is well established that STATs have to undergo cytokine receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation by JAKs and dimerization via phosphotyrosine residues and Src homology 2 domains of each of the monomers before nuclear translocation can take place (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. William B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar, 31Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell J.E., Jr. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The key regulatory event controlling the nuclear import of STATs appears to be dimerization (32Mowen K. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Milocco L. Haslam J. Rosen J. Seidel M. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) demonstrated that importin α5 interacted with activated STATs, but in their work specific STAT NLSs were not identified. Now we know more of the details of the regulation of nuclear import and export of STATs. Mutational analyses revealed that lysines 410 and 413 of STAT1 and corresponding basic residues of STAT2 regulate IFN-induced nuclear import of STAT1 homodimers and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Meyer T. Begitt A. Lodige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Several groups have also shown IFN-independent nuclear localization of STAT1, which appears to occur constitutively and by a different mechanism than that of IFN-induced import of STAT1 (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Meyer T. Begitt A. Lodige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4111-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of STAT1 is regulated by CMR1/exportin 1 protein, which binds to a DNA-free form of STAT1 via a leucine-rich consensus-like nuclear export signal situated at positions 400–409 of STAT1 (35McBride K.M. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6196-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is of great interest that the STAT1 nuclear export signal is in the immediate vicinity of its NLS residing at positions 410–413 (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 35McBride K.M. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6196-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the STAT1 nuclear export signal may also interfere with STAT1-importin α5 interaction (36McBride K.M. Banninger G. McDonald C. Reich N.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the present work previous cell biological observations (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Meyer T. Begitt A. Lodige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were extended to a biochemical level. For these studies we chose to use the baculovirus expression system since it has been shown to efficiently produce biologically active components of the JAK-STAT pathway (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthun B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here we show that importin α5 can directly bind to STAT1 homodimers or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers evidently with a relatively high affinity since even high molar concentrations of NaCl or urea are not able to disrupt the interaction of STAT dimers with importin α. We also show that no binding of monomeric STAT1 to importin α5 is taking place. In addition, neither monomeric nor dimeric STAT bind to importin β. This suggests that IFN-induced nuclear import of STAT1 homodimers or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation-triggered dimerization of STATs followed by efficient and direct binding of STAT dimers to two importin α5 molecules. In our experiments the key residues regulating importin α5-STAT dimer interaction were lysines 410 and 413 of STAT1, which apparently mediate direct interaction between dimeric STAT complexes and importin α5. Some signaling proteins, such as Smads, can directly interact with importin β, which mediates their translocation into the nucleus (38Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,39Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Importin β is a snail-like molecule that has a narrow canyon that functions as the binding pocket for the helical arginine/lysine-rich N-terminal domain (IBB) of importin α (15Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The NLS of STATs is situated on the surface of the DNA binding domain (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and therefore it is hard to vision that this element could mediate direct binding of STATs to importin β. The three-dimensional structures of STAT3 and STAT4 are very similar to that of STAT1 (40Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar,41Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell J.E., Jr. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and it is thus likely that the other members of the STAT family use the same importin α-mediated nuclear import pathway. Gel filtration experiments show that the nuclear import complex of STATs is composed of two STAT molecules attached to two importin α5 molecules. Importin α5 alone was found to exist as a monomer (Fig.6), but in the presence of STAT dimers it formed complexes that migrated in the 300–350-kDa range in gel filtration analysis. Coomassie Blue staining and quantitation of the protein composition of these complexes indicated that STAT1/STAT2 dimers bound to two importin α5 molecules. Dimeric STAT binding to two importin α5 molecules may represent a previously uncharacterized type of interaction between nuclearly targeted molecules and importin α. Based on the three-dimensional structure of mouse importin α or karyopherin α, a yeast homolog of importin α, the molecule has two binding sites that bind classical NLS peptides (e.g. SV40 T-antigen NLS). The overall structure of importin α/karyopherin α includes well conserved armadillo (arm) repeats that mediate NLS binding (42Conti E., Uy, M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 43Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Arm repeats 2–4 form the major NLS binding site, whereas arm repeats 7 and 8 form the minor binding site. The major binding site (arm 2–4) also functions as the binding site for the autoinhibitory N-terminal IBB domain of importin α (44Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 45Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) suggested, based on extensive deletion analysis, that neither of the NLS binding sites functions as the binding site for STAT1, but rather it is the C-terminal end of importin α5 that regulates STAT1-importin α5 interaction. To reveal the question of STAT binding site(s) in importin α5 a more fine-tuned mutational analysis should be carried out. Alternatively, a three-dimensional structural analysis of the STAT-importin α complex should be obtained. In our previous study we observed that the nuclear import-defective STAT1 K410A,K413A mutant was also defective in its DNA binding activity to GAS or interferon-stimulated response elements (9Melén K. Kinnunen L. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16447-16455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This prompted us to study whether GAS oligonucleotides would be able to interfere with STAT-importin α5 interaction. We observed that high concentrations of GAS DNA was able to almost completely inhibit STAT1 dimer binding to importin α5. This suggests that STAT1 binding to importin α5 or target DNA occurs at sites that are very close to each other. In the present work we have taken a clear step forward in understanding the mechanisms of nuclear import of STATs. We have evidence that dimeric STAT complexes interact with two importin α5 molecules via a lysine-rich conformation NLS within the STAT1 DNA binding domain. However, it still remains an open question why only STAT dimers are able to bind to importin α5 and which of the NLS binding sites of importin α5 are involved in this interaction. We thank Drs. S. Pellegrini, M. Malim, and P. Palese for Tyk2, GST-importin α5/NPI-1, and GST-importin β and -importin α5 (NPI-1) gene constructs, respectively. We thank M. Yliselä and T.

https://openalex.org/W2016126865,"We evaluated the hypothesis of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c being a general mediator of the transcriptional effects of insulin, with a focus on adipocytes, in which insulin profoundly influences specific gene expression. Using real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR to monitor changes in the expression of about 50 genes that cover a wide range of adipocyte functions, we have compared the impact of insulin treatment with that of adenoviral overexpression of either dominant positive or dominant negative SREBP-1c mutants in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As expected, insulin up-regulated, dominant positive stimulated, and dominant negative decreased previously characterized direct SREBP targets (FAS, SCD-1, and low density lipoprotein receptor). We also identified three novel SREBP-1c transcriptional targets in adipocytes, which were confirmed by run-on assays: plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ), and C/EBPβ. Because most insulin-regulated genes were also modulated by SREBP-1c mutants, our data establish that 1) SREBP-1c is an important mediator of insulin transcriptional effects in adipocytes, and 2) C/EBPβ is under the direct control of SREBP-1c, as demonstrated by the ability of SREBP-1c to activate the transcription from C/EBPβ promoter through canonical SREBP binding sites. Thus, some of the effects of insulin and/or SREBP-1c in mature fat cells might require C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ as transcriptional relays.

Insulin is the main anabolic hormone in mammals and exerts its effects in liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal and cardiac muscle via the insulin receptor (for a review, see Ref. 1Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The cellular mechanism underlying its action on carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism has been the center of major interest for many years. Active research has led to the identification of the major steps of the insulin signal transduction pathway. These include a family of soluble scaffolding molecules, known as insulin receptor substrates, which initiate downstream signaling cascades involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 1Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar and 2Whitehead J.P. Clark S.F. Urso B. James D.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this cascade, rapid changes in the state of protein phosphorylation ultimately mediate many important actions of insulin (e.g. glucose transport, glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and antilipolysis). It is also well known that, alongside these rapid nongenomic effects, important changes in gene expression play critical roles in insulin action in insulin-sensitive tissues (3O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The transcriptional effects of insulin and the mechanisms by which insulin can relay signal to the nucleus have remained largely unknown until recently. As described (4Flier J.S. Hollenberg A.N.

A. 1999; 96: 14191-14192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), new light was shed by the identification of SREBP-1c 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; Ad, adenovirus; MOI, multiplicity of infection (i.e. plaque-forming units per cell); DN, dominant negative; DP, dominant positive; SRE, sterol-regulatory element; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKB, protein kinase B; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor. 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol-regulatory element-binding protein; Ad, adenovirus; MOI, multiplicity of infection (i.e. plaque-forming units per cell); DN, dominant negative; DP, dominant positive; SRE, sterol-regulatory element; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKB, protein kinase B; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor. as a transcription factor capable of mediating some of the effects of the hormone on previously identified insulin target genes. Indeed, SREBP-1c was shown not only to regulate the expression of key genes of glucose, fatty acid, and triglyceride metabolism in fibroblasts, adipocytes, hepatocytes, and the livers of transgenic mice (5Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 7Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) but also to be able to substitute to insulin in inducing transcription of known insulin target genes like glucokinase or FAS in hepatocytes (8Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c is particularly abundant in the adipose tissue and the liver, both of which are insulin-sensitive and display quite a restricted expression pattern compared with the ubiquitously expressed SREBP-2, the other SREBP isoform that is encoded by a separate gene (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). In agreement with their distinct expression pattern and regulation, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 can also be distinguished in vivo by their ability to target different genes. Indeed, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 assume different functions, SREBP-2 being more selective for activating genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 10Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), whereas SREBP-1c actions are focused on lipid synthesis and glucose metabolism. From these studies, SREBP-1c thus appears as a strong candidate to be a general mediator of the metabolic actions of insulin via the regulation of gene expression. The aim of the present study was to document further this hypothesis with a focus on adipocytes, in which specific gene expression is profoundly influenced by insulin. In the context of the adipose cell, several transcription factors that play interconnected roles ultimately determine the fully differentiated adipocyte gene expression profile. Among these factors is SREBP-1c, known also as ADD-1 (foradipocyte determination anddifferentiation factor-1 (11Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar)), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family of transcription factors. Other important adipocyte transcriptional regulators include the fatty acid derivative-activated nuclear receptor zinc finger peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and several members of the basic leucine zipper family of CAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) (reviewed in Ref. 12Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, when induced by appropriate stimuli, can initiate a transcriptional cascade that culminates in the induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα and the activation of the adipogenic program. In this study, we have used mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes to investigate the impact of the overexpression of mutant SREBP-1c isoforms, either dominant positive or dominant negative, on a panel of 50 adipocyte-specific genes. The latter were selected to cover a number of aspects of key fat cell functions such as lipid storage, lipolysis, glucose metabolism, energy expenditure, adipocyte-gene transcription factors, and adipocyte-derived secreted products. Our results show that genes that were up-regulated by the dominant positive and down-regulated by dominant negative SREBP-1c forms were also up-regulated by insulin, confirming that SREBP-1c is a major factor underlying the transcriptional effect of insulin. Moreover, we found out that SREBP-1c specifically mediated insulin action on some adipocyte genes, such as PAI-1, and the β and δ C/EBP isoforms, which were known as insulin-sensitive but previously unrecognized as SREBP-1c targets. Finally, we provide evidence that SREBP-1c can directly transactivate the C/EBPβ promoter through canonical SREBP binding sites. Moreover, those sites map the insulin response region of the C/EBPβ promoter. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of an insulin-SREBP-1c-C/EBPβ axis in adipocytes and suggests that a transcriptional cascade might be initiated by SREBP-1c to mediate insulin effects on fully differentiated adipocyte gene regulation. The adenovirus vector containing the transcriptionally active dominant positive (DP) amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1–403) of rat SREBP-1c, Ad.SREBP-1c DP, was constructed as previously described (8Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) with homologous recombination in BJ5183 bacteria using the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (13He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus containing the dominant negative form of rat SREBP-1c, Ad.SREBP-1c DN, was described elsewhere (14Boizard M., Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Both Ad.SREBP-1c DP and Ad.SREBP-1c DN were under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The adenovirus vector containing the major late promoter with no exogenous gene (Ad.null) was used as control. The adenoviral vectors were propagated in the HEK 293 cell line, purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C until use. The efficiency of infection in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was assessed by visualizing GFP expression using a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E800, Nikon). Measurements of SREBP target gene expression were also performed using various MOI (from 10 to 500) and various postinfection times from 24 to 72 h. Experiments were performed 4–6 times. Various tested conditions were Ad.SREBP-1c DP with no insulin; Ad.SREBP-1c DN with insulin (100 nm); Ad.null with insulin (100 nm); and Ad.null with no insulin. 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC number CL-173) were grown in 6-cm diameter dishes and differentiated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of air/CO2 (90:10, v/v) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (50 units penicillin/50 μg of streptomycin per ml of medium). Two days after reaching confluence, cells were induced into differentiation with a 2-day incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal-calf serum containing insulin (1 μg/ml), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mm) (all from Sigma). Then preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin (1 μg/ml). After 10 days, when adipocytes have accumulated numerous lipid droplets as judged by Oil Red O staining, cells were placed for 16–18 h in a defined medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1, v/v), 4.5 g/liter glucose, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, free fatty acid bovine serum albumin (5%) (Sigma), in the absence or in the presence of insulin (100 nm), and then treated for various times (24–72 h) at an MOI of 10–500 with the different recombinant adenoviruses. Total RNA was prepared as described (15Krief S. Feve B. Baude B. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. Emorine L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6664-6670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in 20 μl using random hexamers and murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The design of primers was done using either Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) or Oligo (MedProbe, Olso, Norway) software. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analyses for the genes described in Table I were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA (diluted in 5 μl of 1× Sybr Green buffer), with a 200 nm concentration of both sense and antisense primers (Genset) in a final volume of 25 μl using the Sybr Green PCR core reagents in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence is generated after laser excitation by bound Sybr Green to double-stranded DNA. Because we used Sybr Green in measurements of amplification-associated fluorescence for real time quantitative RT-PCR, it was important to verify that generated fluorescence was not overestimated by contaminations resulting from residual genomic DNA amplification (using controls without reverse transcriptase) and/or from primer dimers formation (controls with no DNA template nor reverse transcriptase). RT-PCR products were also analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose to ensure that a single amplicon of the expected size was indeed obtained. To measure PCR efficiency, serial dilutions of reverse transcribed RNA (0.1 pg to 200 ng) were amplified, and a line was obtained by plotting cycle threshold (C T) values as a function of starting reverse transcribed RNA, the slope of which was used for efficiency calculation using the formula E = 10‖(1/slope)‖ - 1 (16PerkinElmer Life Sciences (1999) Relative Quantification of Gene Expression: Bulletin 2, Boston, MA.Google Scholar). Ribosomal 18 S RNA amplifications were used to account for variability in the initial quantities of cDNA. The relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as -fold variation over control (untreated cells), was calculated after determination of the difference between C T of the given gene A and that of the calibrator gene B (GAPDH) in treated cells (ΔC T1 = C T1A −C TB) and control cells (ΔC T0 = C T0A −C TB) using the 2 − ΔΔC T(1–0) formula (16PerkinElmer Life Sciences (1999) Relative Quantification of Gene Expression: Bulletin 2, Boston, MA.Google Scholar). GAPDH expression of a control cDNA was used as interplate calibrator. Variation over controls was determined using the above-mentioned formula as follows. The effect of insulin was calculated by comparing meanC T values obtained in the Ad.null with insulin condition and that obtained in the Ad.null with no insulin condition; the effect of Ad.SREBP-1c DP by comparing Ad.SREBP-1c DP with no insulin and the Ad.null with no insulin conditions; and the effect of Ad.SREBP-1c DN by comparing Ad.SREBP-1c DN with insulin and the Ad.null with insulin conditions. C T values are means of triplicate measurements. Experiments were repeated 4–6 times. All primers are presented in Table I. In a given cDNA population, relative expression level between genes could be calculated based on individual C T, provided that PCR efficiencies were close to 1. The latter were calculated according to Ref. 16PerkinElmer Life Sciences (1999) Relative Quantification of Gene Expression: Bulletin 2, Boston, MA.Google Scholar and were 1.1 + 0.07 (mean ± S.E., n = 21), indicating an approximate doubling of DNA at each PCR cycle, as theoretically expected. The percentage of relative expression between several genes of a given family (e.g. for the three C/EBP isoforms) was calculated as follows; mean C T of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ in the absence of insulin were 24.9, 22.24, and 30.31, respectively. Using the 2 − ΔC Tformula, these could be expressed as two equations (C/EBPβ = 6.32 × C/EBPα and C/EBPβ = 268 × C/EBPδ) plus another equation as C/EBPα + C/EBPβ + C/EBPδ = 100. It could thus be calculated that the percentage expression of the C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ isoforms was 13.6, 86.1, and 0.3%, respectively.Table IPrimer sequences of the selected genes involved in key pathways of adipose metabolismThe abbreviations of the genes, full name, accession number or locus, corresponding primer numbers, and 5′ to 3′ nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers are presented. Open table in a new tab The abbreviations of the genes, full name, accession number or locus, corresponding primer numbers, and 5′ to 3′ nucleotide sequences of the sense and antisense primers are presented. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were treated with insulin or were infected with the adenovirus encoding the DP SREBP-1c mutant. After 24 h, nuclei were prepared as previously described (17Lacasa D. Le L., X Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11512-11516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and were incubated with [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 45 min at 32 °C. Incubations were terminated by the addition of RNase-free DNase and proteinase K, and labeled RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform. Labeled transcripts were hybridized for 72 h with plasmid cDNA immobilized on nylon membranes. Blots were washed to high stringency, and hybridized RNA was quantified with an optical scanner (Storm 860;Amersham Biosciences). A 1.4-kb promoter fragment of the rat C/EBPβ gene, cloned in front of the luciferase reporter in the p19-Luc vector, has been described elsewhere (18Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From this construct, a series of 5′ deletions was derived, encompassing regions from −441 to +16, −183 to +16, and −136 to +16 relative to the transcription start site. Point mutations on sterol-regulatory element (SRE) sites in the 1.4-kb promoter fragment were introduced using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. The sequences of the mutagenic primers were 5′-GGGCGGAGGTCGTACCAGCTCAGCAfor the SRE1 site located at −1124 and 5′-AAGGTTGAGCAACGTACCACCAGCTTGCC for the SRE2 at −1064. In both cases, the disruption of the SRE motif was performed by replacing the ACC triplet by GTA as underlined in the sequences. Growing 3T3L1 preadipocytes in 60-mm dishes were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, with a mixture of plasmid DNA containing 1 μg of a promoter luciferase construct, 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase as an internal standard, and 50 ng of pSV Sport1-ADD1 expression vector encoding an active form of the rat SREBP-1c transcription factor (19Kim J.B. Spotts G. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 15: 2582-2588Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was kept constant in each experiment by adding empty pSV Sport1 when necessary. Reporter gene activities were assayed 24 h after transfection, and luciferase data were normalized to galactosidase. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were placed in serum-free medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin and no insulin for 24 h and transfected by electroporation as described previously for mature adipocytes (20Rolland V. Dugail I., Le Liepvre X. Lavau M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 × 106 cells in 200 μl were shocked electrically in the presence of 20 μg of promoter luciferase constructs and 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase internal control. Cells were then replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml insulin. Reporter gene activities were measured after 24 h. Nuclear extracts were obtained from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes as described previously (20Rolland V. Dugail I., Le Liepvre X. Lavau M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and used for Western blotting with a commercially available antibody against C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For statistical analyses of real time RT-PCR experiments, results for a given gene were expressed as differences from the mean C T value obtained in the Ad.Null with no insulin condition. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls comparison tests (Statistica, StatSoft Inc.). In transfection experiments, statistical differences were assessed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered as the threshold of statistical significance. As a first step to study the impact of changes in SREBP-1c content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and its potential correlation with insulin-induced gene expression profile, we assessed the ability of insulin to modulate endogenous SREBPs expression in these cells. In agreement with initial studies (21Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), we observed a stimulatory effect of insulin on SREBP-1c mRNA, increasing its levels by 3-fold (Fig.1 A). The effect of insulin was restricted to the SREBP-1c isoform, with no change in SREBP-1a or SREBP-2. Similar results were obtained in livers of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (7Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and in cultured hepatocytes (22Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C., Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, insulin specifically targets SREBP-1c in adipocytes. It remains to be determined whether the isoform-specific effect of the hormone equally occurs in adipose in vivo and in other insulin-sensitive tissues (i.e. skeletal, cardiac muscle, and brown fat). Having shown that insulin stimulated SREBP-1c, we examined the conditions to achieve optimal expression of SREBP-1c mutants (DP or DN forms) following adenoviral infection of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. First, using Ad.SREBP-1c DP, which co-expresses GFP, optimal conditions for transduction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with recombinant adenoviruses were assessed. After 24 h, nearly 100% of GFP-expressing adipocytes was achieved with an MOI of 500 (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). Second, the steady state levels of SREBP-1 mRNA were monitored by real time RT-PCR using primers designed to differentially target endogenous SREBP-1c, endogenous SREBP-1a, or total SREBP-1 expression (including endogenous as well as adenovirus-mediated DN or DP mutant forms of SREBP-1c; see Table I for primer sequences). Ad.Null was used as control and exerted no effects on gene expression, whatever the MOI (not shown). Fig. 1 B shows that the infection of adipocytes with increasing titers of adenoviruses encoding mutant forms of SREBP-1c (either dominant negative or positive) produced, as expected, a dose-dependent increase in total SREBP-1 mRNA expression, demonstrating significant transgene expression in adipocytes. Because we observed that the endogenous expressions of SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c were not altered by Ad.SREBP-1c DP or DN (Fig. 1 B), the increase in total SREBP-1 observed following adenovirus infection was solely accounted for by an increase in the expression of the transgene. As shown in Fig.1 B, total SREBP-1 expression increased by ∼15-fold in cells infected with the Ad.SREBP-1c DP (MOI of 500) and was stimulated to a similar extent (∼10-fold) using the same titer of Ad.SREBP-1c DN. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-SREBP-1 antibody that showed a huge increase in SREBP transgene protein content in nuclear extracts prepared from cells infected with Ad.SREBP-1c DP (data not shown). To ensure that SREBP-mediated transcriptional activity was significantly altered in adipocytes infected with the adenoviruses encoding the DP or DN SREBP-1c mutants, we measured the steady state levels of known SREBP target genes such as FAS (5Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 14Boizard M., Le Liepvre X. Lemarchand P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Dugail I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and LDL receptor (25Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A., Wu, J. Hua X.X. Goldstein J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that increasing titers of Ad.SREBP-1c DP mutant dose-dependently stimulated the expression of FAS, SCD-1, and LDL receptor genes (left panel). The induction of FAS, SCD-1, and LDL receptor gene expression started at 10–100 plaque-forming units/cell, and a plateau was reached after 250, the 500 plaque-forming units/cell condition being optimal. The mRNAs encoding FAS and SCD-1 were increased with higher efficiencies (up to 10-fold) than that of the LDL receptor, which was stimulated only 3-fold. This agreed well with the ability of SREBP-1c to stimulate lipogenesis in preference to cholesterol uptake in vivo (26Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pai J.T. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32379-32382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In reciprocal experiments, cells were infected with increasing titers of Ad.SREBP-1c DN mutant (Fig. 1 C, right panel). We observed, as expected, a gradual decline in the steady state levels of FAS, SCD-1, and LDL receptor mRNAs. The observed changes in DN-expressing cells were of lesser magnitude than those in cells expressing the DP form. Since the dominant negative mutant inhibits SREBP-1c transcriptional activity by titrating endogenous SREBP-1c into inactive heterodimers (5Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), it is possible that Ad DN expression might not reach sufficient levels to completely inhibit endogenous SREBP-1c. Alternatively, because transcriptional activation of these genes requires in addition to SREBP other transcription factors such as NFY or Sp1 (24Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 28Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), it remained plausible that the presence of these untitrated factors or that of other co-activators allows sufficient residual transcriptional activity, thus obviating total inhibition of transcription. Taken together, all these results establish that SREBP-1c transcriptional activity can be efficiently manipulated in 3T3-L1 cells by means of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of dominant positive or negative SREBP-1c mutants. The 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocyte cell system was used to compare the effects of insulin with that of SREBP-1c manipulations on the expression of various adipocyte genes. Specific primers were designed for real time fluorescent RT-PCR analyses of a panel of genes that covers a wide range of fat cell functions,i.e. lipid storage or lipolysis,"

Here we compared three NOSoxy isozymes regarding dimer strength, interface composition, and the ability ofl-Arg and H4B to stabilize the dimer, promote its formation, and protect it from proteolysis.

Dimer strengths of the full-length NOSs had the same rank order as judged by their urea-induced loss of NO synthesis activity. NOSoxy dimers containingl-Arg plus H4B exhibited the greatest resistance to urea-induced dissociation followed by those containing either molecule and then by those containing neither. Analysis of crystallographic structures of eNOSoxy and iNOSoxy dimers showed more intersubunit contacts and buried surface area in the dimer interface of eNOSoxy than iNOSoxy, thus revealing a potential basis for their different stabilities. l-Arg plus H4B promoted dimerization of urea-generated iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy monomers, which otherwise was minimal in their absence, and also protected both dimers against trypsin proteolysis. In these respects, l-Arg alone was more effective than H4B alone for nNOSoxy, whereas for iNOSoxy the converse was true. The eNOSoxy dimer was insensitive to proteolysis under all conditions. Our results indicate that the three NOS isozymes, despite their general structural similarity, differ markedly in their strengths, interfaces, and in how l-Arg and H4B influence their formation and stability. These distinguishing features may provide a basis for selective control and likely help to regulate each NOS in its particular biologic milieu.

Our results indicate that the three NOS isozymes, despite their general structural similarity, differ markedly in their strengths, interfaces, and in how l-Arg and H4B influence their formation and stability. These distinguishing features may provide a basis for selective control and likely help to regulate each NOS in its particular biologic milieu. nitric-oxide synthase NOS oxygenase domain neuronal NOS inducible NOS endothelial NOS 6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin calmodulin 4-(2-hydoxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol Nω-hydroxyarginine The free radical nitric oxide (NO) drives important physiologic and patho-physiologic functions in animals and is produced by a family of enzymes termed nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs)1 (1Colasanti M.

The 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) cofactor interacts with residues in both subunits of the dimer and also hydrogen bonds to the active site heme.

To address these issues, we compared iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS proteins expressed and purified from bacteria regarding their dimer strengths, dimer interfaces, and responses toward l-Arg and H4B in stabilizing the dimer, promoting dimer formation, or in protecting the dimer against proteolysis. Our report helps clarify how each NOS differs in these respects and discusses potential structural and biologic origins for the differences. Ultrapure urea was obtained from Aldrich. All other supplies were of highest purity grade available and from sources previously reported (23Ghosh D.K., Wu, C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J.

Bovine eNOSoxy was obtained by limited trypsin hydrolysis of pure bovine eNOS protein as detailed before (57Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

This method cleaves eNOS at a point between its oxygenase domain and CaM binding sequence. In all cases, enzyme concentration was determined from the 444-nm absorbance of the ferrous-CO complex using an extinction coefficient of 76 mm−1cm−1. All purified proteins were checked for their purity by gel electrophoresis. NOSoxy or full-length NOS were incubated at 15 °C for 2.5 h in 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 3 mm DTT and the indicated concentrations of urea (0–7 M) in a final volume of 100 μl. Heme concentrations of the treated holo-NOS proteins in the incubation system ranged from 6 to 10 μm. In studies monitoring spectral change of urea-treated proteins over time, the whole incubation was performed in a cuvette at a final volume of 300 μl. To measure the activity of NOSoxy proteins, their nitrite production from NOHA in a H2O2-supported reaction was assayed in 96 micro-well plates at 37 °C as has been previously described (29Panda K. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures (100-μl final volume) contained 60 mmEPPS, pH 7.6, 150–300 nm NOSoxy heme, 1 mmNOHA, 1 mm DTT, 30 mmH2O2, 25 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 μm H4B. The reactions were initiated by the addition of NOHA and H2O2 and stopped after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C by the addition of 1300 units of catalase. Finally, 100 ml of Greiss reagent was added into each well, and the absorbance was recorded at 550 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader. The amount of nitrite formed was determined based on NaNO2standards. Activities of full-length NOS proteins were determined in NADPH-driven NO synthesis assays using the oxyhemoglobin detection method as detailed before (29Panda K. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

NOS reductase domain activity was determined by measuring NADPH-dependent cytochromec reduction by the CaM-bound NOS enzymes as described before (55Abu-Soud H.M. Loftus M. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11167-11175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Spectral data were recorded on a Hitachi U3110 Spectrophotometer. Samples were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a 30 × 10-cm Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 HR column. The column was equilibrated with 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol, 3 mm DTT, and 150–250 mm NaCl. Protein in the column effluent was detected at 280 nm using a flow-through UV detector. Molecular mass was estimated based on elution profiles of protein standards. Typically, two copies of the gel filtration profiles were made, and the overlapping dimer and monomer peaks were cut out separately from each copy and weighed on a microbalance. The weights of the peaks were used as direct measures of their areas and used to determine the dimer:monomer ratios. NOSoxy monomers were prepared by incubating the as-isolated proteins (120–150 μm) with urea at concentrations ranging from 3 to 5m for 2.5 h at 15 °C as described before (29Panda K. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The samples were then diluted 10-fold with 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, containing 10% glycerol and 2 mm DTT. Diluted protein samples were then incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature in the absence or presence of l-Arg (10 mm) and/or H4B (100 μm). NOSoxy protein samples were incubated overnight on ice in the absence or presence ofl-Arg (10 mm) and/or H4B (100 μm). They then were treated with 10 μg of trypsin for 5 min and then immediately boiled in 20 μl of gel sample buffer containing 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue and then subjected to SDS-PAGE at a constant current of 20 mA on 1-mm slab gels using Protean II apparatus from Bio-Rad. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue R-250. The apparent Mr of the proteins and their trypsin-generated fragments were calculated on the basis of Bio-Rad pre-stained SDS-PAGE standards. N-terminal sequencing of proteins excised from the gel was done at the Cleveland Clinic core facility.

We calculated solvent-accessible surface areas buried in the dimer interfaces using CCP4 (60Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A 1.4-Å probe radius was used in the surface area calculations. By using two independent methods we verified that calculated differences exceeded uncertainties inherent to either surface area calculation method. Multiple structures were analyzed for each isozyme, and these calculations verified that differences in the surface areas of the two isozymes could not be attributed to refinement and/or co-crystallization with inhibitors. We studied and compared subunit dissociation and reassociation among three NOSoxy and utilized full-length NOS dimers in a subset of experiments. We selected urea as the chaotrope for dimer dissociation because it has been used extensively to reversibly dissociate iNOSoxy and full-length iNOS into heme-containing monomer (28Ghosh D.K.

We also examined roles of l-Arg and H4B in stabilizing the three NOS dimers and in promoting reassociation of their urea-generated monomers. The three NOSoxy proteins prepared in the absence of H4B andl-Arg were incubated overnight at 4 °C with or withoutl-Arg and/or H4B before treatment with urea. Fig.1 shows their gel filtration profiles after being preincubated under the various conditions and then treated with 0, 3, and 5 m urea. It is clear that in the absence of both l-Arg and H4B the iNOSoxy and nNOSoxy dimers were highly vulnerable to subunit dissociation compared with the eNOSoxy dimer. The iNOSoxy dimer exerted the least resistance to urea-induced dissociation as it formed over 94% monomer with 3 m urea and completely dissociated with 5 m urea. This was followed by nNOSoxy, which despite undergoing some aggregation after dilution from high concentrations of urea was nearly 80% monomeric at 3m urea and almost totally monomeric at 5 murea. However, gel filtration analysis of fractions of such proteins show that a substantial part of such aggregated proteins are active with P450 spectral characteristics and not necessarily denatured. In comparison, eNOSoxy exhibited the highest resistance in that we observed 18% monomer at 3 m urea and 25% monomer at 5m urea and failed to observe a predominant monomer population even at 7 m urea (data not shown). Fig. 1 also demonstrates that coincident preincubation with l-Arg and H4B imparted the strongest resistance to urea dissociation in all three NOSoxy dimers. Thus, conditions supporting the most stable dimer interaction match those that support full enzymatic activity in the NOS isozymes. Experiments that examined the individual contribution ofl-Arg or H4B suggested that H4B was a bit more effective than l-Arg in stabilizing dimer against urea dissociation (Fig. 1). Together, the results suggest that (i) dimer stability inl-Arg and H4B-free NOSoxy dimers follows the rank order eNOS ≫ nNOS > iNOS, (ii) l-Arg and H4B together or separately increase resistance toward urea-induced subunit dissociation in all three NOSoxy, and (iii) the same rank order of dimer stabilities is maintained in the presence of"
https://openalex.org/W2043645272,"Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) is associated with heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and characterized by deafness and hypopigmentation due to lack of melanocytes in the inner ear and skin. Melanocyte-specific MITF isoform (MITF-M) is essential for melanocyte differentiation and is transcriptionally induced by Wnt signaling that is mediated by β-catenin and LEF-1. Here we show that MITF-M transactivates its own promoter (Mpromoter) by interacting with LEF-1, as judged by transient expression assays and in vitro protein-protein binding assays, whereas no transactivation of the M promoter was detected with MITF-M alone or with the combination of MITF-M and dominant-negative LEF1 that lacks the β-catenin-binding domain. This synergy depends on the three LEF-1-binding sites that are clustered in the proximalM promoter. Importantly, MITF-M recruited on the M promoter could function as a non-DNA-binding cofactor for LEF-1. Thus, MITF-M may function as a self-regulator of its own expression to maintain a threshold level of MITF-M that is required for melanocyte development. We suggest that MITF-M haploinsufficiency may impair the dosage-sensitive role of MITF-M or the correct assembly of multiple transcription factors, involving MITF-M, on the Mpromoter, which could account for dominant inheritance of WS2."

A rat CYP24 promoter containing two vitamin D response elements and an Ets-1 binding site was used to characterize the mechanism of actions for the 1,25D secosteroid hormone. The Ets-1 binding site was determined to function cooperatively with the most proximal vitamin D response element in a hormone-dependent fashion. Evidence was obtained for distinct roles of ERK1/ERK2 and ERK5 in the 1,25D-inductive actions. Specifically, 1,25D stimulated the activities of ERK1/ERK2 and ERK5 in a Ras-dependent manner. Promoter induction was inhibited by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) and a dominant-negative Ras mutant (Ras17N). Induction ofCYP24 by 1,25D was also inhibited by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of ERK1 and MEK5 (ERK1K71R and MEK5(A)). The p38 and JNK MAP kinases were not required for the action of 1,25D. 9-cis retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) interacted with ERK2 but not ERK5 in intact cells, whereas Ets-1 interacted preferentially with ERK5. Increased phosphorylation of RXRα and Ets-1 was detected in response to 1,25D. Activated ERK2 and ERK5 specifically phosphorylated RXRα and Ets-1, respectively. Mutagenesis of Ets-1 (T38A) reduced CYP24 promoter activity to levels observed with the dominant-negative MEK5(A) and inhibited ERK5-directed phosphorylation. Mutated RXRα (S260A) inhibited 1,25D-induced CYP24 promoter activity and abolished phosphorylation by activated ERK2. The 1,25D-inductive action through ERK5 involved Ets-1 phosphorylation at threonine 38, whereas hormone stimulation of ERK1/ERK2 required RXRα phosphorylation on serine 260.

The transcriptional actions of 1,25D are mediated by the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), which heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific vitamin D response element (VDRE) sites in the promoter region of vitamin D-responsive genes (5Carlberg C. Polly P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Transactivation by the liganded VDR/RXR is dependent upon the binding of one or more coactivator complexes that permit bridging to the RNA polymerase II machinery (6Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In the unliganded state, some nuclear receptors including VDR (8Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) can bind a co-repressor that inhibits transactivation (9Dwivedi P.P. Muscat G.E.O. Bailey P.J Omdahl J.L. May B.K. J.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this repressor dissociates upon ligand binding. Maintenance of cellular 1,25D levels is critical to regulation of the function of the hormone in which high levels of 1,25D are toxic and can lead to hypercalcemia and systems failure. Therefore, a highly specific hydroxylase system functions within the vitamin D pathway to tightly regulate control of 1,25D levels. The mitochondrial hydroxylases cytochromes P450C1 and P450C24 are responsible for the bioactivation and degradation of vitamin D3 metabolites, respectively (11Omdahl J.L. May B.K Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 69-85Google Scholar, 12St.-Arnaud R. Messerlian S. Moir J.M. Omdahl J.L. Glorieux F.H. J. Bone Miner.

May B.K Steroids. 2001; 66: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Genes for the hydroxylase enzymes are subject to stringent hormonal control, most notably by 1,25D, which functions to down-regulate P450C1 and up-regulate P450C24 enzyme expressions. We are studying the molecular regulation of the P450C24(CYP24) gene, which is expressed widely in different cell types with the highest activity observed in kidney (1Jones G. Strugnell S.A. DeLuca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). CYP24 is a multifunctional enzyme that directs the side-chain oxidation and cleavage of 1,25D and 25D to catabolic carboxylic acid end products (11Omdahl J.L. May B.K Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 69-85Google Scholar, 13Omdahl J.L. Bobrovnikova E.A. Choe S. Dwivedi P.P.

The action of 1,25D to induce expression of the ratCYP24 gene is mediated by two VDREs that are located about 100 bp apart within the −300-bp promoter region. The synergistic action of the tandemly arranged VDREs underlies the extraordinary high levels of induction that can be attained in response to 1,25D and represents the most active vitamin D-dependent promoter identified to date (14Hahn C.N.

The important role forP450C24 gene expression has been further demonstrated inCYP24 knockout mice in which null animals demonstrated high ambient 1,25D levels and bone mineralization defects (17St.-Arnaud R. Arabian A. Travers R. Barletta F. Raval-Pandya M. Chapin K. Depovers J. Mathieu C. Christakos S Demay M.B. Glorieux F.H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2658-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). During our studies into the molecular mechanism by which 1,25D inducesCYP24 promoter activity, we identified an Ets-1 binding site located near the proximal VDRE that is important for maximal transcriptional induction. Exogenously expressed Ets-1 stimulated vitamin D induction, and this was further enhanced by coexpression of Ras (18Dwivedi P.P. Omdahl J.L. Kola I. Hume D.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ras can elicit activation of several downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, among other signaling molecules (19Reuther G.W. Der C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Rebollo A. Martinez-A C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the present study, we have asked whether vitamin D increases the activities of MAP kinase pathways and whether these pathways impinge on the 1,25D-induced activation of theCYP24 promoter. Recent studies have indicated that 1,25D can elicit rapid responses, apparently independent of gene expression (22Falkenstein E. Tillman H.C. Christ M. Feuring M. Wehling M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 513-555PubMed Google Scholar,23Norman A.W. Feldman D. Glorieux F.H. Pike J.W. Vitamin D. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 233-256Google Scholar). These non-genomic effects include changes in ceramide/phosphoinositide metabolism and increases in intracellular calcium as well as activation of protein kinase C (24Slater S.J. Kelly M.B.

Presumably these vitamin D-dependent responses are mediated by a vitamin D receptor at the plasma membrane (25Nemere I. Schwartz Z. Pedrozo H. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1353-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), but the relationship of this putative receptor with that in the nucleus remains obscure. We provide evidence in the current study that vitamin D directs the rapid activation of the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 and ERK5. Activation of RXRα was obligatory to ERK1/ERK2, whereas ERK5 was specifically required for Ets-1 phosphorylation. Inhibition of either the ERK1/ERK2 or ERK5 modules substantially reduced vitamin D-induced transcriptional activation of the CYP24 promoter. Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of both of these modules abrogated CYP24 promoter activity induced by 1,25D, an effect that was mimicked by inhibition of Ras function. Our results emphasize the critical roles played by MAP kinase pathways in the phosphorylation of Ets-1 and RXR during the 1,25D induction process. 1,25D and 25D were purchased from Tetrionics, Inc., Madison, WI.

Dual luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined by the DLR assay kit using a luminometer model TD 20/20 (Turner Design Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Human choriocarcinoma cells, JEG-3, were cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of reporter plasmid (pG5E1b-Luc) and 50 ng of pRL-TK-Luc (transfection efficiency control) with 500 ng each of GAL4-Ets-1 or GAL4-Ets-1T38A plasmids with either VP16-TR or VP16-VDR expression plasmids using the DOTAP transfection protocol as described earlier in this section. After 24 h, medium was changed, and 1,25D was added as indicated. Cells were further cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM and then harvested for DLR assays. COS-1 cells with or without transfected HA-tagged expression constructs (confluent 10-cm dishes) were stimulated with 1,25D, H2O2, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for the times indicated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The incubations were terminated by removing the medium and washing the cells once with Hanks' buffered salts solution (4 °C). The cells were scraped and lysed in 200 μl of buffer A (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 38 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, benzamidine, aprotinin, and leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol) by constant rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Soluble fractions were collected after centrifugation (16,000 × g, 3 min, 4 °C), and the protein content of the lysates was determined by Lowry's method of protein determination. Samples were stored at −70 °C until assayed. For Western blot analysis, samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer and boiled before being stored. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (15 μl) before being incubated with anti-HA antibody (3 μg of each) to immunoprecipitate HA-ERK2, HA-ERK5, HA-RXRα, or HA-Ets-1. The antigen-antibody complexes were sedimented by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (15 μl) and centrifugation (16,000 ×g for 20 s, 4 °C). The immune complexes were washed (2 × 200 ml) with buffer A. The immune complexes were washed with assay buffer (1 × 200 μl) (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 10 mm Sigma 104, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm orthovanadate, 20 mm cold ATP), and kinase assays were started by the addition of assay buffer (30 ml) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP, GST-RXR, GST-Ets-1, His-Ets-1, or GST-VDR (10–15 μg/sample). In some assays, GST-tagged mutants of RXR or Ets-1 were used. After 20 min at 30 °C, the assays were terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer (15 ml), and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Phosphorylated substrates were fractionated on 16% (MBP) or 10% (GST-tagged proteins) SDS-PAGE gels and detected using an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments, Canberra, Australia). To determine the level of ERK1 and ERK2 dual phosphorylation, lysates containing equal amounts of denatured proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% gels). After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was probed with anti-ACTIVETM ERK antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (32Hii C.S.T. Huang Z.H. Bilney A.J. Costabile M. Murray A.W. Rathjen D.A. Der C.J. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19277-19282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The blot was stripped using a Western blot recycling kit (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, Texas) and reprobed with anti-ERK2 antibody to confirm equal protein loading between lanes. To detect co-immunoprecipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the blots were probed first with one antibody, stripped, and reprobed with another antibody as indicated under “Results.” The plasmid pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc contains −298 bp of rat CYP24 promoter sequence encompassing the two known functional VDREs and the Ets-1 protein binding site designated EBS (Fig.1). We have previously shown that Ets-1 present in nuclear extracts of COS-1 cells binds EBS, whereas exogenous Ets-1 can stimulate 1,25D induction of a truncated CYP24promoter containing only the first VDRE and the nearby EBS (18Dwivedi P.P. Omdahl J.L. Kola I. Hume D.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Initial studies were undertaken to evaluate the effect of ectopically expressed wild type Ets-1 on 1,25D induction of the −298 bpCYP24 promoter. With hormone alone, a 4.8-fold level of induction was observed, and overexpressed Ets-1 increased this to 11.2-fold (Fig.2A). Endogenous VDR is limiting in these cells, and exogenously expressed human VDR (hVDR) increased 1,25D induction to 26-fold, whereas a combination of exogenous VDR and Ets-1 further enhanced induction to 56-fold, the latter reflecting a functional cooperation of these transcription factors. When the EBS was inactivated (pCYP24mEBS(−298)-Luc), the level of induction by exogenous Ets-1 and VDR together was reduced to 14.0-fold (Fig. 2A). Ets-1 alone did not alter basal promoter activity in the absence of hormone (data not shown). A mutant form of the wild type Ets-1 protein was examined in which threonine residue 38 was mutated to alanine (Ets-1 T38A). This threonine residue is conserved in several Ets proteins, and based on other work (31Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), it is likely to be phosphorylated in a Ras-dependent fashion, although the identity of any specific MAP kinase involved is not known (33Yang B.-S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Beveren C.V. Stacy K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The 26-fold level of induction observed with exogenous VDR (Fig. 2A) was lowered to 16-fold when the mutant Ets-1 T38A was overexpressed, a value comparable with that seen when the EBS was mutated (Fig.2A). This result shows that the expressed mutant Ets-1 protein competes strongly with endogenous Ets proteins for binding to EBS but is unable to functionally cooperate with VDR·RXR complexes on either VDRE-1 or VDRE-2 in response to 1,25D. In control experiments, it was established that Ets-1 T38A did not alter basal expression of the construct (results not shown), whereas mutagenesis of both VDREs abolished 1,25D induction (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that wild type Ets-1 substantially enhance vitamin D-induced promoter activity in the presence of two VDREs and that the threonine 38 residue of Ets-1 is vital for its functional cooperation with VDR in the presence of 1,25D. Experiments were undertaken to determine whether the functional cooperation observed between exogenously expressed hVDR and Ets-1 occurred on one or both VDREs present in the CYP24 promoter. As observed already, overexpression of hVDR alone gave a 26-fold level of induction with pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc, and this was increased to 56-fold with coexpression of Ets-1 (Fig. 2B). There was no stimulatory effect of overexpressing Ets-1 when VDRE-1 was mutated (Fig. 2B); however, over-coexpression of Ets-1 and hVDR increased 1,25D induction from 7.9- to 14.9-fold when analyzed in the presence of inactive VDRE-2 (Fig. 2B). The results demonstrate that the proximity of the EBS to VDRE-1 underlies its contribution to induction. Evidence for an in vivoprotein-protein interaction between Ets-1 and VDR was achieved using the mammalian two-hybrid assay and the plasmid G5E1B-Luc as reporter (Fig. 2C). The fusion protein GAL4-Ets-1 interacted substantially with VP16-VDR but did not interact with control VP16-T3R (Fig. 2C). A similar interaction was seen with GAL4-Ets-1T38A (results not shown). VDR and wild type and mutant Ets-1 interactions were unaltered by 1,25D treatment (Fig. 2C). It is evident from these experiments that the ligand-independent interaction between Ets-1 and VDR does not require the threonine 38 residue of Ets-1. In agreement with this observation, it has been shown from in vitro pull-down experiments that a region in the DNA binding domain of VDR interacts with an Ets-1 deletion protein that lacks threonine 38 (34). We have previously shown that overexpression of H-Ras in COS-1 cells increases 1,25D induction of the CYP24 promoter construct and that this action is potentiated in the presence of the wild type but not the mutant form Ets-1 (18Dwivedi P.P. Omdahl J.L. Kola I. Hume D.A. May B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This implies that Ras plays a role in the 1,25D induction of the CYP24 promoter in COS-1 cells and that Ets-1 can positively modulate the action of Ras. To investigate the possible involvement of endogenous Ras activity, we have overexpressed an inhibitory dominant-negative rasconstruct, ras17N. Expression of Ras17N strongly reduced 1,25D induction of the pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc construct from 26- to 3.5-fold at the highest concentration tested. At these concentrations of Ras17N, there was no effect on basal expression of pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc or expression of the internal control pRL-TK-Luc described under “Experimental Procedures” (data not shown), demonstrating that Ras17N has a selective inhibitory effect on 1,25D induction. However, in the absence of Ras17N, mutagenesis of the EBS reduced 1,25D induction to 14.0-fold (Fig.3). These results not only demonstrate that Ras is essential for components of the 1,25D-responsive transcription machinery but also suggest that although the EBS is a downstream mediator site of Ras signaling, the action of Ras is also channeled through other downstream effectors. The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases are major downstream effectors of Ras. Both MAP kinases are members of a cascade of kinases that consists of the MAP kinase kinase kinase, raf-1, which phosphorylates and activates the MAP kinase kinases, MEK1/MEK2, the immediate upstream regulators of ERK1/ERK2 (20Marshall C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine whether ERK1/ERK2 are involved in the actions of 1,25D, we first investigated whether 1,25D-stimulated the activities of ERK1/ERK2 in COS-1 cells. It is evident from the data in Fig.4A that 1,25D at 10−7m rapidly increased ERK1/ERK2 dual phosphorylation and hence activity. Although increased ERK1 phosphorylation persisted for at least 30 min, ERK2 phosphorylation peaked at 5 min after the addition of 1,25D. The effect of 1,25D on ERK1/ERK2 dual phosphorylation was also observed at 10−9but not at 10−10m (Fig. 4B). The precursor, 25D, at 10−7m did not affect ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation (Fig.4B) nor induce pCYP24WT(−298)-Luc expression (data not shown) in which stimulation of MAP kinase was selective for 1,25D at a low concentration. Activation of ERK2 activity by 1,25D using myelin basic protein as a substrate was confirmed in cells that had been transfected with HA-ERK2 (Fig. 4C). Co-transfection of the cells with ras17N reduced but did not abolish 1,25D-"
https://openalex.org/W2154863348,"Bop1 is a conserved nucleolar protein involved in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly in eukaryotes. Expression of its dominant-negative mutant Bop1Δ in mouse cells blocks rRNA maturation and synthesis of large ribosomal subunits and induces a reversible, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. In this study, we have conducted a deletion analysis of Bop1 and identified a new mutant, Bop1N2, that also acts as a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Bop1N2 and Bop1Δ are C-terminal and N-terminal deletion mutants, respectively, and share only 72 amino acid residues. Both mutant proteins are localized to the nucleolus and strongly inhibit rRNA processing, suggesting that activation of a cell cycle checkpoint by Bop1 mutants is linked to their inhibitory effects on rRNA and ribosome synthesis. By using these dominant-negative mutants as well as antisense oligonucleotides to interfere with endogenous Bop1, we identified specific rRNA processing steps that require Bop1 function in mammalian cells. Our data demonstrate that Bop1 is required for proper processing at four distinct sites located within the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and the 3′ external spacer. We propose a model in which Bop1 serves as an essential factor in ribosome formation that coordinates processing of the spacer regions in pre-rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1991202400,"To determine whether reduction of insulin resistance could ameliorate fructose-induced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) oversecretion and to explore the mechanism of this effect, fructose-fed hamsters received placebo or rosiglitazone for 3 weeks. Rosiglitazone treatment led to normalization of the blunted insulin-mediated suppression of the glucose production rate and to a ∼2-fold increase in whole body insulin-mediated glucose disappearance rate (p < 0.001). Rosiglitazone ameliorated the defect in hepatocyte insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, and IRS-2 and the reduced protein mass of IRS-1 and IRS-2 induced by fructose feeding. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B levels were increased with fructose feeding and were markedly reduced by rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone treatment led to a ∼50% reduction of VLDL secretion rates (p < 0.05)in vivo and ex vivo. VLDL clearance assessed directly in vivo was not significantly different in the FR (fructose-fed + rosiglitazone-treated) versus F (fructose-fed + placebo-treated) hamsters, although there was a trend toward a lower clearance with rosiglitazone. Enhanced stability of nascent apolipoprotein B (apoB) in fructose-fed hepatocytes was evident, and rosiglitazone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in apoB stability. The increase in intracellular mass of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein seen with fructose feeding was reduced by treatment with rosiglitazone. In conclusion, improvement of hepatic insulin signaling with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist, is associated with reduced hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion due to reduced intracellular apoB stability.

Steiner G. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1996; 12: 37-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) flux from peripheral and intra-abdominal adipose tissue depots due to resistance to the insulin anti-lipolytic and esterification effect in adipose tissue is felt to play an important role in driving VLDL assembly and secretion in insulin resistant states (2Ginsberg H.N.

Nevertheless, previous studies in humans suggest that insulin also has an important direct effect on the liver in controlling VLDL secretion (5Lewis G.F. Uffelman K.D. Szeto L.W. Weller B. Steiner G.

These animal models may not, however, be ideal for the study of human lipoprotein disorders because, unlike humans, their livers secrete both apoB48 and apoB100-containing VLDL, and they do not necessarily develop VLDL oversecretion as the basis for their hypertriglyceridemia (8Hirano T. Mamo J. Poapst M. Steiner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E236-E240PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li X. Grundy S.M. Patel S.B. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1277-1288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike livers from rat or mouse, the liver of the golden Syrian hamster secretes only apoB100-containing VLDL, and its lipoprotein metabolism more closely resembles that of humans (10Taghibiglou C. Rudy D. VanIderstine S.C. Aiton A. Cavallo D. Cheung R. Adeli K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 499-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that insulin resistance in the fructose-fed golden Syrian hamster is associated with mild hypertriglyceridemia, VLDL-apoB oversecretion, increased intracellular apoB-containing lipoprotein particle stability, and increased expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (11Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The present studies were conducted to explore the effect of improving insulin sensitivity in this insulin-resistant animal model by treatment with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist and insulin sensitizer and to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of VLDL oversecretion in insulin resistant states.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and Study ProtocolsMale Syrian golden hamsters (Charles River, Quebec, Canada) were housed in pairs and given free access to food and water. After 7 days acclimatization, animals were placed on a fructose-enriched diet (hamster diet with 60% fructose, pelleted, Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA) for 5 weeks. After 2 weeks of feeding with the fructose-enriched diet, the animals were randomized to receive either rosiglitazone (20 μmol/kg/day) (GlaxoSmithKline) diluted in waterversus water only given once daily by gavage for the remaining 3 weeks of the fructose feeding period. At the end of the 5 weeks, the fructose-fed (F) and fructose-fed + rosiglitazone-treated (FR) animals underwent either one of the three in vivoprotocols described below or isolation of hepatocytes for the ex vivo protocols. In addition, some animals remained on regular chow for 5 weeks to serve as normal controls.In Vivo ProtocolsEuglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp StudiesStudies were performed as previously described (11Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Catheters were kept patent overnight with 4% heparin in normal saline (Hepalean, Organon Teknica, 1000 IU/ml). At 8:00 a.m. the morning after insertion of femoral vein and arterial catheters, a primed (10 μCi) constant (0.1 μCi/min) infusion of high performance liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was started (time, 90 min) (12Schwenk W.F. Butler P.C. Haymond M.W. Rizza R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E228-E233PubMed Google Scholar). [3-3H]Glucose was added to the 20% dextrose infusate to minimize the decline in glucose specific activity during the clamp. After 75 min of equilibration at time 0 min, a primed (80 milliunits/kg) constant insulin infusion (8 milliunits/kg/min in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in normal saline) (Humulin R, Eli Lilly, Canada) was started, and a D20% infusion was adjusted at 10-min intervals to maintain blood glucose at base-line level. Blood samples (0.25 ml) were taken from the arterial line at times 15, 0, 90, 100, 110, and 120 min of the clamp for measurement of blood glucose, [3-3H]glucose specific activity (SA), and plasma insulin levels. There was no significant decline in hematocrit throughout the study. Endogenous glucose production (Ra) was calculated as the endogenous rate of appearance measured with [3-3H]glucose using a modified one-compartment model (13Finegood D.T. Bergman R.N. Vranic M. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 914-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin-mediated glucose disappearance (ΔRd) was the rate of disappearance measured with [3-3H]glucose during the clamp minus the mean base-line Rd level. Data were smoothed with the optimal segments routine (14Finegood D.T. Bergman R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: E472-E479PubMed Google Scholar) using the optimal error algorithm (15Bradley D.C. Steil G.M. Bergman R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E902-E911PubMed Google Scholar). Because euglycemia was not maintained in one hamster of the FR group, this animal was not included in the analysis of these experiments.In Vivo VLDL Secretion StudiesOne day before these studies, catheters were inserted into the femoral vein and artery of F (n = 10) and FR animals (n = 9) of similar weight (134 ± 3 g versus 132 ± 2 g, respectively, p = 0.64) and chow-fed controls (n = 5) as previously described (11Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). VLDL-apoB and VLDL-triglyceride (TG) secretion rates were measured in the fasting state (12 h) after intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339 (Sigma) as previously described (11Taghibiglou C. Carpentier A. Rudy D. Aiton A. Lewis G.F. Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8416-8425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The total blood volume of the samples drawn was less than 1.5 ml per animal during the experiment, and there was no significant decline in hematocrit.In Vivo VLDL Clearance StudiesBecause the Triton method does not allow direct assessment of VLDL clearance, the following studies were performed after a 12-h fast in 7 F and 8 FR animals of similar weight (129 ± 6 g versus 126 ± 4 g, respectively, p = 0.68). Catheters were inserted the day before these studies into the femoral vein and artery. A bolus (20 μCi) of [2-3H]glycerol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected intravenously, and blood samples were collected at times 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 50 min after the injection to measure VLDL-TG levels and to determine the rate of decline of VLDL-TG [3-3H]glycerol SA. The fractional clearance rate of VLDL-TG (pool/min) was assessed by the slope of the natural logarithm of VLDL-TG [2-3H] glycerol SA over time, determined by linear regression over the linear portion of the down-slope, as previously described (16Lemieux S.

VLDL-TG [2-3H]glycerol SA (dpm/mg) was determined as previously described (5Lewis G.F. Uffelman K.D. Szeto L.W. Weller B. Steiner G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical AnalysisAll the values are reported as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. For the euglycemic clamp studies, two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the glucose, insulin, Ra, and ΔRd curves of the F, FR, and control chow-fed groups at base line and during the last 30 min of the clamp, and the difference between the three groups was assessed by post-hoc analysis using Scheffe test. A two-tailed unpaired homoscedastic t test was used to compare all the other quantitative parameters between F and FR hamsters and between F and control chow-fed hamsters. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.RESULTSEffect of Rosiglitazone Treatment on Body Weight, Plasma Insulin, FFA, TG, and Glucose (Table I)Because of constraints imposed by the small blood volume of the animals, not all variables were measured on each animal undergoing the various experiments. Fasting plasma insulin was significantly lower (p = 0.02) in the FR and control chow-fed group than in the F group. Total plasma TG levels tended to be lower (by ∼30%,p = 0.16) after rosiglitazone treatmentversus the fructose-fed hamsters and were identical to TG levels in the control chow-fed hamsters. All other variables were not significantly different.Table ICharacteristics of F vs. FR vs. chow-fed control hamsters (S.E.)FnFRnControlsnΔ Weight (g)34 (1)5136 (2)5230 (3)19FFA (mmol/liter)0.625 (0.061)130.550 (0.097)130.689 (0.139)9Total TG (mmol/liter)2.06 (0.36)111.40 (0.24)91.40 (0.24)9Insulin (pmol/liter)331 (38)26221 (25)1-ap < 0.05 vs.F group.

Open table in a new tab Treatment of Fructose-fed Hamsters with Rosiglitazone Ameliorates Whole-body Insulin Sensitivity and Improves Hepatocyte Insulin SignalingEuglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp StudiesPlasma glucose (Fig. 1 A) was higher in the Fversus FR animals at base line (4.4 ± 0.3versus 3.2 ± 0.2 mmol/liter, p = 0.03) and during the last 30 min of the clamp (4.0 ± 0.3 mmol/literversus 3.0 ± 0.1 mmol/liter, p < 0.001) but was kept constant by design throughout the clamp. Hamsters fed a normal chow diet had intermediate glucose levels at base line (3.7 ± 0.2 mmol/liter) and during the last 30 min of the clamp (3.4 ± 0.1 mmol/liter, p < 0.001versus the F group). The insulin levels (Fig. 1 B) were similar throughout the clamp in the F, FR, and the control chow-fed group. Glucose SA (not shown) remained constant in the last 30 min of the clamp in the three groups. The endogenous glucose production rate (Ra) (Fig. 1 C) was significantly higher in the Fversus FR animals at base line (80.6 ± 12.2versus 54.0 ± 11.1 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.001) and throughout the clamp (51.9 ± 14.3 versus10.7 ± 7.0 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.001). Treatment of the F animals with rosiglitazone resulted in normalization of Ra at base line and during the clamp (p = NSversus control chow-fed group) and also led to normalization of the level of suppression of Ra from base line (Ra was suppressed to 64.7 ± 15.6 of base line versus 19.1 ± 11.4versus 13.1 ± 8.4% of base line level during the clamp in the F, FR, and control chow-fed group respectively,p < 0.001 for the difference between F and the two other groups). The glucose infusion rate (not shown) was significantly lower in the F versus the FR group during the last 30 min of the clamp (64.7 ± 8.7 versus 121.7 ± 25.1 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.001). However, rosiglitazone treatment did not completely correct the glucose infusion rate and remained lower than the control chow-fed group (glucose infusion rate of control chow-fed group, 176.2 ± 3.0 μmol/kg/min,p < 0.001 versus FR group). Consequently, insulin-mediated glucose disappearance rate (ΔRd) (Fig.1 D) during the clamp was also significantly lower in the Fversus FR animals (29.4 ± 8.4 versus75.3 ± 20.8 μmol/kg/min, p < 0.001) but was not completely normalized by treatment with rosiglitazone (ΔRd of control chow-fed group, 119.6 ± 5.1 μmol/kg/min,p < 0.001 versus FR).Insulin Signaling in Hamster Primary Hepatocyte CulturesIn hepatocytes isolated from F, insulin-stimulated insulin receptor β subunit tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced to 34.1 ± 2.6% (n = 3, p = 0.033) of that in control hepatocytes derived from chow-fed hamsters, and this was restored to the control levels (98.3 ± 0.5%, n = 3,p = 0.01 versus F) after rosiglitazone treatment, indicating complete restoration of insulin receptor phosphorylation by the drug (Fig.2 A). Insulin receptor appears as a doublet on the gel. We have consistently observed this doublet in hamster hepatocytes. We do not believe that the second band is a result of degradation, since the addition of protease inhibitors does not prevent the detection of the doublet (data not shown). Insulin-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation versus basal was 184.3 ± 22.6% in the control chow-fed (n = 4,p = 0.002), 130.3 ± 5.3% in F (n= 4, p = 0.007), and 188.9 ± 8.5% in FR (n = 4, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2 B) groups, indicating improvement of IRS-1 phosphorylation to the control levels in hepatocytes isolated from FR (p < 0.001 Fversus FR and p = 0.49 for control chow-fedversus FR groups). The effect of insulin on phosphorylation of IRS-2 was similar to that of IRS-1, as shown in Fig. 2 C, indicating significant reduction (n = 3,p = 0.01 versus control chow-fed group) in insulin-stimulated IRS-2 phosphorylation with fructose feeding and a marked improvement (n = 3, p = 0.004versus F) after treatment with rosiglitazone. As shown in Fig. 3 A, fructose feeding had no significant effect on IR protein mass (100 ± 14.1% in the control chow-fed group versus 88.3 ± 29.6% in F,n = 4, p = 0.3). However, in FR hepatocytes, IR protein mass was increased more than 2-foldversus cells derived from control chow-fed and F animals (212.6 ± 47% of control chow-fed animals, n = 4,p = 0.001 versus F). Fructose feeding reduced the protein mass of IRS-1 (Fig. 3 B) by 77% from 359.7 ± 23.9 scanning units/mg of total protein in hepatocytes from control chow-fed animals to 80 ± 11.5 in hepatocytes from F animals (n = 3, p = 0.0002versus control chow-fed animals). Rosiglitazone treatment partially restored IRS-1 mass to 52.8 ± 11.1% that in control chow-fed animals (n = 3, p = 0.003versus F). IRS-2 protein mass in hepatocytes isolated from F hamsters was reduced to 57.8 ± 7.1% (p = 0.001) that of the levels in control chow-fed animals, whereas rosiglitazone treatment increased protein mass to 74.1 ± 8% that of control hepatocytes (n = 4, p = 0.002versus F) (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that the observed change in IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 phosphorylation in hepatocytes isolated from FR may be partially due to change in protein expression levels of these proteins.Figure 2Insulin-mediated phosphorylation of the IR , IRS-1 , and IRS-2.

FR had marked reduction of PTP-1B levels to 24.4 ± 12.9% that of control chow-fed animals (n= 3, p = 0.0004 versus F) (Fig.3 D).Treatment of Fructose-fed Hamsters with Rosiglitazone Ameliorates VLDL-apoB and VLDL-TG Oversecretion in Vivo and ex Vivo without Affecting VLDL ClearanceThe slope of the increase in VLDL-apoB (Fig.4 A) over time after the injection of Triton WR-1339 was significantly steeper in the Fversus FR group (2.42 ± 0.51 versus1.09 ± 0.27 μg/ml/min, p < 0.05) andversus the control chow-fed group (0.3 ± 0.1 μg/ml/min, p < 0.05). Consequently, the VLDL-apoB secretion rate was higher in the F versus FR group (12.4 ± 2.7 versus 5.5 ± 1.4 μg/min, respectively, p < 0.05) and versus the control chow-fed group (1.3 ± 0.3 μg/min, p < 0.05) (inset of Fig. 4 A). Similarly, VLDL-TG increase over time after the injection of Triton WR-1339 (Fig.4 B) was significantly higher in F versus FR hamsters (0.024 ± 0.004 versus 0.011 ± 0.004 μmol/ml/min, respectively, p < 0.05) andversus the control chow-fed group (0.009 ± 0.002 μmol/ml/min, p < 0.05). The VLDL-TG secretion rate (inset of Fig. 4 B) was higher in the F than in the FR group (0.12 ± 0.02 versus 0.06 ± 0.02 μmol/min respectively, p < 0.05) and higher than the control chow-fed group (0.04 ± 0.01 μmol/min, p< 0.05). As depicted in Fig. 4 C, rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced ex vivo VLDL-apoB secretion to 38 ± 32% (mean ± S.D., n = 4, p < 0.001) that of fructose-fed hepatocytes, in keeping with the in vivo findings. In vivo VLDL-TG fractional clearance rate, as determined from the [2-3H]glycerol bolus studies, was not significantly different between the Fversus FR animals (0.034 ± 0.008 versus0.025 ± 0.004 min−1 respectively, p= 0.33), although clearance tended to be slightly delayed in the latter.Figure 4VLDL-apoB and VLDL-TG secretion rates.Shown are in vivo VLDL-apoB (A) and VLDL-TG (B) levels over time after intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339 (600 mg/kg) in fructose-fed hamsters treated with rosiglitazone (light gray circles, n = 10)versus placebo (closed circles, n= 9) and control chow-fed hamsters (dark gray squares,n = 5).

Decreased secretion was also accompanied with a significant decrease in total apoB recovered (Fig. 5 B). There was also a significant reduction in the fraction of labeled apoB secreted in the FR versus F animals after a 2-h chase (53 ± 7% versus 97 ± 1% in the FR versus F animals, respectively,p = 0.004), and similarly higher levels of total apoB were recovered, suggesting that rosiglitazone treatment led to destabilization and increased degradation of nascent apoB-containing particles. The cellular protein mass of MTP in hepatocytes from F was 153.3 ± 6.6% (n = 4, p = 0.0002) that of controls (Fig. 5 C). Rosiglitazone treatment led to normalization of cellular protein mass of MTP in fructose-fed hamsters to 107.0 ± 9.4% that of controls (n = 4,p < 0.005 versus F).Figure 5Pulse-chase labeling experiments to assess the stability of apoB in hepatocytes from fructose-fed hamsters treated with rosiglitazone.

In budding yeast, this process is controlled by a regulatory cascade called the mitotic exit network. Extensive genetic data indicate that mitotic exit network activity is determined by a GTP-binding protein, Tem1, and its putative regulators, Bub2, Bfa1, and Lte1. Here we describe the purification and in vitro activities of Tem1, Bub2, and Bfa1. We describe the nucleotide binding properties of Tem1 and characterize its intrinsic GTPase activity. The combination of Bfa1 and Bub2 acts as a two-component GTPase-activating protein for Tem1. In the absence of Bub2, Bfa1 inhibits the GTPase and GTP exchange activities of Tem1. This inhibition is elicited by either the N- or C-terminal regions of Bfa1, which also retain some ability to co-activate GTPase activity in the presence of Bub2. Although the C-terminal region of Bfa1 binds to Bub2, no interaction of the N-terminal half of Bfa1 with Bub2 was detected despite their combined GAP activity. Therefore, we propose that Bfa1 acts both as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1 and as an allosteric effector that facilitates this interaction.

Only then does the final step of cell separation occur, thus avoiding chromosomal loss or gain from precocious cell division or misaligned spindles. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this sequence of mitotic exit and cytokinesis is controlled by a signal transduction cascade called the mitotic exit network (MEN)1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Bardin A.J. Amon A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar and 2McCollum D. Gould K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The primary role of the MEN is to reduce mitotic kinase activity, a prerequisite for spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. The MEN comprises a regulatory cascade with the small Ras-like protein, Tem1 (3Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7476-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and its putative regulators, Bfa1, Bub2 and Lte1, at the top of the pathway (4Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A.

Other components are the kinases Cdc15, Cdc5, Dbf2, and Dbf20. Also involved are the Dbf2-associated protein Mob1, the phosphatase Cdc14, and Nud1, a spindle pole body component important for proper localization of other MEN proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Bardin A.J. Amon A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar and 2McCollum D. Gould K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the functional sequence of the MEN components is Tem1-Cdc15-Mob1/Dbf2-Cdc14 (7Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The role of the Cdc5 kinase is less clear, and it probably acts at different steps as a positive and/or negative regulator. When the MEN is activated, Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus and causes a reduction in mitotic kinase activity (8Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol.

Recently, the FEAR (Cdc14 early enaphase release) pathway has been described, which contributes to the initial release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, but the precise role of FEAR remains unclear (11Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence shows that Bfa1 and Bub2 act together as negative regulators of the MEN (12Alexandru G. Zachariae W. Schleiffer A. Nasmyth K.

An interaction between at least some Bub2/Bfa1 and Tem1 occurs throughout mitosis and in G1 (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar). DespiteTEM1 being an essential gene, BUB2,BFA1, and LTE1 are dispensable in an unperturbed cell cycle. However, BUB2/BFA1 are essential for arresting the cell cycle following damage or misalignment of the mitotic spindle or after DNA damage (13Fesquet D. Fitzpatrick P.J. Johnson A.L. Kramer K.M.

Cell. 2001; 107: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Bub2/Bfa1 negatively regulate the cell cycle by delaying activation of MEN. Initially, Bub2/Bfa1 were envisaged as checkpoint activators, but more recent data indicate that Bub2/Bfa1 also function every cell cycle for the timely control of MEN activation (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar). Tem1 and many components of the MEN bind to the spindle pole bodies and particularly to the spindle pole bodies destined for the daughter cell (16Bardin A.J. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2000; 102: 21-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Pereira G. Höfken T. Grindlay J. Manson C. Schiebel E. Mol.

It has been proposed that during mitosis, the migration of the spindle pole bodies into the daughter cell, where Lte1 is primarily localized, triggers the activation of the MEN. MEN activation has also been related to the phosphorylation of Bfa1. Bfa1 is a substrate for Cdc5 and Cdc28 kinases, and its pattern of phosphorylation is determined by cell cycle phase and spindle status (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, there is still controversy as to whether in vivo phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 inhibits or stimulates its putative GAP activity (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Insights into Tem1 regulation by Bub2 and Bfa1 have arisen from comparisons with the related Schizosaccharomyces pombeseptation initiation network (SIN), which controls septation and cytokinesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Bardin A.J. Amon A. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2McCollum D. Gould K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The homologues of most of the components of the MEN can be found in the SIN indicating that the two pathways are operationally similar. In the SIN, Spg1 is the homologue of Tem1. Both proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and share 58% sequence identity. In vivo, the down-regulation of Spg1 is achieved by Cdc16 and Byr4 (23Minet M. Nurse P. Thuriaux P.

Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bub2 and Bfa1 are homologous to Cdc16 and Byr4 and, on this basis, have also been considered as a two-component GAP of Tem1. The activation of Tem1 is thought to be carried out by Lte1, which contains a Cdc25 nucleotide exchange factor homology domain in its C terminus (4Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 4: 451-461Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite this similarity between the components of the MEN and SIN, TEM1 and BFA1cannot complement spg1 or byr4 mutations, respectively (26Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Lee J. Hwang H-S. Kim J. Song K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1449: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, no positive regulator of the Spg1 GTP cycle has yet been identified. Despite the extensive genetic, cellular, and physiological data available concerning the roles of Bub2, Bfa1, and Lte1, no biochemical characterization of their in vitro activities has been carried out. Likewise, no data exist on the properties of Tem1 with the exception of its ability to bind GTP (3Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7476-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize the enzymatic activity of Tem1 and show that Bfa1 and Bub2 act together as a two-component GAP. Furthermore, our data suggest that Bfa1 might induce a conformational change in Tem1 in addition to acting as the bridge between Tem1 and Bub2. The TEM1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing aBamHI site and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing anHindIII site and was ligated into pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) yielding pMAL-Tem1. BFA1 was amplified by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide with a BamHI site and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing a XbaI site and was ligated into pGEX-KG yielding pGEX-Bfa1. pGEX-Bfa1 was then digested withBamHI and XhoI and a Bfa-containing fragment was cloned into pMAL-c2X digested with BamHI and SalI enzymes to obtain pMAL-Bfa1FL. The sequence encoding the 280 C-terminal residues 294–574 of Bfa1was amplified by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing a XhoI site and was cloned into pMAL-c2X cut with BamHI and SalI enzymes to obtain pMAL-Bfa1CT. The sequence encoding the first 302 N-terminal residues of Bfa1 was amplified by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide with aBamHI site and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing anHindIII site and was cloned into pMAL-c2X to obtain pMAL-Bfa1NT. The BUB2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a SmaI site and a 3′-oligonucleotide containing a XbaI site and was ligated into pGEX-KG to give pGEX-Bub2. Escherichia coliBL21 containing expression plasmids for MBP-Tem1, MBP-Bfa1 full-length, MBP-Bfa1CT, MBP-Bfa1NT, GST, and GST-Bub2 were grown in LB broth at 37 °C for 3 h, transferred to 25 °C, and after 1 h were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells expressing the MBP-Tem1 fusion protein were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed through a French press. MBP-Tem1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The eluted protein was cut with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C, and Tem1 was separated from MBP by ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at −80 °C. For Bfa1 and Bub2 fusion proteins, induced cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) or glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After elution, GST-Bub2 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. MBP-Bfa1 fusion proteins were stored at −80 °C. Glutathione beads with immobilized GST or GST-Bub2 (4 μg of each) were washed twice with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in 250 μl of binding buffer plus 2% nonfat dry milk and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical), and incubated with MBP-Bfa1 full-length, MBP-Bfa1CT, or MBP-Bfa1NT at a final concentration of ∼2 μm for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in binding buffer plus 15 mm of reduced glutathione, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs). 1 μg of purified Tem1 was incubated in 25 μl of loading buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm, NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT) containing 0.1 MBq of [γ-32P]GTP or 0.03 MBq of [γ-35S]GTP for 10 min at 30 °C. For GDP exchange, we used 5 μg of purified Tem1 and 0.1 MBq of [3H]GDP. The mixture was then put on ice, and 10 μl were added to 50 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm GTP, and 0.6 μg/μl BSA). The tube was transferred at 30 °C, and at the indicated times, 10 μl of the reaction was diluted in 990 μl of cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). The samples were filtered through prewetted nitrocellulose filters, washed three times with 4 ml of cold of washing buffer and air-dried. The amount of filter-bound radioactive nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting. When Bfa1 activity was examined, the indicated amount of purified Bfa1 was added to the loading buffer. When Bub2 activity was assessed, the indicated amount of purified Bub2 was added to the reaction buffer. The GDP and GTP dissociation rates, k d andk t, were calculated by a fit of the experimental data to a single exponential decay. Data points represent the average of at least two assays, which typically differed by < 10%. However, we have noticed that there was a certain degree of quantitative variation from experiment to experiment because of GTPase instability on filters. A similar phenomenon has been previously reported for Sec4 and Ran (28Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To examine the properties of Tem1 and its putative regulators, Bfa1 and Bub2, all three proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Tem1 was expressed as an MBP-fusion protein, which was soluble in E. coli extracts. Following the removal of the affinity tag by Factor Xa, Tem1 was purified on SP-Sepharose to >95% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A). Bub2, Bfa1, and the fragments thereof were expressed as GST and MBP fusion proteins, respectively, and were used without further removal of the affinity tag. Full-length Bfa1 and the N-terminal fragment migrate more slowly in SDS-PAGE than predicted by their calculated molecular weights. GST-Bub2 co-purified with a 60-kDa protein, which is likely to be the chaperone GroEL that has previously been reported to co-purify with Cdc16 (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The induction of GST-Bub2 expression at 14 °C overnight did not reduce the apparent ratio between the chaperone and Bub2 but significantly increased its activity. To characterize the GTPase activity of Tem1, the rates of GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide dissociation were determined in a filter binding assay. Radiolabeled nucleotides were bound to Tem1. After 10 min, an excess of non-radioactive nucleotide was added, and a loss of radioactivity was measured over 30 min. With Tem1-[γ-32P]GTP, radioactivity is lost by two means, 1) by dissociation of GTP at a rate, k d, and 2) by hydrolysis and subsequent release of [γ-32P] at a rate, k hyd. Therefore, the kinetics of loss of counts from Tem1-[γ-32P]GTP are the sum of k dand k hyd and occurred with a rate of 0.19 min−1 at 30 °C (Fig. 2). To determine the rate of GTP dissociation alone, the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue [γ-35S]GTP was used. In this case, [γ-35S]GTP was lost from Tem1 at ak d of 0.07 min−1 (Fig. 2). Finally, the dissociation of GDP was assayed using Tem1 loaded with [3H]GDP. Initial attempts to determine the rate for GDP dissociation at 30 °C proved difficult, because almost all of the [3H]GDP bound to Tem1 was lost within the first sampling interval. Carrying out the reaction at the lower temperature of 13 °C allowed us to determine a rate of 0.2 min−1 (Fig.2). This high rate of intrinsic GDP release may explain why the putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Lte1, is not an essential protein at least at 30 °C. Even without Lte1, there might be sufficient intrinsic exchange activity to provide enough Tem1-GTP for MEN activation. Byr4, the S. pombehomologue of Bfa1, inhibits both GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis by Spg1 (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test whether Bfa1 might have similar properties, we monitored the intrinsic GTPase activity of Tem1 and nucleotide dissociation in the presence of varying amounts of Bfa1. For this test, Tem1 was loaded with radioactive nucleotides and incubated for times and temperatures that gave an ∼50% loss of label as shown in Fig. 2. The effect of Bfa1 on GTP dissociation was assayed using Tem1 loaded with [γ-35S]GTP. Whereas 45% of radiolabel was released during the subsequent incubation period in the absence of Bfa1, this release was progressively inhibited by increasing amounts of Bfa1. Thus, Bfa1 inhibits GTP dissociation from Tem1. Likewise, the effect of Bfa1 on GTP hydrolysis was monitored with Tem1 loaded with [γ-32P]GTP. Again, there was a strong Bfa1-dependent inhibition of loss of radioactivity from Tem1-[γ-32P]GTP indicating the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by Bfa1 (Fig. 3). Dissociation and hydrolysis of GTP were fully inhibited at concentrations of ∼200 nm Bfa1, suggesting that the affinity between Tem1 and Bfa1 is high with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range. In contrast, Bfa1 does not markedly affect the dissociation of GDP from Tem1 as judged by the similar losses of radiolabeled [3H]GDP in the presence or absence of Bfa1 (Fig. 3) Although Bub2 and Cdc16 contain a TBC homology domain (domain in Tre-2, BUB2p, and Cdc16p) typical of GAPs for Rab-like GTPases (30Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the Bub2 homologue, Cdc16, only displays GAP activity in combination with Byr4 (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test whether Bub2 might have a similar activity, Tem1 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence or absence of Bfa1. After loading, increasing amounts of Bub2 were added, and the fraction of [γ-32P]GTP remaining bound to Tem1 after a 7-min incubation at 30 °C was compared with levels bound at time zero (Fig.4 A). In the absence of Bfa1 or Bub2, ∼50% of the radioactive [γ-32P]GTP bound to Tem1 was lost. This reflects the intrinsic GTP dissociation and GTPase activities of Tem1 as described above (Fig. 2). Notably, in the absence of Bfa1, there were no further changes in bound [γ-32P]GTP upon the addition of increasing amounts of Bub2, clearly indicating that Bub2 alone does not affect either hydrolysis or dissociation of GTP from Tem1. In parallel assays increasing amounts of Bub2 were added to Tem1-[γ-32P]GTP in the presence of a fixed concentration of Bfa1. In the zero Bub2 control, there was no loss of [γ-32P]GTP from Tem1, a result already seen above in which Bfa1 alone inhibits the GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation (Fig.3). However, the addition of Bub2 in the presence of Bfa1 caused a precipitous loss of radioactivity from Tem1-[γ-32P]GTP (Fig. 4 A). To ensure that this loss of radioactivity was attributed to GTP hydrolysis and not because of an increased rate of GTP dissociation, we performed a similar assay with [γ-35S]GTP (Fig. 4 B). The addition of Bub2 caused no loss of the non-hydrolyzable [γ-35S]GTP from Tem1 with or without accompanying Bfa1. The amount of Bub2 required to achieve maximal stimulation of GAP activity is significantly higher than the amount of Bfa1 required for complete inhibition of GTP hydrolysis and dissociation (Fig. 4 A). At present, we are not able to conclude whether this reflects a real difference in the affinities between these complexes or whether only a fraction of the Bub2 used in these assays is fully active, possibly because of the association with GroEL. The GAP-activated GTPase activity of Tem1 in the presence of 150 nm Bfa1 and 15 μm Bub2 is shown in Fig. 4 C in comparison to its intrinsic GTPase activity. Under these conditions, hydrolysis is complete after 5 min. As expected from Fig. 3, the presence of 150 nm Bfa1 alone caused a large reduction in the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis by Tem1. The results presented thus far show that Bfa1 has different activities depending upon the absence or presence of Bub2. Without Bub2, Bfa1 inhibits GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation from Tem, whereas it acts as a two-component GAP in the presence of Bub2. To characterize these different effects of Bfa1 in more detail and to map the regions that are responsible for these activities, we produced an N-terminal fragment of Bfa1, Bfa1NT encompassing residues 1–302 and a C-terminal fragment Bfa1CT encompassing residues 294–574. These fragments were expressed as MBP fusion proteins and purified from E. coli(Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Both fragments were tested for their effect on GTP dissociation and GTPase hydrolysis of Tem1. For this test, increasing amounts of Bfa1NT, Bfa1CT, and full-length Bfa1 were added to Tem1 during loading with [γ-32P]GTP and the time course of loss of radioactivity was measured (Fig.5). In the absence of Bfa1, only 50% [γ-32P] GTP remained bound to Tem1 after 5 min because of GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis (see Fig. 2). Also, as expected from Fig. 3, 200 nm full-length Bfa1 prevented all loss of [γ-32P]GTP. As shown in Fig. 5, both Bfa1NT and Bfa1CT inhibit GTP hydrolysis by Tem1. Bfa1CT shows similar concentration dependence as the full-length protein, indicating that both proteins bind Tem1 with equal affinities. In contrast, slightly higher concentrations of Bfa1NT are required to achieve a similar effect. We have also observed that GST-Bfa1NT and GST-Bfa1CT have the same inhibitory effects on GTP hydrolysis and exchange in Tem1 as do the equivalent MBP fusions (data not shown). Thus, the MBP moiety does not inhibit Tem1 activity, nor does the type of tag modify the activity of the Bfa1 fusion proteins. Next we investigated whether both of these two fragments can interact with Bub2 to form a two-component GAP for Tem1. The concentration dependence of Bub2 on GAP activity with full-length Bfa1 (150 nm) is shown in Fig. 6. More than 95% GTP is hydrolyzed after 7 min in the presence of 30 μm Bub2. Bfa1CT is also capable of stimulating GTP hydrolysis, although 3–4 times higher amounts of Bub2 are required to achieve maximal activity. The Bfa1NT was also able to increase GTP hydrolysis in combination with Bub2, yet this fragment showed a significantly lower activity than the C-terminal part of the protein. Thus, the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal fragments of Bfa1 can act as a two-component GAP with Bub2, although there is a significant difference in their activity at identical Bub2 concentrations. To investigate whether the differences in GAP activity between the N- and C-terminal portions of Bfa1 are caused by their different affinities for Bub2, we carried out in vitro pull-down binding assays. GST-Bub2 or a GST control were bound to glutathione-sepharose beads and assayed for their ability to bind to Bfa1NT, Bfa1CT, or full-length Bfa1 (Fig.7). Approximately, equal amounts of each form of Bfa1 were used as judged by Western blotting with an anti-MBP antibody. Only full-length Bfa1 and Bfa1CT bound to the GST-Bub2 beads. Indeed, the Bfa1CT seemed to bind more effectively to Bub2 than the full-length protein. No binding was detected with Bfa1NT, indicating both that this portion of Bfa1 does not interact with Bub2, and more generally, that binding is not caused by the MBP moiety of any of the Bfa1 fusion proteins used in these assays. No form of Bfa1 bound to the control GST-only beads. The minor high molecular weight bands retained by GST-Bub2 and MBP-Bfa1CT are probably unspecific bands attributed to the milk used in the binding assay. To avoid the possibility that immobilizing Bub2 on beads may in some way interfere with the interaction with Bfa1NT, a second series of binding assays were performed with immobilized Bfa1 and free Bub2. MBP, MBP-Bfa1NT, MBP-Bfa1CT, and MBP-Bfa1FL were immobilized on amylose resin and assayed for binding in vitro transcribed and translated [35S]Bub2 (data not shown). These experiments confirmed that only full-length Bfa1 and Bfa1CT interact specifically with Bub2. The activation of the mitotic exit network by Tem1 and its regulation by Bub2/Bfa1 has been the subject of intense analysis for several years. Here, we describe the purification and enzymatic activities of Tem1, Bub2, and Bfa1. We show that Tem1 is a GTPase, which is down-regulated by a two-component GAP comprising Bub2 and Bfa1. The negative regulation of mitotic exit by Bub2/Bfa1 in vivo can therefore be attributed to their ability to activate GTP hydrolysis and thereby reduce the active form of Tem1 until the spindle is correctly assembled and positioned for the even partitioning of chromosomes. The rates of GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis of Tem1 are very similar to those determined for its S. pombe homologue Spg1 and those of members of the Rho family of small GTPases (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Hall A. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19718-19722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As bfa1 and bub2 mutants are viable and grow at normal rates, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Tem1 may be sufficient for the correct execution of mitotic exit, at least in the absence of spindle damage. In contrast to GTP dissociation, the release of GDP from Tem1 and Spg1 is significantly faster than for many other small GTPases. The only other example of a GTPase with a comparatively high GDP off-rate is Sec4, which belongs to the Rab family of small GTPases (28Kabcenell A.K. Goud B. Northup J.K. Novick P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9366-9372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of this protein, it has been suggested that differences in the switch regions might weaken Mg2+binding and thereby cause the high GDP off-rate (34Stroupe C. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Similar structural features may be the reason for the high rate of GDP dissociation observed for Tem1 and Spg1. However, the confirmation of this notion or otherwise awaits the structural characterization of Tem1 and Spg1. Nevertheless, the high GDP exchange rate is consistent with the observation that Lte1, the putative exchange factor for Tem1, is not essential at least at 30 °C (4Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 4: 451-461Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Presumably, inlte1 mutants, the high intrinsic exchange activity can maintain adequate levels of Tem1-GTP for mitotic exit. Bub2 contains a TBC domain that is the signature motif for GAPs specific for Rab-like small GTPases (30Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GAPs for small GTPases are typically monomeric proteins that are able to increase the intrinsic GTPase rate by several orders of magnitude by a mechanism that often involves the stabilization of the switch regions of the GTPase and the supply of a catalytic residue into the active site of the GTPase (reviewed in Refs. 35Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and 36Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Yet, despite the presence of a GAP homology domain, Bub2 has an absolute requirement for Bfa1 as a co-activator of GAP activity. The only other system identified so far in which two proteins are required to form a functional GAP is the SIN, which is regulated by the small GTPase, Spg1, and its two-component GAP, Cdc16/Byr4 (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In vitro results from the two systems suggest two roles for Bfa1 and Byr4 in bringing about co-activation. Firstly, the results presented here and by Furgeet al. (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) suggest that Bfa1 and Byr4 have a “bridging” role in the GTPase·GAP complex. Byr4 can interact with both Spg1 and Cdc16, but Spg1 and Cdc16 do not stably interact without Byr4. Similarly, we show that Bfa1 interacts with both Tem1 and Bub2. Bfa1 contacts Bub2 via its C-terminal region whereas both the N- and C-terminal portions of Bfa1 can contact Tem1 as judged by the inhibition of GTPase and GTP dissociation. A similar distribution of the binding regions was found in Byr4 (37Furge K.A. Cheng Q. Jwa M. Shin S. Song K. Albright C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11339-11343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In GAP assays, it was largely the Bfa1 C-terminal region with its ability to interact with both Bub2 and Tem1 that supported GAP activity. Thus, Bfa1 like Byr4 might serve as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1. However, several observations suggest that Bfa1 might have an additional function. Bfa1 is subject to cell cycle and spindle damage-dependent fluctuations in phosphorylation that have been related to alterations in GAP activity (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bfa1 and its N- or C-terminal fragments are able to inhibit GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation of Tem1. This activity is reminiscent of guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors and certain downstream effectors, which have previously been shown to inhibit GTP hydrolysis and/or nucleotide dissociation (38Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 71: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 40Nomanbhoy T.K. Cerione R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 41Rudolph M.G. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal fragment of Bfa1, which is unable to bind Bub2, is still able to act as a GAP in combination with Bub2, albeit at higher concentrations. Thus, the binding of Bfa1NT might be capable of inducing a conformational change in Tem1, which results in the formation of a binding site for Bub2. This suggestion is further supported by the reduced activity of the C-terminal portion of Bfa1 in promoting GAP activity compared with full-length Bfa1 (Fig. 6) despite the apparent higher affinity of Bfa1CT for Bub2 (Fig. 7). Together, these observations point to the C-terminal portion of Bfa1 acting as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1, whereas the N-terminal portion may modify the conformation of Tem1, thereby creating a binding site for Bub2. An example for the latter activity has been shown for Ran whose GTPase activity is enhanced by a combination of RanGAP and RanBP1 (29Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although RanBP1 is not absolutely required for RanGAP activity, its presence increases the rate of GTP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude (29Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The structure of a trimeric complex between Ran, RanBP1, and RanGAP shows that there is no direct contact between RanGAP and RanBP1, making it unlikely that RanBP1 has a direct structural effect on RanGAP (42Seewald M.J. Korner C. Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Instead, it appears that RanBP1 relieves a conformation of Ran, which is inhibitory to RanGAP binding. Given the role of Bfa1 in acting with Bub2 to reduce Tem1-GTP levels, it is paradoxical that Bfa1 acting without Bub2 maintains levels of Tem1-GTP. From this result, it might naively be predicted that the overexpression of Bfa1 would activate the MEN. However, the opposite occurs, and Bfa1 overexpression causes an anaphase arrest (15Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4989-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), likewise the overexpression of Byr4 inhibits septation in S. pombe (23Minet M. Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Mitchison J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 440-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This lethal Byr4/Bfa1 overexpression phenotype can be suppressed by co-overexpression of Spg1/Tem1 (25Furge K.A. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 2M. Geymonat, unpublished observation. Thus, a high ratio of Bfa1 to Tem1 could inhibit the ability of Tem1-GTP to communicate with its effectors by competing for a common binding site on Tem1. As Tem1 requires a two-component GAP to restrain its activity, the ability of Bfa1 alone to block the activity of GTP-bound Tem1 therefore may provide a second tier of restraint to protect against precocious MEN activation. Although an interaction between Bub2 and Bfa1 has been seen throughout mitosis (6Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether all or just a proportion of Bfa1 and Bub2 are combined in this way. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Bfa1 on Tem1 may safeguard against times when GAP activity is reduced by Bfa1 and Bub2 dissociation or by transiently low levels of Bub2. In summary, we present the first demonstration of the in vitro activities of Tem1 and their regulation by a GAP activity provided by a complex between Bub2 and Bfa1. Why such a complicated two-component GAP mechanism has evolved when most other small GTPases rely on monomeric GAPs remains an enigma. As a first step to answering this question, we present insights into the nature of Bub2 and Bfa1 interactions with each other and with Tem1. This work therefore provides the foundations for future investigations of how Bub2 and Bfa1 function as “gatekeepers” of the mitotic exit network.

Here, we have demonstrated genotropic actions of testosterone that are independent of intracellular androgen receptors (iAR). Through plasma membrane androgen receptors (mAR), testosterone induces a rapid rise in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration of iAR-free murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. This nongenomic testosterone signaling, which is independent of both iAR and estrogen receptors, does not in itself activate either the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families ERK1/2, p38, and JNK/SAPK, the stably and transiently transfected c-fos promoter, or NO production. In the context of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling, however, testosterone attenuates LPS activation of the c-fos promoter and NO production, which is abolished by the intracellular Ca2+chelator BAPTA. Testosterone also attenuates the LPS activation of p38 but not that of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK, and this attenuation is abrogated by BAPTA. Moreover, the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, largely reduces LPS activation of the c-fos promoter and NO production, and the remaining levels are no longer regulated by testosterone.

These receptors in the plasma membranes of cells, though mostly not yet defined in molecular terms, mediate nongenomic actions that have been described for different steroids, including the brassinosteroids of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (13Li J. Chory J. Cell. 1997; 90: 929-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 14He Z. Wang Z.Y., Li, J. Zhu Q. Lamb C. Ronald P. Chory J.

The latter is remarkable in that the plant genomes do not seem to encode any transcription factors of the nuclear receptor family (15Wang Z.Y. Seto H. Fujioka S. Yoshida S. Chory J. Nature. 2001; 410: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Nongenomic actions of steroids through surface receptors often become evident as rapid rises in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (16Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Audy M.C. Vacher P. Duly B. Eur. J.

Nonetheless, the Ca2+ signals, though steroid-specific, generally exhibit low amplitude and short duration so that their consequences for cell functioning are not immediately obvious. Hence, the nongenomic steroid actions are often disregarded as meaningless.Testosterone has been described as exerting both genotropic and nongenomic actions. Genotropic actions are mediated through the classic intracellular androgen receptor (iAR), which is a 110-kDa protein with domains for androgen binding, DNA binding, and transactivation (21Zhou Z.X. Wong C.I. Sar M. Wilson E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 249-274PubMed Google Scholar,22Quigley C.A., De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand-activated iAR is not only able to act on transcription but has also been recently reported to exert nongenomic actions such as activation of ERK1/2 and p21-activated kinases (23Cato A.C. Peterziel H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 150-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L.

By contrast, nongenomic actions of testosterone through membrane androgen receptors (mAR) on cell surfaces become evident as intracellular Ca2+signaling, which varies with cell type. In murine T-cells, for example, mAR mediate ligand-induced Ca2+ influx through non-voltage-gated, Ni2+-blockable Ca2+ channels (26Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Sekeris C.E. Wunderlich F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In rat osteoblasts, testosterone induces both the influx of extracellular Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through G-protein-coupled receptors activating phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (28Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murine macrophages of the cell line IC-21 respond to testosterone with predominantly intracellular Ca2+ mobilization mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors for testosterone (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling, in particular with regard to gene expression and cell function, is not yet understood.To get information for possible genotropic effects of nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling, we have chosen as a model system mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages transiently or stably transfected with a c-fos promoter linked to human secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a reporter, because the immediate early gene c-fos is known to be Ca2+-sensitive (31Roche E. Prentki M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32van Haasteren G., Li, S. Muda M. Susini S. Schlegel W. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling through mAR cannot directly activate the c-fos promoter. However, nongenomic testosterone signaling is able to exert genotropic actions in context with the LPS signaling pathway through p38 MAPK with impact on cell function.DISCUSSIONNongenomic actions of steroids on cells are obviously much more complex than anticipated to date. During recent years, a number of reports have appeared describing nongenomic steroid effects that are mediated through the classic intracellular steroid receptors. For instance, iER-mediated nongenomic E2 effects can activate members of the MAPK family such as ERK1/2 (5Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6322-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and p21-activated kinases (25Yang F., Li, X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by a nongenomic pathway via the classic iAR. Very recently, testosterone has been shown to activate the ERK signaling pathway nongenomically through either iAR or even iER in diverse cells such as osteoblasts, osteocytes, embryonic fibroblasts, and HeLa cells (24Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the present study has demonstrated that intracellular steroid receptors are not a necessary precondition to mediate nongenomic effects of steroids. Like the macrophage cell line IC-21 (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the murine RAW 264.7 macrophages investigated here do not express any significant amounts of iAR. Nevertheless, in RAW 264.7 macrophages, testosterone is able to induce iAR-independent nongenomic actions, which can in turn even exert genotropic actions with impact on cell function.Nongenomic testosterone signaling manifests itself as a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in macrophages of the cell line RAW 264.7. Such rises have also been observed in other cell types (26Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Sekeris C.E. Wunderlich F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F.

Jones G.R. Rommerts F.F. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and they are well known to be inducible by other steroids as well (10Falkenstein E. Tillmann H.C. Christ M. Feuring M. Wehling M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 513-556PubMed Google Scholar, 54Machelon V. Nome F. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In RAW 264.7 cells, similar to IC-21 macrophages (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the testosterone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is not prevented by the iAR blocker, cyproterone. We can also exclude the possible action of testosterone through the iER (24Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because the Ca2+ response was not sensitive to the iER blockers, raloxifene, tamoxifen, and ICI 182,780. Rather, our data demonstrate that testosterone exerts its nongenomic iAR- and iER-independent effects through mAR. An increase in [Ca2+]i is also inducible with the plasma membrane-impermeable testosterone-BSA, and specific binding sites for testosterone can be localized on the surface of intact RAW-fos13 cells with testosterone-BSA conjugated to FITC. Though still unknown in molecular terms, the mAR mediate actions specific for different androgens; only testosterone and 5α-DHT induce about the same rise in [Ca2+]i, whereas 5β-DHT and 1-DeHT are ineffective in evoking changes in [Ca2+]i of RAW-fos13 macrophages.The nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling through mAR is not able in itself to induce genotropic actions in terms of activation of the stably and transiently transfected promoter of the Ca2+-inducible gene c-fos in RAW 264.7 cells. Nevertheless, the nongenomic testosterone signaling has the potency to induce genotropic actions. This becomes evident in the context of co-stimulation of the LPS signaling pathway. Thus, LPS stimulates c-fos promoter activation, and this stimulation is attenuated by testosterone-induced Ca2+ signaling. This attenuation can be completely abolished by BAPTA, and it is specific as supported by the following results. First, E2 causes the opposite effect of testosterone, namely an enhanced activation of thec-fos promoter following LPS stimulation. Second, testosterone has no effect on SV40 promoter activity. Third, 5α-DHT is just as effective as testosterone in inducing attenuation, whereas 5β-DHT and 1-DeHT are ineffective.The nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling not only exerts genotropic actions in context with LPS signaling but also has a specific impact on cell function. This manifests itself as a testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-stimulated NO production of RAW 264.7 macrophages. In accordance, a recent report (55Friedl R. Brunner M. Moeslinger T. Spieckermann P.G. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) also has shown testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-stimulated NO production. Our data demonstrate that nongenomic testosterone Ca2+signaling is the reason for testosterone-attenuated LPS-activated NO production, because the latter can be abolished by BAPTA.The testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-induced c-fos promoter activation and NO production may be thought to reflect only a simple uniform dampening of all LPS signaling parameters in macrophages through the increased free Ca2+ions. However, this attenuation is specific, which has to be deduced from our results. Thus, LPS activates all three MAPK families, ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38, in accordance with previous reports (39Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 41Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). Testosterone, however, selectively down-regulates only the LPS-induced activation of p38, not that of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK. This p38 down-regulation is indeed due to nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling. When the free Ca2+ ions induced by testosterone are captured by BAPTA, p38 is again fully able to be stimulated by LPS. The central role of p38 MAPK is further substantiated by our finding that the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, diminishes the LPS-induced activation of c-fos promoter activation and NO production and abolishes the responsiveness to testosterone of the remaining LPS effect. Collectively, our results indicate that there is a cross-talk of the testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling with the LPS signaling pathway. The testosterone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i attenuates the LPS-induced activation of p38, which further downstream attenuates both the LPS-activated c-fos promoter and NO production.The nongenomic iAR-independent testosterone signaling we have observed here in RAW 264.7 macrophages is a novel paradigm for a nongenomic steroid effect with impact on gene expression and cell functioning, independent of the cognate intracellular steroid receptor. This nongenomic signaling is presumably of importance with respect to the long known immunosuppressive activities of testosterone that are not yet explainable by the classic iAR response. In particular, the testosterone-induced nongenomic decrease in NO production of macrophages is compatible with our previous findings that testosterone dramatically diminishes the ability of mice to eliminate blood stages of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria (56Wunderlich F. Mossmann H. Helwig M. Schillinger G. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Wunderlich F. Marinovski P. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1991; 13: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, testosterone not only prevents the development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi infections but even impairs the efficacy of protective vaccination against P. chabaudi malaria (58Wunderlich F. Maurin W. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These immunosuppressive effects of testosterone are mediated neither through iAR nor, after aromatization of testosterone to E2, through iER (59Benten W.P.M. Wunderlich F. Mossmann H. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 135: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 60Benten W.P.M. Wunderlich F. Herrmann R. Kühn-Velten W.N. J.

Steroid hormones play a key role as signaling molecules in the development, differentiation, and physiology of multicellular organisms.

These receptors in the plasma membranes of cells, though mostly not yet defined in molecular terms, mediate nongenomic actions that have been described for different steroids, including the brassinosteroids of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (13Li J.

Science. 2000; 288: 2360-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The latter is remarkable in that the plant genomes do not seem to encode any transcription factors of the nuclear receptor family (15Wang Z.Y. Seto H. Fujioka S. Yoshida S. Chory J. Nature. 2001; 410: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Nongenomic actions of steroids through surface receptors often become evident as rapid rises in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (16Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Audy M.C. Vacher P. Duly B. Eur. J.

Nonetheless, the Ca2+ signals, though steroid-specific, generally exhibit low amplitude and short duration so that their consequences for cell functioning are not immediately obvious. Hence, the nongenomic steroid actions are often disregarded as meaningless. Testosterone has been described as exerting both genotropic and nongenomic actions. Genotropic actions are mediated through the classic intracellular androgen receptor (iAR), which is a 110-kDa protein with domains for androgen binding, DNA binding, and transactivation (21Zhou Z.X. Wong C.I. Sar M. Wilson E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 249-274PubMed Google Scholar,22Quigley C.A., De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand-activated iAR is not only able to act on transcription but has also been recently reported to exert nongenomic actions such as activation of ERK1/2 and p21-activated kinases (23Cato A.C.

By contrast, nongenomic actions of testosterone through membrane androgen receptors (mAR) on cell surfaces become evident as intracellular Ca2+signaling, which varies with cell type. In murine T-cells, for example, mAR mediate ligand-induced Ca2+ influx through non-voltage-gated, Ni2+-blockable Ca2+ channels (26Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Sekeris C.E. Wunderlich F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In rat osteoblasts, testosterone induces both the influx of extracellular Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+channels and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through G-protein-coupled receptors activating phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (28Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Murine macrophages of the cell line IC-21 respond to testosterone with predominantly intracellular Ca2+ mobilization mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors for testosterone (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling, in particular with regard to gene expression and cell function, is not yet understood. To get information for possible genotropic effects of nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling, we have chosen as a model system mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages transiently or stably transfected with a c-fos promoter linked to human secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a reporter, because the immediate early gene c-fos is known to be Ca2+-sensitive (31Roche E. Prentki M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32van Haasteren G., Li, S. Muda M. Susini S. Schlegel W. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling through mAR cannot directly activate the c-fos promoter. However, nongenomic testosterone signaling is able to exert genotropic actions in context with the LPS signaling pathway through p38 MAPK with impact on cell function. DISCUSSIONNongenomic actions of steroids on cells are obviously much more complex than anticipated to date. During recent years, a number of reports have appeared describing nongenomic steroid effects that are mediated through the classic intracellular steroid receptors. For instance, iER-mediated nongenomic E2 effects can activate members of the MAPK family such as ERK1/2 (5Migliaccio A., Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

Very recently, testosterone has been shown to activate the ERK signaling pathway nongenomically through either iAR or even iER in diverse cells such as osteoblasts, osteocytes, embryonic fibroblasts, and HeLa cells (24Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the present study has demonstrated that intracellular steroid receptors are not a necessary precondition to mediate nongenomic effects of steroids. Like the macrophage cell line IC-21 (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H.

Nevertheless, in RAW 264.7 macrophages, testosterone is able to induce iAR-independent nongenomic actions, which can in turn even exert genotropic actions with impact on cell function.Nongenomic testosterone signaling manifests itself as a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in macrophages of the cell line RAW 264.7. Such rises have also been observed in other cell types (26Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Sekeris C.E. Wunderlich F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F.

Jones G.R. Rommerts F.F. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and they are well known to be inducible by other steroids as well (10Falkenstein E. Tillmann H.C. Christ M. Feuring M. Wehling M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 513-556PubMed Google Scholar, 54Machelon V. Nome F. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In RAW 264.7 cells, similar to IC-21 macrophages (29Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Guo Z. Wunderlich F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3113-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,30Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Guo Z. Stamm O. Wrehlke C. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Steroids. 2002; 67: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the testosterone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is not prevented by the iAR blocker, cyproterone. We can also exclude the possible action of testosterone through the iER (24Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because the Ca2+ response was not sensitive to the iER blockers, raloxifene, tamoxifen, and ICI 182,780. Rather, our data demonstrate that testosterone exerts its nongenomic iAR- and iER-independent effects through mAR. An increase in [Ca2+]i is also inducible with the plasma membrane-impermeable testosterone-BSA, and specific binding sites for testosterone can be localized on the surface of intact RAW-fos13 cells with testosterone-BSA conjugated to FITC. Though still unknown in molecular terms, the mAR mediate actions specific for different androgens; only testosterone and 5α-DHT induce about the same rise in [Ca2+]i, whereas 5β-DHT and 1-DeHT are ineffective in evoking changes in [Ca2+]i of RAW-fos13 macrophages.The nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling through mAR is not able in itself to induce genotropic actions in terms of activation of the stably and transiently transfected promoter of the Ca2+-inducible gene c-fos in RAW 264.7 cells. Nevertheless, the nongenomic testosterone signaling has the potency to induce genotropic actions. This becomes evident in the context of co-stimulation of the LPS signaling pathway. Thus, LPS stimulates c-fos promoter activation, and this stimulation is attenuated by testosterone-induced Ca2+ signaling. This attenuation can be completely abolished by BAPTA, and it is specific as supported by the following results. First, E2 causes the opposite effect of testosterone, namely an enhanced activation of thec-fos promoter following LPS stimulation. Second, testosterone has no effect on SV40 promoter activity. Third, 5α-DHT is just as effective as testosterone in inducing attenuation, whereas 5β-DHT and 1-DeHT are ineffective.The nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling not only exerts genotropic actions in context with LPS signaling but also has a specific impact on cell function. This manifests itself as a testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-stimulated NO production of RAW 264.7 macrophages. In accordance, a recent report (55Friedl R. Brunner M. Moeslinger T. Spieckermann P.G. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) also has shown testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-stimulated NO production. Our data demonstrate that nongenomic testosterone Ca2+signaling is the reason for testosterone-attenuated LPS-activated NO production, because the latter can be abolished by BAPTA.The testosterone-induced attenuation of LPS-induced c-fos promoter activation and NO production may be thought to reflect only a simple uniform dampening of all LPS signaling parameters in macrophages through the increased free Ca2+ions. However, this attenuation is specific, which has to be deduced from our results. Thus, LPS activates all three MAPK families, ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38, in accordance with previous reports (39Hambleton J. Weinstein S.L. Lem L. DeFranco A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 41Feng G.J. Goodridge H.S. Harnett M.M. Wei X.Q. Nikolaev A.V. Higson A.P. Liew F.Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). Testosterone, however, selectively down-regulates only the LPS-induced activation of p38, not that of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK. This p38 down-regulation is indeed due to nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling. When the free Ca2+ ions induced by testosterone are captured by BAPTA, p38 is again fully able to be stimulated by LPS. The central role of p38 MAPK is further substantiated by our finding that the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, diminishes the LPS-induced activation of c-fos promoter activation and NO production and abolishes the responsiveness to testosterone of the remaining LPS effect. Collectively, our results indicate that there is a cross-talk of the testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling with the LPS signaling pathway. The testosterone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i attenuates the LPS-induced activation of p38, which further downstream attenuates both the LPS-activated c-fos promoter and NO production.The nongenomic iAR-independent testosterone signaling we have observed here in RAW 264.7 macrophages is a novel paradigm for a nongenomic steroid effect with impact on gene expression and cell functioning, independent of the cognate intracellular steroid receptor. This nongenomic signaling is presumably of importance with respect to the long known immunosuppressive activities of testosterone that are not yet explainable by the classic iAR response. In particular, the testosterone-induced nongenomic decrease in NO production of macrophages is compatible with our previous findings that testosterone dramatically diminishes the ability of mice to eliminate blood stages of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria (56Wunderlich F. Mossmann H. Helwig M. Schillinger G. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Wunderlich F. Marinovski P. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1991; 13: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, testosterone not only prevents the development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi infections but even impairs the efficacy of protective vaccination against P. chabaudi malaria (58Wunderlich F. Maurin W. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These immunosuppressive effects of testosterone are mediated neither through iAR nor, after aromatization of testosterone to E2, through iER (59Benten W.P.M. Wunderlich F. Mossmann H. J.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6403-6412PubMed Google Scholar). Testosterone, however, selectively down-regulates only the LPS-induced activation of p38, not that of ERK1/2 and JNK/SAPK. This p38 down-regulation is indeed due to nongenomic testosterone Ca2+ signaling. When the free Ca2+ ions induced by testosterone are captured by BAPTA, p38 is again fully able to be stimulated by LPS. The central role of p38 MAPK is further substantiated by our finding that the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, diminishes the LPS-induced activation of c-fos promoter activation and NO production and abolishes the responsiveness to testosterone of the remaining LPS effect. Collectively, our results indicate that there is a cross-talk of the testosterone-induced nongenomic Ca2+ signaling with the LPS signaling pathway. The testosterone-induced rise in [Ca2+]i attenuates the LPS-induced activation of p38, which further downstream attenuates both the LPS-activated c-fos promoter and NO production. The nongenomic iAR-independent testosterone signaling we have observed here in RAW 264.7 macrophages is a novel paradigm for a nongenomic steroid effect with impact on gene expression and cell functioning, independent of the cognate intracellular steroid receptor. This nongenomic signaling is presumably of importance with respect to the long known immunosuppressive activities of testosterone that are not yet explainable by the classic iAR response. In particular, the testosterone-induced nongenomic decrease in NO production of macrophages is compatible with our previous findings that testosterone dramatically diminishes the ability of mice to eliminate blood stages of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria (56Wunderlich F.

Furthermore, testosterone not only prevents the development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi infections but even impairs the efficacy of protective vaccination against P. chabaudi malaria (58Wunderlich F. Maurin W. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These immunosuppressive effects of testosterone are mediated neither through iAR nor, after aromatization of testosterone to E2, through iER (59Benten W.P.M. Wunderlich F. Mossmann H. J.

This respiratory protein forms a monomer of about 17 kDa that is not exported into the hemolymph. Recombinant Drosophilahemoglobin displays a typical hexacoordinated deoxy spectrum and binds oxygen with an affinity of 0.12 torr. Four different hemoglobin transcripts have been identified, which are generated by two distinct promoters of the hemoglobin (glob1) gene but are identical in their coding regions. Putative binding sites for hypoxia-regulated transcription factors have been identified in the gene. Hemoglobin synthesis in Drosophila is mainly associated with the tracheal system and the fat body. This suggests that oxygen supply in insects may be more complex than thought previously and may depend on hemoglobin-mediated oxygen transport and storage in addition to simple diffusion.

Gas exchange in insects and other terrestrial arthropods is mediated via trachea that enable the transport of oxygen from the atmosphere to the inner organs. For this reason, respiratory proteins have been regarded as unnecessary in most insects. Only species that are adapted to a hypoxic environment were considered as sporadic exceptions: the aquatic larvae of the chironomid midges (1Osmulski P.A. Leyko W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 85B: 701-722Google Scholar), some aquatic Hemiptera (2Bergtrom G. Insect Biochem. 1977; 7: 313-316Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Wells R.M.G. Hudson M.J. Brittain T. J. Comp.

Insect Hbs may either occur freely dissolved in the hemolymph (Chironomidae) or accumulate in specialized tissues, mostly tracheal or fat body cells (6Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Typically, the Hbs of these species reach concentrations in the millimolar range and thus may easily be identified due to the red color of the organs or the hemolymph. However, recently we showed that a hemoglobin gene is present and expressed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Hb gene of Drosophila(glob1) is located on chromosome 3 at position 89A13-B1. It shares significant sequence similarity with the extracellular Hbs from Chironomidae, but the highest identity score was found with the intracellular Hb of the botfly G. intestinalis(39% identity and 64% similarity of the amino acids). The identification of an Hb in Drosophila, which was unexpected at first glance, suggested the possibility that a respiratory protein is part of the standard genetic repertoire of insects. Such an assumption is supported by the molecular phylogenetic analysis, which shows a close association of the different insect Hbs, including the chironomid extracellular Hbs (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The physiological role of intracellular Hbs, which are mostly expressed at low levels in many invertebrate taxa, is not well established. Intracellular Hbs may enhance the diffusional transport of oxygen from the extracellular medium to the mitochondria (8Wittenberg J.B. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 60-85Google Scholar, 9Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 19: 217-241Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Others might be involved in oxygen sensing (10Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) or have enzymatic functions (11Minning D.M. Gow A.J. Bonaventura J. Braun R. Dewhirst M. Goldberg D.E. Stamler J.S.

To understand the role of the intracellular Hbs in insect physiology, we have investigated the gene organization, expression pattern, biochemical properties, and ligand binding behavior of D. melanogasterHb. TheDrosophila Hb coding region (EMBL/GenBankTMaccession number NM_079645) was cloned into the pET3a expression plasmid using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cells were grown at 25 °C in TB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm δ-amino-levulinic acid. Hb expression was induced at A 600 = 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After 14–18 h, the reddish bacteria were harvested and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The bacteria were broken with three freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication. The debris was removed by two centrifugation steps (10 min at 10,000 × g and 60 min at 105,000 ×g). Further purification was achieved by 40 and 90% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The 90% pellet, which contains the crude Hb pellet, was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, dialyzed overnight, and loaded onto a Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing of the unbound material, the Hb was eluted with 200 mm NaCl. The Hb fractions were concentrated by Amicon filtration (PM10) and passed through a Sephacryl S200 column. The final Hb fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C until use. Absorption spectra of recombinant D. melanogaster Hb were measured for the various forms and conditions using an SLM-Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Ligand binding experiments were performed on recombinant Hb in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Kinetics were measured by flash photolysis (13Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using laser pulses of 10 ns at 532 nm (Quantel) with detection at 436 nm. The kinetics were studied for samples equilibrated with air or CO. The oxygen dissociation rate was determined from the kinetics after photolysis of samples equilibrated under a mixed oxygen-CO atmosphere. The transition from the hexacoordinated deoxy form to the CO bound form was measured by stopped flow (Biologic, Claix, France) by mixing a deoxygenated Hb sample with a solution equilibrated under CO. These kinetics involve the competition of ligands, and simulations were made, taking into account the on/off rates for each ligand, the solvent concentration of the external ligand, and the absorption coefficients at the wavelength of detection. The equations for the binding of both ligands were numerically integrated to obtain the time course for the overall reaction. The oxygen affinity at equilibrium was determined independently by measuring full spectra at different partial pressures of oxygen for samples in a tonometer. Antibodies against recombinantDrosophila Hb were raised in rabbits. For Western blotting, total protein extracts were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 14% acrylamide gel in the presence of SDS. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose by the semidry method. The filters were blocked in 2% non-fat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20) for several hours and subsequently incubated overnight with the antibodies (1:10,000) diluted in TBST/2% milk. Goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated with alkaline phosphatase were used as secondary antibody. Detection was performed using nitro-blue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Drosophila larvae and adults were anesthetized and fixed overnight at 4 °C in BT-fix (4% sucrose, 0.12 m CaCl2, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently rinsed in 2× BT-fix. Mounted 15-μm cryosections were rinsed in PBS1 (7 mmNa2HPO4, 3 mmNaH2PO4, 130 mm NaCl), blocked with 30% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and incubated with the anti-Drosophila Hb antibody (1:500). The specimens were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS and incubated in the dark for 1 h with anti-rabbit antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase. After washing 3 × 5 min with PBS, specific staining was detected by comparison with control slices (without the first antibody). Total RNA was isolated using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the RT-PCR experiments, cDNA was synthesized with the SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using a specific primer and amplified by PCR using nested primers. Appropriate water and extraction controls have been included in all analyses. 5′ RACE assays were carried out with a series of nested oligonucleotide primers using the kit from Invitrogen. The PCR products were purified from agarose gels and directly sequenced. EST (expressed sequence tag (15Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar)) sequences were obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) data base using the BLAST algorithm (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes were produced using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals in vitro transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-radioactive in situhybridization with embryos, larvae, and adult Drosophila was essentially performed according to the method of Tautz and Pfeifle (17Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Briefly, the embryos were fixed for 20 min in 50% heptan, 5.5% formaldehyde in PBT (7 mm Na2HPO4, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 130 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), washed with methanol, and stored in ethanol at −20 °C. The tissues of larval and adult specimens were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After 3 × 5 min washing with PBT, the samples were post-fixed for 20 min in 5% formaldehyde in PBT. Prehybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% Tween 20 for about 2 h at 55 °C, and hybridization with labeled antisense RNA probes was performed at 65 °C overnight in the same solution. Sense probes were used as negative controls. The samples were washed for 15 min at 65 °C in hybridization solution, for 15 min in 50% hybridization solution/50% PBT, and 5 × 10 min in PBT. The specimens were incubated at room temperature with an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (90 min at 1:1,000 in PBT) and washed 3 × 10 min in PBT. Detection was carried out using nitro-blue-tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and specimens were post-fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBT, washed with PBT, and stored in 70% glycerol. The Drosophila Hb was recombinantly expressed in the bacterial pET3a system and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography. The protein elutes as a monomer of about 17 kDa in size exclusion chromatography (not shown). The absorbance spectra were recorded between 350 and 710 nm (Fig. 1 A). The ferrous deoxy form of Drosophila Hb exhibits a spectrum that is typical of a hexacoordinated Hb, as illustrated by large amplitudes of the α band (561 nm) and the Soret band (426.5 nm) plus a smaller peak at 531 nm. The oxy form displays the typical Hb-like pattern with absorption maxima at 419, 541, and 576 nm; the maxima of the CO form are at 422, 542, and 572 nm. The binding of CO and O2 to the photodissociatedDrosophila Hb is a biphasic process (Fig. 1 B) with a rapid phase reflecting the competitive binding of the external ligand and an intrinsic protein ligand, most likely the distal E7-histidine. The slower phase corresponds to the globin fraction in which the distal histidine as an internal ligand is bound to the iron atom. The replacement of the histidine by CO occurs on a much slower time scale, essentially limited by histidine dissociation, which has a time coefficient of 25 ms (from stopped flow measurements) or 30 ms by the flash photolysis technique. The CO association rate is best determined at high levels of CO (1 atm) where the kinetics have little contribution from the histidine; at sufficiently low levels of CO, histidine binding is favored, and one observes essentially the His on rate. As for other Hbs, there is a higher affinity for CO, although oxygen association is about five times faster than CO binding (64 × 106m−1 s−1 and 13 × 106m−1s−1, respectively). These conditions allow the use of a mixed O2/CO atmosphere to study competition between these two external ligands. After photodissociation, a certain fraction will bind oxygen, followed by a slow replacement reaction for the return to the CO form. As for the case of histidine, this experiment allows a determination of both the oxygen on and off rate; the off rate was 1/s as compared with 1.1/s from the stopped flow method. The rate coefficients are summarized in TableI. The overall oxygen affinity calculated for Drosophila Hb from the kinetic measurements is 0.18 torr (flash photolysis technique) or 0.14 torr with the stopped flow rates, as compared with 0.12 torr for direct measurements using the tonometer.Table ILigand binding kinetics of Drosophila Hb and other selected Hbsk on(O2)k off(O2)k off/k onP50HistidineReferencem−1s−1s−1nmtorrkon/koffDrosophilaHb1-aIn the case of hexacoordinated Hbs, the observed oxygen affinity depends on the competition with the protein ligand (histidine in this case) Kobs = K5/(1 + KHis).

The amino acid coding region of the Drosophila Hb gene (glob1) is distributed on three exons with introns at codon positions D7.0 and G7.0 (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additional data base analyses revealed the presence of a total of about 100 ESTs from variousDrosophila cDNA libraries, which are available at the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP, www.fruit fly.org). Ignoring a few putative sequencing errors, these EST clones are identical within the glob1 coding region but display striking differences at the 5′ ends. Comparison with the publishedDrosophila genomic sequence (18Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar) demonstrates the presence of three additional exons in the 5′-untranslated region, which are differentially spliced into four distinct transcripts (Fig.2). Transcript A is composed of the small exon 1 (56 bp) plus the three coding exons 4–6, and transcript B contains an additional exon of 182 bp (No. 2), which is separated from exon 1 by a 59-bp intron. Transcripts C and D start with the third exon and use an alternative promoter, which is located in the second intron about 2 kb downstream of the first promoter. These transcripts only differ in the length of their first exon (No. 3), which has two different splice donor sites at its 3′ end. The expression pattern of the different transcripts was investigated by Northern blotting (data not shown) and RT-PCR experiments (Fig.3). For unknown reasons, transcript B, which is represented by only 2 cDNAs from the adult head out of about 100 EST sequences, was not identified in these analyses. In both the larvae and adults, transcripts A, C, and D were detected. In embryos, we could only find transcripts A and C, whereas the EST data set contains few embryonic entries for transcript B. No differences between male and female adults have been observed. The transcription start site of transcript A, which is the major form in all investigated stages, was determined by 5′ RACE (Fig. 2). Comparison with the genomic sequences revealed the presence of a TATA box 28 bp upstream of the start site. The start site of transcripts C and D was identified from the EST databases and turned out to be identical with that predicted by the computer. A TATA box-like sequence (CATAAA) was found 30 bp upstream of this transcriptional start site. The 7-kb genomic region of the glob1 gene was scanned for the presence of putative hypoxia-responsive sequence elements. Such hypoxia-responsive sequence elements in hypoxia-regulated mammalian genes are not positionally fixed relative to the transcription unit and are defined by the combined presence (in direct or inverted orientation) of binding sites for hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 (“core” sequence: RCGTG) and the EPO sequence 5′-CACAG-3′ (19Semenza G.L.

Several closely spaced motif combinations (either two potential HIF binding sites or one HIF plus one EPO site) have been detected in the Drosophila globin gene region and await further characterization by functional assays (Fig. 2). In situ hybridization experiments were performed on different developmental stages using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes encompassing the complete glob1 coding region (Fig.4; Table II). Labeled sense RNA was used in control experiments and resulted in either no or only diffuse background staining (not shown). Embryos of stages 1–5 showed the presence ofDrosophila Hb mRNA in the whole embryo (Fig.4 A), whereas no staining was observed in stages 6–10. Expression of Hb mRNA in the yolk sac and in vitellophages was observed in later developmental periods (stages 11–15) (Fig.4 B). Starting with embryonic stage 14, the Hb is expressed in the developing fat body (Fig. 4 C). Tracheal expression was found in stage 15 and older embryos. In this stage, additional staining of the pharynx was observed. In the larvae, Hb mRNA is expressed in fat body cells (Fig. 4 D) and the terminal cells of the tracheal system (Fig. 4 E). In the adult fly, Hb expression was observed in the tracheoles and terminal cells (Fig.4 F) as well as in fat body cells that are associated with organs such as the gonads (Fig. 4 G). Hb is also expressed in late oogenesis (Fig. 4 H).Table IISummary of Hb expression in DrosophilaHybridization signalEmbryosstage 1–5all embryostage 6–10no stainingstage 11vitellophagesstage 12–14yolk sacstage 15–17trachea, pharynx, fat bodyLarvaefat bodyall fat bodytracheatracheoles, terminal cellsAdultsovariesearly stagesno staininglate stagesall ovaryfat bodyhead, cells surrounding organstracheal systemtracheoles, terminal cells Open table in a new tab Western blot analysis shows a single band in the range of 17 kDa in larvae, adult heads, and adult abdomen (Fig.5 A).

The strongest staining was found in the fat body of the adult head (Fig. 5,B–E). The presence of an Hb in D. melanogaster (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is surprising because among insects, only those species living under pronouncedly hypoxic conditions were thought to require a respiratory protein. Ironically, even after the determination of the complete genomic sequences of D. melanogaster (18Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar), the occurrence of a hemoglobin-like gene in this species was denied (20Rubin G.M Yandell M.D. Wortman J.R. Gabor Miklos G.L. Nelson C.R et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2204-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that the Drosophila Hb exhibits ligand binding properties and expression patterns that resemble those of other known insect globins (6Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest a common, conserved function of the intracellular Hbs in insect physiology and lead us to conclude that insect respiration may be more complex than thought previously. Recombinantly expressed Drosophila Hb is a monomer with an M r of about 17,000 (Fig.5 A). Only a single Hb gene was detected in the genome of this species, as evident from Southern blot experiments (data not shown) and comparison with the complete D. melanogastergenome sequence (18Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar).

The dimericGasterophilus Hb consists of at least two distinct polypeptides that are encoded by different genes (5Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Van Houte K. Pesce A. Griffon N. Kiger L.

Based on a sequence alignment (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the proximal (F8) and distal (E7) residues ofDrosophila Hb are histidines, indicating a His-Fe-His binding scheme. This is in contrast to the intracellular Hb of G. intestinalis and the extracellular Hbs of the chironomids, which are pentacoordinated (5Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Van Houte K. Pesce A.

Biochem. 1985; 80: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The hexacoordinated state of theDrosophila Hb results in an apparently slow binding of external ligands since the displacement of the distal His (E7) is required. The flash photolysis data show that ligand association to the pentacoordinated form is quite fast (Table I). However, the observed oxygen affinity of the Hb is much lower than in the pentacoordinated form due to competition with the internal protein ligand. The kinetics are thus similar to those of vertebrate neuroglobin (26Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The resulting high oxygen affinity of Drosophila Hb (0.12 torr) is fully comparable with the values measured for the intracellularGasterophilus Hb (5Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Van Houte K. Pesce A. Griffon N. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Vermeire S. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E. Moens L. J. Biol.

Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Weber R.E. Braunitzer G. Kleinschmidt T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. 1985; 80: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Table I). The structure of the Drosophila Hb gene (glob1) is complex with a total of six exons that are used to create at least four different transcripts with an identical coding region (exons 4–6) but different 5′-untranslated regions (Fig. 2). The functional role of this organization is largely unknown. The unequal distribution of ESTs in different cDNA libraries that have been prepared by the BDGP suggests a differential expression of transcripts. For example, the adult head cDNA libraries contain ESTs of transcripts A and B but no transcripts C or D, whereas the libraries from embryos mainly contain transcripts C and D. Our RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 3) indicate the presence of multiple transcripts throughout fly development, possibly in different relative amounts. The results may also be explained by tissue-specific usage of alternate splice forms, which has not yet been studied in detail. The differences between transcripts A and B versus C and D probably reflect the presence of two alternate promoters that might be differentially controlled. The principal sites of Hb synthesis in larval and adultDrosophila are the cells of the fat body and the tracheal system. Although the total Hb concentration is comparatively low inDrosophila, this distribution mirrors the pattern in other insects with more pronounced Hb expression; synthesis of intracellular Hbs in fat body and tracheal cells was observed in the botfly G. intestinalis (4Keilin D. Wang Y.L. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as in the back-swimmers (Hemiptera)Buenoa confusa (2Bergtrom G. Insect Biochem. 1977; 7: 313-316Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), Anisops pellucens, and Anisops assimilis (3Wells R.M.G. Hudson M.J. Brittain T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1981; 142: 515-522Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The extracellular Hbs of the Chironomidae are also synthesized in fat body cells (6Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 32Bergtrom G. Laufer H. Rogers R. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of hemoglobin in chironomid oocytes has been described (33Trewitt P.M. Boyer D.R. Bergtrom G. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 963-969Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and may be equivalent to the in situ signal, which we obtained in Drosophila oogenesis. The absence of Hb mRNA in embryos of stages 6–10 suggests that maternally derived message is responsible for the staining in early embryos (stages 1–5). Embryonic Hb synthesis starts in stage 11 in the vitellophages and later in the fat body. There is little difficulty in associating the expression of Hbs at high levels with their function in oxygen storage and transport (6Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The total expression level of the DrosophilaHb, however, appears to be lower when compared with the classical insect globin models. Nevertheless, similar oxygen affinity (Table I), tissue distribution (Figs. 4 and 5), and phylogenetic history (7Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest similar functions. Thus, the transport and storage of oxygen should be considered as the most likely role of insect Hbs, even under vastly normoxic conditions. The Hb in the tracheoles and terminal cells of the trachea may facilitate a permanent oxygen flow from the air in the tracheal space into the tissues. The oxygen demand of the mitochondria may be responsible for further O2 delivery into the metabolically active cells. The strong Hb expression in the fat body cells that surround the adult organs of Drosophila, in particular the adult brain, may be associated with the local storage of oxygen for these metabolically highly active tissues. Insect species that live under hypoxic conditions such as the aquatic back-swimmers (2Bergtrom G. Insect Biochem. 1977; 7: 313-316Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 3Wells R.M.G. Hudson M.J. Brittain T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1981; 142: 515-522Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the G. intestinalis larvae (4Keilin D. Wang Y.L. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Van Houte K. Pesce A. Griffon N. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Vermeire S. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have reacted with a genetically fixed enhancement of Hb expression in the fat body and the tracheal organ. It is tempting to relate the presence of an intracellular Hb to the enhanced tolerance of and recovery from anoxia (as compared with vertebrates) observed in several insect taxa (34Wegener G. Hochachka P Lutz P.L. Sick T. Rosenthal M. van den Thillart G. Surviving Hypoxia: Mechanisms of Control and Adaptation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 417-434Google Scholar). In particular, Drosophila embryos and larvae are surprisingly resistant toward prolonged periods of experimentally induced hypoxia (35Haddad G.G. Sun Y.-A. Wyman R.J. Xu T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10809-10812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 36Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which may for example be of adaptive value when the fly eggs and larvae compete with microorganisms for a limiting supply of oxygen within fermenting fruits. Although the present data strongly support the primary role of theDrosophila Hb as a respiratory protein involved in oxygen storage or transport, other possible functions must still be taken into account. For example, it is conceivable that intracellular insect hemoglobins may serve as an oxygen sensor, which for example may be involved in the regulation of tracheal growth (37Jarecki J. Johnson E. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Since tracheal growth under hypoxia is stimulated by a signaling pathway involving nitric oxide (36Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the Hb might also be instrumental in supplying the nitric oxide synthase with an oxygen reserve needed for nitric oxide synthesis. Drosophila as a prime model organism will provide the tools for further investigations of lowly expressed intracellular hemoglobins. T. H. and T. B. would like to thank E. R. Schmidt and J.

TRs function by regulating the expression of thyroid hormone (T3) target genes in both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways. Distinct classes of co-regulatory proteins modulate these two pathways. We show here a novel role of cyclin D1 as a T3-independent co-repressor for TRs. Cyclin D1 interacted with TR in vitro and in cells in a ligand-independent manner. Cyclin D1 acted to repress both the silencing activity of the unliganded TR and the transcriptional activity of the liganded TR. The repression was not due to the inhibition of the binding of TR to the thyroid hormone response element but by serving as a ligand-independent bridging factor to selectively recruit HDAC3 to form ternary complexes. The repression was augmented by increasing expression of HDAC3 but not by HDAC1 and was alleviated by trichostatin A.

Four different thyroid hormone (T3) binding TR isoforms deriving from alternative splicing of two separate genes are identified. They are expressed in tissue-dependent and developmentally regulated fashion (1Cheng S.Y. Rev. Endocrine Metabolic Dis. 2000; 1: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yen P. Physiol.

TR functions not only as a ligand-dependent transcription factor in the presence of ligand but also acts as a constitutive repressor for their target genes in the absence of ligand. A network of associated proteins identified as co-repressors and co-activators has been shown to facilitate TR in gene regulation. One mechanism for the action of co-regulator proteins has been shown to involve acetylation/deacetylation of the lysine residues on the amino terminus of the core histones of chromatins. Several co-activators such as steroid hormone receptor co-activator (SRC) family members pCBP/300 and p/CAF have been show to harbor intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (3Clements A.

In contrast, co-repressors such as N-CoR and SMRT have been shown to be associated with histone deacetylases (HDAC) and mediate the transcriptional silencing by TR (6Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

Dynamic changes in the state of acetylation of core histones, which are controlled by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases and HDACs, lead to transcriptional activation or repression of genes (10Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). Hyperacetylation of the histone tail relaxes the chromatin structure and leads to transcriptional activation. Conversely, deacetylation condenses chromatin and results in gene repression. In humans and mice, nine HDACs have been cloned and identified to date. They are divided into two distinct classes based on their size and sequence homology to yeast HDACs. The class I enzymes such as HDAC1 (11Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L.

During the transition of cell cycle, the activity of these kinase complexes is activated by specific cyclins and inactivated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Cyclin Ds complexing with CDK4 or CDK6 are strong key regulators of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (21Resnitzky D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3463-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar,22Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4310) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that cyclin D1 also harbors activities that are independent of its role as a cyclin D kinase regulatory subunit (23Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 was found to activate the estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription in breast tumors by direct binding to the hormone binding domain of the ER and by enhancing the binding of ER to their target genes (24Zwijsen R.M. Wientjens E. Klompmaker R. van der Sman J. Bernards R. Michalides R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that cyclin D1 interacts with members of the SRC family and p/CAF through a motif that is similar to the co-activator binding domain of nuclear receptors in a ligand-independent manner (25McMahon C. Suthiphongchai T. DiRenzo J. Ewen M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It is suggested that cyclin D1 serves as a bridging factor to recruit SRC and p/CAF co-activators to ER, thereby facilitating the acetylation of histones and promoting the ER-mediated transcription (25McMahon C. Suthiphongchai T. DiRenzo J. Ewen M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5382-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Zwijsen R.M. Buckle R.S. Hijmans E.M. Loomans C.J. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3488-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that T3 stimulates the proliferation of growth hormone producing GC cells (27Barrera-Hernandez G. Park K.S. Dace A. Zhan Q. Cheng S.-y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5267-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect is mainly due to a shortening of G0/G1 phase. The shortening in G0/G1 phase correlated with T3-induced increases in the mRNA and protein levels of two key regulators of G1 progression, cyclins D1 and E (27Barrera-Hernandez G. Park K.S. Dace A. Zhan Q. Cheng S.-y. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5267-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential direct or indirect functional link of these two cyclins with TRs. Because ER and TR share many co-regulatory proteins in their signaling pathways (28McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar), we sought to understand whether cyclin D1 also acted to stimulate the transcriptional activity of TRs. We found that indeed, cyclin D1 physically interacted with the hormone binding domain of TR. However, unexpectedly we discovered that in contrast to ER, this interaction led to a repression of both T3-dependent and -independent transactivation activities of TRs. The repression was mediated by cyclin D1-dependent recruitment of HDAC3 to cyclin D1-TR complexes. These findings expand the role of cyclin D1 in transcriptional regulation. Significantly, our studies highlight a novel regulatory pathway in mediating both T3-dependent and -independent repression of the transcriptional activity of TRs. CV-1, GC, and MCF7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 μg/ml penicillin, 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C under 5% CO2. T3-depleted FBS was prepared by incubating FBS with 20 mg/ml activated charcoal and 50 mg/ml anion exchange resin (AGX-8, Bio-Rad) for 24 h followed by centrifugation and ultrafiltration. T3 (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. Trichostatin A (TSA) was obtained from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Both reagents were stored at −20 °C and diluted immediately before use.

For in vitrotranscription/translation, pCJ3, pJL8, pJL5, and pCJ4 encode full-length and truncated TRβ1 under the control of the T7 promoter (30Lin K.H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Mol.

The reporter plasmid pTK-Pal-Luc (1 μg) was transfected with 0.2 μg of TR expression vector (pCLC51) and cyclin expression vectors (pCMV-cyclin D1 or pCMV-D1-HA) into cells. Empty vectors were used to supplement equal amounts of DNA in each transfection. Transfection was carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation, cultures were replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% T3-depleted FBS and induced with 100 nm T3 for 24 h before harvest. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity and normalized to total protein concentration. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated 3–5 times. The results shown are the mean ± S.E.

[35S]Methionine-labeled TR proteins were prepared by TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and incubated with 1 μg of GST-cyclin D1or GST in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Lubrol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% BSA, 5% glycerol protease inhibitors) at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. Subsequently, beads were washed 4 times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5% sucrose, 2.5 mmEDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Lubrol. The bound proteins were extracted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. CV1 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). GC cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested after 48 h and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 300 μg of cell extract was incubated with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or monoclonal anti-TR, monoclonal anti-TRβ1 antibody (mAbC4) (31Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.-G. Cheng S.-y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C, and followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) overnight. Beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk and probed with the primarily antibodies anti-TR, anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), or anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were washed 5 times in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 and developed in ECL reagent (Pierce). The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the Lys-TRE was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP similarly as described by Zhu et al. (32Zhu X.G. McPhie P. Cheng S.Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). About 0.2 ng of probe (3–5 × 104 cpm) was added to the binding buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.01 mm ZnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, 0.01% TritionX-100) andin vitro translated proteins, and 0.2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA. Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min, and complexes were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 150 V for 2 h. After drying of the gel, the DNA-bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. We utilized the GST/glutathione (GSH) binding system to assess whether TRβ1 physically interacted with cyclin D1. GST alone was used as a negative control. Fig. 1 A shows that TRβ1 bound to GST-D1 in the absence (lane 3) or presence of T3 (lane 4), but not GST (lanes 1 and2), indicating the specific physical interaction of TRβ1 with cyclin D1. To map the region of TRβ1 to which cyclin D1 bound, we prepared 35S-labeled truncated TRβ1 in which domains were systematically deleted (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of domain A/B (lanes 5 and 6, Fig. 1 A), domains A/B+C (lanes 7 and 8, Fig. 1 A), or domains A/B+C+D (lanes 9 and 10, Fig.1 A) did not significantly affect the binding of cyclin D1 to TRβ1 regardless of whether T3 was present or not. These results indicate that domain E was the essential binding region for cyclin D1 and that this physical interaction was independent of T3. To demonstrate the interaction of cyclin D1 with TRβ1 in vivo, CV1 cells were transfected with expression vector of TRβ1 or cyclin D1 tagged with hemagglutinin (D1-HA) or transfected with both expression vectors. Fig. 1 C shows the results of such experiments from cells cultured in the absence of T3. Western blot analysis of cell lysates using mAbC4 (31Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.-G. Cheng S.-y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10591-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) detected the expression of TRβ1 (lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 1 C,a) but not in cells transfected only with D1-HA expression vector (lane 2). When cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blot analysis using mAbC4, TRβ1 was detected in cells transfected with TRβ1 and D1-HA as shown in lane 6 (Fig. 1 C,a) but not in cells transfected with either TRβ1 (lane 4) or D1-HA alone (lane 5), indicating an association of TRβ1 with cyclin D1 in vivo. The association of TRβ1 with cyclin D1 in vivo was further demonstrated by a reverse experiment in which cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with anti-TRβ1 (mAbC4) followed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA. As shown in lane 6 of Fig.1 C, b, cyclin D1-HA was detected in cells transfected with both TRβ1 and cyclin D1-HA expression plasmids but not in cells transfected only with TRβ1 (lane 4, Fig.1 C, b) or with cyclin D1-HA (lane 5, Fig. 1 C, b). The identity of the co-immunoprecipitated cyclin D1-H1 was confirmed by direct Western analysis of cell lysates with anti-HA as shown in lanes 2and 3 of Fig. 1 C, b. Similar results were obtained from cells cultured in the presence of T3 (Fig. 1 D). TRβ1 was detected in cells co-transfected with both D1-HA and TRβ1 after first immunoprecipitation of lysates with anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blot analysis using anti-TRβ1 antibody (mAbC4; lane 6, Fig. 1 D, a). Using the same protocol, no TRβ1 was detected in cells transfected only with either TRβ1 (lane 4, Fig. 1 D,a) or D1-HA (lane 5, Fig. 1 D,a). The association of D1-HA with TRβ1 was further confirmed by reversing the antibodies in that anti-TRβ1 antibody was first used to immunoprecipitate TRβ1 followed by Western blot using anti-HA (lane 6, Fig. 1 D, b).Lanes 1 and 3, Fig. 1 D, a, and lanes 2 and 3 of Fig. 1 D,b, show the expression of TRβ1 and D1-HA, respectively, by direct Western blot analysis. Taken together, these data indicate that the association of D1 with TRβ1 in cells was T3-independent. Cyclin D1 not only associated with the transfected TR but also with the endogenous TR in GC cells (Fig. 1 E). As shown in Fig.1 E, a, TRβ1 was detected in GC cells transfected with cyclin D1 (lane 2 of Fig. 1 E) by co-immunoprecipitation assay but not in cells without the transfected cyclin D1 (lane 1 of Fig. 1 E, a). Fig.1 E, b and c, show the controls by direct Western blot analysis to indicate the expression of endogenous TRβ1 and the transfected cyclin D1 in GC cells, respectively, (lane 2 of Fig. 1 E, c). These results indicate that cyclin D1 associates not only with the transfected TRβ1 but, importantly, with the endogenous TRβ1 in GC cells. To assess the functional consequences of the physical interaction of TRβ1 with cyclin D1, we used TRE-containing reporter systems (Fig. 2). CV1 cells were transfected with a constant amount of TRβ1 expression plasmid in the absence or presence of an increasing amount of expression plasmid of cyclin D1. Fig. 2 A shows that the transactivation activity of TRβ1 was activated 20-fold by T3 (bar 4, Fig.2 A). Cyclin D1 repressed the T3-dependent transactivation activity of TRβ1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The extent of repression was ∼55% (bar 6 versus bar 4) and ∼80% (bar 8 versus bar 4) at the cyclin D1:TRβ1 plasmid ratio of 1 and 2, respectively. These results indicate that cyclin D1 negatively regulates the T3-dependent transactivation activity of TRβ1. Consistent with the T3-independent binding of cyclin D1 to TRβ1 shown in Fig. 1, cyclin D1 also augmented the silencing effect of the unliganded TRβ1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The enhancement in the silencing effect was 1.6- and 2-fold when the ratio of the cyclin D1:TRβ1 was increased from 1 to 2 (bars 5 and 7, respectively). Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin D1 not only repressed the T3-dependent transactivation activity but also augmented the T3-independent silencing activity of TR. The cyclin D1-mediated repression effect was further demonstrated by the transactivation activity of endogenous TRs in GC cells. Fig.2 B shows that transfection of increasing concentrations of cyclin D1 expression plasmid (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 μg; bars 4, 6, and 8, respectively) into GC cells led to a concentration-dependent repression of the T3-dependent transactivation activity of the endogenous TRs (∼50%, ∼70, and ∼85% repression for bars 4,6, and 8, respectively). The silencing effect of the unliganded endogenous TR was also augmented up to 1.7-fold at the highest concentration of cyclin D1 (bar 7 versus bar 1). Taken together, these data indicate that cyclin D1 not only repressed the transactivation activity of the transfected TRs but also the endogenous TRs. To further evaluate the functional consequences of the interaction of cyclin D1 with TR, we co-transfected cyclin D1 and TRβ1 in to a cancer cell line, MCF7 cells (Fig. 2 C). Similar to that found in CV1 and GC cells, the T3-dependent transactivation activity of TRβ1 was repressed by cyclin D1 in a concentration-dependent manner (compared bars 6and 8 with bar 4, Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, the silencing effect was also further augmented by cyclin D1 in a concentration-dependent manner (bars 5and 7 versus bar 3, Fig.2 C). Thus, the repression of the transcriptional activity by cyclin D1 not only occurs in CV1 and GC cells but also in MCF7 cells. We further evaluated whether cyclin D1 also interacted with other TR isoforms in cells by carrying out the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3,A–C). CV1 cells were transfected with TRα1 or TRβ2 with or without cyclin D1-HA in the absence of T3 (lanes 1–5, Fig. 3, A–C). When lysates from cells transfected with cyclin D1-HA and TRα1 or TRβ2 expression plasmids were first immunoprecipitated with anti-TR (mAbC4) followed by Western analysis using anti-HA, D1-HA was detected as shown in lanes 2 and3 of Fig. 3 A, indicating the association of TRα1 or TRβ2 with cyclin D1-HA, respectively. This association is further supported by a negative control in which no D1-HA was detected in cells without the co-transfection of either TRα1 or TRβ2 (lane 1, Fig. 3 A). The lack of detection of D1-HA was not due to the lack of expression because direct Western blot analysis of the same lysates indicates that D1-HA was similarly expressed (lane 1, Fig. 3 B) as in cells co-transfected with either TRα1 or TRβ2 (lanes 2 and3, Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, direct Western blot analysis using anti-TR antibody shows that TRα1 and TRβ2 were expressed (lanes 2–5, Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that cyclin D1 also physically interacted with TRα1 or TRβ2 in the absence of T3. Similar association of cyclin D1 with TRα1 or TRβ2 was also detected in cells cultured in the presence of T3 (lanes 7and 8, Fig. 3 A, respectively). Again, this physical association in cells was further confirmed by the negative controls in that when cells were not transfected with either TRα1 or TRβ2, no D1-HA was detected (lane 6, Fig. 3 A). The data shown in Fig. 3 indicate that TRα1 and TRβ2 were associated with D1-HA in cells independent of T3. The functional consequences of the physical interaction of cyclin D1 with each of the TR isoforms were evaluated in the presence or absence of T3 by using TRE-containing reporter system (Fig. 3 D). In the presence of T3, the interaction of cyclin D1 with each of the three TR isoforms led to the repression of T3-dependent transactivation of TRs. However, the extent of the repression is TR isoform-dependent in that 60, 80, and 65% repression was observed for TRβ1, TRα1, and TRβ2, respectively. Fig. 3 D also compares the extent of the effect of cyclin D1 on the silencing effect of the un-liganded TRα1 and TRβ2 with that of TRβ1. The augmentation of the silencing effect by cyclin D1 also differed among the TR isoforms in that the extent of the enhancement of the silencing effect was 1.6-, 2.0-, and 1.2-fold for TRβ1 (bar 5 versus 3), TRα1 (bar 9 versus 7), and TRβ2 (bar 13 versus 11). As a first step to understand the mechanisms by which cyclin D1 repressed the TR-mediated transactivation, we first addressed the question as to whether the binding of TRβ1 to TRE was affected by cyclin D1. We carried out electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay by using thein vitro translated TRβ1 in the absence or presence ofin vitro translated cyclin D1. Lane 2 of Fig.4 was the control, which indicated that no nonspecific band was detected in the unprogrammed lysates.Lanes 1 and 8 were the positive controls to show that TRβ1 bound to TRE as homodimers and heterodimers with the retinoic X receptor β (RXRβ), respectively. Clearly, cyclin D1 itself did not bind to TRE, as no TRE bound was detected in the presence of increasing concentrations of the in vitrotranslated cyclin D1 (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4) nor in the presence of RXRβ (lane 7). The binding of TRβ1 to TRE as homodimers (compare lanes 5 and 6 withlane 1) or as heterodimers with RXRβ (compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 8) was clearly not affected by the presence of in vitro translated cyclin D1. These data indicate that the repression of the transactivation activity of TR by cyclin D1 was not due to the inhibition of the binding of TRβ1 to TRE. To investigate whether the cyclin D1-mediated repression of TR involves HDACs, we transfected TRE-containing reporter with or without cyclin D1 into GC cells. The TRE-mediated transactivation activity of the endogenous TR was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of TSA (Fig.5). As shown in bar 3 of Fig.5, the T3-dependent transactivation activity of endogenous TRs was activated 12-fold by T3, which was repressed by cyclin D1 (∼70% repression; bar 4 versus bar 3). In the presence of 330 nm TSA, the T3-dependent transactivation activity of TR was enhanced (bars 7 versus 3). Importantly, the extent of repression effect on the T3-dependent transactivation activation of TRs by cyclin D1 was reduced from ∼70 to ∼20% (bar 8 versus 7). When the concentration of TSA was further increased to 660 nm (2-fold), the repression effect on the T3-dependent transactivation activation of TRs by D1 was totally abrogated (bar 11 versus 12), indicating the TSA reversed the repression effect mediated by D1. A similar reversal of the repression effect of cyclin D1 on the silencing activity of endogenous unliganded TR by TSA was also observed (Fig. 5). Bar 2 (versus bar 1) shows that cyclin D1 augmented the silencing activity of unliganded TR, which was alleviated by the increasing concentrations of TSA (bar 6 versus 5 and 10 versus 9). These findings indicate the involvement of HDACs in the repression effect of transactivation activation of TR by cyclin D1. These data further suggest that the recruitment of HDACs by TR·D1 complex was T3-independent. The above results prompted us to ask the question as to whether HDACs are physically associated with TR·D1 complexes. Recently, it has been reported that HDAC3 is more distantly related to HDAC1/HDAC2 (13Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2795-2"
https://openalex.org/W2050734507,"Two acyl-CoA carboxylases fromStreptomyces coelicolor have been successfully reconstituted from their purified components. Both complexes shared the same biotinylated α subunit, AccA2. The β and the ε subunits were specific from each of the complexes; thus, for the propionyl-CoA carboxylase complex the β and ε components are PccB and PccE, whereas for the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex the components are AccB and AccE. The two complexes showed very low activity in the absence of the corresponding ε subunits; addition of PccE or AccE dramatically increased the specific activity of the enzymes. The kinetic properties of the two acyl-CoA carboxylases showed a clear difference in their substrate specificity. The acetyl-CoA carboxylase was able to carboxylate acetyl-, propionyl-, or butyryl-CoA with approximately the same specificity. The propionyl-CoA carboxylase could not recognize acetyl-CoA as a substrate, whereas the specificity constant for propionyl-CoA was 2-fold higher than for butyryl-CoA. For both enzymes the ε subunits were found to specifically interact with their carboxyltransferase component forming a β-ε subcomplex; this appears to facilitate the further interaction of these subunits with the α component. The ε subunit has been found genetically linked to several carboxyltransferases of differentStreptomyces species; we propose that this subunit reflects a distinctive characteristic of a new group of acyl-CoA carboxylases.

Stopps J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by ACC involves two separate reactions.1.HCO3−+Mg­ATP+enzyme­biotin↔enzyme­biotin­CO2−+Mg­ADP+Pi2.Enzyme­biotin­CO2−+acetyl­CoA↔enzyme­biotin+malonyl­CoASCHEME I ACC is composed of three different components, which allow it to carry out these two distinct reactions. The BC component catalyzes the first half-reaction which involves the phosphorylation of bicarbonate by ATP to form a carboxyphosphate intermediate, followed by transfer of the carboxyl group to biotin to form carboxybiotin. In vivo, biotin is attached to the BCCP, designated above as enzyme-biotin, via an amide bond between the valeric acid side chain of biotin and the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue. In the second reaction, catalyzed by carboxyltransferase, the carboxyl group is transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA.Animals contain all three of these components in one polypeptide chain. In contrast, three different proteins compose the Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis form of ACC (2Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3393-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, no other bacterial ACC have been studied in detail.Interestingly, several complexes with ACC activity have been purified from a number of actinomycetes and other bacteria. These complexes also possess the ability to carboxylate other substrates, including propionyl- and butyryl-CoA (8Henrikson K.P. Allen S.H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5888-5891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Huanaiti A.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem.

Consequently, these enzymes are referred to as acyl-CoA carboxylases, and all of them consist of two subunits, a larger one (the α-chain) with the ability to carboxylate its covalently bound biotin group, and a smaller subunit (the β-chain) bearing the carboxyltransferase activity. Little is known about the biochemistry and physiological role of these enzymes, and so far all of these complexes have shown, at least in vitro, higher affinity by propionyl-CoA compared with acetyl- or butyryl-CoA; therefore, many of them are called PCCs (EC 6.4.1.3). The quaternary structure of the acyl-CoA carboxylase complexes has been reported only in a few organisms, such as Mycobacterium smegmatis(α6β6) (11Hasse F.C. Henrikson K.P. Treble D.H. Allen S.H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 254: 11994-11999Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), Sacharopolyspora erythraea (α4β4) (9Huanaiti A.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and Myxococcus xanthus (α6β6) (12Kimura Y. Kojyo T. Kimura I. Sato M. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and in all cases the stoichiometry of the complex subunits was 1:1.Attempts to identify enzymes with acyl-CoA carboxylase activity inS. coelicolor led to the characterization of three complexes. The first one, purified by Bramwell et al. (13Bramwell H. Hunter I.S. Coggins J.R. Nimmo H.G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), showed specificity for propionyl-CoA; therefore, it was classified as a PCC. This enzyme consisted of a biotinylated protein, PccA, of 88 kDa, and a non-biotinylated component, the carboxyltransferase, of 66 kDa. In our laboratory, two new carboxylases from S. coelicolorhave been partially characterized at both the genetic and biochemical levels (14Rodrı́guez E. Gramajo H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3109-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Rodrı́guez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One of them was defined as a PCC, because a mutation in its carboxyltransferase component, pccB, affected only PCC activity levels (14Rodrı́guez E. Gramajo H. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3109-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This enzyme appeared to be formed by two subunits: the biotinylated α subunit, encoded by either of the two identical genes named accA1 and accA2, and the carboxyltransferase component, encoded by pccB. The third acyl-CoA carboxylase characterized was shown to be essential forS. coelicolor viability, and it was called ACC (15Rodrı́guez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An interesting characteristic of this complex was that a third subunit (ε), AccE, considerably enhanced the basal activity obtained by the α and β subunits, encoded by AccA2 and AccB, respectively.Little is known about the physiological role of acyl-CoA carboxylases in bacteria; although the PCC activity of these complexes should certainly be involved in the catabolic pathway of odd-chain fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids (16Rosemberg L.E. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Frederickson D.S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1983: 474-497Google Scholar). In Streptomyces we were able to demonstrate, by constructing a conditional mutant in its carboxyltransferase component, AccB, that the main physiological role of the ACC complex was that of an ACC that synthesizes malonyl-CoA for both fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis (15Rodrı́guez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because polyketide synthetases are large multienzyme systems that are responsible for the stepwise biosynthesis of complex natural products from simple 2-, 3-, and 4-carbon building blocks such as acetyl-, propionyl-, and butyryl-CoA and their activated derivatives malonyl-, methylmalonyl-, and ethylmalonyl-CoA (17Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 171: 88-106PubMed Google Scholar), it is obvious that the acyl-CoA carboxylases will certainly play a fundamental role for the biosynthesis of this pharmacologically important compounds (15Rodrı́guez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).In this paper we describe the kinetic properties of the two acyl-CoA carboxylases, ACC and PCC, previously described by our group (14Rodrı́guez E.

We also present data that address the functional significance of the ε subunit in both enzyme complexes and propose a new group of enzyme within the acyl-CoA carboxylases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Culture, and Transformation ConditionsE. coli strain DH5α was used for routine subcloning and was transformed according to Sambrook et al.

To improve the biotinylation of AccA2 in E. coli, the strains containing pTR204 were also transformed with pCY216 (23Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which overexpresses theE. coli biotin ligase (BirA); 10 μm d-biotin was also added to the medium. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh medium and grown toA600 0.5–0.8 before the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Induction was allowed to proceed for 8 h. The cells were harvested, washed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol).Protein MethodsCell-free extracts and purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. The final acrylamide monomer concentration was 8, 10, or 18% (w/v) for the separating gel and 5% for the stacking gel. Analytical gel electrophoresis of the native enzyme under nondenaturing conditions was carried out at 4 °C in a 6% polyacrylamide gel with Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, for 2 h. Alternatively, gels were soaked in 60 mm Tris-HCl and 40 mm CAPS at pH 9.4 and pre-run for 60 min before samples were loaded. Coomassie Brilliant Blue was used to stain protein bands. The biotinylated proteins were detected by modification of Western blotting procedure described by Nikolau et al. (25Nikolau B.J. Wurtele E.S. Stumpf P.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin conjugate (AP-streptavidin diluted 1:10,000) (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed according to Burnette (26Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar) using anti-PccB or anti-AccB, in a 1:1000 dilution. Anti-AccE and anti-PccE were used at a 1:500 dilution. Antigenic polypeptides were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-tagged secondary antibody. Antisera against PccB, PccE, AccB, and AccE were elicited in rabbits following conventional procedures (26Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar). Protein contents were determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar) or Lowry (28Lowry O. Rosebrough N.J.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as standard.ACC/PCC Assay: Radioactive MethodACC and PCC activities in cell-free extracts and in in vitroreconstituted complexes obtained by mixing purified proteins were measured following the incorporation of radioactive HCO3− into acid non-volatile material (9Huanaiti A.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Bramwell H. Hunter I.S. Coggins J.R. Nimmo H.G. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 μg of BSA, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mmNaH14CO3 (specific activity 200 μCi mmol−1 (740 kBq mmol)), 0.5 mm substrate (acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA), and 100 μg of cell-free protein extract in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NaH14CO3, allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 15 min, and stopped with 200 μl of 6m HCl. The contents of the tubes were then evaporated to dryness at 95 °C. The residue was resuspended in 100 μl of water, 1 ml of Optiphase liquid scintillation medium (Wallac Oy) was added, and 14C radioactivity determined in a Beckman scintillation liquid counter. Nonspecific CO2 fixation by crude extracts was assayed in the absence of substrate. One unit of enzyme activity catalyzed the incorporation of 1 μmol of 14C into acid-stable products/min.Coupled Enzyme AssayThe rate of ATP hydrolysis by biotin carboxylase was measured spectrophotometrically (29Janiyani K. Bordelon T. Waldrop G.L. Cronnan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29864-29870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The production of ADP was coupled to pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and the oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm. Assay were performed either in a microplate reader or a Varian spectrophotometer. In the first case, measurements were carried out in a volume of 0.2 ml in 96-well polycarbonate cuvettes. The assay mixture contained 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 0.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml BSA, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 3 mm ATP, 50 mmNaHCO3, and the appropriate concentrations of acetyl-, propionyl-, or butyryl-CoA. Reactions were initiated by addition of the different enzyme components. The amount of coupling enzymes was sufficient to ensure that the initial velocity varied linearly with enzyme concentration. Data were collected using a Dynex MRX microplate reader interfaced to a PC equipped with a data acquisition program. Temperature was maintained at 30 °C by a circulating water bath with the capacity to heat and cool the thermospace of the cell compartment. Measurements in a spectrophotometer were conducted in a mixture (0.7 ml) containing all ingredients except ATP and KHCO3. Cuvettes were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Oxidation of NADH was then recorded after addition of ATP until a stable base line was obtained, and the reaction was started by addition of NaHCO3. Initial velocities are obtained from initial slopes of the recorder traces. Under the assay conditions described, the reaction was linear for at least 3 min, and the initial rate of reaction was proportional to the enzyme concentration. One unit of enzyme activity catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of the respective carboxylated CoA derivative or ADP/min under the assay conditions described. Essentially identical activities are measured by the14CO2 fixation method and by spectrophotometric method. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of AccA2.High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)ACC and PCC activities were also analyzed by HPLC to confirm the products of the reactions. The samples were performed using a C18 column (Waters, μBondapak C18, 10 μm, 3.9 × 300 mm), eluted with a 45-min isocratic gradient of 1–30% methanol in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 4.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (Waters 600 Pump) and detection wavelength 254 nm (Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector). Detection of radioactive products was accomplished with a β-RAM flow-through detector (IN/US, Pine Brook, NJ). Unlabeled CoA and malonyl-, acetyl-, propionyl-, methylmalonyl-, and butyryl-CoA were added as internal standards.DNA ManipulationsIsolation of chromosomal and plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, and agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out by conventional methods (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 30Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F.

For this, pTR68 was digested with NotI and the large fragment religated to obtain pTRK1.pTRK3The synthetic oligonucleotides NACCE2 (5′-CCCATATGACCATCAAGGTCGTCCG), used to introduce an NdeI site at the translational start codon of the S. coelicolor pccE gene, and CACCE2 (5′-TATGCATCAGGTCGGCCAGTAGGTG) were used to amplify pccE. The PCR product was cloned using pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) inE. coli DH5α, yielding pTRK2. To generate apccE His tag fusion gene (full-length pccE fused to 6 His codons in its NH2 terminus), aNdeI-EcoRI fragment from pTRK2 was cloned inNdeI-EcoRI-cleaved pET28a (+) (Novagen), yielding pTRK3.pTRL1To generate an accB His tag fusion gene (full-length accB fused to 6 His codons in its NH2 terminus), the NdeI-NotI fragment from pTR90 was cloned in NdeI-NotI-cleaved pET28a(+), yielding pTRL1.pTR131The synthetic oligonucleotides NpccB (5′-TATCTAGACATATGTCCGAGCCGGAAGAG), used to introduce anNdeI site at the translational start codon of theS. coelicolor pccB gene, and CpccB (5′-TAGAATTCATGCATTGACAGGGGGATGTTGCC), which introduces anEcoRI site at the end of the ORF, were used to amplify the complete pccB. To generate a pccB His tag fusion gene (full-length pccB fused to 6 His codons in its NH2 terminus), the PCR product was digested withNdeI and EcoRI and cloned inNdeI-EcoRI-cleaved pET28a (+), yielding pTR131.pTR116This plasmid was constructed by cloning theNdeI-SacI fragment from pTR88 (15Rodrı́guez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), in aNdeI-SacI-cleaved pET28a(+).Protein Purification ProtocolsFor expression of tagged proteins, the plasmids pTR116 (His6-AccB, AccE), pTR131 (His6-PccB), pTRL1 (His6-AccB), pTRK3 (His6-PccE), and pTR237 (His6-AccE) were transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) or Rosetta (DE3) pLacI2. Protein expression was induced by adding 0.1 mm IPTG to cultures grown to A600 ∼ 0.8. Cells were resuspended in buffer A, disrupted by sonication, and the lysate clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a column of Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity column (Qiagen), equilibrated with the same buffer supplemented with 20 mm of imidazole. The column was subsequently washed and the His6-tagged proteins eluted from the column using binding buffer containing 150 mmimidazole. Fractions of the eluate were collected and analyzed for protein by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing purified proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.75 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol. Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration through a PM-3 membrane (Amicon) and stored at −80 °C.The biotin carboxylase subunit AccA2 was purified from cultures of BL21(DE3) harboring pTR204 and pCY216, which harbors the E. coli birA gene to allow high level of biotinylation of biotin-containing proteins. Protein expression were induced by addition of 0.1 mm IPTG and 0.5% arabinose (induction of biotin ligase). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in buffer A, and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. DNase was added to degrade nucleic acid. Ammonium sulfate was added to 50%, and the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein precipitate was resuspended in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a column of avidin-Sepharose (Bio-Rad), equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was subsequently washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer; biotinylated protein, AccA2, was eluted from the column using binding buffer containing 5 mm biotin. The fractions containing purified protein were dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.75 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol.Interaction AssayThe physical interaction of PccB with His6-PccE was assayed by the coexpression of genes encoding for PccB and His6-PccE from pTRK1 and pTRK3, respectively, in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLacI2(Novagen). Culture of this strain was grown at 37 °C and induction and protein purification carried out as described above. The outcome of this column was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The same assay was carried out with a cell extract containing only PccB to check for the existence of nonspecific interactions with the column.The physical interaction of AccE with His6-AccB was evaluated by the coexpression of genes encoding for His6-AccB and AccE from pTR116 in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Culture of this strain was grown at 37 °C and induction and protein purification carried out as described above. The outcome of this column was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.The interaction of PccB (or AccB) with AccA2 was studied in vitro by mixing purified H6-PccB (or His6-AccB) and AccA2, with or without addition of purified His6-PccE (or His6-AccE). After the incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the mixtures were passed through an avidin-Sepharose affinity column equilibrated and washed (10 volumes) with buffer A, and eluted with the same buffer containing 5 mm biotin. The outcome of this column was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.DISCUSSIONThe genetic characterization of two acyl-CoA carboxylases ofS. coelicolor, ACC and PCC (14Rodrı́guez E. Gramajo H.

In this study, the successful in vitro reconstitution of the ACC and PCC complexes from their purified components allowed us to carry out a primary characterization of these two enzymes complexes at a biochemical and structural level.All the acyl-CoA carboxylases (usually defined as PCC), isolated from diverse sources such as mammalian (32Kaziro Y.

The structure reveals a dimeric enzyme comprising two 8-fold β/α barrel domains, each bound to FMN, and a subunit folding topology and mode of flavin-binding similar to that found in Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase. The subunit interface of MR is formed by interactions from an N-terminal β strand and helices 2 and 8 of the barrel domain and is different to that seen in OYE. The active site structures of MR, OYE, and PETN reductase are highly conserved reflecting the ability of these enzymes to catalyze “generic” reactions such as the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone. A region of polypeptide presumed to define the reducing coenzyme specificity is identified by comparison of the MR structure (NADH-dependent) with that of PETN reductase (NADPH-dependent). The active site acid identified in OYE (Tyr-196) and conserved in PETN reductase (Tyr-186) is replaced by Cys-191 in MR.

Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). MR catalyzes the NADH-dependent saturation of the carbon-carbon bond of both morphinone and codeinone. The products of these reactions, hydromorphone and hydrocodone, are valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs; hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic (seven times more potent than morphine (2Melmon K. Morrelli H. Clinical Pharmacology: Basic Principles in Therapeutics. Macmillan Publishing Co., New York1972Google Scholar)), and hydrocodone is a mild analgesic and antitussive (3Moffat A. Jackson J. Moss M. Widdop B. Clarke's Isolation and Identification of Drugs. The Pharmaceutical Press, London1986Google Scholar). The synthesis of both compounds is complicated owing to difficulty in specifically oxidizing the C-6 hydroxy group of morphine and the often limiting supply of thebaine (a precursor for the synthesis of hydrocodone). These shortcomings have led to the development of novel recombinant biocatalytic routes for hydromorphone and hydrocodone synthesis (4Bruce N. French C. Hailes A. Long M. Rathbone D. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 200-205Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Biological synthesis exploits the ability of Escherichia coli, transformed with the genes encoding morphinone reductase and morphine dehydrogenase and fed with morphine or codeine, to accumulate hydromorphone and hydrocodone, respectively (5French C.E.

Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The folds of both OYE and PETN reductase comprise an 8-fold β/α barrel and reveal the presence of FMN bound at the C-terminal ends of the internal β-strands. The active sites are highly conserved, which reflects the ability of OYE and PETN reductase to reduce the unsaturated bond of a number of 2-cyclic enones (23Vaz A.D. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Williams R.E. Rathbone D. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C.E. Nicklin S. Ghisla S. Kroneck P. Macheroux P. Sund H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolf Weber, Berlin1999: 663-666Google Scholar). Additionally, PETN reductase has been shown to catalyze the denitration of nitroester explosives, the reduction of nitroaromatic explosives such as trinitrotoluene and picrate and degradation of the nitramine explosives (Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX)) (25Williams R.

Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21906-29012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MR shares with the other Class I subfamily members the ability to reduce a number of 2-cyclic enones and to form complexes with steroids (27French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, MR is distinct in its ability to reduce the unsaturated carbon-carbon bond of a number of opiate compounds (27French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment studies also suggest differences in the chemical nature of the active site of MR compared with OYE and PETN reductase (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To investigate these aspects, and to provide a structural basis for detailed mechanistic studies of MR, we have solved the structure of MR in complex with the opiate substrate codeinone at 2.2-Å resolution. The structure is discussed in the context of the mechanism of opiate reduction and in view of the existing structural information for PETN reductase and OYE. All materials were of analytical grade. Codeinone was a gift from MacFarlan Smith (Edinburgh, Scotland). Mimetic Yellow 2 affinity chromatography resin was from Affinity Chromatography Ltd. Q-Sepharose resin was from Amersham Biosciences. MR was purified from a recombinant strain of E. coli expressing the enzyme from the cloned mor B gene as described previously (27French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but also incorporating a final chromatographic step using Q-Sepharose. In this latter step, enzyme was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (8.5 cm × 5 cm) equilibrated with 30 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B). The column was washed with 2 liters of buffer B containing 230 mm NaCl and the enzyme was eluted using a gradient of NaCl (250–500 mm) contained in buffer B. For long term storage, MR was kept at −80 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The C191A mutant MR was isolated using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GTC CAC GCC GCC AAC GCC GCG CTG CCC AAC CAG TTC CTC-3′ and 5′-GAG GAA CTG GTT GGG CAG CGC GGC GTT GGC GGC GTG GAC-3′. Plasmid pMORB3 (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used as template for the mutagenesis reactions. The mutant gene was completely sequenced to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the mutagenesis reaction. Expression and purification of the C191A MR enzyme was as described for wild-type enzyme. Initial crystallization conditions for the enzyme have been described elsewhere (28Moody P.C.E. Shikotra N. French C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 619-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but conditions were refined in the course of the work described here. The optimum crystals were grown from 15–25% monomethyl polyethylene glycol 550, 0.1m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.5–7.5, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of the codeinone-enzyme complex were isolated by soaking the crystals in a solution comprising 1 mmcodeinone, 10 mm phosphate buffer, and 30% monomethyl polyethylene glycol at pH 6.2 for 20 min. The crystals could be flash-frozen directly, and data were collected in the home laboratory. The crystals belong to space group I212121 with cell dimensionsa = 49.9Å, b = 121.7 Å, and c = 178.2 Å and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. Data sets were obtained from single crystals mounted in rayon loops and cooled to −173 °C in a gas stream of N2. Three sets of data were used in the course of the work described here. The original data (2.5 Å) were collected using a RAXIS IIc image plate device mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode source with MSC/Yale mirrors. Subsequent 2.36-Å data were recorded at Station 7.2 of SRS (Synchrotron Radiation Source) Daresbury Laboratory with an MAR 180 image plate device, and final 2.2-Å data were recorded using a RAXIS IV image plate device mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode source with MSC/Yale mirrors. Data were processed and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Data statistics are presented in Table I. A random 5% set of the possible reduced data was selected and used to flag reflections for the calculation of free R values (30Brunger A.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The correct solutions to the rotation function had the highest peaks with a correlation coefficient of 14.8l; the next highest peaks had a value of 9.5. The translation function solution gave a coefficient of 29.1; this increased to a value of 40.2 upon rigid-body refinement (R = 49.4% for data in the range 20–4.0 Å). The starting model was made using the sequence alignment of French et al. (10French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6623-6627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); all non-conserved side chains were truncated to alanine or glycine ,and all insertions in the OYE sequence were deleted. FMN was not included in these molecular replacement calculations, but calculation of difference maps showed clear density for the cofactor, confirming that the correct solution had been chosen. Subsequent refinement was carried out with XPLOR version 3.843 (32Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). The model was broken into 12 segments (determined by secondary structure), and each segment was refined as a rigid body. Inspection of sigmaA (33Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar), and rebuilding was followed by simulated annealing and positional refinement. Further rounds of rebuilding and refinement reducedR (Rfree) for the data for 20–2.5 Å to 36.1% (38.0%) with 80 water molecules. The 2.36-Å data were collected from a crystal soaked with codeinone, and refinement was continued using CNS 0.5 (32Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S.

This included further rounds of rebuilding and refinement (both positional and temperature-factor) resulting in a model with R (Rfree) for data for 40–2.36 Å of 24.5% (28.1%). No interpretable density was seen in the active site, and further codeinone soaking steps were tried. The final 2.2-Å data were collected with a crystal soaked as described above. Refinement with these data used CNS 1.0 (32Brunger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G.

Codeinone was built into difference density using atomic parameters extracted from the Cambridge Structural Data base through the Chemical Data base Service at Daresbury Laboratory. The parameters for refinement were calculated with XPLOR2D (35Kleywegt G. Jones T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Refinement statistics and final model parameters are presented in Table I. The 2.2-Å data and coordinate files have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1GWJ). All kinetic studies were performed under strict anaerobic conditions (<5 ppm of O2) within a glove box environment (Belle Technology) to prevent oxidase activity of MR. Steady-state assays were performed using a Jasco V530 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Reaction buffer was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, which was made anaerobic by bubbling with humidified Pureshield argon at 5 p.s.i. for 2 h prior to introduction into the glove box. NADH solutions were made from pre-weighed powder and anaerobic buffer inside the glove box, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε340 = 6220m−1 cm−1). Solutions of 2-cyclohexenone were made by dilution of a stock (10 m) into anaerobic buffer. The initial velocity in steady-state assays was determined from absorbance changes at 340 nm in a reaction cell volume of 1 ml; the desired concentration of substrate and cofactor solutions was achieved by making microliter additions to the cell. Least squares fitting procedures to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation were performed using Origin (v6) software (Microcal). Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow instrument, and transients were analyzed using non-linear least squares regression using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Averages of five to seven individual transients were analyzed. The enzyme was contained in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. In the reductive half-reaction, enzyme (20 μm) was mixed with NADH at different concentrations (at least >5-fold the enzyme concentration to ensure pseudo-first order conditions). Flavin reduction was monitored at 462 nm; formation and decay of the enzyme-NADH charge-transfer species was monitored at 552 nm (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In studies of the oxidative half-reaction, MR was titrated with sodium dithionite to produce the 2-electron-reduced form of MR. Reduced MR (20 μm) was then mixed with 2-cyclohexenone at different concentrations, and flavin oxidation was monitored at 462 nm. Equations used to analyze the reductive half-reaction have been described elsewhere (36Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Analysis of the transients obtained for the oxidative half-reaction is described under “Results.” The structure of MR was determined at 2.2-Å resolution by molecular replacement using OYE as the search model. The structure reveals an 8-fold β/α barrel with non-covalently bound FMN located toward the center and C-terminal end of the barrel (Fig. 1A). The overall subunit structure is similar to that reported for OYE (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and PETN reductase (22Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it is closer to PETN reductase in that it has a β-loop excursion (comprising of residues 131–151) between β strand 3 and α-helix 3 of the core barrel domain instead of the helix found in OYE. Additionally, β-strands A and B form a cap at the N-terminal domain of the barrel, as seen also in OYE (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and PETN reductase (22Barna T. Khan H. Bruce N. Barsukov I. Scrutton N. Moody P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MR is dimeric, and the structure of the dimer (Fig. 1B) reveals that the subunit interactions are different from those reported for OYE (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In OYE, the dimer interface involves helices 4, 5, and 6 of the β/α barrel, but in MR the interface is less extensive and comprises interactions between the N-terminal β strands (strands A and B, Fig. 1B) and helices 2 and 8 of the barrel domain. The dimer interface in MR is not part of the highly conserved region identified by Fox and Karplus in their analysis of OYE (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In addition, in MR the C-terminal excursion of one subunit extends over the dimer interface and interacts with the corresponding extension from the second subunit (Fig. 1B). This C-terminal extension also partially defines the entrance to the active site of MR along with the polypeptide excursion found between β strand 3 and α-helix 3 of the core barrel domain. The active site structure of MR is presented in Fig.2A, alongside those for OYE and PETN reductase. Important differences in the active site of MR can be discerned. Tyr-196 in OYE is known to function as an active site acid in the oxidative half-reaction with α/β unsaturated enones (37Kohli R.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This residue is conserved in PETN reductase (Tyr-186), but in MR the equivalent residue is Cys-191. The active site of MR is larger than the corresponding site in OYE. This is primarily due to the presence of a largely hydrophobic insertion (residues Arg-291 to Glu-301) in OYE that is absent in MR, which lines the entrance to the active site close to the dimethylbenzene subnucleus of the flavin isoalloxazine ring. Wider access to the active site no doubt reflects the ability of MR to bind more bulky and conformationally restrained substrates such as codeinone and morphinone. His-191 and Asn-194 in OYE, which are involved in ligand binding (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 38Brown B.J. Deng Z. Karplus P.A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), are conserved in MR as His-186 and Asn-189. The nature of the flavin contacts in MR (Fig. 2B) are essentially identical to those described for OYE, except the O3 atom of the ribityl hydroxyl group is H-bonded to Asn-275 in MR, whereas in OYE this interaction is absent. A key interaction with the flavin is that made by residue Arg-238. The side chain of this group is located close to the N-1/C-2 carbonyl region of the flavin isoalloxazine ring, where it is expected that negative charge will develop during enzyme reduction. Although the positioning of a positively charged side chain in this region in many flavoproteins has been postulated to stabilize developing negative charge (and thus facilitate flavin reduction), our recent mutagenesis studies with MR indicate that Arg-238 is not required to stabilize the reduced flavin (39Craig D.H. Barna T. Moody P.C. Bruce N.C. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This finding is in stark contrast to similar work on lactate monooxygenase, where mutation of the positively charged residue at this region (Lys-266 to Met-266) impairs flavin reduction by substrate (40Muh U. Massey V. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7982-7988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADH is the natural coenzyme preference of MR. In contrast, PETN reductase, like OYE, has a strong preference for NADPH. The mode of binding NADPH in OYE is not clear; crystallographic studies with the NADP analogue (c-THN)TPN show changes in electron density, but more than one interpretation for the ADP portion has been presented (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the absence of a model for coenzyme binding, it is difficult to account for the differences in coenzyme specificity between the family members. Preference for NADPH is often conferred by the presence of two arginine residues in the vicinity of the 2′-phosphate group of the coenzyme (41Scrutton D.R. Robson P. Davies R.M. Nature. 1967; 213: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar,42Bocanegra J.A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), although it is important to note that these preferences are derived from a different protein fold. In NADH-dependent dehydrogenases these arginine residues are absent, and an acidic residue (aspartate or glutamate) forms a hydrogen bond to the 2′-hydroxy group of NADH (41Scrutton D.R. Robson P. Davies R.M. Nature. 1967; 213: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 42Bocanegra J.A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2737-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In searching for residues that confer coenzyme preference in the OYE family, we note from modeling studies in which the NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) portion of the coenzyme adopts a conformation similar to that seen in OYE (21Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that the polypeptide excursion between β-strand 3 and α-helix 3 of the core barrel domain might be positioned appropriately to form interactions with the distal part of the coenzyme. In PETN reductase two arginine residues (Arg-142 and Arg-130) are candidates to confer specificity for NADPH. In contrast, in the NADH-dependent MR these residues are absent and an acidic residue (Glu-135 for MR) is present. We suggest this region of the protein might be important in conferring coenzyme specificity. In OYE, however, the polypeptide excursion between β-strand 3 and α-helix 3 is replaced by a α-helix. If our proposed site for coenzyme recognition is correct, then the mode of interaction of the coenzyme in this region of OYE is different from that in PETN reductase and MR, making general conclusions concerning coenzyme recognition in the family difficult. However, there are a number of acidic and basic residues in this region of OYE that could form interactions with the reducing coenzyme in OYE. Our future studies are now focused on defining those residues that interact with NADH by mutagenesis and kinetic methods. We have made a number of attempts to soak ligands into the active site of crystalline MR. Our studies have included soaking steps with NADH and the oxidizing substrates 2-cyclohexenone and codeinone. Upon soaking crystals with NADH, the yellow appearance of the crystals fades indicating reduction of the enzyme-bound FMN. This reduction of the flavin occurs without crystal cracking, but analysis of frozen crystals showed no evidence for the presence of coenzyme in the active site. Our observations suggest that NADP+ and NADPH have relatively low affinities for reduced enzyme, consistent with a ping-pong reaction mechanism (27French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and with the known moderate affinity of reduced OYE for NADP+ (43Massey V. Schopfer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1215-1222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, analysis of crystals soaked with 2-cyclohexenone showed no evidence of ligand binding in the active site. In contrast, we have had some limited success in analysis of crystals soaked with the oxidizing substrate codeinone. The active site of the MR-codeinone complex clearly shows"

Among the three Shc isoforms, P66 and P52, but not P46, were found to interact with and activate c-Src in vitro and in vivo. Activation of c-Src accompanied autophosphorylation of c-Src in the activation segment, but the carboxyl-terminal dephosphorylation was not observed. We have identified the interaction sites between Shc and c-Src and constructed a point mutant of Shc that abolishes the c-Src activation. Using this mutant, we have confirmed that the Shc-mediated c-Src activation triggers Stat-p21/WAF1/Cip1 pathway that has been implicated in the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of epidermal growth factor-stimulated A431 cells.

Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). PTK activity was originally found to be associated with the translational product of the Rous sarcoma virus oncogene, v-src, which is responsible for the malignant transformation of cells infected with this virus (2Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Later on, a normal cellular homologue of v-src, named c-src, was identified in chicken cells and is now known to be widespread in higher eukaryotes. There are 12 exons in the chicken c-src (3Takeya T. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1983; 32: 881-890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), whereas v-src has no introns. It is believed that v-src has been derived from a spliced message of c-src, and thus the c-src gene is called a proto-oncogene. Products of v-src and c-src are proteins of 60 kDa and designated as v-Src and c-Src, or as p60v-src and p60c-src, respectively. After the discovery of the src genes, several closely related genes have been identified as oncogenes of viral origin and/or proto-oncogenes, and these are now classified into the Src family. The Src family members identified thus far are Src, Fyn, Yes, Fgr, Lck, Lyn, Hck, Blk, and Yrk (Refs. 4Cooper J.A. Kemp B.E. Peptide and Protein Phosphorylation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 85-113Google Scholar, 5Dymecki S.M. Zwollo P. Zeller K. Kuhajda F.P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol.

Therefore, c-Src is a prototype of the cellular members of the Src family kinases (SFKs). Like other Src family members, c-Src possesses structural features of the SFKs, including a unique amino-terminal region, Src homology (SH) 3 and SH2 domains, and the catalytic domain (also referred to as SH1 domain), as well as the non-catalytic regulatory sequence in the carboxyl terminus. The inactive SFKs are phosphorylated on the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue by another PTK, named Csk (8Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SH2 domain binds to this terminal phosphotyrosine residue through an intramolecular interaction, while the SH3 domain reinforces this interaction by binding to a proline-rich motif within the linker region between SH2 and catalytic domains (9Xu W.

Since the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine is absent from the v-Src sequence, the SH2 domain in v-Src cannot form the intramolecular interaction. This is thought to be the reason why the v-Src is deregulated and constitutively active. On the other hand, activity of the normal SFKs can be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue (11Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As to physiological function, the SFKs are physically coupled with various surface receptors (12Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 13Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). For example, Fyn is associated with the T-cell receptor, and Lyn with B-cell receptor, and Lck with CD antigens of T-cells. Some receptor-type PTKs, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and colony stimulating growth factor receptor, are also coupled with the SFKs. The SFKs are the immediate downstream targets in these cascades of receptor signaling upon agonist stimuli. In A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, for example, c-Src is shown to be activated and in complex with EGF receptor after a short period of EGF stimulation (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the above interaction between c-Src and EGF receptor seems to be indirect (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation mechanism under physiological conditions of the normal SFKs is not well understood. The adaptor protein Shc is another proto-oncogene product that has no intrinsic catalytic activity (16Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which Shc causes malignant cell transformation is not known. However, Shc possesses at least three tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its central collagen-homology domain and two phosphotyrosine-binding domains, one SH2 domain in the carboxyl terminus and another phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain in the amino terminus (17Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). So, it has been assumed that Shc will work as an adaptor molecule to mediate phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling events near the cell surface receptors. In fact, many studies demonstrated that several receptor PTKs have tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, which bind to Shc, and that the receptor-bound Shc becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by the receptor and recruits another SH2-containing adaptor protein, Grb2, to the phosphotyrosine residues. The activated receptor-Shc-Grb2 complex then triggers the Ras-mediated MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase cascade through a Ras-activating molecule, Sos (18Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R., Li, W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). It is also observed that Shc plays a role in the downstream signaling of non-kinase receptors, such as T-cell receptor, integrins, and G protein–coupled receptors (17Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this case, cytoplasmic PTKs seem to be responsible for the Shc phosphorylation. However, it is not clear how cytoplasmic PTKs are activated and interact with Shc. Another important issue is that Shc is usually expressed as three isoforms, P46, P52, and P66, in many types of cells. These isoforms are produced from one gene by alternative splicing and alternative translation (19Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T., Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). When the production of P66 isoform was specifically blocked in P66-knock-out mice, the mice showed prolonged viability under the oxidative stress (20Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). So, there might be isoform-specific functions for Shc proteins. Until now, however, the functional difference between the P46 and P52 isoforms has not been demonstrated. Recently, we have found that overexpression of P52 and P66 Shc isoforms, but not P46 isoform, induce c-Src activation in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to examine a direct interaction between Shc and c-Src molecules and the effect of the interaction on c-Src activity in vitro and in vivo. We show here that Shc-mediated c-Src activation results from a direct and site-specific interaction of Shc isoforms, namely P66 and P52, but not P46. The activation of c-Src is not accompanied by the dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal phosphotyrosine residue that has been believed to be important for the up-regulation of c-Src. It is also demonstrated that the Shc-mediated activation of c-Src is enhanced by the EGF signaling and leads to tyrosine-phosphorylation of Stat transcription factors and activation of p21/WAF1/Cip1 pathway that has been implicated in cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis of the A431 cells (21Chin Y.E.

Subconfluent cells were transfected for 24 h with plasmid DNAs encoding GFP fusion Shc isoforms (see below) by using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Germany), serum-starved for 18 h, and stimulated with or without 10 nm EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) as described previously (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Plasmids for bacterial or mammalian expression of GST and GFP fusion forms of mouse Shc were constructed as described (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding a series of fragment of mouse P52 Shc were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of mouse shc gene using the appropriate sets of sense and antisense primers and subcloned into pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences) or pEGFP-C3 (Clonetech Laboratories) expression vector. A point-mutated version of the P52 Shc (M46P) was obtained by ligating two cDNAs encoding residues 1–49 and 46–469 of P52, in which the nucleic acid residues encoding methionine (ATG) at residue 46 have been substituted by those encoding proline (CTG). DNA encoding the activation segment of c-Src (residues 404–432) was generated by PCR amplification of the corresponding region using the chicken c-src gene, which was subcloned in p5H (25Levy J.B.

The resulting DNA was purified and subcloned into pGEX-2T to be bacterially expressed as GST fusion protein (GST-IDA). All GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity column chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). Anti-Src (mAb327), anti-phospho-Tyr-416, and anti-phospho-Tyr-527 antibodies were obtained from Oncogene Research Products. Antibodies specific to the unphosphorylated Tyr-527 of c-Src (anti-Tyr-527) or carboxyl terminus of human EGF receptor (anti-EGF receptor) were prepared as described (15Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M.

Anti-phosphorylated p42/p44 MAP kinase antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-p21/WAF1 antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). c-Src, v-Src, and EGF receptor were prepared from bovine brain, Rous sarcoma virus-transformed mouse cells, and A431 cells, respectively, as described (15Sato K.

Synthetic peptides (IDA peptides) that correspond to the activation segment of c-Src, MAP kinase, PKA, EGF receptor, or CDK1 and a tyrosine kinase substrate peptide (Cdc2 peptide: residues 7–26 of the fission yeast Cdc2) were prepared as described (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These antibodies and peptides were used at concentrations as specified in the text. The Src-specific inhibitor PP2 and its inactive analogue PP3 (28Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S.

To analyze protein function in A431 cells, EGF-treated or untreated cells were extracted with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentration was determined by the dye binding assay using a Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad). Specified amounts of the extracted proteins (1 mg/ml protein) were subjected to examinations for tyrosine phosphorylation, coimmunoprecipitation, expression, subcellular localization, and enzyme activity of proteins by immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting as described (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the analysis of nuclear localization of STAT3, nuclear fraction was prepared according to the described method (23Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Protein kinase activity was assessed by in vitro kinase assay in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA), a substrate peptide, and the specified amounts of effector molecules such as recombinant Shc proteins, synthetic IDA peptides, EGF, and cAMP. Kinase reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. After terminating the reaction by boiling with SDS-containing buffer, phosphorylated peptide and protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by BAS 2000 phosphoimage analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Tyrosine phosphorylation state of c-Src was determined by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Direct binding of recombinant Shc proteins to the activation segment of c-Src (GST-IDA, see above) was determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using BIAcore 1000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-IDA was immobilized onto a sensor tip that had been coated with carboxyl-methylated dextran and activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Association of the Shc proteins with the immobilized GST-IDA was carried out in buffer supplied by the manufacturer at 25 °C for 600 s and followed by wash treatment for 300 s. Dissociation constants between Shc and GST-IDA were calculated by employing software from BIA Evaluation (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). Affinity pull-down of cellular c-Src and Shc were carried out with recombinant Shc and GST-IDA, respectively. The reaction involved incubation of the specified amount of cell lysate with recombinant Shc and GST-IDA (1–5 μg of protein) immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads at 30 °C for 30 min, and wash treatment of the beads with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to eliminate nonspecific binding. Bound proteins in the washed beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting and/or protein staining. We analyzed isoform-specific function of Shc in A431 cells that transiently express GFP-tagged Shc isoforms (Fig.1A). Since our previous studies have shown that EGF induces association of EGF receptor with c-Src and activation of c-Src (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we first confirmed the effect of Shc isoforms on the interaction between c-Src and EGF receptor. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of GFP-Shc P52 or P66, but not P46, resulted in an augmentation of EGF-dependent association of c-Src with EGF receptor and caused an activation of c-Src in A431 cells. Both endogenous and GFP-tagged P52/P66 were coimmunoprecipitated with c-Src, but neither endogenous P46 nor GFP-P46 was associated with the c-Src-EGF receptor complex. The result demonstrates that P52 and P66, but not P46, Shc can mediate up-regulation of both basal and EGF-stimulated activities of c-Src. We have also observed stimulation of the basal c-Src activity by overexpression of Shc P52/P66 in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitation of Shc P52/P66 with c-Src suggests that the up-regulation of c-Src may involve a direct interaction of Shc molecules with c-Src. To clarify the physiological consequence of this Shc isoform-specific c-Src activation, we have examined phosphorylation of Stat transcription factors and expression of p21/WAF1/Cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. It has been reported that EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat is dependent on c-Src activity in A431 cells (23Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and the phosphorylated Stat undergoes nuclear translocation and induces p21/WAF1/Cip1 expression (21Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M., Su, W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1C, the EGF-dependent Stat3 phosphorylation is sensitive to PP2, a Src-specific inhibitor, while phosphorylation of EGF receptor and EGF-dependent activation of p44/p42 MAP kinase are scarcely affected by the inhibitor. Thus, the EGF-dependent Stat phosphorylation is a good indicator for EGF-dependent c-Src activation in this cell system. In Fig. 1D, we examined phosphorylation of Stat proteins in GFP- or GFP-Shc-expressing cells that had been pretreated with PP2 or PP3 (an inactive analogue of PP2) and incubated with or without EGF. We found phosphorylation of Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5b in all of the EGF-stimulated cells. Prominently, in the cells expressing GFP-Shc P52 or P66, Stat phosphorylation was observed even in the absence of EGF stimulation (lanes 9 and 13). Control cells expressing GFP alone or the cells expressing GFP-Shc P46 did not show such an EGF-independent activation of c-Src (lanes 1 and 5). Phosphorylation of Stat proteins was effectively inhibited by PP2. However, phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat5b seemed to be less sensitive to PP2, when cells were stimulated with EGF. This result suggests that other PTKs, such as EGF receptor itself, may be partially involved in the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat5b. The phosphorylation of Stat3 was accompanied by its accumulation in the nucleus and well correlated with the expression of p21/WAF1/Cip1. Fig. 1D also shows phosphorylation state of c-Src that was monitored by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (lower panels). It is demonstrated that activation of c-Src by EGF stimulation or by the expression of GFP-P52/P66 involved the autophosphorylation of Tyr-416 in the activation segment of c-Src. Importantly, however, the activation of c-Src was not accompanied by dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal phosphotyrosine residue (phospho-Tyr-527). The result implies that the EGF- and Shc-dependent stimulation of c-Src activity is not resulted from an activation of phosphatase(s) that can dephosphorylate phospho-Tyr-527. To examine whether Shc proteins can activate c-Src directly, we employed anin vitro reconstitution assay with purified proteins. We used down-regulated, i.e. enzymatically inactive but activable, c-Src that was purified from bovine brain and glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged Shc isoforms expressed inEscherichia coli. As shown in Fig.2A, GST-P66 and P52, but not GST-P46 or GST alone, stimulated the activity of purified c-Src in a dose-dependent manner. This result strongly suggests that Shc isoform-specific c-Src activation is mediated by a direct interaction between c-Src and Shc molecules. As shown in Fig.2B, the purified c-Src incubated with GST-P52 Shc underwent autophosphorylation at Tyr-416 under the in vitro assay conditions, but dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal phospho-Tyr-527 was not observed (lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, incubation of c-Src with alkaline phosphatase clearly reduced phosphorylation state of both sites (lanes 3and 4). These results indicate that the c-Src activation by Shc is not mediated by Shc-dependent stimulation of any phosphatase activity that may dephosphorylate phospho-Tyr-527 and activate c-Src. It is also demonstrated in Fig. 2C that the GST-P52-dependent kinase activation is specific to c-Src. The constitutively active v-Src, EGF receptor, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were not stimulated by GFP-P52. The result eliminates the possibility that GST-P52 is a nonspecific activator of protein kinases, for instance, an inhibitor of ATPase that may contaminate the in vitro assay system. We have previously found that synthetic peptides corresponding to the activation segment of c-Src, named IDA peptides, can affect the interaction between c-Src and Shc-EGF receptor complex (14Sato K. Kimoto M. Kakumoto M. Horiuchi D. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 749-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). So we examined the effect of IDA peptides on the Shc-dependent activation of c-Src. As shown in Fig.2D, activation of c-Src by GST-Shc P52 was inhibited by the IDA-Src peptide in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Tyr-416 in the peptide did not affect this inhibitory action. IDA peptides corresponding to other protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, MAP kinase, EGF receptor/kinase, and CDK1) had no inhibitory effect on the c-Src activation by Shc. These results suggest that the interaction between c-Src and Shc involves the activation segment of c-Src and is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation state of the segment. To confirm this, we prepared IDA-Src peptide fused with GST (GST-IDA) and tested whether it can pull down Shc molecules from cell extract. Fig. 2E shows that GST-IDA but not GST can bind to the endogenous Shc P52 in this affinity pull-down assay. However, apparent binding of Shc P66 was not detected in this experiment. We think this is probably because P66 is less abundant than P52 in the extract (see the first lane). Although isoform specificity of the interaction was not confirmed by this experiment, it is demonstrated that the unphosphorylated activation segment of c-Src can bind to Shc. To confirm the isoform-specific direct binding of Shc to the activation segment of c-Src, we have employed surface plasmon resonance analysis in which GST-IDA surface was tested for the interaction with GST-Shc isoforms (Fig. 3A). P52 and P66 isoforms fused to GST were found to interact with GST-IDA, whereas GST-P46 or GST alone did not exhibit significant binding. Neither GST-P52 nor GST-P66 interacted with GST surface (data not shown). The dissociation constants (KD) for GST-P52 and GST-P66 were calculated to be 1.8 ± 0.4 × 10−8m and 5.3 ± 0.8 × 10−8m, respectively. The result clearly demonstrates that the binding of Shc to c-Src is direct and isoform-specific. To identify the c-Src-interactive site(s) in Shc molecule, we have prepared a series of recombinant Shc fragments and used them in an affinity pull-down experiment (Fig. 3B). We found that GST-P52, but not GST-P46, interacted with c-Src in the extract of A431 cells. A fragment of P52 Shc having residues 1–45 still showed a notable binding toward c-Src. However, fragments shorter than this lost the binding capacity. Deletion of amino-terminal residues up to 28 from P52 Shc did not abolish the binding capacity. Therefore, the binding capacity of Shc was mapped between residues 29 and 45 of P52 Shc in this assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, the affinity pull-down of c-Src with GST-Shc P52 was inhibited by the IDA peptide derived from c-Src but not by those from other protein kinases, confirming that GST-Shc P52 is interacting with c-Src via the activation segment of c-Src. We also examined c-Src binding capacities of Shc fragments by surface plasmon resonance analysis. The results obtained are summarized in Fig.4, along with those obtained for c-Src activation assays with the same Shc fragments. In addition to the Shc fragment having residues 1–45 that was positive in the pull-down assay (Fig. 3B), a fragment corresponds to residues 1–39 was newly found to be capable of c-Src binding in this analysis. To our surprise, however, when we performed activation assay with these Shc fragments, they did not show any stimulating effect on the c-Src kinase activity. This result indicates that the c-Src binding capacity of Shc can be discriminated from the c-Src activation ability as depicted in Fig. 4B. In other words, c-Src binding of Shc is not sufficient for c-Src activation. From a structural analysis of the PTB domain of Shc (29Zhou M.M. Ravichandran K.S. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Sattler M. Halian J.E. Wade W.S. Burakoff S.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), it has been shown that there are three α-helices in the PTB domain. The first α-helix (α1) is present in the c-Src activation region of P52 Shc (residues 40–47). This helix is not included in the phosphophotyrosine binding pocket of PTB domain. So, we assumed that any helix-disrupting mutation in this α1-helix might specifically abolish the c-Src-activating property of Shc without affecting the PTB function, for instance, binding to the activated EGF receptor. Moreover, such a mutation would not affect the c-Src binding capacity of Shc, because it still has the region responsible for the c-Src"
https://openalex.org/W2138111547,"We have previously described a new aspect of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins anti-apoptotic activity that involves the TAK1/JNK1 signal transduction pathway (1Sanna M.G.

Our findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism that regulates the anti-apoptotic activity of IAPs that is separate from caspase inhibition but instead involves TAK1-mediated activation of JNK1. In a search for proteins involved in the XIAP/TAK1/JNK1 signaling pathway we isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening a novel X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP)-interacting protein that we called ILPIP (hILP-Interacting Protein). Whereas ILPIP moderately activates JNK family members when expressed alone, it strongly enhances XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. The expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 blocked XIAP/ILPIP synergistic activation of JNK1 thereby implicating TAK1 in this signaling pathway. ILPIP moderately protects against interleukin-1β converting enzyme- or Fas-induced apoptosis and significantly potentiates the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP. In vivo co-precipitation experiments show that both ILPIP and XIAP interact with TAK1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. Finally, expression of ILPIP did not affect the ability of XIAP to inhibit caspase activation, further supporting the idea that XIAP protection against apoptosis is achieved by two separate mechanisms: one requiring JNK1 activation and a second involving caspase inhibition.

Whereas ILPIP moderately activates JNK family members when expressed alone, it strongly enhances XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3. The expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 blocked XIAP/ILPIP synergistic activation of JNK1 thereby implicating TAK1 in this signaling pathway. ILPIP moderately protects against interleukin-1β converting enzyme- or Fas-induced apoptosis and significantly potentiates the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP. In vivo co-precipitation experiments show that both ILPIP and XIAP interact with TAK1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6. Finally, expression of ILPIP did not affect the ability of XIAP to inhibit caspase activation, further supporting the idea that XIAP protection against apoptosis is achieved by two separate mechanisms: one requiring JNK1 activation and a second involving caspase inhibition.

Apoptosis is involved in many diverse homeostatic processes in multicellular organisms, both during development and in the mature organism, and is increasingly being recognized as a biological process of critical importance, not only in normal physiology but also in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar, 4Jaattela M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 5Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is genetically determined and controlled through the expression of an increasing number of genes, many of which are conserved in nematodes, mammals, and viruses (6Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are the most extensively studied activators of apoptosis. Among the anti-apoptotic gene products is the IAP1 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis) family of proteins. Initially discovered in baculovirus, where they were shown to be involved in suppressing the host cell death response to viral infection (7Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 8Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), IAP homologues were then isolated in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, yeast, and mammalian organisms. To date, seven members of the IAP family have been identified in mammalian cells, with XIAP being the most extensively studied member of the family (9Rothe M. Pan M.G. Henzel W.J. Ayres T.M.

The diversity of stimuli against which the IAPs suppress apoptosis is greater than that observed for any other family of apoptotic inhibitors. At least one suggested mechanism of IAP apoptotic suppression appears to be through direct caspase inhibition. Several of the human IAP family proteins have been reported to directly bind and inhibit specific members of the caspase family (17Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). XIAP has been shown to participate in the BMP signaling pathway by binding with both the BMP receptor and the adaptor molecule TAB1, which is a co-activator of TAK1, thus linking the BMP receptors to TAB1-TAK1 and therefore participating in the bone morphogenic protein-signaling pathway involved in mesoderm induction and patterning in earlyXenopus embryos (18Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). XIAP also stimulates NF-κB via the TAK1 signaling pathway (19Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Stehlik C. Binder B.R. Lipp J. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22064-22068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we have recently described an alternative mechanism for the IAP anti-apoptotic protection, which is distinct from caspase inhibition and involves activation of the MAPK JNK1 through the TAB1·TAK1 complex (1Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar,2Sanna M.G. da silva Correia J. Ducrey O. Lee J.

Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). XIAP involvement in signal transduction pathways is still poorly characterized. Few proteins have been shown to interact with XIAP. A recently described XIAP-interacting protein is SMAC/DIABLO, which promotes caspase activation by binding and inhibiting the IAPs (21Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 22Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). XAF1 has also been reported to bind to XIAP and inhibit its anti-apoptotic effect apparently by triggering the redistribution of XIAP from the cytosol to the nucleus (11Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). However, none of these interactions has been correlated with the XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1. This led us to search for new XIAP-interacting proteins and to investigate their role in the XIAP/TAK1/JNK1 signaling cascade. A cDNA fragment encoding human XIAP was amplified by PCR and inserted into the XhoI site of pBD-GAL4 Cam (Stratagene, LA Jolla, CA) to generate pBD-GAL4 Cam/XIAP. After verification of the sequence, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CG1945 cells (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were sequentially transformed with pBD-GAL4 Cam/XIAP and human fetal brain library (Matchmaker, CLONTECH, 108cfu/ml) in pACT using a lithium acetate transformation protocol. Selection was done by growth on synthetic (SD) medium (yeast nitrogen base/dextrose/essential amino acids) lacking histidine, uracil, and tryptophan (CLONTECH). Twenty clones exhibiting activation of the lacZ reporter gene were identified among 3 × 106 transformants by the β-galactosidase assay. A few clones showing a strong reproducible interaction with XIAP were chosen. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast colonies by a glass bead phenolchloroform extraction protocol (CLONTECH). Escherichia coli DH5α bacteria cells were transformed with the plasmids and bacteria containing the pACT vector were selected on ampicillin-resistant plates. The pACT plasmids were isolated from E. coli and restriction-mapped (XhoI), and the sequence of the insert was determined. The partial cDNA two-hybrid clone was used to design a probe to screen a human liver Uni-ZAP cDNA lambda library (Stratagene) and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques. Phage plaques were isolated and screened to verify the cDNA size by PCR using the T3 and T7 primers. The phagemid pBluescript vector carrying the cDNA of nine individual clones was isolated byin vivo excision from the Uni-ZAP vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The isolated cDNAs were sequenced, and sequences were analyzed using the GCG Sequence Analysis software package (Madison, WI). The full-length ILPIP gene encoding an ∼2.4-kb cDNA was subcloned by BamHI-XhoI restriction sites into pcDNA3 vector encoding an HA tag at the N terminus. The sequence contains an initiator methionine, a stop codon, and a poly-adenylation tail and provides evidence for a novel gene, which we have named ILPIP. Northern blot was performed using the partial ILPIP cDNA isolated from the two-hybrid system following standard procedures. Plasmids encoding JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, p38, ERK2, β-gal-ICE, XIAP, TAB1, and ASK1 (KM, lysine 709 to methionine) used in this study have been previously described (1Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). TAK1 was expressed in pCMV6. TRAF6 and TRAF6Δ (amino acids 1–287 deleted at the N terminus, therefore expressing only the TRAF domain) were expressed in pRK5. The capacity of TAK1 (KW, lysine 63 to tryptophan) to act in a dominant negative manner was determined previously (23Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915PubMed Google Scholar). ILPIPα and ILPIPβ were expressed in pcDNA3 with an HA or FLAG tag. Human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, each well of a six-well plate was seeded with 7 × 105 cells. Cells were transfected 18 h later using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) for 3 h and incubated for 18 h before lysis. MCF7-Fas cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection each well of a six-well plate was seeded with 2.5 × 105 cells and 24 h after plating were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (150 ng/ml). After 16 h, cells were fixed and stained as described below. Stable transfectants were obtained as follows: human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were transfected with pBMN-Z-I-Blasto, pBMN-TAK1(K63W)-I-Blasto, or pBMN-ASK1(KW)-I-Blasto by calcium phosphate precipitation and selected in medium containing blasticidin S (10 μg/ml) (23Lee J. Mira-Arbibe L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 68: 909-915PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysis was performed for 30 min at 4 °C with lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 137 mmNaCl, 3 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Expression of MAPK proteins was quantified by densitometry after Western blot analysis, and equivalent amounts were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (see below) before performing the kinase assay. HA- and Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using 20 μl of agarose-Protein A (Pierce) preincubated with anti-HA antibody or anti-Myc antibody (5 μg, Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively) and FLAG-tagged proteins with 20 μl of agarose conjugated with the M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.). In vitro kinase assays was performed as previously described (1Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) with the difference that a 30-min incubation time was used for the detection of JNK2 and JNK3 kinase activity. UV activation of JNK1 was carried out in 293T cells as previously reported (1Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids together with a β-galactosidase expressing vector and stained with X-gal (reagent for β-galactosidase expression) to allow visualization of transfected cells and morphology observation. Quantification of apoptotic cells was determined at the microscope by counting over five fields for each sample. Apoptotic cells appear to be smaller, rounder, and show condensed and misshapen nuclei compared with viable cells, which are flat, well spread, and with easily discernible nuclei. Protein expression for all the transfected constructs was assessed by Western blot on duplicate lysates of original transfections used for the apoptosis assays. Cell were C. O. transfected with the indicated plasmids together with green fluorescent protein vector (CLONTECH Laboratories) to allow quantitation of transfection efficiency. Annexin V-PE staining was performed as suggested by the manufacturer (BD PharMingen). Briefly, adherent cells were detached from the plates and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. After removing the supernatant, cells were washed with Annexin V binding buffer and centrifuged again, and the supernatant was decanted by inversion of the tube. Cells were resuspended, and Annexin V-PE conjugate (5 μl) was added to each sample, incubated for 10 min in the dark, and then analyzed by FACS within 1 h. Death by apoptosis was quantified both by X-gal staining of cells and Annexin V-PE-FACS analysis for each experiments. The results obtained using the two different techniques were comparable, and therefore only the x-gal data are shown. Cells were washed extensively and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 14 mmpepstatin A, 100 mm leupeptin, 3 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium fluoride. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were recovered. Cell lysates were pre-cleared three times for 20 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and mixed with specified antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in blocking buffer (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with the specified antibody for 2 h and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at ambient temperature. Specific bands were revealed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translation of TAK1 was performed using standard procedures (Promega). XIAP-GST protein was expressed from a pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) and purified as suggested by the manufacturer and JNK1-HIS protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Glutathione- or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-conjugated beads (from Sigma and Qiagen, respectively) were used to precipitate XIAP-GST and JNK1-HIS. Binding assays were performed in lysis buffer, and TAK1 interaction with XIAP or JNK1 was detected by Western blot using an anti-TAK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cytosolic extracts from transfected 293T (100-mm dishes) were prepared essentially as described previously (24Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar), with several modifications (25Deveraux Q.L. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 154-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed once with ice-cold buffer A and pelleted by centrifugation. Packed cell pellets were suspended in 1–2 volumes of buffer A, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then disrupted by 15–30 passages through a 26-gauge needle. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for “cell-free” assays. For initiating caspase activation, 10 μm horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) together with 1 mm dATP was added, and the assays were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. 1 μl (10 μg of total protein) was measured for caspase activity by monitoring the release of AFC DEVD-containing synthetic peptides using continuously reading instruments as described previously (26Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Fluorogenic 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC) caspase substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC) was purchased from Sigma. As a first step in the characterization of the XIAP/JNK1/TAK1/TAB1 interactions, we used a XIAP-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion construct as bait in the two-hybrid system to screen a human fetal brain cDNA-Gal4 activation domain function library (Matchmaker, CLONTECH). Among the selected primary transformants, positive yeast colonies were independently identified and isolated. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast cells, and the sequence of the insert was determined. This process lead to the identification of a 700-bp cDNA sequence. This partial cDNA two-hybrid clone was used to design a probe to screen a human liver Uni-ZAP cDNA lambda library (Stratagene). The library screen yielded the parent 2.4-kb cDNA containing an initiator methionine, a stop codon, and a poly-adenylation tail that encoded for a 418-amino acid protein that we have named ILPIPα (Fig.1A). The predicted ILPIP amino acid sequence revealed that ILPIP is identical to ALS2CR2, a novel gene identified within the ALS2 (juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) critical region (27Hadano S. Yanagisawa Y. Skaug J. Fichter K. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Scherer S.W. Nicholson D.W. Rouleau G.A. Ikeda J. Hayden M.R. Genomics. 2001; 71: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the protein level, the strongest homologies were found with serologically defined breast cancer antigen NY-BR-96 (∼20% identity, 46% homology) and with SPAKs (STE20/SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinases), a member of the Ste20/SPS1 family of kinases and other Ste20-like kinases (Fig.1B, up to ∼20% overall amino acid identity, ∼45% similarity). ILPIP has a putative protein kinase domain (amino acids 58–369, Fig. 1C) with a hypothetical ATP-binding site located at the N terminus of the protein and several serine, threonine, or tyrosine active and phosphorylation sites toward the C terminus (Fig. 1C). In the same screening, a shorter isoform encoding a protein of 280 amino acids was isolated (Fig.1A). The shorter isoform was named ILPIPβ and originates from a methionine at amino acid 139 of the ILPIPα due to an insertion in the 5′ region of the gene (data not shown), which introduces two stop codons before the initial ILPIPα methionine. The existence of the ILPIPα and β isoforms was confirmed by RT-PCR on RNA extracted from several different cell lines. Two PCR products were obtained, and sequence analysis matched the original sequences for ILPIPα and β. Northern blot analysis revealed that ILPIP is expressed in normal tissues as a single 2.4-kb transcript with higher levels of expression in muscle, liver, and heart (Fig. 2). ILPIP was also expressed as a 2.4-kb band in human embryonic kidney cells (293T) (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Tissue distribution and expression pattern of ILPIP mRNA. Northern blot analysis of ILPIP. A32P-radiolabeled DNA fragment of ILPIP was hybridized at high stringency to a nitrocellulose membrane bearing 2 μg of poly(A) RNA/lane isolated from normal human tissues (CLONTECH). A single 2.4-kb transcript was detected using the ILPIP probe with higher levels of expression in muscle, liver, and heart. ILPIP was also expressed as a 2.4-kb band in human embryonic kidney cells. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used to check equal loading of RNA. The size of the transcripts is shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1 is necessary for its anti-apoptotic (1Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Sanna M.G. da silva Correia J. Ducrey O. Lee J. Nomoto K. Schrantz N. Deveraux Q.L. Ulevitch R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus we addressed the question whether expression of ILPIP alone or ILPIP and XIAP together would have an effect on MAPK activation. 293T cells were co-transfected with vectors encoding for JNK1, JNK2, or JNK3 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of plasmids encoding for ILPIP or XIAP, alone or in combination. Expression of MAPK proteins was quantified by densitometry after Western blot analysis and equivalent amounts were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h. Kinase activity was measured using ATF-2 as substrate. As previously reported XIAP expression increased JNK1 activity. Expression of ILPIPα or ILPIPβ also resulted in a slight increase in JNK activity. However, co-expression of ILPIPα with XIAP, and to a lesser degree ILPIPβ, resulted in a marked synergistic activation of JNK1 that was comparable to UV activation (Fig.3A). Cooperative activation of JNK2 and JNK3 was also observed, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 3B). Expression of ILPIPα or ILPIPα plus XIAP had no effect on p38 or ERK2 activation (data not shown). Therefore ILPIP acts synergistically with XIAP in specifically activating JNK family members. XIAP is known to protect against a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Because XIAP and ILPIP synergistically activated JNK1 and XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1 is important for the protection against apoptosis, we investigated whether ILPIP and XIAP also cooperatively protect against apoptosis. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding for ICE-β-galactosidase in the presence of increasing amounts of XIAP or ILPIP DNA, alone or in combination. A green fluorescent protein-expressing vector was used as negative control. Each apoptotic assay was quantified both with X-gal staining of cells and Annexin V-PE-FACS analysis. The results obtained using the two different techniques were comparable, and therefore only the data from representative experiments performed with X-gal are shown. Expression of ILPIP was able to partially inhibit ICE-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A), although this effect was not as pronounced as that of XIAP. However, ILPIP remarkably enhanced XIAP protection against ICE-induced apoptosis (up to 90% of viable cells), suggesting that ILPIP and XIAP cooperatively protect against ICE-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in MCF7/Fas cells when apoptosis was induced by treating the cells for 18 h with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 4B). ILPIPα partially protected against Fas-induced apoptosis and significantly potentiated the protective effect of XIAP. We have previously reported that XIAP-mediated activation of JNK1 involves the MAP3 kinase TAK1. To investigate if the synergistic effect of ILPIP on XIAP-mediated JNK1 activation was also dependent on TAK1, 293T stably transfected cells expressing either LacZ control vector or catalytically inactive TAK1 (TAK1 (KW)) were transfected with vectors encoding for XIAP or ILPIPα, alone or in combination, and JNK1 activation was determined. 293T cells stably expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of ASK1 (ASK1 (KM)) were also used as a control of specificity. XIAP-, ILPIPα-, or XIAP/ILPIPα-mediated JNK1 activation was inhibited in the presence of TAK1 (KW) (Fig.5B), whereas LacZ or ASK1 (KM) had no effect (Fig. 5, A and C). These data suggest that activation of JNK1 by ILPIPα or XIAP and the synergistic activation of JNK by ILPIP and XIAP are dependent upon TAK1. Because TAK1 appears to transmit the signal between the XIAP, ILPIPα, and JNK1, we investigated the possibility that XIAP and ILPIPα would physically interact with TAK1. In an in vivo binding assay, vectors encoding XIAP-FLAG or ILPIPα-FLAG were co-transfected with wt TAK1-HA or AKT-HA as a control of specificity in 293T cells. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody (Fig.6A). Cell extracts were also directly subjected to immunoblot analysis to check for protein expression. TAK1 was found to co-precipitate with XIAP and ILPIPα, suggesting that an interaction exists between these proteins. Results were confirmed by reverse co-precipitation using anti-HA antibody (data not shown). It has been previously reported that TAK1, TRAF6, TAB1, and TAB2 associate in a complex (28Takaesu G.

https://openalex.org/W1966832597,"Cytochromes P450 (CYP) constitute the major enzymatic system for metabolism of xenobiotics. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional activation of CYPs by the drug-sensing nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and the chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR) can be modulated by endogenous cholesterol and bile acids. Bile acids induce the chicken drug-activated CYP2H1 via CXR, whereas the hydroxylated metabolites of bile acids and oxysterols inhibit drug induction. The cholesterol-sensing liver X receptor competes with CXR, pregnane X receptor, or constitutive androstane receptor for regulation of drug-responsive enhancers from chicken CYP2H1, human CYP3A4, or human CYP2B6, respectively. Thus, not only cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), but also drug-inducible CYPs, are diametrically affected by these receptors. Our findings reveal new insights into the increasingly complex network of nuclear receptors regulating lipid homeostasis and drug metabolism. Cytochromes P450 (CYP) constitute the major enzymatic system for metabolism of xenobiotics. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional activation of CYPs by the drug-sensing nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and the chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR) can be modulated by endogenous cholesterol and bile acids. Bile acids induce the chicken drug-activated CYP2H1 via CXR, whereas the hydroxylated metabolites of bile acids and oxysterols inhibit drug induction. The cholesterol-sensing liver X receptor competes with CXR, pregnane X receptor, or constitutive androstane receptor for regulation of drug-responsive enhancers from chicken CYP2H1, human CYP3A4, or human CYP2B6, respectively. Thus, not only cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), but also drug-inducible CYPs, are diametrically affected by these receptors. Our findings reveal new insights into the increasingly complex network of nuclear receptors regulating lipid homeostasis and drug metabolism. cytochrome P-450 phenobarbital liver X receptor farnesoid X receptor constitutive androstane receptor pregnane X receptor chicken xenobiotic receptor 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor ligand-binding domain PB-responsive enhancer module chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase PB-responsive enhancer unit cholic acid deoxycholic acid chenodeoxycholic acid hemagglutinin geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate upstream activating sequence hyocholic acid hyodeoxycholic acid Cytochromes P450 (CYPs)1are heme-containing enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of lipophilic substrates in all species. In the liver, a subset of members of the CYP gene superfamily metabolize xenobiotics such as drugs, food additives, and pollutants (1Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Some of these CYPs can be transcriptionally regulated by their own substrates and by other compounds. The barbiturate phenobarbital (PB) represents a class of inducers that activate predominantly the CYP2B and CYP2C subfamilies, whereas the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the antibiotic rifampicin exemplify drugs that elevate CYP3A levels in man. Induction of drug metabolism has important clinical consequences, causing altered pharmacokinetics of drugs and carcinogens, drug-drug interactions, and changes in the metabolism of steroids, vitamin D, and other endogenous compounds. Other types of hepatic CYPs occupy key positions in the biosynthesis and metabolism of numerous endogenous molecules including steroids, bile acids, fatty acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, biogenic amines, or retinoids. As examples, CYP51 converts lanosterol into cholesterol, whereas CYP7A1 catalyzes the first step of cholesterol metabolism into bile acids (2Nelson D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Like xenobiotic-metabolizing CYPs, some of the CYPs that hydroxylate endogenous substrates are also regulated transcriptionally by their substrates or metabolites. In the mouse, CYP7A1 is induced by oxysterols and inhibited by bile acids (3Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of many CYPs is carried out by members of the gene superfamily of nuclear receptors (3Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 4Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The relative lipophilicity and small size of inducer compounds allows either direct diffusion or facilitated transport into the cell and interaction with specific intracellular receptors, which then bind to their respective DNA recognition elements arranged as repeats of hexamer half-sites in the 5′-flanking regions of CYPs (5Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) and the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) bind oxysterols and bile acids, respectively, and are key players in the regulation of CYP7A1 (3Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of CYP7A1 by LXR in rodents is counteracted by high bile acid levels that activate FXR. FXR subsequently increases the transcription of the small heterodimerization partner that acts as an inhibitor of several nuclear receptors, including LXR (7Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

Although induction of CYPs by PB has been described over 40 years ago, our understanding of the molecular mechanism is still fragmentary. Recently, the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) (alternatively called steroid and xenobiotic receptor or pregnane-activated receptor), and chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR) were discovered to be involved in drug induction of CYP2Bs, CYP3As, and CYP2H1 in humans, mice, and chickens, respectively (4Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 5Waxman D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Savas U.

A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In mammals, CAR and PXR exhibit overlapping substrate and DNA recognition specificity, and the exact contribution of these two receptors to drug induction has not been fully elucidated (10Xie W.

In chickens, only one xenobiotic-sensing orphan nuclear receptor has been identified. It might constitute the ancestral gene that diverged into CAR and PXR in mammals (9Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Despite this apparent difference, the molecular mechanism of drug-mediated CYP induction is conserved at the level of both nuclear receptors and DNA recognition elements from birds to humans (9Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Handschin C. Meyer U.A. J. Biol.

Apparently, many CYPs are responsible for maintaining both lipid homeostasis and detoxification of lipid-soluble drugs and xenobiotics (4Honkakoski P. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the xenosensor PXR is also activated by endogenous bile acids and involved in hepatic detoxification of excess bile acid levels (13Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report, we describe experiments concerning the role of xenobiotic-sensing nuclear receptors in lipid homeostasis as well as the role of cholesterol- and bile acid-sensing nuclear receptors in drug metabolism. Moreover, we present a hypothesis on how these nuclear receptors might interact with each other and thus provide a sensitive regulatory network that controls both lipid and xenobiotic levels. These findings also provide insight into the evolution of these systems and suggest that our body might recognize lipophilic xenobiotics as a kind of “toxic bile acids.” Full-length receptor coding sequences from chicken CXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor γ (RXRγ), FXR, and LXR were amplified and subcloned into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene, Basel, Switzerland). Chicken CXR (amino acids 97–391), FXR (amino acids 194–473), and LXR (amino acids 126–409) ligand binding domains (LBD) fused to the yeast GAL4 transcription factor DBD were obtained by PCR amplification of the LBDs of the nuclear receptors and subsequent subcloning of the PCR products in frame into the expression plasmid pA4.7, a kind gift from Dr. A. Kralli (Division of Biochemistry, Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland). An N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was produced using the oligonucleotides 5′-AAT TCC CAT GTA CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC TG-3′ and 5′-AAT TCA GCG TAA TCT GGA ACA TCG TAT GGG TAC ATG GG-3′ synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The double-stranded oligonucleotide was ligated into the EcoRI site of the pSG5-CXR expression vector. The (UAS)5-tk-CAT reporter plasmid was generously provided by Dr. S. A. Kliewer (Department of Molecular Biology, University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Oligonucleotides for the wild type CYP2B6 51-bp PB-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) and the corresponding 51 bp where the hexamer half-sites of the two DR-4 elements were mutated into SacII and EcoRV sites, respectively, were synthesized by Microsynth. Similarly, a wild type ER-6 element from the CYP3A4 promoter and a corresponding element with mutations in the intrinsic DR-4 element were obtained. Human LXRα in the CMX expression vector was a kind gift of Dr. R. M. Evans, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA. Human RXRα expression plasmid was generously provided by Dr. P. Chambon (IGBMC, Université Louis Pasteur, Illkirch, France). A pGL3basic plasmid containing 13 kb of the human CYP3A4 5′-flanking region was a kind gift of Dr. C. Liddle (University of Sydney at Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia). This construct was digested with XbaI and SpeI, and the resulting 343-bp fragment was further cut with HincII. The 228-bp xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module was subsequently used in electromobility shift assays and has been described (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cultivation of LMH cells in Williams E medium and transfection with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were performed as described (16Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stöckli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Before transfection, cells were kept in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells were then plated on six-well dishes, and medium was replaced 4 h after transfection by induction or control medium, respectively, both lacking fetal calf serum. 16 h after drug treatment, the cells were harvested, and nonradioactive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed using the CAT-ELISA kit according to the manual of the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell extracts were also used for the determination of protein concentration using the ESL protein assay for normalization of specific CAT expression to total protein content (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection and drug treatment of CV-1 cells was performed as described (16Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stöckli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for CAT using a CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and β-galactosidase activities were determined. CAT concentrations were then normalized against β-galactosidase values in order to compensate for varying transfection efficiencies. Electromobility shift assays were performed as published (16Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stöckli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To test for supershifts, 0.5 μl of either monoclonal anti-mouse RXR rabbit antibody (kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon, IGBMC, Université Louis Pasteur, Illkirch, France) or of a 200-μg IgG/ml anti-HA high affinity rat monoclonal antibody solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the reaction mix. CV-1 cell cDNA was used in PCRs for 40 cycles using an annealing temperature of 61.5 °C with the following primers: human CAR (5′-GAG GGC TGC AAG GGT TTC TTC AGG AGA-3′ and 5′-CAG CAG GCC TAG CAA CTT CGC ATA CAG A-3′), human PXR (5′-ATC AAG CGG AAG AAA AGTGAA CGG ACA G-3′ and 5′-GAG GGG CGT AGC AAA GGG GTG TAT G-3′), human LXRα (5′-CAG AGC CCC CTT CAG AAC CCA CAG AGA T-3′ and 5′-GAG CAA GGC AAA CTC GGC ATC ATT GAG-3′), human LXRβ (5′-CAC AGT CAC AGT CGC AGT CAC CTG-3′ and 5′-GAG AAC TCG AAG ATG GGG TTG ATG AAC T-3′), human FXR (5′-GTT TCT ACC CCC AGC AGC CTG AAG AGT G-3′ and 5′-CAG CGT GGT GAT GAT TGA ATG TCC GTA A-3′), and human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5′-CGG GAA GCT TGT CAT CAA TGG AAA TC-3′ and 5′-GCC AAA TTC GTT GTC ATA CCA GGA AAT G-3′). Bands or regions of the expected sizes (864 bp for CAR, 900 bp for PXR, 869 bp for LXRα, 532 bp for LXRβ, 1134 bp for FXR, and 766 bp for GAPDH, respectively) were excised from the gel, subcloned, and sequenced. A probe for chicken CYP7A1 was amplified from chicken cDNA using degenerate primers based on the mammalian CYP7A1 sequences and verified by sequencing. A more comprehensive analysis and characterization of full-length chicken CYP7A1 mRNA will be published elsewhere. Northern hybridizations were carried out as described (16Handschin C. Podvinec M. Stöckli J. Hoffmann K. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1571-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In rats, CYP2B2 mRNA levels are elevated when blocking cholesterol biosynthesis using the squalene synthase inhibitor squalestatin or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor fluvastatin or lovastatin (19Kocarek T.A. Kraniak J.M. Reddy A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Kocarek T.A. Reddy A.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Kocarek T.A. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 120: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This induction can be prevented by replenishing cholesterol levels with oxysterols. The same results were obtained with chicken CYP2H1 and CYP3A37 mRNA in the chicken hepatoma cell line LMH (22Ourlin J.C. Handschin C. Kaufmann M. Meyer U.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the CYP2H1 5′-flanking region, a 264-bp PB-responsive enhancer unit (PBRU) was isolated, and within this enhancer fragment, a DR-4 element was identified to be essential for conferring drug induction (14Handschin C. Meyer U.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether inhibition of CYP2H1 induction by oxysterols is mediated by this PBRU. As shown in Fig.1a, both the PB and the clotrimazole induction were reduced when co-incubated with either 10 μm 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R), 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S), or 20 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol (25O), whereas none of the oxysterols affected the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU alone. We also tested the effect of bile acids on the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU, because bile acids are able to induce CYP2H1 and CYP3A37 mRNA (22Ourlin J.C. Handschin C. Kaufmann M. Meyer U.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At 100 μm, a concentration that physiologically occurs in bile or in cholestatic livers (23Setchell K.D. Rodrigues C.M. Clerici C. Solinas A. Morelli A. Gartung C. Boyer J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 226-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 24Fischer S. Beuers U. Spengler U. Zwiebel F.M. Koebe H.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 251: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), cholic acid (CA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CCA) all induced CAT reporter gene levels driven by the 264-bp PBRU in LMH cells (Fig. 1b). Surprisingly, co-incubation of these bile acids with PB or clotrimazole reduced the effect of the drugs (data not shown). Thus, both oxysterols and bile acids modulate drug induction of the 264-bp PBRU, comparable with their effects on CYP2H1 mRNA (22Ourlin J.C. Handschin C. Kaufmann M. Meyer U.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The 264-bp PBRU is activated by the chicken xenobiotic-sensing orphan nuclear receptor CXR (9Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether oxysterols or bile acids directly affect this receptor. An expression vector for GAL4(DBD)-CXR(LBD) fusion proteins together with the GAL4 upstream activating sequence (UAS) in a reporter gene vector were co-transfected into CV-1 cells, and reporter gene levels were measured after incubation with drugs, oxysterols, or bile acids. As shown in Fig.1c, none of the oxysterols had an inhibitory effect on either PB or clotrimazole induction of the CXR-LBD. In contrast, the CXR-LBD was activated by the bile acids DCA and CCA (Fig.1d). Apparently, the inhibition of the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU by oxysterols is not directly mediated by CXR, whereas CXR itself constitutes a low affinity bile acid receptor. In order to be able to test candidate receptors that might be responsible for the oxysterol and bile acid effects, we cloned the chicken LXR and chicken FXR orthologs. A cloning strategy similar to the one used for the isolation of chicken CXR was designed (9Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Binding of the chicken CXR, LXR, and FXR to the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU was examined to see if the observed effects of oxysterols and bile acids on drug induction are directly mediated by these receptors. Electromobility shift assays with radiolabeled 264-bp PBRU as probe showed that neither the chicken RXRγ, CXR, LXR, nor FXR bound alone to this enhancer element (Fig.2a, lanes 2–5). Heterodimers of CXR or LXR with RXR shifted the probe (lanes 6 and 8, arrow b), and this complex could be supershifted when adding anti-RXR antibody (lanes 9 and 11, arrow c). In contrast, FXR was not able to bind to the 264-bp PBRU together with RXR (lanes 7 and 10). Thus, multiple chicken nuclear receptors are able to bind to this PBRU and others found in the CYP2H1 5′-flanking region (15Handschin C. Podvinec M. Looser R. Amherd R. Meyer U.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 681-689PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the observed LXR interaction with the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU, we examined whether CXR and LXR bind to the same DR-4 element within this PBRU that has previously been shown to be responsible for CYP induction by CXR (9Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In electromobility shift assays, CXR/RXR heterodimers bound strongly to the radiolabeled, wild type 264-bp PBRU and much more weakly to the radiolabeled 264-bp PBRU containing mutations in both hexamer half-sites of the DR-4 element (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 5, arrow b). Similarly, LXR/RXR heterodimers only bound to the wild type 264-bp PBRU but not to the DR-4 mutant (lanes 4 and 6). Apparently, both CXR and LXR heterodimerize with RXR and bind to the same sequence elements on the 264-bp PBRU. Since LXR and CXR bind to the same DR-4 element, electromobility shift assays were used to elucidate if LXR and CXR directly compete for binding to this PBRU. To clearly discriminate between complexes containing CXR or LXR, an HA tag was N-terminally attached to CXR, and an anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used to supershift complexes that include HA-CXR. Constant LXR concentrations were titrated against increasing concentrations of HA-CXR with chicken RXR and anti-HA antibody included in all reactions (Fig. 2c, lanes 3–12). With increasing HA-CXR levels, a shift that is lower compared with the LXR/RXR shift (lane 2, arrow c) and a supershift became gradually visible, and the LXR/RXR shift decreased correspondingly (lanes 3–12, arrow b for the HA-CXR/RXR shift, arrow c for the LXR/RXR shift and arrow d for the supershift). The lower shift (arrow b) and the supershift (arrow d) were also observed in a control reaction with HA-CXR and RXR (lane 13).Vice versa, in electromobility shifts using constant amounts of HA-CXR and increasing levels of LXR, the HA-CXR/RXR supershift was gradually reduced (Fig. 2d). These results imply that LXR and CXR directly compete for heterodimerization with RXR and subsequent binding to the DR-4 element in the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU. It is realized that in vitro electromobility shift assays do not allow a conclusion about the relative affinities of the different nuclear receptor heterodimers to the DNA-binding sites in vivo. However, these experiments demonstrate that both LXR/RXR and CXR/RXR heterodimers bind to the same DR-4 sites and that, by changing the concentration of one of the components, changes in the binding of the rival complex can be observed. Functional evidence for the inhibitory action by LXR was also obtained by experiments in LMH cells transfected with the 264-bp PBRU using varying concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid. After 16 h of treatment, the 264-bp PBRU was only activated by micromolar concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid, much more than required to activate RXR in permissive nuclear receptor heterodimers (Fig. 3a). This suggests that CXR is nonpermissive like PXR and CAR (25Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D. Tomkinson N.C. LeCluyse E.L. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In LMH cells transfected with the 264-bp PBRU, 10 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R) or 0.1 μm 9-cis-retinoic (9-cis-RA) acid only marginally change reporter gene levels after 16 h (Fig.3b). In striking contrast, the combination of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid synergistically inhibits drug induction of the 264-bp PBRU (Fig.3b). Further proof for the involvement of LXR was obtained by treating LMH cells with 25 μm geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), an inhibitor of LXRα that reduces the interaction between LXRα and the nuclear receptor co-activator SRC-1 (26Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer G.J., Jr. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Gan X. Kaplan R. Menke J.G. MacNaul K. Chen Y. Sparrow C.P. Zhou G. Wright S.D. Cai T.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48702-48708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). GGPP was able to induce the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU after a 16-h treatment (Fig. 3c). These results strongly suggest that the permissive oxysterol receptor LXR (28Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar) is responsible for the oxysterol-mediated inhibition of drug induction. Moreover, these results suggest that LXR might inhibit xenosensor-mediated drug induction by other mechanisms in addition to mere competition for binding to the DR-4 site. In mammals, CYP3As and to a lesser extent CYP2Cs and CYP2Bs are capable of hydroxylating bile acids (29Araya Z. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Furster C. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, a specific subset of hydroxylated bile acids were shown to induce both LXRα and LXRβ in transactivation assays (31Song C. Hiipakka R.A. Liao S. Steroids. 2000; 65: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Assuming that chicken CYP2H1 is also involved in bile acid hydroxylation, we tested the effect of 6α-hydroxylated CCA (hyocholic acid (HC)) and 6α-hydroxylated lithocholic acid (hyodeoxycholic acid (HD)) on drug induction of the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU and on activation of chicken LXR and FXR, respectively. As depicted in Fig.4a, 10 μm HC or HD had no effect on the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU alone, but both compounds severely reduced PB and clotrimazole induction comparable with 10 μm 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S) after 16-h induction in LMH cells. In CV-1 cell transactivation assays with the GAL4(DBD)-LXR(LBD) and GAL4(DBD)-FXR(LBD) fusion proteins and the GAL4-response element UAS in a reporter gene vector, HC and HD activated the chicken LXR LBD (Fig.4b). In contrast, chicken FXR LBD was not affected by hydroxylated bile acids after a 24-h incubation at a dose of 10 μm (Fig. 4c). As control compounds, the oxysterols 20α-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 4b, 20α (10 μm)) and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S, 10 μm) strongly activated chicken LXR. The oxysterols 19-hydroxycholesterol (19O, 10 μm), 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22R, 10 μm), and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25O, 20 μm) showed relatively small effects (Fig. 4b). Moreover, 25 μm GGPP inhibited both 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol- and hyodeoxycholic acid-mediated induction of LXR (Fig. 4b). DCA and CCA markedly activated the chicken FXR construct GAL4(DBD)-FXR(LBD) in CV-1 cell transactivation assays, whereas cholic acid (CA) had no effect (Fig. 4c). Thus, chicken LXR and FXR exhibit similar activation patterns as their mammalian orthologs (3Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hydroxylated bile acid-mediated activation of chicken LXR is responsible for the inhibition of the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU. Having established the cross-talk between LXR and the xenobiotic-sensing orphan nuclear receptor CXR in chicken, we wanted to know whether a corresponding regulatory mechanism of LXRα competing with PXR and CAR exists in humans. Accordingly, electromobility shift assays with wild type and mutated radiolabeled human CYP3A4 xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and CYP2B6 51-bp PBREM (32Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6043-6046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) showed specific binding of human PXR, human CAR, and human LXRα, each of these receptors heterodimerized with RXRα. This binding was only observed when using the wild type probe but not with mutated probe, as shown for the CYP2B6 PBREM (Fig.5a, lanes 2–7 and lanes 9–14). PCR amplifications of CV-1 cDNA revealed the presence of LXRα, LXRβ, and FXR in this monkey kidney epithelial cell line, whereas expression of neither PXR nor CAR could be detected (data not shown). To establish a direct role of LXR in mediating the inhibitory effect, we transfected the CV-1 cells with increasing concentrations of LXR and measured activation of the chicken CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU (Fig.5b). After co-transfecting the CYP2H1 264-bp PBRU, chicken LXR, and CXR, CV-1 cells were treated with either vehicle, 20 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 5b, 25O), 10 μm clotrimazole (clo) or combinations of these compounds. Increasing concentrations of co-transfected LXR decreased the reporter gene expressio"

This study shows that the N-terminal domain represses topoisomerase activity in the absence of nucleotide, and nucleotide binding is sufficient to relieve the repression.

Mutants lacking all or part of the latch relax DNA in the absence of nucleotide, indicating that this region mediates topoisomerase repression.

Nucleotide hydrolysis is essential to the specificity of reverse gyrase for increasing the linking number of DNA.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). They change the topological state of DNA by altering its linking number, i.e. the number of times that one strand of the double helix crosses the other. They use a three-step mechanism of cleavage, strand passage, and religation. In the first step, a nucleophilic tyrosine attacks the phosphodiester backbone, cleaving the DNA and leading to a covalent intermediate of protein-DNA termed the “cleavage complex.” Type I topoisomerases cleave one strand of the duplex; type II enzymes cleave both strands. The enzyme, covalently attached to the cut DNA, separates the free ends of the cleaved strand(s) and allows the other strand of the duplex (type I), or another region of duplex (type II), to pass through this gap. The protein then reseals the backbone of the cleaved DNA and releases the product. Although all topoisomerases can relax supercoiled DNA, only prokaryotic gyrase is able to introduce negative supercoils in DNA. This type II topoisomerase uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to reduce the linking number, leading to an underwound, or negatively supercoiled, product. Until recently, gyrase was the only topoisomerase known to supercoil DNA. Later, another supercoiling enzyme was discovered and named reverse gyrase, because it increases the linking number, leading to overwound, or positively supercoiled, product (2Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 3Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase is the only topoisomerase known to overwind DNA. So far it has been found exclusively in hyperthermophiles, organisms that live above ∼80 °C (4Bouthier de La Tour C. Portemer C. Nadal M. Stetter K.O. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bouthier de La Tour C. Portemer C. Huber R. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3921-3923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the protein in vivo remains unclear (6Déclais A.-C. Bouthier de La Tour C. Duguet M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 334: 146-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); one suggestion is that it rewinds the DNA strands in regions of the chromosome that have opened up to allow transcription or replication (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such strand separation at the growth temperatures of hyperthermophiles could be lethal if the strands do not re-associate efficiently. Reverse gyrase belongs to the family of type IA topoisomerases (3Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,8Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de La Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which includes the well-studied topoisomerases I and III fromEscherichia coli. Reverse gyrase differs from other type I enzymes in three key respects. First, whereas type I enzymes can only relax supercoiled DNA, reverse gyrase positively supercoils. Second, reverse gyrase requires nucleotide hydrolysis for this activity (2Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,10Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This property makes reverse gyrase akin to type II topoisomerases in general, all of which require ATP hydrolysis, and specifically to gyrase, which couples ATP hydrolysis to supercoiling. Lastly, in the presence of ATP, reverse gyrase performs the strand passage step unidirectionally: It can increase the linking number of DNA but not decrease it (3Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, topoisomerase I can relax either negatively or positively supercoiled DNA (11Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), corresponding to an increase or a decrease in linking number, respectively. The N-terminal domain of reverse gyrase provides the ATP energy to drive positive supercoiling by the topoisomerase domain. Understanding how the two domains interact is therefore critical for understanding the enzyme's mechanism. The crystal structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus reverse gyrase revealed a bimodular enzyme comprising an N-terminal domain with a pair of RecA-like folds homologous to the ATPase domains of helicases, and a C-terminal domain highly homologous to E. coli topoisomerase I (12Rodrı́guez A. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The structure immediately suggested a basis for the interaction between the two domains. Residues 352–427 of the N-terminal domain form a “latch” that clamps down over the topoisomerase module. We predicted that the latch would mediate part or all of the communication between the domains. This report explores the role of the latch in the reverse gyrase mechanism. Although the N-terminal domain allows positive topoisomerization in the presence of ATP, it uses the latch to repress topoisomerization in the absence of nucleotide. This study also examines aspects of the protein's DNA-binding behavior, its selectivity for nucleotide cofactor, and the relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and unidirectional strand passage. An A. fulgidus reverse gyrase expression clone (pRGY1N) was constructed as described previously (12Rodrı́guez A. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The clone contains two PCR-induced mutations, Pro-719 → Leu and Leu-1046 → Met. Expression clones containing just the Pro-719 → Leu mutation or neither mutation were created by movingSacI-BamHI or NsiI-BamHI cassettes, respectively, from an error-free PCR clone into pRGY1N. The topoisomerase domain was subcloned from pRGY1N and inserted into pRET3a using NdeI and BamHI sites encoded in the primers. The subclone begins with a Met, followed by Glu-478 and extends through the natural end of the gene into a Gly-(His)6 sequence as in pRGY1N. Deletion mutants of reverse gyrase were created by PCR amplification using a mutagenic primer to fuse, in-frame, the sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the region to be deleted. The mutated fragments were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and inserted into pRGY1N cut in the same way. The Δlatch mutant (missing residues 360–418) and Δ370 mutant (missing residues 370–381) were created with a MunI-NsiI cassette, and the Δ857 mutant (missing residues 857–866) was created with anSfiI-BamHI cassette. The Tyr-809 → Phe mutant of reverse gyrase was created by the megaprimer method (13Sarkar G. Sommer S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant PCR product was digested with SacI and BamHI and inserted into pRGY1N. The Δlatch(Y809F) mutant was created by moving the Tyr-809 → Phe cassette (SacI-BamHI) into the Δlatch background. All mutant constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli C41(DE3) (14Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Freshly transformed colonies were cultured overnight, then inoculated into 2 × YT containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm atA600 = 0.6–0.8, and the temperature was reduced to 18 °C. Cells were left to grow an additional ∼16 h, harvested, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 300 mm NaCl), and stored at −80 °C. The following procedures were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise noted. Cells were thawed rapidly at room temperature, sonicated, and spun for 30 min at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor. The supernatant was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. The resin was washed in 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with 150 mm imidazole. Protein fractions were pooled and concentrated on YM-30 concentrators (Amicon). To maintain solubility during concentration of the protein, buffer A containing 5m NaCl was added to the Ni2+ column pool until the final NaCl concentration was 1 m. Alternatively, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The concentrate was applied to a 26/60 Sephacryl S300 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 200 mm NaCl; 10 mm MgCl2; 0.02% NaN3). The reverse gyrase peak was pooled, concentrated in YM-30 concentrators, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA assay (Pierce). Protein dilutions for experiments were made in buffer B. Unless stated otherwise, 30-μl reactions were set up in “standard reaction buffer” (50 mm Tris-Cl, (pH 8.0); 30 mm NaCl; 10 mm MgCl2; 0.02% NaN3) containing 2 μg of negatively supercoiled pBR322 and 1 mm of the indicated NTP. The NaCl concentration includes salt contributed by the addition of enzyme. (Reactions with the topoisomerase domain alone also contained 1 mmDTT,1 0.5 mmEDTA, and 5% glycerol, but these components can be omitted.) Reactions were overlaid with mineral oil and incubated 30 min at 80 °C, then halted by the addition of “stop” buffer (5× concentrations: 48% glycerol (v/v), 40 mm EDTA, 5% SDS (w/v), 0.05% NaN3). The reactions were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels at room temperature. The gel was run in one dimension for 2.5 h, soaked in running buffer supplemented with 4.5 μg/ml chloroquine (Aldrich) for 2 h, then run in the orthogonal dimension for 2 h. The second dimension was performed with fresh running buffer supplemented with 4.5 μg/ml chloroquine. Both dimensions were performed at 120 V (voltage limiting) in a running buffer of 40 mm Tris and 380 mmglycine. The gel was stained with 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 35 min, destained in water, and photographed with a digital camera. Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Substrates were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, incubated at 65 °C for 20 min to inactivate the kinase, and passed over a NAP-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unincorporated label. Substrates containing single- and double-stranded regions (“mixed” substrates) were taken from a study examining the DNA-binding behavior of Thermus aquaticus DnaB helicase (15Kaplan D.L. Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6889-6897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequence of the duplex region is 5′-CGAGCACCGCTGCGGCTGCACC. Tailed substrates were created by adding extensions of polydeoxythymidine to either the 5′- or 3′-end of this strand. The complementary strand was labeled on its 5′-end and supplemented with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide to allow accurate quantitation. The labeled strand was annealed with a 2-fold excess of the appropriate partner strand in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3. The 52-bp duplex substrate has the sequence 5′-CGGAAAAGGCTGGAGTTGGGACTGAGAATCTCATCGGCTACTATCATGGCAG (and its complement), corresponding to bases 368–419 of the A. fulgidus reverse gyrase gene. The strand whose sequence is given was 5′-radiolabeled, diluted with unlabeled strand, and annealed with the complementary oligonucleotide as described for the mixed substrates. Reactions (30 μl) were assembled at room temperature in standard reaction buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8.3% (v/v) glycerol, and 12 fmol of the indicated DNA substrate. No nucleotide was included. The reactions were left for 20 min at room temperature then electrophoresed at 20 mA on native gels prepared with 0.5× Tris-borate (1× concentrations: 90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid) and either 10% polyacrylamide (37.5:1, v/v) for duplex and mixed substrates or 12% polyacrylamide for single-stranded substrates. Reactions (30 μl) were set up with 7.8 pmol of the indicated protein in standard reaction buffer containing 8 nm φX174 single-stranded DNA (New England BioLabs) and 100 μm of the indicated dNTP spiked with 2.5 μCi of the same dNTP radiolabeled on either the α- or γ-phosphate (∼3000–6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). ATP radiolabeled on the γ-phosphate was used for experiments comparing rates of ATP hydrolysis by full-length reverse gyrase and deletion mutants. Extent of hydrolysis was determined by charcoal adsorption assay. Reactions were incubated at 80 °C for the indicated times, then halted by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and placing the tubes on ice. When all time points had been processed, 700 μl of 5% (w/v) activated charcoal (suspended in 20 mm H3PO4) was added to the reactions, which were vortexed briefly, then spun at 4 °C for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. A 500-μl portion of the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and centrifuged for 10 min. Finally 300 μl of this supernatant was added to 5 ml of FluoranSafe 2 (BDH) and counted in a Beckman LS6000 scintillation counter. For experiments comparing hydrolysis of different dNTPs or NTPs by full-length reverse gyrase, nucleotides radiolabeled on the α-phosphate were used. Extent of hydrolysis was determined by quantitation of the relative amounts of (d)NTP and corresponding diphosphate, which were resolved by thin-layer chromatography. Reactions were incubated at 80 °C for the indicated times then halted by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mm and placing the tubes on ice. One μl of the reactions was spotted onto Polygram CEL 300 polyethyleneimine plates (Aldrich) and developed for 2 h at room temperature with 1 m acetic acid/0.8 m LiCl. The plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and nucleotide peaks were quantitated with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length reverse gyrase gene from A. fulgidus was overexpressed in E. coli (12Rodrı́guez A. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This clone contains two mutations created during PCR: Pro-719 to Leu, and Leu-1046 to Met. The protein with or without the two mutations behaves similarly in positive supercoiling assays (data not shown), but changing Leu-719 back to the native Pro creates a clone extremely toxic to the cells and reduces expression levels 30-fold. The “wild-type” and mutant reverse gyrases described in this report carry both mutations. In the absence of divalent metals, A. fulgidus reverse gyrase aggregates at NaCl concentrations below 600 mm, similar to Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Methanopyrus kandleri reverse gyrases (16Nadal M. Jaxel C. Portemer C. Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Duguet M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9102-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Krah R. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13986-13990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, the protein remains soluble down to 200 mm NaCl. In the presence of excess DNA, no salt is needed to keep the protein in solution. A. fulgidus reverse gyrase shows a marked dependence on temperature for carrying out its positive supercoiling reaction (Fig.1), similar to the S. acidocaldarius and Desulfurococcus amylolyticus enzymes (10Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Slesarev A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Mirambeau G. Duguet M. Forterre P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Numerous studies indicate that this temperature dependence reflects the need for single-stranded regions in the plasmid substrate (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Slesarev A. Kozyavkin S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1990; 7: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At elevated temperature, the DNA strands of a duplex tend to separate locally, especially when the DNA is negatively supercoiled, and this allows reverse gyrase to gain access to the DNA. To understand this preference for single-stranded DNA in more detail, the binding of A. fulgidus reverse gyrase to various types of DNA substrates was studied in bandshift assays. Fig.2A shows the binding of reverse gyrase to single-stranded poly(dT) oligonucleotides. At least three protein-DNA species are visible: two bands that penetrate into the gel (marked with arrows in Fig. 2A) and a species that remains trapped in the wells. It is unclear whether the species in the wells is a discrete protein-DNA complex or nonspecific aggregate. At least the faster gel-penetrating species is likely to be a higher affinity complex than the well-trapped one, because it appears earlier in the titration. Fig. 2B shows that reverse gyrase also binds to a 52-bp duplex substrate. Fig. 3 examines the enzyme's ability to bind to DNA substrates containing both single- and double-stranded regions. These mixed substrates contain a 22-bp duplex region flanked by a single-stranded poly(dT) tail on either the 5′- or 3′-end. When the tail is 30 bases long on either end, the protein forms complexes very efficiently, more so than when the substrate is purely single-stranded p(dT)30 (Fig. 2A). When tail length is reduced to 20 bases, however, complex formation is very low and smearing is observed, presumably indicative of weakly interacting protein and DNA. That reverse gyrase binds more efficiently to poly(dT)30 when it abuts duplex DNA suggests that the enzyme interacts with both duplex and single-stranded regions of the substrate. To determine the minimal duplex region necessary for efficient binding, mixed substrates containing a 30-base 3′ tail and duplex regions of 18-, 15-, and 10-bp were tested. All are bound at comparable efficiency by reverse gyrase (data not shown), suggesting that the duplex region contacted by the protein is small. Because these bandshift studies were performed at room temperature, they indicate that the protein does not require elevated temperature for DNA binding per se. Together with previous studies using plasmids (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jaxel C. Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Takahashi M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Slesarev A. Kozyavkin S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1990; 7: 935-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), these experiments with oligonucleotides further support the idea that the temperature dependence of the positive supercoiling reaction reflects the need for reverse gyrase to bind to locally denatured regions of the substrate. Reverse gyrase is unique among type I topoisomerases in its requirement for nucleotide hydrolysis, which it couples to the overwinding of DNA. In the following discussion, “(d)NTP” refers to a dNTP, together with the corresponding NTP. Previous work found that, of the four natural NTPs and dNTPs, only (d)ATP could support positive supercoiling by S. acidocaldarius reverse gyrase (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other (d)NTPs allowed the enzyme to relax DNA but not supercoil it. This correlated with the fact that (d)ATP was the only (d)NTP hydrolyzed by the enzyme; no hydrolysis of (d)GTP, (d)CTP, or (d)UTP was detected (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the positive supercoiling activity of the A. fulgidus enzyme can be powered by all four standard (d)NTPs (Fig.4A). Maximal positive supercoiling occurs at a concentration around 10 μm for (d)ATP, as reported for S. acidocaldarius reverse gyrase (3Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), contrasting with about 100 μm for the other (d)NTPs. The results observed for the S. acidocaldarius enzyme (7Shibata T. Nakasu S. Yasui K. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be reproduced by repeating the assays in Fig. 4A using less protein: saturating amounts of (d)ATP supported a modest degree of positive supercoiling, whereas the other nucleotides supported only quantitative relaxation (data not shown). The selectivity of reverse gyrase for (d)ATP was confirmed in hydrolysis assays performed in the presence of single-stranded DNA (Fig. 4B). The enzyme hydrolyzes ATP and dATP with a turnover number of ∼0.1 s−1 (corresponding to a specific activity of 1 nmol s−1 mg−1), whereas it hydrolyzes CTP and dTTP at a rate only slightly above background. The crystal structure of the enzyme with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenylylimidodiphosphate (ADPNP) suggests that the selectivity for (d)ATP stems from an interaction between the N6 amino group of the adenine ring with the Oε1 atom of the invariant residue Gln-61 (12Rodrı́guez A. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The homology between the topoisomerase domain of reverse gyrase and topoisomerase I suggests that reverse gyrase, like its E. coli homologue, might act as a DNA relaxing enzyme in the absence of nucleotide. However, no significant topoisomerization by reverse gyrase is observed without ATP (Fig.5A), even at high molar ratios of protein to DNA (P/D). The topoisomerase domain expressed on its own does weakly relax DNA in the absence of ATP (Fig. 5D), as reported for the topoisomerase domain of S. acidocaldariusreverse gyrase (21Déclais A.-C.

These results indicate that the N-terminal domain represses the activity of the topoisomerase domain in the absence of nucleotide. Nucleotide binding is sufficient to “de-repress” topoisomerase activity, because reverse gyrase relaxes DNA at low P/D ratios in the presence of ADPNP (Fig. 5B). How might the N-terminal domain repress topoisomerase activity? The reverse gyrase crystal structure revealed that subdomain H3 of the N-terminal module closes like a latch over the topoisomerase gate, preventing the gate opening thought to be required for strand passage and topoisomerization (22Li Z. Mondragón A. DiGate R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We proposed that binding of both nucleotide and DNA cause the latch to pull away from the topoisomerase domain (12Rodrı́guez A. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, reverse gyrase deletion mutants were studied. Mutants were constructed lacking essentially the entire latch (Δlatch, residues 360–418) or just the part interacting with the topoisomerase in the crystal structure (Δ370, residues 370–381) (Fig. 1D). The supercoiling activity of the Δlatch mutant is shown in Fig.6. The enzyme, as predicted by our model, shows weak relaxation activity in the absence of nucleotide. Hence the latch is critical for the repression of topoisomerase activity by the N-terminal domain. At higher P/D ratios, nicked (form II) and linearized (form III) DNA molecules accumulate; this effect is addressed later in this section. The Δ370 mutant behaves similarly to Δlatch (Fig. 7), suggesting that topoisomerase repression is mediated principally in the region of residues 370–381. Both mutants retain positive supercoiling activity in the presence of ATP, indicating that the latch is not required for coupling nucleotide hydrolysis to positive supercoiling. The latch is also dispensable for efficient substrate binding, because both mutants behave similarly to the full-length protein in bandshift assays like those in Fig. 3 (data not shown).FIG. 7Topoisomerization activity of reverse gyrase mutant Δ370, lacking residues 370–381 of the latch. Reactions were set up as described in the legend to Fig. 5. In some cases, the well after electrophoresis is shown as aninset to the lower left of the corresponding sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) That deletion of residues 370–381 allows “de-repression” of the topoisomerase activity suggests that the interface between the latch and topoisomerase domain in the crystal structure is functionally relevant. The sides of this interface are formed chiefly by residues 370–381 of the latch and residues 857–866 of subdomain T3 (Fig.1D). To examine the other side of the putative interface, a mutant lacking residues 857–866 (Δ857) was produced and checked for supercoiling activity (Fig. 8). Like the full-length enzyme, the Δ857 mutant does not show significant relaxation activity in the absence of nucleotide. This suggests that the latch need not interact directly with residues 857–866 to repress the topoisomerase module. When the Δlatch, Δ370, and Δ857 mutants are used in excess in the supercoiling assay, especially in the absence of nucleotide hydrolysis, nicked or linearized DNA products accumulate (FIG. 6, FIG. 7, FIG. 8). It is possible that the form II and III bands reflect nuclease contamination, but this seems unlikely for two reasons. The bands accumulate to a significant extent only with the mutant enzymes, yet all the proteins in this study were purified from the same E. coli strain in a similar manner and to a similar degree of purity (Fig.1C). Moreover, the form II and III products require the formation of a covalent intermediate of reverse gyrase and DNA, because they are not observed with a Δlatch mutant carrying a Phe in place of the active-site Tyr-809 (Fig. 9). These products may therefore reflect formation of cleavage complex that does not undergo religation but instead suffers hydrolytic attack. Normally, topoisomerases perform the religation step efficiently such that DNA hydrolysis by the solvent is not a competing reaction, but the reverse gyrase mutants may be compromised in the religation step, allowing hydrolysis to become observable. Further studies are needed to test this hypo"

Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is an elaborate, multistage process that begins with enzymatic tagging of target proteins with a polyubiquitin chain and culminates with ubiquitin-dependent degradation of tagged proteins by the 26 S proteasome (1Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 3Hershko A.

In the first stage, the C terminus of ubiquitin is covalently bound through a thioester bond to the active site cysteine residue of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 to an active site cysteine residue in one of a number of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Finally, in a reaction mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitin is conjugated directly via isopeptide bonds to ε-amino groups of lysines in the target protein and then to lysines in their ubiquityl moieties to complete synthesis of the polyubiquitin tag. The E3 components of the ubiquitin pathway are responsible for recognizing and recruiting target proteins for polyubiquitylation. The E3 fall into two functional classes (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 5Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M.

One class includes the homologous to E6-AP carboxylterminus (HECT) domain proteins, which have an active site cysteine residue that receives ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and transfers it to target proteins. The other class includes the E3 that appear to activate ubiquitylation of target proteins at least in part by binding to both E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and target proteins and bringing them into close proximity. Among members of this class of E3s are the structurally related multiprotein SCF (Skp1-Cul1/Cdc53-F-box protein) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)1tumor suppressor (CBCVHL or Cul2-ElonginBC-VHL) complexes, which use heterodimeric modules composed of a member of the Cullin protein family and the RING finger protein Rbx1 (also referred to as ROC1 or Hrt1) to activate ubiquitylation of target proteins by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Cdc34 and Ubc5 (6Deshaies R.J.

SCF ubiquitin ligases include a member of the F-box family of proteins, which serve to recognize and recruit target proteins. F-box proteins are linked to a Cul1(Cdc53)/Rbx1 module by the Skp1 adaptor protein that binds to a degenerate, ∼40-amino acid sequence motif called the F-box, which is present in F-box proteins (8Bai C.

The VHL protein is linked to a Cul2/Rbx1 module by the ubiquitin-like Elongin B and Skp1-like Elongin C adaptor proteins. Elongins B and C form a stable subcomplex that binds to a short BC-box motif present in the VHL protein (15Kibel A. Iliopoulos O. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin W.G.

F-box proteins, including mammalian Skp2 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc4, Grr1, and Met30, have recently been shown to be short lived proteins that are rapidly turned over with ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome when assembled into SCF complexes in cells (18Galan J.-M.

Based on these findings, it has been proposed that these F-box proteins are ubiquitylated by an autocatalytic mechanism in the context of the SCF and, further, that rapid turnover of F-box proteins provides a mechanism for rapid assembly and disassembly of distinct SCF complexes required for timely responses of the cell to different cell cycle or environmental cues. In contrast to these F-box proteins, the VHL tumor suppressor protein is long lived in cells. In addition, whereas F-box proteins are stabilized in cells by mutations that prevent them from binding Skp1 and assembling into SCF complexes, VHL is destabilized by mutations that interfere with its ability to bind Elongins C and B and assemble into CBCVHL (22Schoenfeld A.R.

Based on these findings, the longevity of the VHL protein in cells is likely to ensure that it can maintain close and continuous surveillance of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, which may be activated at any time during the life of a cell. In this report, we have investigated the molecular basis of the different modes of regulation of VHL and F-box proteins. We have demonstrated that unlike the F-box protein Cdc4, which is ubiquitylatedin vitro by Cdc34 in the context of the SCF, the VHL protein is protected from Ubc5-catalyzed ubiquitylation in the context of CBCVHL even though the RING finger protein Rbx1 is capable of directly targeting VHL for ubiquitylation when it is not assembled into the CBCVHL complex. Our findings provide a plausible model to explain the differential stabilities of VHL and F-box proteins, and they suggest that the longevity of the VHL tumor suppressor protein is regulated at least in part by the geometry of the CBCVHL complex through the spatial organization of its surface lysine residues.

After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-VHL (Ig32), anti-FLAG, or anti-HPC4 antibodies and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were mixed with ∼50 ng of Uba1, ∼3 μg of GST·UbK48R, and either ∼100 ng of hUbc5a or ∼200 ng of ScCdc34 in a 20-μl reaction containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 26 °C. To assay the abilities of purified recombinant CBC and SCF complexes to ubiquitylate VHL, Cdc4VHL, and Cdc4 proteins, aliquots of TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC column fractions indicated in the figures were mixed with ∼50 ng of Uba1, ∼3 μg of GST·UbK48R, and either ∼100 ng of hUbc5a or ∼200 ng of ScCdc34 in a 10-μl reaction containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 26 °C. The observation that VHL is more stable in cells when it is associated with Elongins B and C (22Schoenfeld A.R. Davidowitz E.J. Burk R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8507-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the VHL protein might be protected from ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation by assembly into the CBCVHL complex. To address this possibility directly, Sf21 insect cells were coinfected with various combinations of baculoviruses encoding Cul2, Rbx1, Elongins B and C, and either wild type VHL, VHL mutant [K159R,K171R,K196R]VHL, which has no lysines and therefore cannot be ubiquitylated, or VHL mutants [L158P]VHL and [C162F]VHL, which exhibit substantially reduced affinities for Elongins B and C. We note that although Elongin C is capable of interacting with VHL in the absence of Elongin B, Elongins B and C were always coexpressed together in these experiments for the following reasons. (i) The binding of Elongin C to VHL is stabilized by Elongin B both in vitro and in cells (16Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 35Pause A. Peterson B. Schaffar G. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9533-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). (ii) Elongin C is stabilized and expressed to considerably higher levels in insect cells that also express Elongin B (data not shown). (iii) The detectable Elongin C is always found in association with Elongin B during biochemical purification of Elongin C-containing complexes (Ref. 36Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar and data not shown). VHL-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with an anti-VHL monoclonal antibody and tested for their susceptibility to VHL ubiquitylation. In these experiments, immunopurified complexes (Fig.1A, lanes 1–9) were incubated with an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a, ubiquitin (GST·UbK48R), and ATP. Reaction products were analzyed by Western blotting with anti-VHL antibody. As shown in Fig.1B, maximal formation of the more slowly migrating VHL-GST·UbK48R conjugates was observed in reactions performed with VHL complexes immunoprecipitated from insect cells expressing wild type VHL, Cul2, and Rbx1 (lane 2). Formation of these more slowly migrating species was strongly inhibited by the presence of Elongins B and C (lanes 3 and 7) and was not observed in VHL immunoprecipitates from insect cells expressing the [K159R,K171R,K196R]VHL mutant (lanes 4 and 5). Further supporting the notion that binding of Elongins B and C to VHL blocks its ubiquitylation, VHL mutants [L158P]VHL and [C162F]VHL are more efficiently ubiquitylated than wild type VHL, even when present in VHL immunoprecipitates from cells expressing high levels of Elongins B and C (lanes 8 and 9). To confirm and extend these findings, wild type VHL, Cul2, Rbx1, Elongin C, and an epitope-tagged Elongin B (HPC4·EloB) were coexpressed in insect cells and coimmunopurified with anti-HPC4 monoclonal antibodies. This procedure ensured that all of the immunoprecipitated VHL protein was associated with Elongins B and C. As shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 10 and 11, anti-HPC4 immunoprecipitates contained all five subunits of the CBCVHL complex. Notably, the VHL protein contained in these Elongin B-containing complexes was resistant to ubiquitylation (Fig. 1B, lanes 10and 11). The results of the experiments described above argue that VHL ubiquitylation can be negatively regulated by its binding to Elongins B and C and/or by its assembly into complete CBCVHL complexes containing Cul2, Elongins B and C, and Rbx1. However, they provide no information about the mechanism of VHL ubiquitylation outside the context of CBCVHL. In the course of investigating interactions among subunits of the CBCVHL complex, we have observed that Rbx1 binds to VHL in the absence of exogenously expressed Cul2 and Elongins B and C (32Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S. Kaelin W.G. Elledge S.J. Conaway R.C. Harper J.W. Conaway J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Rbx1 might be capable of directly activating VHL ubiquitylation. To address this possibility, His6-tagged wild type VHL or His6-tagged [L158P]VHL were expressed in Sf21 insect cells alone, with Rbx1, or in combination with Rbx1, Cul2, and Elongins B and C. VHL or VHL-containing complexes were purified from cell lysates by consecutive Ni2+-agarose chromatography and TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. As shown in the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig.2A, wild type VHL could be purified as an approximately stoichiometric component of the complete CBCVHL complex. In addition, both wild type VHL and the [L158P]VHL mutant could be purified with approximately stoichiometric amounts of Rbx1 in the absence of exogenously expressed Cul2 and Elongins B and C. Purified VHL and VHL-containing complexes were incubated with E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a, GST·UbK48R, and ATP. Consistent with the results in Fig.1, we observed no detectable ubiquitylation of VHL in the context of the purified CBCVHL complex. Purified VHL and [L158P]VHL formed VHL-UbK48R conjugates with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to those expected for addition of a single GST·UbK48R. In contrast, high molecular mass VHL-GST·UbK48R conjugates were formed when VHL and [L158P]VHL were present as components of VHLRbx1complexes (Fig. 2, B and C). To investigate further the requirement for Rbx1 in the formation of high molecular mass VHL-GST·UbK48R conjugates, we compared VHL ubiquitylation in the presence of wild type Rbx1 and the Rbx1 mutant [C94S], which does not support activation of either Cdc34-dependent ubiquitylation of Cln2 by SCFGrr1 complexes or Ubc12-dependent Rub1 modification of Cullin proteins (31Kamura T. Conrad M.N. Yan Q. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In these experiments, His6-tagged VHL was coexpressed in insect cells with either Rbx1 or [C94S]Rbx1. The resulting complexes were purified from cell lysates by consecutive Ni2+-agarose chromatography and TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. As shown in Fig.3A, approximately stoichiometric amounts of both wild type and mutant Rbx1 copurified with the VHL protein. In addition, high molecular mass VHL-GST·UbK48R conjugates were formed only in the presence of wild type Rbx1 (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that VHL ubiquitylation depends on the presence of functional Rbx1. The S. cerevisiae F-box protein Cdc4 is rapidly ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome in cells (18Galan J.-M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that (i) Cdc4 turnover depends upon its ability to interact with the SCF components Skp1 and Cdc53, and (ii) Cdc4 is stabilized when cells containing a temperature-sensitive Skp1 mutant are grown at the non-permissive temperature, it has been proposed that Cdc4 can be ubiquitylated in the context of an SCFCdc4 complex (18Galan J.-M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence in support of this model has not been reported. To test this possibility, we asked whether a recombinant SCFCdc4complex, expressed in and purified from Sf21 insect cells, is capable of promoting Cdc4 ubiquitylation. N-terminal His6- and HSV-tagged Cdc4 (His-HSV·Cdc4), S. cerevisiae Cdc53, N-terminal FLAG-tagged S. cerevisiae Skp1 (FLAG-Skp1), and N-terminal His6- and Myc-tagged S. cerevisiaeRbx1 (His-Myc·ScRbx1) were coexpressed in Sf21 insect cells and purified from cell lysates by consecutive Ni2+-agarose chromatography and TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. The purified SCFCdc4complexes are shown in Fig.4A, left panel. As shown in Fig. 4A, right panel, high molecular mass Cdc4-GST·UbK48R conjugates appeared in a time-dependent manner following incubation of the purified SCFCdc4 complexes with E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34, GST·UbK48R, and ATP. Although these results strongly suggested that Cdc4 can be ubiquitylated in the context of the SCFCdc4 complex, it was possible that the ubiquitylated Cdc4 in these reactions was not actually a component of SCF complexes but rather represented contaminating free Cdc4 in the purified SCFCdc4 fraction. To prepare SCFCdc4 complexes free of contaminating Cdc4, SCF subunits were coexpressed in insect cells and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antibodies recognizing the FLAG epitope on Skp1 (Fig. 4B, left panel). Immunoprecipitated complexes were then incubated with E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34, GST·UbK48R, and ATP. As shown in Fig. 4B (right panel), similar to the results obtained with chromatographically purified SCFCdc4complexes, high molecular mass Cdc4-GST·UbK48R conjugates were also formed in the presence of immunoprecipitated complexes. Thus, unlike the VHL protein in the CBCVHL complex, the Cdc4 protein can be ubiquitylated in the context of the SCFCdc4complex. To account for the observation that Cdc4, a target recruitment subunit of the SCF complex, can be ubiquitylated in the context of SCFCdc4 (whereas VHL, a CBC target recruitment subunit, is protected from ubiquitylation in the context of CBCVHL), we considered the possibility that CBC complexes might be inherently incapable of supporting ubiquitylation of associated target recruitment subunits. To address this hypothesis, we constructed an N-terminal His6-tagged Cdc4VHLchimera that contained the entire VHL open reading frame, including the BC-box and the Cdc4 WD-40 repeat domain but lacked the Cdc4 F-box (Fig.5A). The Cdc4VHLchimera was coexpressed in Sf21 insect cells with Cul2, Rbx1, and Elongins B and C; the resulting CBC-Cdc4VHL complex was purified from cell lysates by consecutive Ni2+-agarose chromatography and TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. The purified CBC-Cdc4VHL complex is shown in Fig. 5B. As shown in Fig. 5C, high molecular mass Cdc4VHL-UbK48R conjugates were formed in a time-dependent manner following incubation of the purified CBC-Cdc4VHL complex with E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5a, GST·UbK48R, and ATP, indicating that the Cdc4VHL chimera can be ubiquitylated in the context of the CBC-Cdc4VHL complex. Thus, the resistance of VHL to ubiquitylation in the context of the CBCVHL complex does not reflect an inherent inability of CBC complexes to ubiquitylate their target recruitment subunits, and therefore resistance to ubiquitylation must be a property of the VHL protein itself. In this report we have investigated the molecular basis of the different modes of regulation of the VHL tumor suppressor protein as the target recruitment subunit of the CBCVHL ubiquitin ligase and of F-box proteins as target recruitment subunits of the structurally related SCF ubiquitin ligases. Our findings provide a plausible model to explain the different stabilities of the VHL and of F-box proteins in cells. Unlike the F-box proteins Cdc4, Grr1, and Met30, which can be ubiquitylated in the context of the SCF and degraded by the proteasome, the VHL protein is resistant to ubiquitylation in the context of the CBCVHLcomplex, thus accounting at least in part for its long half-life in cells and consistent with its continuous requirement in negative regulation of the levels of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors throughout all phases of the cell cycle. Our observation that the Cdc4VHL chimera can be ubiquitylated in the context of the CBC-Cdc4VHL complex suggests that the resistance of VHL to ubiquitylation in the CBCVHL complex is not an intrinsic property of the CBC complex conferred by one or more of its Cul2, Rbx1, and Elongin B and C subunits but instead is a property of the VHL protein regulated by the geometry of the CBCVHL complex. The human VHL protein contains three lysine residues that are found in its C-terminal α-domain (37Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) at positions 159, 171, and 196 and that are potential ubiquitylation sites. The lysine at position 159, which is located within the Elongin BC binding site and is hydrogen-bonded to Asn-108 of Elongin C, would be predicted to be protected from ubiquitylation by interaction of VHL with Elongins B and C. The lysines at positions 171 and 196 lie on exposed surfaces of VHL within the VHL-Elongin BC complex. Whether Cul2 and Rbx1 physically block access of the E2 to Lys-171 and -196 or whether some other aspect(s) of the geometry of the complex prevents their ubiquitylation awaits structural studies of the intact CBCVHL complex. Interestingly, in recent experiments we have observed that, although the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc5 and Cdc34 can both be activated to synthesize polyubiquitin chains conjugated to Cul2 in the context of the CBC complex, the two enzymes transfer ubiquityl moieties to lysines at different sites on Cul2. 2T. Kamura, R. C. Conaway, J. W. Conaway, and Qin Yan, unpublished results.Thus, the overall geometry of lysines on the surface of target proteins is likely to contribute to regulation of their ubiquitylation by CBC and SCF ubiquitin ligases. Experiments are underway to decipher the rules governing the choice of surface lysines by different E2 enzymes and should shed light on this mode of regulation. We thank A.

However, the frequency of recombination between the CTG·CAG tracts has not been studied. Here we performed a systematic study on the frequency of recombination between these sequences using a genetic assay based on an intramolecular plasmid system in Escherichia coli. The rate of intramolecular recombination between long CTG·CAG tracts oriented as direct repeats was extraordinarily high; recombinants were found with a frequency exceeding 12%. Recombination occurred in both RecA+ and RecA− cells but was ∼2–11 times higher in the recombination proficient strain. Long CTG·CAG tracts recombined ∼10 times more efficiently than non-repeating control sequences of similar length. The recombination frequency was 60-fold higher for a pair of (CTG·CAG)165 tracts compared with a pair of (CTG·CAG)17 sequences. The CTG·CAG sequences in orientation II (CTG repeats present on a lagging strand template) recombine ∼2–4 times more efficiently than tracts of identical length in the opposite orientation relative to the origin of replication. This orientation effect implies the involvement of DNA replication in the intramolecular recombination between CTG·CAG sequences. Thus, long CTG·CAG tracts are hot spots for genetic recombination.

The (CTG·CAG)175sequence is not a pure CTG·CAG tract but contains two G to A interruptions at repeats 28 and 69 (30); all other TRS are pure (not interrupted). All of these sequences have non-repeating human flanking sequences (19 and 41 bp) outside the repeated tract. pRW3815 2K. Ohshima and R. D Wells, unpublished data. is a pUC18NotI derivative and contains the (GTC·GAC)79 tract. These plasmids were maintained inE. coli HB101 (Invitrogen) (mcrB, mmr, hsdS20(rB−, mB−), recA1, supE44, ara14, galK2, lacY1, proA2, rplS20 (SmR), xyl5, λ−, leuB6, mtl-1). The (CTG·CAG)n and (GTC·GAC)n sequences were subcloned into pBR322. The general strategy of this investigation involved recloning of the (CTG·CAG)n and (GTC·GAC)nsequences from pUC19NotI and pUC18NotI derivatives (28Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), respectively, into pBR322. Fragments containing the CTG·CAG and the GTC·GAC TRS were prepared from these plasmids by digesting the pUC19NotI or pUC18NotI derivatives with EcoRI and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Inc.) followed by filling-in the recessed 3′ termini with 0.1 unit of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the four dNTPs (0.1 mm each). In the case of pRW4806 (a pUC19NotI derivative harboring a tract of 165 uninterrupted CTG·CAG repeats), the insert was prepared byAluI digestion. The blunt-ended DNA fragments were used for cloning to obtain plasmids containing the TRS tracts in both orientations relative to the unidirectional ColE1 origin of replication. The digested DNA was electrophoresed in a 7% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide, and the bands containing the triplet repeat fragment were excised. The DNA was eluted from the excised bands, purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated with ethanol (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The vector was prepared by digesting pBR322 with EcoRI and HindIII followed by filling in the recessed 3′ termini as described earlier. The vector and the insert were mixed at a molar ratio of ∼1:10 and ligated for 14 h at 16 °C by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA ligase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The ligation mixture was ethanol-precipitated and transformed into E. coli HB101 by electroporation (2.5 kV, cuvette size 0.2 mm) and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual transformants by the Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System (Promega). Clones containing the CTG·CAG repeats in orientations I and II (defined in Refs. 28Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar and 30Bowater R.P. Rosche W.A. Jaworski A. Sinden R.R. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were obtained and characterized by restriction mapping. The inserts cloned into theEcoRI/HindIII site of pBR322 are referred to as “X inserts” (Fig. 2). The pBR322 derivatives containing a single CTG·CAG sequence (the “X insert”) were subsequently used to clone the second TRS tract (CTG·CAG or GTC·GAC) into the PvuII site at position 2064 of the pBR322 backbone (Fig. 2, Y insert). The same experimental approach was used to clone the second TRS insert, except that after ligation the reaction mixture was subjected to PvuII digestion to eliminate plasmids lacking the insert. This strategy enabled the construction of a family of plasmids harboring two homologous TRS tracts oriented as direct repeats or inverted repeats as well as plasmids containing non-homologous repeats (Fig. 2). All plasmids were characterized by restriction mapping (to determine the orientation and length of the cloned TRS) and dideoxy sequencing of both strands with ThermoSequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The sequencing reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using the following pBR322 specific primers: pBR322EcoRI, GTATCACGAGGCCCT which 3′-terminates at the pBR322 map position 4347 (New England Biolabs, Inc.); pBRHR, GCGTTAGCAATTTAACTGTGAT which 3′-terminates at the pBR322 map position 49 (Genosys Inc.); pBRPF, GCTTCACGACCACGCTGAT which 3′-terminates at the pBR322 map position 2052 (Genosys Inc.); pBRPR, GTCAGAGGTTTTCACCGTCAT which 3′-terminates at the pBR322 map position 2087 (Genosys Inc.). The products of the sequencing reactions were analyzed on 6% Long Ranger gels (FMC BioProducts) containing 7.5m urea in the glycerol tolerant gel buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Two different non-repeating sequences were used as controls in this study: the 564-bp fragment of λ phage DNA (HindIII fragment from nucleotide position 36895 to 37459) and the 354-bp fragment of the human DMPK gene (part of the exon 7 and intron 7) (32Mahadevan M.

Thus, the two plasmids, pRW4804 and pRW4805, harbor direct and inverted repeats, respectively (Fig. 2). The exon 7/intron 7 fragment of the human DMPK gene used for construction of pRW4871 and pRW4873 was obtained by PCR amplification of the sequence from the human genomic DNA. The PCR was carried out in a volume of 20 μl containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 0.2 units ofPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR primers DM7F, GGCTCGAGACTTCATTCAGC, and DM7R, TAGATGGGCACAGAGCAGGT, were used at the concentration 1 μm. Amplification on a PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) involved 35 cycles: 20 s/95 °C, 20 s/58 °C, and 40 s/72 °C. PAGE-purified PCR product was phosphorylated using 2 mm ATP and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) and cloned into the HindIII andPvuII sites of pBR322. pRW4871 as well as pRW4873 contain homologous sequences oriented as direct repeats; however, the orientations of the pairs of inserts are opposite in these two plasmids. pBR322 and pBR322 derivatives containing direct, inverted, non-homologous repeats and non-repeating DNA sequences were digested with EcoRV and EagI (positions 185 and 939 on the pBR322 map, respectively) to remove the 754-bp DNA fragment of the vector backbone. The digested plasmids were purified by 5% acrylamide gel electrophoresis as described earlier and ligated to theGFPuv gene (36Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The GFPuv gene was obtained by digestion of the pGFPuv (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) withPvuII and EagI (positions 56 and 1078 on the pGFPuv map, respectively). After ligation and transformation intoE. coli HB101, transformants were screened using a long-wave length UV lamp. The cells carrying plasmids with theGFPuv gene emitted a strong green fluorescence. The GFP cassette from pGFPuv contains the GFPuv variant of the green fluorescent protein gene inserted in-frame with the lacZ initiation codon from pUC19 so that a β-galactosidase-GFPuv fusion protein is expressed from the lac promoter in E. coli. For determinations of recombination properties, plasmids containing TRS tracts were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels, and bands corresponding to the supercoiled plasmids were excised from the gels, transferred into dialysis tubes, and electroeluted (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To avoid DNA damage, plasmid purifications were performed without ethidium bromide staining and UV irradiation of DNA. In all experiments, only gel-purified, supercoiled plasmid DNA was used for transformation of the appropriate E. coli strains. To ensure the identical conditions for experiments with all plasmids studied, a large batch of the competent cells was prepared for each set of experiments, and the transformations were always done in parallel. The transformants were cultured, harvested, and analyzed under the same conditions. The following E. coli strains were used: AB1157 (37Bachmann B.J. Neidhardt F.D. Derivations and Genotypes of Some Mutant Derivatives of Escherichia coli K-12. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987Google Scholar) as a parent of the recombination deficient strain JC10289 (thr-1, ara-14, leuB6, Δ(gpt-proA)62, lacY1, tsx-33, glnV44(AS), galK2, λ−, rac−, hisG4(Oc), rfbD1, mgl-51, Δ(recA−srl)306, srlR301::Tn10, rpsL31(strR), kdgK51, xylA5, mtl-1, argE3(Oc), thi-1). Strains were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT. In the population experiments, the transformation mixture was inoculated into 10-ml LB tubes containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at a cell density of 102 cells/ml. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. At late log phase (A600 ∼1.0 units), the cells were harvested, and the plasmid DNA was isolated as described above and analyzed by restriction digestion. To determine the frequency of recombination, plasmids harboring theGFPuv gene were transformed into the appropriateE. coli strain, plated onto LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The frequency of recombination was measured as the ratio of the number of white colonies to the total number of viable cells. The white as well as a representative number of fluorescent colonies were inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium (containing ampicillin at 100 μg/ml). After overnight growth, the plasmids were isolated and subjected to the restriction and DNA sequencing analyses. The statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 2.03. This genetic assay enabled the detection and quantitation of the recombination events that occurred directly after transformation of the parental plasmids into the host cells. In order to detect those recombination events that took place at a later stage of colony formation, the recombination product would have to outgrow the parental plasmid molecules (that are present in a large excess at the moment of the recombination event). Consequently, the recombinant plasmid should have a tremendous replication advantage over the parental plasmids. However, this can be easily ruled out by the results of copy number analyses (see “Results”). In addition, the white and the fluorescent colonies are stable. Randomly selected fluorescent colonies (350 total) were inoculated into one bulk culture, mixed, and then plated on plates containing ampicillin. After overnight growth, no white colonies were observed among ∼2 × 105 colonies screened. The same experiment was repeated for the white colonies which revealed no fluorescent colony formation in ∼105 white colonies analyzed. These results indicate that the “color of the colony” (i.e. recombination status of the plasmid) is established at the earliest stage of the colony formation, and masking or overgrowing of the cells to alter the apparent color (e.g. fluorescent cells by the white ones or vice versa) is highly unlikely. To ensure that results of the population experiments are not biased by the growth advantage of cells containing recombination products over the cells containing parental plasmids, the doubling time of E. coli cells harboring either recombination substrates or the recombination products with CTG·CAG tracts of different lengths and orientations was established. The determination of the doubling time and plasmid copy numbers as well as the recombination studies were carried out under identical conditions of bacterial growth (10-ml LB tubes containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm). In each case, ∼102–103 cells/ml were used to start the cultures. Aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn at every 30–60 min for ∼8 h, diluted in LB, and subsequently plated on agar plates without ampicillin. The growth curves were prepared using SigmaPlot 2000 version 6.10, and the doubling time was calculated as described previously (38Bacolla A. Jaworski A. Connors T.D. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18597-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of the replicative advantage of recombination products over the parental plasmids, the copy numbers of these plasmids were determined as described earlier (39Chiang C.S. Bremer H. Plasmid. 1988; 20: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 40Lin-Chao S. Bremer H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); the size of the E. coli genome of 4,639 Kbp (41Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5988) Google Scholar) was used for these calculations. The quantitative analyses of plasmid and genomic DNAs separated by agarose gels were performed using FluorChem version 3.04 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). In order to analyze the products of intramolecular recombination between repeating sequences, the isolated DNAs were linearized with AflIII and labeled by end-filling with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. The labeled DNAs were separated on 1% agarose gels in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8) buffer, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The instabilities of the TRS tracts of the recombination products were determined using SphI/BamHI digestion followed by end labeling as described above. The products were resolved in 5–7% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer. The lengths of the CTG·CAG inserts were calculated as described earlier (29Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28386-28397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The primary structures of more than 35 individual recombination products were determined by direct DNA sequencing of one or both DNA strands. We used an intramolecular plasmid system to study recombination between TRS tracts, where two homologous repetitive sequences are located on the same plasmid molecule and are separated by non-homologous intervening sequences. Two homologous TRS tracts present on the same replicon can be oriented relative to each other as direct or inverted repeats (Fig.1). The term “orientation” is used in this study to define the relative directionality between two recombining homologous sequences (direct and inverted repeats). The terms “orientation I” and “orientation II” refer to the orientation of the TRS sequences relative to the origin of replication; for example, for the plasmids containing (CTG·CAG)n tracts in orientation I, the CTG repeat is in the leading strand template, whereas for the plasmids harboring (CAG·CTG)n tracts, in orientation II, the CTG repeat is in the lagging strand template (28Kang S.

The recombination frequency as well as the types of final products of the intramolecular recombination event strongly depend on the relative orientation of the recombining sequences (Fig. 1) (18Bi X. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Mol.

Takahashi N. Fujitani Y. Yoshikura H. Kobayashi I. Genetics. 1996; 143: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombination event between direct repeats may lead to the deletion of one of the homologous tracts and any intervening sequences between the repeats (20Bi X. Lyu Y.L. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Yamamoto K. Takahashi N. Fujitani Y.

In the case of homologous TRS tracts, the intervening sequence separating the repeats will be also deleted. However, due to their repetitive nature, two homologous CTG·CAG tracts can align and hybridize with each other in several different frames (the number of frames equals the number of repeats divided by 3). As a result of possible different alignments of the CTG·CAG sequences, the length of TRS tracts in the recombination products may vary from the minimum length required for recombination to occur to the maximum length determined by the size of both recombining homologous sequences.

Drawbacks to the former strategy are its dependence on the generation of large libraries, the difficulty in discrimination between binders with small differences in affinity, and the bias in favor of binders with improved expression levels (1,3). Additionally, codon bias and the generation of nonfunctional or deleterious mutants are major drawbacks of this strategy (1Kurtzman A.L. Govindarajan S. Vahle K. Jones J.T. Heinrichs V. Patten P.A.

It is generally accepted that experimental data on the energetic contribution of the modified amino acids are required to develop algorithms relating binding energetics to particular amino acid modifications. Many analyses have used site-directed mutagenesis, especially alanine scanning (17Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1779) Google Scholar, 18Dall'Acqua W.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to determine the energetic contributions of the amino acid side chains and functional groups. These strategies have shown to be very attractive because of their simplicity. However, they often lead to misinterpretations and inconclusive results (21Rajpal A. Taylor M.G. Kirsch J.F. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Ito W. Iba Y. Kurosawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16639-16647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dougan D.A.

One of the possible reasons for these failures is that quantitative measures like kinetic and affinity constants have been related to amino acid substitutions in a qualitative or intuitive way, effectively reducing the analysis to the presence or absence of a side chain or functional group. Other chemical property differences between amino acids are not considered. For instance, a tyrosine residue is often considered to have the same chemical nature as a phenylalanine, except for an additional hydroxyl group (19Dall'Acqua W. Goldman E.R. Lin W. Teng C. Tsuchiya D., Li, H. Ysern X. Braden B.C., Li, Y. Smith-Gill S.J. Mariuzza R.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7981-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Rajpal A. Taylor M.G. Kirsch J.F.

Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is not taken into account that addition or removal of functional groups of a residue may influence the chemical properties of the residue as a whole, thereby changing the chemical nature of the interaction more than intended. To analyze the effect of various physicochemical properties of the amino acids, replacement of a residue by a range of different amino acids may be required. In addition, the introduced modification has to be quantified to extract a mathematical correlation model. “Quantitative structure activity relationship” (QSAR)1 is a method of choice to construct such models and has already been used extensively in the field of rational drug design. The QSAR uses descriptive scales (e.g. electronic, steric, and hydrophobic properties) to account for the observed correlation between the structure and activity of protein-ligand interactions (26Hansch C.

The QSAR models are predictive and are often combined with powerful multivariate statistical methods, thereby extracting a maximum of information from a minimum amount of data. In addition, the reliability of the data and the models are estimated (26Hansch C. Leo A. Exploring QSAR: Hydrophobic, Electronic, and Steric Constants. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 30Hansch C. Klein T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 512-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate the use of QSAR to investigate the interaction of the camel single domain antibody, cAb-Lys3, with its antigen, hen egg white lysozyme (33Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Decanniere K. Transue T.R. Desmyter A. Maes D. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cAb-Lys3 antibody fragment is a well studied model system, of which several crystal structures in complex with lysozyme are available (33Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34Decanniere K. Transue T.R. Desmyter A. Maes D. Muyldermans S. Wyns L.

Proteins. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two residues of the CDR3 loop of cAb-Lys3 were replaced simultaneously by various amino acids, and quantitative descriptions for the substituted residues were used. In our analysis we related the sequence of these two positions to the kinetic parameters of the interaction. In addition, the binding of all mutants to lysozyme was characterized in several buffers containing a variety of chemical additives, to explore the sensitivity of binding resulting from changes in chemical environment for each mutant. Both the amino acid replacements and the buffer additives were selected using a multivariate experimental design. All reagents were analytical grade. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PDEA, EDC, NHS, ethanolamine, and dithioerythritol were obtained from Biacore AB, and cystamine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. The amino acids are numbered as they occur in the linear sequence of cAb-Lys3. Positions 101 and 105 correspond to, respectively, 97 and 100a in the Kabat numbering (36Kabat E.A., Wu, T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeler C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. United States Public Health Services, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The cAb-Lys3 mutants are referred to by a two-letter code where the first and second letter represents the amino acid (single-letter code) at position 101 and 105, respectively. The wild type cAb-Lys3 is thus represented by TS because it possesses threonine and serine at the respective positions. We needed to identify positions of cAb-Lys3 where an amino acid substitution would modulate antigen binding but does not abolish the interaction. These are to be found at the periphery of the interaction interface (37Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). We analyzed the crystal structure data of the cAb-Lys3 with HEL (34Decanniere K. Transue T.R. Desmyter A. Maes D. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and looked for (i) two amino acids, (ii) within the CDR3 loop, (iii) that were not in direct contact with each other, and (iv) that were at the edge of the antibody/antigen interaction surface. The residues at positions 101 and 105 comply with those criteria. In addition, we were attracted by Ser-105 because it is located at the tip of the CDR3 loop of cAb-Lys3 and it is in contact with the catalytic residues Glu-35 and Asp-52 of HEL (34Decanniere K. Transue T.R. Desmyter A. Maes D. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we knew from previous (unrelated) experiments that Ser-105 could be replaced without dramatic effects on the cAb-Lys3 affinity for HEL. 2M. Murshed and E. De Genst, unpublished results. In the selection of the amino acid substitutions at positions 101 and 105 of cAb-Lys3, we excluded tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine at either position because inspection of the crystal structure revealed that these residues at those positions would lead to large sterical clashes with the antigen. Additionally, cysteine was not included to avoid dimerization and folding problems of the recombinant mutant proteins. The amino acids at positions 101 and 105 were parameterized using three scales: ZZ1, ZZ2, and ZZ3, representing, respectively, hydrophilicity, size/polarizability, and electronic properties (polarity, electrophilicity, charge, electronegativity) (27Sandberg M. Eriksson L. Jonsson J. Sjöström M. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) (Table I). To resolve six parameters in the model, more than six mutants are required. We designed eight new mutants, mainly double mutants, and added six already available single mutants (TG, TA, TP, TH, TQ, TN). Therefore, 14 single and double mutants at position 101 and 105 of cAb-Lys3 were envisaged. The final selection of the eight new mutants was based on the optimization of the condition number of the design matrix (29Andersson K. Choulier L. Hämäläinen M.D. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Altschuh D. Malmqvist M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Choulier L. Andersson K. Hämäläinen M.D. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Malmqvist M. Altschuh D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The condition number is a measure of the degree of linear dependence between the rows of the descriptor-matrix. For a statistically perfect design, the condition number would be 1 (29Andersson K. Choulier L. Hämäläinen M.D. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Altschuh D. Malmqvist M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Condition numbers between 1 and 5 are considered to be good; above 5 the design becomes progressively less acceptable (29Andersson K. Choulier L. Hämäläinen M.D. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Altschuh D. Malmqvist M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The optimization of the condition number was performed by manually testing various combinations of double amino acid mutations (positions 101 and 105) combined with the preset single mutants (position 105), until a condition number of 2.81 was obtained. An ordinary D-optimal design generator could not be applied here, because this algorithm assumes that all descriptors can be varied independently, which is not the case for amino acids (three parameters are fixed per amino acid).Table IThe ZZ1–3 scales of the naturally occurring amino acids (from Sandberg et al.

Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) by PCR. The sequence of the single mutants was analyzed on an ALF automatic sequencer (Amersham Biosciences) and recloned in a vector in which the hemagglutinin tag and geneIII between NotI and EcoRI sites were replaced by a fragment encoding six consecutive histidine codons followed by a termination codon. This modified expression vector is called pHEN6 cAb-Lys3 (39Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The mutants LS, VN, RT, PG, SQ, HD, QP, and MV of cAb-Lys3 were constructed in a pHEN6 cAb-Lys3 vector by site-directed mutagenesis of closed circular DNA in vitro, according to Chen et al. (40Chen Z. Ruffner D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1126-1127Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Primers were 53 nucleotides in length and complementary to the coding strand of the cAb-Lys3 gene. The sequence of the primers was: 5′-CAG ACC GTG GCC GCA TTC ATA ATA XXX AGC GTA GATXXX CGA ATC TGC CGC AC-3′, where XXX is the mutagenic codon. All of these mutants except MV removed a unique TaqI (underlined) site in the original sequence of cAb-Lys3, and mutants were screened by colony PCR amplifying the cAb-Lys3 gene and digestion with TaqI. The MV mutant introduced a Sau3AI (bold and underlined) site, and MV clones were screened by digestion with Sau3AI. Mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Periplasmic expression, extraction, and purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration of mutants and wild type cAb-Lys3 were performed according to Lauwereys et al. (39Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W., De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The concentration of the mutants and wild type cAb-Lys3 was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the calculated sequence-based extinction coefficient (41Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar) which is equal to 27,220m−1 cm−1 for all mutants. Lysozyme was modified with PDEA to introduce reactive disulfide groups before immobilization via surface thiol coupling, as described in the BIAapplications Handbook (42Biacore ABBIAapplications Handbook. Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden1998Google Scholar). This immobilization method was chosen based on the closest approximation to a 1:1 binding model for the binding of eight mutants and the wild type cAb-Lys3 to the immobilized ligand. PDEA-modified lysozyme dissolved in 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, was coupled to CM5 chips at a rate of 5 μl/min. Two flow cells (fc1 and fc3) were incubated with 35 μl of EDC/NHS (mixture of EDC (200 mm) and NHS (50 mm)) and subsequently with 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and served as reference surfaces for the kinetic measurements. Two other flow cells (fc2 and fc4) were used to immobilize PDEA-modified lysozyme at 80 RU and 500 RU, respectively. The two flow cells were treated with 10 μl of EDC/NHS and subsequently with 15 μl of cystamine dihydrochloride, followed by 15 μl of dithioerythritol. Manual injection of the PDEA-modified lysozyme was then performed until the aimed immobilization levels were obtained. Excess reactive thiols on the chip were deactivated by 20 μl of PDEA-NaCl. All buffers used were phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-based. The chemical additives NaCl, urea, Me2SO, KSCN, and pH, and their ranges were chosen as detailed by Andersson et al. (29Andersson K. Choulier L. Hämäläinen M.D. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Altschuh D. Malmqvist M. J. Mol. Recognit. 2001; 14: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Choulieret al. (38Choulier L.

To analyze the main effects of these five chemical factors on the (mutant) antibody antigen interaction, a standard fractional factorial design to a resolution of III was applied, which consists of 11 experiments (2exp(5–2) buffers to probe the high and low value of five factors without resolving interaction effects plus three replicate centerpoints) (see Table II) (43Haaland P.D.

Replicate runs were performed on a different chip and instrument. Each mutant was characterized in PBS at four protein concentrations ranging from 12 μm to 31.25 nm, depending on the affinity of the mutant for HEL, and was subsequently tested in 11 perturbation buffers (in randomized run order). The mutants were injected for 2 min, and dissociation data were collected during 5 min (perturbation buffers) or 10 min (PBS). Regeneration after each cycle was performed using 10 mmglycine-HCl, pH 1.0, for 2 min. Control injections using 1500 nm TG mutant in PBS was performed before and after two kinetic cycles to confirm that the activity of the immobilized lysozyme did not change over time. Zero concentration data (injection of buffer alone) were always subtracted from the sensorgrams before fitting. Kinetic parameters were obtained by global fitting of the sensorgrams to a 1:1 model using BIAevaluation 3.1 software. The Rmax parameter, representing the binding capacity of the chip, was fixed to the average equilibrium response of the TG injections. All mathematical modeling was performed in Modde 5.0 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) essentially according to Andersson et al. and Choulier et al.(29Andersson K. Choulier L.

There are also reports showing abnormally high levels of PKD1 expression in cystic epithelial cells. At present, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating the normal expression of thePKD1 gene or whether transcriptional disregulation of the PKD1 gene has a role in cyst formation. We have analyzed a 3.3-kb 5′-proximal portion of the human PKD1gene. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of consensus sequences for numerous transactivating factors, including four T-cell factor (TCF) binding elements (TBEs). Transcriptional activity of the 3.3-kb fragment and a series of deletion constructs was assayed in HEK293T cells. A 2.0-kb proximal promoter region containing one of the four TBEs (TBE1) was inducible up to 6-fold by cotransfection with β-catenin. β-catenin-mediated induction was inhibited by dominant-negative TCF and by deletion of the TBE1 sequence. 15- or 109-bp sequences containing the TBE1 site, when cloned upstream of a minimal promoter, were shown to respond to β-catenin induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that the TBE1 site is capable of forming complexes with TCF and β-catenin. To determine whether expression of the endogenous PKD1 gene responds to β-catenin, HT1080 cells were treated with LiCl, and HeLa cells were stably transfected with β-catenin. In both cases, endogenous PKD1 mRNA levels were elevated in response to these treatments. Taken together, these studies define an active PKD1 promoter region and suggest that the PKD1 gene is a target of the β-catenin/TCF pathway.

A 2.0-kb proximal promoter region containing one of the four TBEs (TBE1) was inducible up to 6-fold by cotransfection with β-catenin. β-catenin-mediated induction was inhibited by dominant-negative TCF and by deletion of the TBE1 sequence. 15- or 109-bp sequences containing the TBE1 site, when cloned upstream of a minimal promoter, were shown to respond to β-catenin induction. Gel shift assays confirmed that the TBE1 site is capable of forming complexes with TCF and β-catenin. To determine whether expression of the endogenous PKD1 gene responds to β-catenin, HT1080 cells were treated with LiCl, and HeLa cells were stably transfected with β-catenin. In both cases, endogenous PKD1 mRNA levels were elevated in response to these treatments. Taken together, these studies define an active PKD1 promoter region and suggest that the PKD1 gene is a target of the β-catenin/TCF pathway. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease polycystic kidney disease T-cell factor TCF binding element glycogen synthase kinase-3β constitutively active dominant-negative human embryonic kidney 293T reverse transcriptase-PCR oligonucleotide optimal TCF-4 mutant TCF-4 glutathione S-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)1 is a very common inherited disease worldwide, having a gene frequency of 1 in 200–1,000 individuals and causing 6–9% of all end-stage renal disease (1Grantham J.J.

PKD is characterized by the neoplastic growth of tubular epithelial cells, which gives rise to the formation of kidneys containing numerous fluid-filled cysts and ultimately to renal failure. In situ and Northern hybridization and immunocytochemical analyses have shown that the PKD1 gene is widely expressed in a number of embryonic and adult tissues and organs, including the kidney (5Ward C.J.

However, there are conflicting observations as to whether PKD results from abnormally decreased or increased expression of the PKD1 gene (15Ong A.C. Harris P.C. Davies D.R. Pritchard L. Rossetti S.

On the one hand, there is evidence that loss-of-function germ line mutations can lead to haploinsufficiency at the PKD1 locus (16Koptides M. Mean R. Demetriou K. Pierides A. Deltas C.C. Hum. Mol.

On the other hand, there is immunocytochemical evidence for overexpression of the protein product of the PKD1 gene, polycystin-1, in cyst-lining epithelial cells of polycystic kidneys (15Ong A.C. Harris P.C. Davies D.R. Pritchard L. Rossetti S. Biddolph S. Vaux D.J. Migone N. Ward C.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1324-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of a functionalPKD1 gene can cause PKD (21Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the present time, there is no information concerning the mechanisms regulating transcription of the PKD1 gene. β-catenin is a major component of adherens junctions, linking the actin cytoskeleton to members of the cadherin family of transmembrane cell-cell adhesion receptors (22Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P. J. Pathol. 1997; 182: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Wijnhoven B.P. Dinjens W.N. Pignatelli M. Br. J. Surg. 2000; 87: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Together with α- and γ-catenin, β-catenin binds to the cytosolic domain of E-cadherin to form a complex that is necessary for adhesion to occur. In addition, soluble β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus, where it associates with members of the TCF/LEF family of high mobility group (HMG)-box factors to alter the expression of certain target genes (25Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar). By playing a dual role, a structural role at cell-cell junctions and a regulatory role in the nucleus, β-catenin can transduce changes in cell adhesion and junction formation to control transmembrane signaling and gene expression. The level of soluble β-catenin in the cell is regulated by its association with the tumor suppressor molecule adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Phosphorylation of β-catenin by the APC-axin-GSK-3β complex leads to its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The failure of this degradation in cells expressing mutated β-catenin leads to the accumulation of soluble β-catenin that can result in activation of oncogenic β-catenin-responsive genes (23Wijnhoven B.P. Dinjens W.N. Pignatelli M. Br. J. Surg. 2000; 87: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 24Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys.

A number of observations have implicated β-catenin in the pathogenesis of PKD. Transgenic overexpression of either β-catenin or c-Myc, which is a downstream target of β-catenin, has been shown to give rise to PKD (26Romagnolo B. Berrebi D. Saadi-Keddoucci S. Porteu A. Pichard A.L. Peuchmaur M. Vandewalle A. Kahn A. Perret C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3875-3879PubMed Google Scholar, 27Trudel M. Barisoni L. Lanoix J. D'Agati V. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). Also, high levels of expression of c-Myc mRNA and protein are found in the cysts of both human ADPKD (28Lanoix J. D'Agati V. Szabolcs M. Trudel M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1153-1160PubMed Google Scholar) and the cpk mouse model of PKD (29Cowley B.D. Smardo F.L. Grantham J.J. Calvet J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of the C-terminal tail of polycystin-1 has been shown to stabilize β-catenin and to activate transcription of the β-catenin target gene, siamois (33Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L.K. Benzing T. Fan M.J. Gruning W. Sokol S.Y. Drummond I. Walz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4947-4953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Finally, polycystin-1 has been shown to be in a complex with E-cadherin and α- and β-catenin in normal cells (34Huan Y. van Adelsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and E-cadherin has been shown to be mistargeted in ADPKD cells (35Charron A.J. Nakamura S. Bacallao R. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), possibly because of abnormal polycystin-1 function. In this study, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of thePKD1 promoter and have determined that the PKD1gene is a target for the β-catenin/TCF complex. The cosmid clone 2H2 (LANL) (GenBank accession no. AC005346) was used to amplify a 3,414-bp sequence (29,490–32,904 of AC005346 or 77–3,490 of L39891) from −3,363 to +51, relative to the established transcription start site of thePKD1 gene (36Hughes J.

The DNA product was cloned in pGEM-T (Promega). A KpnI site was introduced near the 5′-end of the 3.3-kb fragment during the initial PCR reaction, and aHindIII site was introduced near the 3′-end. The fragment resulting from KpnI/HindIII digestion (−3,346 to +33; Fig. 1, 3.3 kb) was subcloned in the promoterless luciferase-reporter vector pGL2-Basic (Promega). Nested deletions were obtained by digestion with BglII (−2,018; Fig. 1, 2.0 kb), PvuII (−1,223; Fig. 1, 1.2 kb), XhoI (−947; Fig. 1, 0.95 kb), MluI (−200; Fig. 1, 0.20 kb), and ApaI (−1) (not shown). A 109-bp promoter fragment (−2018 to −1910) containing TBE1 was cloned in pTiLuc, which is pGL2-Basic with the adenovirus major late promoter TATA-box and the TdT initiator region (37Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Site-directed deletion mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs, mutations, and deletions were checked by sequencing. A Myc epitope-tagged wild-type human β-catenin pcDNA3 expression vector was a gift from P. Polakis. A Myc-tagged mutant (lacking amino acids 29–48), constitutively active (CA) β-catenin pcDNA3, and a cyclin D1 reporter construct (originally from R. Pestell, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) were gifts from O. Tetsu and F. McCormick. A Myc-tagged dominant-negative (DN) TCF-4E pcDNA3 lacking the β-catenin-binding domain (amino acids 2–53) also was from O. Tetsu and F. McCormick. pGST-TCF4 (DNA-binding domain) was a gift from K. Kinzler and B. Vogelstein. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T), human colon carcinoma HCT116 (HCT), and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. COS-1 and HeLa cells were obtained from R. Padmanabhan. HCT116 and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (CellGro) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method with HEK293T cells and by LipofectAMINE with COS-1 cells. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was included in each transfection to monitor transfection efficiency. After 48 h the cells were lysed, and activities were determined using enzyme assay kits for luciferase (Packard Bio Science) and β-galactosidase (Promega). Relative light units are the luciferase units normalized to β-galactosidase. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. For stable transfections, HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3 as a control, and Myc-tagged CA β-catenin in pcDNA3 using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and were selected with 400 μg/ml G418. For immunofluorescence assays cells were grown to confluency, fixed in methanol at −20 °C, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The samples were then treated with DNase I (Ambion). 3 μg of RNA from each sample was incubated with random primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to yield cDNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified in 50-μl reactions containing 2 μl of the cDNA reaction mix, 1× PCR buffer, 1 mmMgCl2 for PKD1 or 2 mm MgCl2 for β-catenin and for the ribosomal protein L7, 200 μm of each dNTP, 25 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). For each gene, PCR was performed to determine the linear range of amplification that would permit a quantitative assessment of expression levels. Primers specific for PKD1 (36Hughes J. Ward C.J. Peral B. Aspinwall R. Clark K. San Millan J.L. Gamble V. Harris P.C. Nat.

Each primer set was amplified at 95 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for the indicated number of cycles followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. Amplified PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Bands were analyzed by NIH Image software. Net band intensity (background-subtracted intensity) was normalized to values for L7 and plotted as relative units. The following oligonucleotides (oligos) were synthesized (core consensus TCF sites are capitalized): wild-type PKD1 (−1,965 to −1,951) TBE1 (gtttCTTTGTTtttt); mutant PKD1 TBE1 (gcgcCTTTGggtttt); wild-type TBE1 core site (cgggCTTTGTTgggg); optimal (TOP) TCF-4 (5′-agctggtaagATCAAAGgg-3′); and mutant (FOP) TCF-4 (5′-agctggtaaggcCAAAGgg-3′) (38Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Complementary oligos were annealed and end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A GST-TCF-4 fusion protein was purified from DH5α cells by GSH-Sepharose affinity, and the protein product was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-LEF/TCF antibody (Maine Biotechnology Services). Nuclear extracts were prepared using NuPer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Binding reactions containing 15,000 cpm of labeled DNA were incubated for 30 min on ice with 300 ng of fusion protein or 5 μg of nuclear extract and 500 ng of poly(dI·dC) in 20 mm Hepes, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 12.5% (v/v) glycerol. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed in 4% native polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. For supershift analysis, 500 ng of an anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or an anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated with nuclear extract for 30 min on ice followed by incubation with DNA for 30 min on ice. The PKD1 gene lies in a complex region of DNA on chromosome 16 (36). More than two-thirds of the 5′-end of the gene is duplicated several times in an area proximal to the PKD1gene on chromosome 16. This PKD1 homologous region appears to give rise to multiple transcripts (39Bogdanova N. Markoff A. Gerke V. McCluskey M. Horst J. Dworniczak B. Genomics. 2001; 74: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A 38,849-bp cosmid clone (LANL) 2H2 has in its 3′-end, the 5′-portion of the PKD1gene and a long 5′-upstream region. Based on homology with availablePKD1 sequence and differences with PKD1homologous regions, 2P. Harris, personal communication. we can conclude that this cosmid clone contains the genuine PKD1gene. This cosmid DNA was used to amplify a 3,414-bp sequence from −3,363 to +51, which was analyzed for putative cis-acting elements utilizing the OMIGA sequence analysis software (Oxford Molecular) and TESS (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/index.html). Typical TATA- and CAAT-boxes are absent from this proximal 5′-flanking region; however, a GC-rich region was identified within close proximity to the transcription start site. Numerous transcription factor consensus binding motifs were found in the PKD1 promoter, including AP-1, AP-2, Sp1, Ets, and four TCF binding elements (CTTTGA/TA/T). To test for promoter activity, a number of deletion constructs were made, and their activities were determined following transfection into human (HEK293T) and monkey (COS-1) kidney cell lines (Fig. 1). The constructs appeared to have similar promoter activities in the two cell lines. The 2.0-kb construct containing the −2,018 to +33 region supported the highest level of transcription in both cell lines, suggesting that there may be a negative element in the distal 1.3 kb-region. To determine whether β-catenin is potentially capable of regulating the transcription of the PKD1 gene, we transfectedPKD1 promoter-luciferase reporters into HEK293T cells and measured their responses to cotransfected β-catenin expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant CA β-catenin. HEK293T cells had been shown previously to express TCF-4 and to support β-catenin-dependent activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (40Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). β-catenin induction of the 3.3-kb construct (data not shown) was less significant when compared with that of the 2.0-kb fragment. Therefore, we concentrated our studies on the 2.0-kb fragment, which contains the most proximal TCF site (TBE1). The transcriptional activity of the 2.0-kb fragment showed a dose-dependent response to increasing amounts of cotransfected wild-type β-catenin (Fig. 2A). The response of the 2.0-kb fragment to a CA β-catenin (Fig. 2B, left panel) was similar to that of the β-catenin target, cyclin D1 (right panel) under the same transfection and assay conditions. To further confirm the role of β-catenin/TCF-4 in the activation of the PKD1 promoter, we attempted to inhibit its activity in HEK293T cells with a dominant-negative TCF-4 mutant (DN TCF). As shown in Fig. 2C, cotransfected DN TCF suppressed the activity of the 2.0-kb promoter fragment in the presence or absence of exogenous β-catenin. To determine whether the response of the 2.0-kb construct to induction by β-catenin depends specifically on the TBE1 site, we tested the activities of several deletions in the TBE1 region. An extended deletion of 109-bp at the 5′-end of the 2.0-kb fragment (gatctctggc acattttatt tgctctgtct caccacatgg attttgtttt tttgtttCTT TGTTttttga gatggagtct cactcttgtt gcccaggctg gagtgccat) completely abrogated β-catenin induction (Fig.3A). Deletion of 15 bp (underlined) containing the TCF consensus motif (capital letters) did not abolish induction (data not shown), possibly because there are other AT-rich sequences in this region that could substitute as TCF binding sites. A 28-bp deletion (bold face) removing this AT-rich DNA and the TCF motif strongly reduced the effect of transfected β-catenin (Fig. 3A). To further examine the 109-bp sequence, its functional response was tested when cloned upstream of a minimal promoter. As shown, the 109-bp sequence was capable of being induced by β-catenin (Fig. 3B). These results, taken together, suggest that there might be interactions between β-catenin and/or TCF with other transcription factors within this region that are involved in conferring the observed β-catenin responsiveness. To determine whether the TBE1 sequence is capable of binding TCF, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using a synthetic double-stranded DNA, gtttCTTTGTTtttt, containing the consensus TCF binding motif (capital letters). The oligo was able to form a DNA-protein complex with a GST-fusion protein containing the DNA-binding domain of human TCF-4 (Fig.4A, GST-TCF). As a control, a DNA-protein complex was formed with GST-TCF and an optimal TCF-4 site, TOP (T), but failed to form with the mutated binding site, FOP (F). The TBE1 complex with GST-TCF could be competed with an excess of unlabeled TBE1. The 15-bp TBE1 oligo also formed DNA-protein complexes with nuclear extract from HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B, arrows), suggesting that the PKD1 TBE1 site can bind native TCF and β-catenin. The TBE1 complexes were completely eliminated by competition with excess unlabeled TBE1 and partially eliminated by competition with excess unlabeled TOP (theasterisk indicates a remaining DNA-protein complex). EMSA using the TOP oligo also resulted in the formation of two DNA-protein complexes, which were completely eliminated by competition with excess TBE1 or TOP. As shown in Fig. 4C, the wild-type 15-bp oligo was able to form a complex with GST-TCF (but not GST alone) and with nuclear extracts from HCT, which have a β-catenin-stabilizing mutation (41Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar), and from HEK293T cells transfected with mutated constitutively active β-catenin (293T). Mutation of this 15-bp oligo (gcgcCTTTGggtttt), leaving only 5 bp of the core of the TCF motif (capital letters), abrogated the binding both with GST-TCF and with the HCT and 293T nuclear extracts (Fig. 4C). Although we were unable to supershift the wild-type 15-bp oligo using an anti-β-catenin antibody, possibly because of other protein factors preventing an interaction with the antibody, we did supershift a probe containing the TBE1 core site (cgggCTTTGTTgggg) and nuclear extract from HCT cells (Fig. 4C, right panel). As expected, no such complex was formed using an anti-c-Myc antibody. The functional response of this 15-bp TBE1 TCF site was also tested in isolation. A single copy of the wild-type 15-bp TBE1 sequence in pGL3-Basic was able to confer β-catenin responsiveness in a dose-dependent manner, which was strongly inhibited by cotransfection with DN TCF (Fig.5A), whereas mutation of the core TCF motif strongly reduced β-catenin responsiveness (Fig.5B), consistent with the wild-type sequence acting as a TCF binding site.FIG. 5Response of the 15-bp TBE1 sequence to β-catenin. A, a single copy of the wild-type 15-bp TBE1 sequence containing the consensus TCF binding motif (underlined) was able to confer β-catenin responsiveness in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells, which was strongly inhibited by cotransfection with DN TCF.B, mutation of the core TCF motif in the 15-bp TBE1 sequence (gg) strongly reduced the responsiveness to CA β-catenin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether expression of the endogenous PKD1 gene responds to β-catenin, human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were treated with 20 mm LiCl, a known inhibitor of GSK-3β activity that results in the stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin and elevation of nuclear β-catenin. PKD1 gene expression was assayed by RT-PCR and compared with the expression of a control that should not respond to β-catenin, the ribosomal protein L7 gene. As shown in Fig. 6A, PKD1 mRNA levels increased ∼1.6-fold in response to LiCl, whereas L7 mRNA did not increase. We also stably transfected HeLa cells with CA β-catenin and determined the effect of overexpression of this mutant form of β-catenin, which cannot be targeted for degradation. β-catenin levels were shown to be increased in these transfected cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 6B) and by immunofluorescence (Fig.6C). Cells transfected with β-catenin showed ∼3-fold increase in PKD1 mRNA levels, whereas L7 mRNA levels were unaffected (Fig. 6B). These results are consistent with the endogenous PKD1 gene being a target of the β-catenin pathway. The 5′-flanking 3.3-kb region of the human PKD1 gene was isolated and analyzed for promoter activity. Functional analysis of deletion constructs fused to a luciferase reporter in HEK293T and COS-1 cells revealed strong transcriptional activity within this 3.3-kb region, with the highest activity localized to the 2.0-kb proximal fragment. Analysis of the 5′-flanking region by TESS predicted a cluster of Sp-1 binding sites just upstream of the transcription start site. Sp-1 plays a key role in regulating the transcription initiation of TATA-less promoters (42Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and is temporally and spatially regulated during nephrogenesis in a pattern that suggests that it may be important in kidney development (43Cohen H.T. Bossone S.A. Zhu G. McDonald G.A. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2901-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the PKD1 promoter also revealed four core TCF/LEF binding element (TBE1–4) consensus sequences. We focused on the most proximal element, TBE1, which is the only TCF site contained within the 2.0-kb proximal fragment. The 2.0-kb fragment showed a dose-responsive induction by β-catenin, which was inhibited by cotransfection with a dominant-negative TCF construct. Deletion of a 109-bp sequence containing the TBE1 site completely abolished the β-catenin responsiveness of the 2.0-kb fragment. In addition, both this 109-bp fragment and a 15-bp fragment within it containing the TBE1 site were able to confer β-catenin responsiveness when placed upstream of a minimal promoter. The response of the 15-bp TBE1 site was reduced or eliminated by mutation of the core consensus TCF motif or by dominant-negative TCF. Furthermore, the wild-type 15-bp sequence, but not the mutated 15-bp sequence, was able to form DNA-protein complexes using nuclear extracts from cells known to contain β-catenin/TCF and with a GST-TCF fusion protein. We conclude from these experiments that the TBE1 site in the PKD1 promoter is a β-catenin/TCF response element. Although we did not focus on the three upstream TBE elements (TBEs 2–4), it is quite possible that they are also β-catenin/TCF response elements because we have shown that a 1.3-kb fragment containing all three (but lacking TBE1) is also induced by β-catenin (data not shown). Further analysis will be required to determine which (one or whether all three) has the potential to act as a TCF response element. Finally, to determine whether expression of the endogenous PKD1 gene is able to respond to increases in β-catenin, we treated human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells with LiCl, which is a known inhibitor of GSK-3β activity and results in the stabilization of β-catenin. We also stably transfected HeLa cells with CA β-catenin. In both cases, we were able to demonstrate that endogenous PKD1 mRNA levels were elevated in response to the treatments, supporting the idea that the PKD1 gene is a β-catenin target. Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that the secreted Wnt factors, through Frizzled receptors, activate Disheveled and inhibit GSK-3β to stabilize β-catenin (24Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Roose J. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1424: M23-M37PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that β-catenin levels are regulated by other mechanisms such as the PKB/akt pathway (44Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Bertrand F. Cherqui G. Perret C. Capeau J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The extent to which these pathways participate in the regulation of PKD1 expression will have to be determined in future studies. A number of observations have suggested that the level of PKD1 expression may be important in PKD. Mice containing multiple copies of a human PKD1 transgene were found to have cystic kidneys, suggesting that PKD1 overexpression can play a role in cystic disease (21Pritchard L. Sloane-Stanley J.A. Sharpe J.A. Aspinwall R., Lu, W. Buckle V. Strmecki L. Walker D. Ward C.J. Alpers C.E. Zhou J. Wood W.G. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2617-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Elevated polycystin-1 mRNA and protein levels have been reported in cystic epithelium (5Ward C.J. Turley H. Ong A.C. Comley M. Biddolph S. Chetty R. Ratcliffe P.J. Gattner K. Harris P.C. Proc. Natl.

Sharma C.P. Kim K. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Arnaout M.A. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 702-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PKD1 mRNA and polycystin-1 protein have been reported in end-stage ADPKD kidneys (47Perrone R.D. Grubman S.A. Murray S.L. Lee D.W. Alper S.L. Jefferson D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1748-C1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These later observations may be explained by the dedifferentiated state of cystic epithelial cells or by a loss of a negative feedback loop regulating PKD1 gene expression. Because this work has shown that the PKD1 gene is a target of β-catenin, it is interesting to note that several instances have been reported that may be relevant to PKD. β-catenin has been shown to regulate the reorganization of renal epithelial cell aggregates into long tubules (48Pollack A.L. Barth A.I. Altschuler Y. Nelson W.J. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and therefore may be important in normal tubulogenesis. Increased stability of β-catenin was found in immortalized cpk cells (a mouse model of recessive PKD) (32van Adelsberg J. Nephrol. Dial.

Together, these results suggest that increased levels of soluble β-catenin may cause overexpression of the normal (and/or mutated) PKD1 gene, which in turn may contribute to cyst formation in PKD.

Here we show that tropomyosin is highly efficient in transforming even the smallest gelsolin-actin complexes into long actin filaments. At low concentrations of tropomyosin, the effect of tropomyosin depends on the length of the actin oligomer, and the cooperative nature of the process is a direct indication that tropomyosin induces a conformational change in the gelsolin-actin complexes, altering the structure at the actin (+) end such that capping by gelsolin is abolished. At increased concentrations of tropomyosin, heterodimers, trimers, and tetramers are converted to actin filaments. In addition, evidence is presented demonstrating that gelsolin, once removed from the (+) end of the actin, can reassociate with the newly formed tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments. Interestingly, the binding of gelsolin to the tropomyosin-actin filament complexes saturates at 2 gelsolin molecules per 14 actin and 2 tropomyosins, i.e. two gelsolins per tropomyosin-regulatory unit along the filament.

The plasticity of this chemo-mechanical transduction system is regulated by a large number of diverse proteins, binding either monomeric or filamentous actin. The regulation involves proteins controlling actin assembly, organizing filaments by cross-linking, and translocating formed actin filament ensembles (1Sheterline P. Handel S.E. Molloy C. Hendry K.A.

Gelsolin is an abundant actin binding protein thought to be involved in cell shape regulation by controlling actin assembly at the (+) end (fast growing end) of actin filaments and by severing actin filaments (5Sun H.Q.

Gelsolin consists of six homologous domains (6Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C.

Domain 1 of gelsolin has a calcium-insensitive high affinity actin-binding site (K d 5 pm), and domain 4 a calcium-sensitive, lower affinity actin-binding site (K d 1.8 μm) (12Pope B. Maciver S. Weeds A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Domain 2 has been shown to bind to actin filaments with a K d of 2–7 μm (13Sun H.Q. Wooten D.C. Janmey P.A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5322-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Gelsolin can nucleate filament formation by forming a complex with two actin monomers. In this process, gelsolin binds to the (+) end of the monomers, thereby initiating growth of a filament, where monomers are added to the (−) end of the gelsolin-actin nucleus (15Yin H.L. Hartwig J.H. Maruyama K. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Lind S.E. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. Yin H.L.

Gelsolin remains bound as a cap on the (+) end of the filament, inhibiting the further addition of actin monomers at that site. Similarly, gelsolin remains bound to the (+) end of one of the fragments after a severing event. These gelsolin activities can be regulated by Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides (17Yin H.L. Stossel T.P.

Gelsolin has been detected at this location by electron microscopy using gold-labeled gelsolin antibodies (26Hartwig J.H. Chambers K.A. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). With the use of such antibodies in indirect immunofluorescence, gelsolin has also been shown to colocalize with both actin stress fibers in non-muscle cells (27Dissmann E. Hinssen H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 336-344PubMed Google Scholar, 28Arora P.D. Janmey P.A. McCulloch C.A. Exp.

Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The function of gelsolin in these structures is unknown. Skeletal muscle tropomyosin is a 40-nm-long coiled-coil heterodimeric protein with seven actin-binding sites (30Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Varnell T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), displaying strong cooperative binding to actin filaments (31Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 839-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At saturation, both sides of the actin filament are associated with tropomyosin, creating regulatory units along the filament consisting of 14 consecutive actin monomers. Studies on truncated forms of tropomyosin show that the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein have major influences on its actin binding capacity and its regulatory properties (32Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Moraczewska J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The multiple binding sites and end-to-end binding are the likely basis for the cooperative regulation by calcium via troponin of the actomyosin interaction in skeletal muscle fibers (34Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Myofibers express two isoforms of tropomyosin, whereas non-muscle cells express 6–8 isoforms, whose pattern of expression depends on the type of cell and the physiological conditions (35Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 36Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev.

There is also a variation in the cellular distribution of the tropomyosin isoforms, suggesting different tropomyosins in functionally different actin organizations in the cell (38Lin J.J. Hegmann T.E. Lin J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Schevzov G. Gunning P. Jeffrey P.L. Temm-Grove C. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J. Weinberger R.P. Mol. Cell.

Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tropomyosin inhibits gelsolin severing of α-actin filaments (44Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and anneals gelsolin-capped filaments, an effect enhanced by caldesmon (45Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite all the available information about tropomyosin, its role in regulating the actomyosin system in both non-muscle and muscle cells is still unclear. Smooth and non-muscle cells do not express troponin; instead, these cells seem to control their actomyosin system by other mechanisms, involving either calcium/calmodulin-regulated caldesmon, a tropomyosin-interacting protein with some homology to troponin (46Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12317-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or phosphorylation of myosin (47Redowicz M.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The observations reported here indicate that tropomyosin as well as gelsolin might have important functions in addition to those described before. First, tropomyosin is remarkably effective in transforming gelsolin-actin complexes into long filaments. In fact, even short gelsolin-actin complexes (heterodimers, GA1; heterotrimers, GA2; and heterotetramers, GA3) can be converted into long filaments by tropomyosin. Second, the appearance of free gelsolin demonstrates that tropomyosin actually dissociates the gelsolin-actin complexes. Finally, tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments were found to bind gelsolin with a distinct stoichiometry of 2 gelsolin molecules per 14 actins and 2 tropomyosins. Bovine β-actin was purified from calf thymus (48Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. Hellsten E. Tjader A.C. Hult T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The actin was stored in G buffer pH 7.6 (5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT) and used within a week or drop-frozen in (25-μl aliquots) liquid nitrogen. Bovine plasma gelsolin was purified from calf serum utilizing Ca2+-dependent absorption to DEAE-cellulose based on earlier protocols with some modifications (49Kurokawa H. Fujii W. Ohmi K. Sakurai T. Nonomura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 50Bryan J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 88-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Bovine blood obtained fresh from the slaughterhouse was clotted at room temperature for 2 h, and the clot was removed by centrifugation. Five hundred milliliters of serum was dialyzed in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C, 45 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm DTT (buffer A) with continuous buffer changes. The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. In the presence of Ca2+, gelsolin is recovered in the flow-through. After the addition of EGTA to the flow-through (2 mm final concentration), the solution was directly applied to a second DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA, allowing gelsolin to bind to the matrix. Gelsolin was eluted with a 1–4 mm CaCl2 linear gradient in 25 mm Tris HCl, 30 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Finally, EGTA was added to the eluate to a concentration of 5 mm. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the protein was dialyzed into a storage buffer containing 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, at 4 °C, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm DTT. Rabbit skeletal muscle tropomyosin was purified as described earlier (51Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients of 0.63 ml·mg·cm−1 for actin at 290 nm, 1.538 ml·mg·cm−1 for gelsolin at 280 nm, and 0.3 ml·mg·cm−1 for tropomyosin at 280 nm. The effect of tropomyosin binding to gelsolin-capped actin filaments was monitored using a sedimentation assay. For this, samples of β-actin (20 or 10 μm) mixed with increasing concentrations of gelsolin (0.1–20 μm) in G buffer was prepared. Polymerization was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 100 mm, respectively. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h, then tropomyosin was added to final concentrations of 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, or 10 μm, and the mixtures were incubated for another hour. The samples were ultracentrifuged at room temperature for 30 min at 30 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were briefly washed with F-buffer and resuspended in equal volumes of G buffer. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions was performed using 4–15% Tris-HCl precast gels according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Bio-Rad). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and the amount of protein was estimated by densitometry using ImageQuant 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics). The molar ratio between the actin, gelsolin, and tropomyosin was calculated using values corrected for the differential uptake of Coomassie stain in the proteins. To determine protein concentrations, a standard curve (0.05–0.6 nmol of bovine serum albumin) was included when scanning the gels. The experimental data were fit to a nonlinear curve using the Hill equation (53Hill A.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1910; 40: 4-8Google Scholar) (Microcal ORIGIN), which provides a measure of the cooperativity of the reaction. The fraction of sedimented actin was normalized to 1.0 by dividing the amount of actin recovered in the pellet with the total amount of actin in the reaction mix. Polymerization of actin was monitored by recording the increase in fluorescence of co-polymerized 2% pyrenyl-labeled bovine β-actin (54Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) using a Fluoroscan II plate reader (Labsystems) (55Schüler H. Korenbaum E. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The nucleation assay studied the conversion of monomeric actin to polymeric actin in samples containing Ca2+-G-actin (2.5 μm) and increasing concentrations of gelsolin (0–120 nm) in G buffer. The polymerization reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to 2 and 100 mm, respectively. The salts were added to all wells simultaneously with a Multitip pipette (Finnpipette) with a delay between the addition of salt and the first measurement of 15 s. An aliquot (20 μl) of the sample was placed on a glow-discharged carbon-coated Formvar copper grid for 60 s, after which a 15-μl drop of 1% uranyl acetate was placed on the grid for 15 s (repeated seven times). Grids were viewed with a Philips CM120 electron microscope at 80 kV and with 45,000× or 60,000× nominal magnification. Actin (30 μm) was mixed with gelsolin (3 μm) and tropomyosin (4 μm) and treated as described above. After ultracentrifugation of the sample, the supernatant was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated using standard proteins provided by the manufacturer (AmershamBiosciences). The column was equilibrated with F buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl) and eluted at a rate of 12 cm/h. The protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and native PAGE gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the complex was determined by interpolation of R f versus M r using the molecular weight standard curve. Gel filtration chromatography was performed at 4 °C. Previous workers have used skeletal muscle α-actin in their studies of the gelsolin-actin interaction. We have presented evidence that muscle α- and non-muscle β-actin differ in the timing and release of inorganic phosphate from polymerizing actin (56Nyman T. Schuler H. Korenbaum E. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, the interaction between plasma gelsolin and non-muscle β-actin was studied by following the gelsolin-induced nucleation of β-actin polymerization. For this, a series of polymerization experiments were performed by varying the concentration of gelsolin (Fig. 1). The polymerization rate was calculated from the slope of the curves in the region where the increase in fluorescence intensity versustime was approximately linear. In the gelsolin-nucleated reaction, the polymerization rate was directly proportional to the concentration of active gelsolin molecules added, and the apparent rate constant for polymerization can be described by the expressiond[F-actin]/dt = k +[gelsolin][actin monomer]. The gelsolin nucleation of β-actin polymerization gives an apparent rate constant (k +) of 0.2 μm−1s−1 for the addition of monomers at the (−) end. Thus, the rate of polymerization relative to gelsolin concentration obtained with non-muscle β-actin was more than three times higher than that previously reported for gelsolin-nucleated polymerization of muscle α-actin (57Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1986; 7: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It was observed earlier that the addition of tropomyosin to short gelsolin-capped actin filaments resulted in longer filaments (44Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described here establish the highly efficient nature of this process. As shown in Fig.2 a, gelsolin and actin mixed in a 1:50 molar ratio gave rise to short actin filaments of an average length of 120 nm, in good agreement with the expected length (50 monomers × 2.7 nm = 135 nm). The electron micrograph in Fig.2 b illustrates that tropomyosin added to such gelsolin-actin complexes resulted in the formation of long filaments several micrometers in length. With gelsolin and actin mixed in a 1:3 molar ratio (Fig. 2 c), the product appeared as short, mainly globular structures. Tropomyosin had the capacity to convert these gelsolin-actin complexes into long actin filaments (Fig.2 d). The filaments obtained here are clearly different in appearance compared with those in Fig. 2 b. Most likely, this is due to the association of the filaments with significant amounts of gelsolin (see below). The efficiency by which tropomyosin transforms gelsolin-actin complexes was studied by mixing β-actin (10 μm) with decreasing concentrations (10–0.2 μm) of gelsolin to form gelsolin-capped actin oligomers of lengths varying from 1 to 200 monomers. After 1 h of incubation in the presence or absence of tropomyosin, the samples were centrifuged, and the material in the pellets and supernatants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see “Materials and Methods”). The addition of 1.5 μm tropomyosin resulted in a sigmoidal increase in sedimentable tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments (Fig. 3, closed circles). The transition began at a point where the gelsolin-actin complexes were expected to contain 6–7 actin monomers, implying that each side of the actin oligomers presented only three consecutive binding sites for the seven complementary sites on tropomyosin. The midpoint of the transition occurred at an estimated actin oligomer length of 14 actin monomers. The process was characterized by a Hill coefficient of 2.0 ± 0.4, corresponding to 2 tropomyosins per 14 actin monomers. In control experiments (Fig. 3, ×) involving only β-actin and gelsolin, actin did not appear in the pellets unless the gelsolin-capped actin oligomers contained at least 100 actin monomers. To further investigate the cooperativity of the process, three series of actin (20 μm) and gelsolin (20–0.1 μm) mixtures were prepared to which 3, 5, and 10 μmtropomyosin was added, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 (open symbols), the higher the concentration of tropomyosin, the higher the yield of sedimentable actin. Remarkably, in the presence of increased concentrations of tropomyosin, 80% of the actin from the shortest gelsolin-actin complexes were recovered in the pellet. This suggests that, in addition to the multi-site cooperative binding of tropomyosin to actin oligomers, there is a novel mechanism of tropomyosin displacing the tightly bound actin from gelsolin. With 10 μm tropomyosin and increasing concentrations of gelsolin, there was a dip in the recovery of sedimentable actin filaments (Fig.4, open circles), with a minimum reached at a 1:4 GA molar ratio. An indication of such a dip is also seen in Fig. 3(diamonds). Annealing of longer gelsolin-actin oligomers, GA80-GA8, should represent the effect of multiple-site interactions with tropomyosin. The interaction of tropomyosin with smaller gelsolin-actin complexes (GA2 and GA) shows that tropomyosin was very efficient also in dissociating gelsolin-actin heterodimers and trimers, resulting in sedimentation of more than 90% of the actin. The addition of gelsolin in molar excess over actin did not decrease the effect of tropomyosin. Furthermore, the corresponding supernatants (Fig. 4,closed circles) contained increased amounts of actin up to a maximum, which coincided with the minimum described above. Up to this point, the supernatants contained a 3-fold excess of actin (closed circles) to gelsolin (open diamonds), indicating the existence of GA3 complexes. Supernatants obtained after annealing of gelsolin-actin heterodimers and trimers, on the other hand, contained up to a 10-fold molar excess of gelsolin over actin, confirming that tropomyosin released gelsolin from actin and induced actin filament formation. To test whether the excess gelsolin was associated with tropomyosin or appeared in the free form, a corresponding sample was analyzed by gel chromatography on Superdex 200. Analysis of the fractions from the chromatography by SDS-PAGE gave no evidence for complex formation between tropomyosin and gelsolin. In fact, the two proteins appeared in the eluate completely separated from each other (data not shown). To characterize the status of the proteins remaining in the supernatant, a gelsolin-capped actin oligomer (1:10 molar ratio) was incubated with tropomyosin as described earlier, and the supernatant was collected and analyzed by gel chromatography (Fig.5). After tropomyosin annealing a gelsolin-actin complex of this length, one major component (I) with an approximate molecular mass of 200 kDa was found in the supernatant (Fig. 5 a). Analysis of this material by SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometry showed gelsolin and actin in a 1:3 molar ratio (Fig. 5 b). In addition to the GA3peak, there were two smaller peaks containing free gelsolin (II) and actin (III). Electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 5 c) confirmed the existence of one component, whose molecular mass appeared to be 260 kDa. Observations of significant amounts of gelsolin cosedimenting with the tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments prompted a more systematic analysis. For this, mixtures of actin with increasing concentrations of gelsolin were incubated with tropomyosin (10 μm), the mixtures were centrifuged, and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.6 a). As seen in Fig.6 b, increasing the concentrations of gelsolin resulted in increasing amounts of gelsolin cosedimenting with tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments. Saturation of the tropomyosin-actin filaments was reached at 0.15 mol of gelsolin per mol of actin, suggesting 2 gelsolin molecules per 14 actin monomers and 2 tropomyosins. The gelsolin bound to tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments with an apparent K d of 1.4 μm. Control experiments show that ultracentrifugation of mixtures containing gelsolin and tropomyosin in the absence of actin resulted in the appearance of only small amounts of gelsolin in the pellet. Gelsolin caps the actin filament (+) end with high affinity (K d in nm range). Partial dissociation of gelsolin from actin can be accomplished by the addition of calcium-chelating agents. Efficient dissociation of gelsolin from the (+) end of actin monomers or filaments in vitro has been accomplished only by the addition of polyphosphoinositides (18Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1987; 325: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), and evidence for the involvement of polyphosphoinositides in the control of actin polymerization in vivo has been reported (5Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Our observations that tropomyosin can dissociate GA complexes, including the high affinity-bound actin monomer strongly suggests that tropomyosin is an important element in the control of actin polymerization in the cell. Both the generation of free (+) ends and the tropomyosin-induced polymerization of small GA complexes could be important in this context. Actin filament (+) ends may be capped by other members of the gelsolin/villin family of actin regulatory proteins or by the ubiquitously expressed Cap Z (58Kwiatkowski D.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 59Witke W. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Southwick F.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of tropomyosin isoforms on filaments of the α-, β-, and γ-actin isoforms, capped by different (+) end binding proteins, need to be systematically investigated. There appear to be two mechanisms involved in the dissociation of gelsolin from actin oligomers by tropomyosin. One mechanism depends on multi-site association of tropomyosin with gelsolin-capped actin oligomers. It can be detected with gelsolin-actin oligomers containing six or more actin monomers even at low concentrations of tropomyosin. The midpoint of the transition from gelsolin-actin complexes to tropomyosin-bound actin polymers occurred when the complexes were about 14 monomers long. The cooperativity of the interaction seen in this case suggests that there is an underlying conformational change in the actin oligomer that causes the dissociation of gelsolin. A second mechanism operating at higher concentrations of tropomyosin causes the dissociation of small gelsolin-actin complexes, GA, GA2, and GA3, with lesser efficiency. This effect was unexpected, since the affinity of gelsolin for the actin filament (+) ends (K d <5 nm) is much higher than that of tropomyosin for filamentous actin (K d 0.2 μm) (60Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has been reported, however, that there is a calcium-dependent interaction between intact gelsolin and tropomyosin in vitro(K d 0.6 μm) (61Koepf E.K. Burtnick L.D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 56-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and that the actin filament binding domain 2 of gelsolin also binds to tropomyosin (62Maciver S.K. Ternent D. McLaughlin P.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is reasonable therefore to suggest that the tropomyosin effect on small gelsolin-actin complexes is due to tropomyosin causing a conformational change in the gelsolin molecule, resulting in its release from actin. The appearance of a minimum in the curve describing tropomyosin-driven conversion of GA complexes of varying lengths (Fig. 4) suggested that complexes consisting of gelsolin and three to five actins are more stable than either smaller or larger complexes. Analysis of the supernatants obtained in these experiments showed that GA3was the major, non-sedimentable component obtained from mixtures initially containing gelsolin and more than three actins. The explanation to GA3 being the most stable complex could be related to the fact that three of the domains of gelsolin interact with actin. It is possible that these domains bind to three different actin monomers and that this provides stability to a gelsolin-bound actin trimer. The dip in the curve mentioned above would then reflect the operation of the two mechanisms of tropomyosin-driven dissociation of GA complexes, annealing of longer gelsolin-bound actin complexes through multi-site interactions and annealing of shorter complexes due to tropomyosin-induced conformational change in gelsolin. The initial phase of the interaction involving both short and long GA complexes might result in the release of free gelsolin. In the case of long GA complexes, released gelsolin would reassociate with actin monomers to form stable GA3 complexes. Alternatively, multi-site interactions between tropomyosin and longer GA complexes could weaken the actin-actin bonds three monomers away from gelsolin, resulting in the direct dissociation of GA3 complexes. The observation that GA3 complexes are particularly stable is in agreement with results obtained in a systematic study of the appearance of stable complexes formed with gelsolin and actin mixed in different proportions and under different conditions. 2K. Narayan, M. Nyåhern-Meazza, S. Irischholz, C. E. Schutt, and U. Lindberg, submitted for publication. Several lines of evidence indicate that actin filaments can exist in at least two different conformational states depending on the type of ligand bound to the polymer. Gelsolin binding to the (+) end of an actin filament changes the polymer conformation, stabilizing the filament in a state that binds proteins of the ADF/cofilin family with increased affinity. Biochemical data suggest that this effect propagates 10–20 monomers from the (+) end of the filament (63Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained by electron microscopy and time-resolved phosphorescence and absorption anisotropy indicate that the effect of gelsolin extends over longer distances and involves changes in the helicity and torsional flexibility of the actin filament (64Orlova A. Prochniewicz E. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 598-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 65Prochniewicz E. Zhang Q. Janmey P.A. Thomas D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 756-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that binding of ADF/cofilin to F-actin changes the helical twist of actin filaments (66McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). ADF/cofilin and tropomyosin display mutually exclusive binding to actin filaments (67Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R. Cell Motil. 1982; 2: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 68Nishida E. Maekawa S. Sakai H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5307-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 69Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This appears not to be due to steric hindrance, since the two proteins do not have overlapping binding sites on actin filaments (70McGough A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 71Ono S. Ono K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Phalloidin can bind to tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments (72De La Cruz E. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14387-14392Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas it cannot bind to cofilin-decorated filaments (63Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that cofilin and tropomyosin stabilize different conformers of actin. Also, as mentioned above, the relative affinity of ADF/cofilin for actin filaments is increased by gelsolin (63Ressad F. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20894-20902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), whereas phalloidin is displaced by the binding of gelsolin (73Allen P.G. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32916-32923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, tropomyosin and phalloidin appear to stabilize one state of the actin filament and gelsolin and ADF/cofilin another. The observations reported here further support the idea of multiple conformations of actin filaments accessible via cooperative transitions along the length of the filaments induced by binding of various actin-binding proteins. How an interplay between tropomyosin and ADF/cofilin might be used by cells to control actin polymerization is unclear. It is possible that signal transduction pathways controlling the activity of ADF/cofilin (74Amano T. Tanabe K. Eto T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 75Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) in turn control the activity of tropomyosin described here. Our observation that tropomyosin establishes the position of gelsolin along actin filaments points to an intimate functional connection between these two proteins. This recalls observations that gelsolin is colocalized with actin stress fibers in tissue-cultured cells (27Dissmann E. Hinssen H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 336-344PubMed Google Scholar, 28Arora P.D. Janmey P.A. McCulloch C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in myofibrils (29Gonsior S. Hinssen H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gelsolin was shown to be important for stress fiber contractility in vivo (28Arora P.D. Janmey P.A. McCulloch C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), andin vitro gelsolin enhances the actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity (76Onji T. Takagi M. Shibata N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 77Albanesi J.P. Coue M. Fujisaki H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13276-13280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect potentiated by tropomyosin and dependent on calcium ions (76Onji T. Takagi M. Shibata N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 78Dabrowska R. Hinssen H. Galazkiewicz B. Nowak E. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, the calcium-sensitive troponin complex forms a regulatory unit with tropomyosin, controlling the actomyosin ATPase. It has long been held, dating back to Bremel and Weber (79Bremel R.D. Weber A. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 238: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), that conformational changes propagated along tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments confer cooperativity to the regulation of force development. Stress fibers in non-muscle cells consist of bundles of actin filaments with periodic arrangements of both myosin and tropomyosin, perhaps forming regulatory units similar to those in sarcomeres of muscle cells (80Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 202-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A possible mechanistic implication of the observations discussed here is that gelsolin-tropomyosin-decorated actin filaments can sustain the directional propagation of force progressively from one regulatory unit to the next. In this model, gelsolin conditions actin filaments for tension development, a role similar to that of troponin in muscle cells.

https://openalex.org/W1982897381,"S100A3 is a unique member of the EF-hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins. It binds Ca2+ with poor affinity (Kd = 4–35 mm) but Zn2+ with exceptionally high affinity (Kd = 4 nm). This high affinity for Zn2+ is attributed to the unusual high Cys content of S100A3. The protein is highly expressed in fast proliferating hair root cells and astrocytoma pointing toward a function in cell cycle control. We determined the crystal structure of the protein at 1.7 Å. The high resolution structure revealed a large distortion of the C-terminal canonical EF-hand, which most likely abolishes Ca2+binding. The crystal structure of S100A3 allows the prediction of one putative Zn2+ binding site in the C terminus of each subunit of S100A3 involving Cys and His residues in the coordination of the metal ion.

S100A3 is a member of the S100 protein family, which constitutes a large subgroup of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins. S100 proteins have a size of 10–12 kDa and form homo- and heterodimers (1Scha¨fer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 2Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Each subunit is composed of two helix-loop-helix (EF-hand) motifs connected by a hinge region. The C-terminal EF-hand contains the canonical Ca2+ binding loop, common to all EF-hand proteins. The N-terminal EF-hand consists of 14 amino acids and is characteristic of the S100 proteins. Upon Ca2+ binding the EF-hand Ca2+ sensor proteins like calmodulin, troponin C, S100B, and S100A6 undergo a conformational change. Unlike ubiquitous calmodulin, the different members of the S100 family show cell- and tissue-specific expression and are involved in widely different processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell growth, cell differentiation, and mobility (3Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, the different S100 proteins interact with annexin, myosin, intermediate filaments, guanylate cyclase, and p53 (2Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Several S100 proteins are secreted to the extracellular space (4Davey G.E. Murmann P. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol.

Differential expression of S100 proteins has been observed in several tumors, like S100A1, S100A2, S100A3, S100A4, and S100A6 in breast cancer (7Sastry M. Ketchem R.R. Crescenzi O. Weber C.

Because both cell types are characterized by high proliferation rates S100A3 is supposed to be involved in cell cycle progression. Generally, the dimeric S100 proteins bind four Ca2+ per dimer (Kd = 20–500 μm). Besides Ca2+ a number of S100 proteins bind Zn2+ with a wide range of affinities (Kd = 0.1–2000 μm) (3Heizmann C.W.

The binding of Ca2+ to S100B induces a reorientation of helix HIII by over 90° whereas helices HI, HII, and HIIIpractically do not move. Thereby a hydrophobic surface is exposed (15Matsumura H.

Among the S100 proteins S100A3 is exceptional with regard to its high Cys content (10 Cys in a total of 101 amino acids per subunit) and metal ion affinities: it binds Ca2+ with poorer affinity (Kd = 4–35 mm) (30Fo¨hr U.G.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) than all other S100 proteins, ruling out a Ca2+-dependent physiological function of this protein. The low Ca2+ affinity is astonishing because there is no hint from the primary structure that indicates the presence of two functional EF-hands per subunit. In contrast to its low Ca2+ affinity S100A3 binds 4 Zn2+ per dimer with unique high affinity (30Fo¨hr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Scha¨fer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Zn2+ ions bind exclusively to Cys and His residues in S100A3 as shown by different spectroscopic techniques (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However there is no sequence homology to other high affinity Zn2+-binding proteins like Zn2+ finger proteins (32Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) or metallothioneins (33Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Here we report the high resolution structure of metal ion-free S100A3. The structure reveals a distortion in the C-terminal canonical EF-hand abolishing Ca2+ binding. Furthermore, it is shown that S100A3 binds Zn2+ under physiological conditions, inducing a large conformational change and dissociation of the homodimer. One putative Zn2+-binding site in each subunit was identified in the crystal structure, and a model for the Zn2+-loaded S100A3 protein is proposed. Human S100A3 was expressed and purified as described previously (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, S100A3 was expressed in Escherichia coli as maltose-binding fusion protein. After affinity chromatography and cleavage by factor Xa the protein was purified by anion exchange (TMAE, Merck) and size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). Metal ions were removed from the buffers by a passage over a Chelex (Bio-Rad) column. The high cysteine content makes S100A3 susceptible to air oxidation resulting in aggregation and precipitation. Partial oxidation of S100A3 occurs even at −70 °C. Therefore S100A3 was reduced prior to the experiments with a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol over Cys content in 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA. The dithiothreitol and EDTA were removed by passage over a Nap-5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in nitrogen-saturated 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The Cys content was determined with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) in 6.0 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA following the absorption at 412 nm (ε = 13 600m−1 cm−1) or by modification with iodoacetamide and subsequent mass spectroscopic analysis. The metal-free protein (250 μm S100A3, 300 μmS100A6, or 400 μm S100B) was dialyzed under exclusion of oxygen against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1–4 mm reduced glutathione and 10 μmZnCl2 at 25 °C. After 24 h the Zn2+content was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The affinity of S100A3 for Zn2+ was calculated using the known affinity constant of glutathione to Zn2+ (34Perrin D.D. Watt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 (10/30) column connected to a FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, and NaCl concentrations varying from 50 to 500 mm. The column was calibrated using molecular mass standard proteins (66,000–6,500 Da; Sigma). The metal-free structure of S100A3 determined in this study was used as a basis for modeling a Zn2+-S100A3 complex. Modeling was performed with the Insight II package (MSI) and DeepView (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar). CD spectra of S100A3 were recorded with a Jasco-715 spectrometer using 1-mm quartz cuvettes in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Crystallization and structure determination of S100A3 was performed as published elsewhere (53Mittl P.R.E. Fritz G. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Heizmann C.W. Gru¨tter M.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystals of S100A3 were grown by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Typically, 2 μl of S100A3 (12–15 mg ml−1) was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 1.8 m ammonium sulfate). Crystals grew within 2 days and belonged to the space group P31 with unit cell dimensions: a =b = 58.8 Å, b = 45.3 Å containing one homodimer per asymmetric unit. The crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 30% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in the nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Data to 2.0 Å resolution were collected in house. The resolution was extended to 1.7 Å using synchrotron radiation at the ESRF beamline ID14–3 (Grenoble, France). The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement using xenon and iodide as heavy atom derivatives. The calculation of phases and initial model building was performed using ARP/wARP 5.1 (37Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). In the intermediate stages, manual rebuilding was performed using O (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The model was refined using CNS (39Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

The coordinates and structure factors of S100A3 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1KSO. Figures were generated using BOBSCRIPT (40Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human S100A3 was determined by the multiple anomalous dispersion method using xenon and iodide as heavy atom derivatives and was refined at 1.7 Å.1 There was one homodimer in the asymmetric unit, consistent with the fact that S100A3 forms a homodimer in solution. The final model comprises two chains (A and B) containing all residues from Ala2 to Pro94 each as well as 207 water molecules. The side chain of residue GluB49 could not be assigned in the electron density map. The overall structure of S100A3 resembles the NMR structures of Ca2+-free S100B (82 Cα, root mean square derivative 3.4 Å) (21Drohat A.C. Tjandra N. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and Ca2+-free S100A6 (83 Cα, r.m.s.d. 3.2 Å) (7Sastry M. Ketchem R.R. Crescenzi O. Weber C. Lubienski M.J. Hidaka H. Chazin W.J. Structure. 1998; 6: 223-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Each subunit is built of two EF-hand domains connected by a hinge region (Fig.1). The dimer interface is built by hydrophobic residues located on helices HI/HIV′ (Leu5, Val9, Ile13, Phe16/Phe72′, Val76′, Ala80′, Cys83′, Cys86′) and helices HI′/HIV (Leu5′, Val9′, Ile13′, Phe16′/Phe72, Val76, Ala80, Cys83, Cys86), further by Tyr27, Tyr27′ on Loop L1/L1′, Trp45, Trp45′ in the hinge region, and Tyr89, Tyr89′, Phe90, and Phe90′ located on a C-terminal short α-helical segment. In Fig.2 a part of the hydrophobic interface is shown. The last seven C-terminal residues (Ser95-Gln101) of both subunits are not resolved in the crystal structure. This might be due to a conformational inhomogeneity introduced by cis-transisomerization of Pro94, Pro97, and Pro98, as observed for the homologous Pro residues in S100A2 (44Randazzo A. Acklin C. Scha¨fer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Chazin W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Figure 2Stereo view of a part of the hydrophobic interface of the S100A3 dimer.

Presence of oxygen leads to immediate disulfide formation and precipitation of the protein. All observed Cys residues (18 of 20 per homodimer) are in the reduced state and are not close enough to build up an intramolecular disulfide bond in the dimer. The sulfur atoms of Cys14/14′, Cys23/23′, Cys30/30′, Cys53/53′, and Cys68/68′are largely solvent-exposed, Cys81/81′ and Cys93/93′ are partly exposed, and Cys83/83′ and Cys86/86′ are completely shielded from the solvent (Fig.1). Although the primary structure of the C-terminal canonical EF-hand of S100A3 contains the EF-hand consensus sequence signature (45Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) it is not capable of binding Ca2+ with high affinity. The required residues Asp63 (position 1,X in the EF-hand consensus sequence), Asn65(position 3, Y), Asp67 (position 5,Z), Asp71 (position 9, −X), and Glu74 (position 12, −Z) are at the correct positions in the primary sequence (Fig.3). Only the glycine residue at position 6 of the consensus motif is replaced by Cys68. However, the glycine in position 6 is not strictly required for high affinity Ca2+ binding because several S100 proteins have a non-glycine residue in this position. Nevertheless, these S100 proteins are still binding Ca2+. The affinity for Ca2+rather reflects the change in free energy of the whole molecule going from the Ca2+-free to the Ca2+-loaded state. Therefore the comparison of structures in the Ca2+-free state with those in the Ca2+-loaded state can provide information about this energy and consequently about the Ca2+ affinity. In the following the structure of Ca2+-free S100A3 is compared with the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-loaded structures of S100B. Structural alignment of C-terminal EF-hand of Ca2+-free S100A3 with the corresponding EF-hand of Ca2+-free S100B revealed that the loop in S100A3 is apparently stretched (Fig.4A). Also the distance between helix HIII and helix HIV in Ca2+-free S100A3 is larger than in Ca2+-free S100B (Fig. 4A). We found that the distances of the Cα and side chain atoms of the Ca2+-coordinating residues Asp63, Asn65, Asp67, and Asp71 to helix HIV are 4–7 Å larger in S100A3 than the corresponding distances in Ca2+-free S100B (Fig.4A). Therefore, the motion of backbone and side chains required for coordination of Ca2+ has to be larger in S100A3 than in S100B and might be energetically less favorable (Fig. 4,A and B). Thus, the low affinity of S100A3 for Ca2+ can be readily explained by a distorted conformation of the C-terminal canonical EF-hand. The distortion of the loop is stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed mainly between backbone atoms of the N-terminal and C-terminal EF-hand, as well as by two bridging water molecules (Fig.5). NMR spectroscopic analysis of the Ca2+-free structures of calbindin D9K and S100B revealed a high degree of mobility and flexibility in the Ca2+ binding loops (46Akke M. Skelton N.J. Kordel J. Palmer III, A.G. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9832-9844Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 47Inman K.G. Baldisseri D.M. Miller K.E. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3439-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From these data we expected that the Ca2+-free EF-hand loops would appear disordered in the crystal structure of S100A3. Surprisingly, both Ca2+-free EF-hand loops of S100A3 are well ordered in the crystal structure as shown by the low temperature factors, which not exceed the average temperature factor of the entire protein. These data indicate that the empty EF-hands are locked in a stable conformation. Ca2+ binding to S100A3 requires that this presumably stable conformation of the Ca2+-free EF-hand has to be broken, a step that would be associated with high expenses of energy. We assume that such energy costs result in the observed low Ca2+affinity of S100A3. To examine the properties of a potentially Ca2+-loaded S100A3, different homology models were built using the structures of Ca2+-loaded S100A6, S100B, S100A7, S100A8, S100A11, and S100A12 as templates (7Sastry M.

In all modeled structures of S100A3 Tyr54 located on helix HIII was colliding with other residues in its proximity, making the movement of helix HIII less favorable. A multiple sequence alignment revealed that the corresponding position of Tyr54 in other S100 proteins is occupied by less bulky, hydrophobic residues, such as leucine, isoleucine, or valine (Fig. 3). Thus the conformation needed for high affinity Ca2+-binding of S100A3 might be hampered by Tyr54. The N-terminal pseudo-EF-hand (HI-L1-HII) of S100B and S100A6 exhibit only small conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding (19Smith S.P. Shaw G.S.

The crystal structure of S100A3 revealed a tightly bound water molecule in the Ca2+-free N-terminal EF-hand. The water molecule (water 1P. R. E. Mittl, G. Fritz, M. Vasak, M. G. Gru¨tter, and C. W. Heizmann, submitted for publication. ) is located exactly at the position of the latter bound Ca2+ ion and can form various hydrogen bonds to the protein, which resemble the coordination of the Ca2+ ion. The only difference between the hydrogen bond network of the water molecule Ca2+-free S100A3 and the coordination of Ca2+ in Ca2+-loaded S100 proteins is that the side chain of Glu33 does not provide a direct hydrogen bond although the corresponding Glu31 in S100B is involved in direct coordination of the Ca2+ (Fig.6). However, an additional water molecule (water19) is bridging the glutamate side chain oxygens with the central water molecule (Fig. 6). The temperature factor of the central water molecule in the Ca2+ site is as low as those of the protein backbone, emphasizing the remarkable rigid arrangement of this water in the EF-hand loop. Thus, especially the central water molecule stabilizes the Ca2+-free N-terminal EF-hand in a Ca2+-loaded like conformation. This is most likely the reason for the absence of a large conformational change in the N-terminal S100-specific EF-hand upon Ca2+ binding. We believe the stable conformation of this water molecule should be a general feature of all S100 proteins. Because the Ca2+concentration during intracellular signaling does not exceed 1 μm, it is obvious that S100A3 that displays millimolar affinities for Ca2+ cannot mediate the Ca2+signal. However S100A3 binds Zn2+ with unique high affinity (30Fo¨hr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Scha¨fer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears more reasonable that Zn2+instead of Ca2+ regulates its biological activity. Previous studies suggested a Kd = 1.5 μm for Zn2+ binding to S100A3 as determined by fluorescence titrations (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reduced glutathione, which is present between 3 and 10 mm in the cytoplasm binds Zn2+ with high affinity adjusting the free Zn2+ concentration to 5–10 nm (34Perrin D.D. Watt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) versus a total concentration of 4–10 μm Zn2+ in the cell (50Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether S100A3 is able to bind Zn2+ under physiological conditions. Several S100 proteins bind Zn2+ with affinities in the micromolar range, i.e. they will not be able to bind the free Zn2+ in the cytoplasm. We performed dialysis experiments of metal-free S100A3 with a buffer containing 1–4 mm glutathione and 10 μm Zn2+ at pH 7.4. Under these conditions the free Zn2+ concentration is 5–10 nm. After dialysis S100A3 contained 2.4–3.0 Zn2+ ions per homodimer. From these data aKd of 4 ± 1 nm is calculated. These studies show that the affinity of S100A3 for Zn2+ is ∼300-fold higher than the value determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. As a control the same experiments were performed using human S100B and S100A6. However, no Zn2+ binding was observed to these two S100 proteins. Thus it is likely that S100A3 is Zn2+-loaded in the cell, whereas S100A6 and S100B are not able to bind Zn2+ in the cytoplasm. Because the changes in free intracellular Zn2+ concentration depend on the redox state and cell cycle phase it is proposed that Zn2+might regulate the activity of S100A3. Although several S100 proteins bind Zn2+, only the structure of Ca2+/Zn2+-loaded S100A7 is available so far (51Brodersen D.E. Nyborg J. Kjeldgaard M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The overall fold of Ca2+-loaded S100A7 changes only a little upon binding of the additional Zn2+. Two Zn2+ ions are bound at the interface of the homodimer and are coordinated by two His residues provided by one subunit and a third His and an Asp by the other subunit. The sequence homologies of S100A7 with other S100 proteins suggest that Zn2+ could bind to homologous sites in S100A9 and S100A12 but not in S100A3 or other S100 proteins. Spectroscopic investigations have shown that there are two Zn2+ ions bound per S100A3 subunit (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One Zn2+ is coordinated by four sulfur ligands provided by cysteines, whereas the second Zn2+ is bound by three sulfur and one nitrogen ligand provided by cysteines and presumably one histidine. A clustering of Cys residues is observed in the C terminus of a S100A3 subunit, where five of ten Cys residues are located (Cys81, Cys83, Cys86, Cys93, Cys99) as well as the only His87 (Fig. 1). Examination of the structure of metal-free S100A3 revealed one preformed metal binding site built by Cys83, Cys86, and His87 (Fig.7). Only minor adjustments of the side chains were necessary without any change of the Cα positions in this region to build a single Zn2+ binding site in a S100A3 subunit. The third thiol sulfur that completes the tetrahedral coordination of the Zn2+ might be provided by Cys93 or Cys99 requiring a conformational change of the C terminus. The alternative recruitment of Cys81 as the fourth ligand would induce an unfolding of the C-terminal part of helix HIV. Interestingly, the thiols of Cys83 and Cys86 are buried in the metal-free structure of S100A3 and are contributing to the hydrophobic dimer interface. Recruitment of Cys93 to complete the tetrahedral coordination induces further changes in the C terminus. Although the suggested model of Zn2+ binding to Cys83, Cys86, and His87 involves only minor movements of the residue side chains, it affects the hydrophobic interface between the subunits. The flipping of the His87 side chain displaces the side chain of the single Trp45 to a solvent-exposed conformation (Fig. 7). This predicted movement is in full agreement with the change in Trp fluorescence observed upon Zn2+ binding (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and disrupts the hydrophobic interaction between Trp45 and Val9′ Furthermore, the movement of the Cys83 side chain weakens its hydrophobic interaction with Phe72′ and Val13′ of the other subunit. Single mutation of the corresponding Phe72 in S100A4 abolished the dimerization (52Tarabykina S. Scott D.J. Herzyk P. Hill T.J. Tame J.R. Kriajevska M. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Maitland N.J. Lukanidin E.M. Bronstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24212-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Further perturbation of the hydrophobic interface is induced by the recruitment of Cys93 for Zn2+ coordination. Positioning of Cys93 requires a substantial change in the conformation of the C terminus. Such a rearrangement displaces Tyr89 and Phe90 and thereby abolishes the hydrophobic interaction with Tyr27′ and Phe72′. To test whether there is a Zn2+-dependent conformational change of S100A3 as predicted by the model of the Zn2+-loaded protein, CD spectra of S100A3 in the metal-free and metal-bound state were recorded. The CD spectrum of metal-free S100A3 is very similar to those of metal-free S100B or S100A6, as expected from the known structures. Upon addition of Zn2+ there was a significant change in the CD spectrum of S100A3 consistent with a reduction in α-helical content (Fig. 8). Addition of Zn2+-chelating agents like EDTA or Chelex restored the spectroscopic properties of the metal-free protein, revealing that the observed conformational change is fully reversible as required for a signaling protein. Analysis of the native apparent molecular mass by size exclusion chromatography of the Zn2+-loaded S100A3 revealed small changes in the retention time consistent with a change in Stokes radius. Around physiological ionic strength (170 mm) the metal-free and Zn2+-loaded S100A3 (4 Zn2+ per homodimer) eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 25,000 and 22,000 Da, respectively. The lower apparent molecular mass of Zn2+-loaded S100A3 might be due to the involvement of the C terminus in Zn2+coordination. In metal-free S100A3, eight C-terminal residues (Pro94–Gln101) presumably display conformational diversity, caused by three proline residues Pro94, Pro97, and Pro98. This unordered tail increases the hydrodynamic radius of the metal-free S100A3. The recruitment of Cys99 for the coordination of Zn2+ will decrease the mobility of the loop resulting in an apparent smaller hydrodynamic radius. When the ionic strength was decreased to 70 mm a partial dissociation of the Zn2+-loaded S100A3 into subunits (approximately 30%) was observed. Lowering the ionic strength, i.e. decreasing the dielectric constant of the environment, weakened the residual hydrophobic interactions leading to a partial dissociation of the S100A3 dimer. These data show that Zn2+ binding perturbs the mainly hydrophobic dimerization site in S100A3 as predicted by the model. This was further supported by gel filtration experiments of S100A3 in the Cd2+-loaded state. Cd2+ is a probe for Zn2+ binding sites and binds to S100A3 with high affinity (31Fritz G. Heizmann C.W. Kroneck P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the case of Cd2+-loaded S100A3 an increased dissociation of the dimer was observed (40–45%), although the ionic strength was raised to 550 mm. This behavior is explained by the 0.2-Å longer Cd2+–S bond compared with the 2.3-Å Zn2+–S bond, inducing a larger distortion of the structure and dissociation of the homodimer. We present here the first high resolution crystal structure of a Ca2+-binding S100 protein with the EF-hands in the Ca2+-free conformation. Analysis of the hydrogen-bonding pattern reveals that two tightly bound water molecules in the N-terminal EF-hand stabilize a conformation that resembles the Ca2+-loaded N-terminal EF-hand of S100B. The C-terminal EF-hand has a distorted stretched conformation that most likely abolishes Ca2+ binding. Furthermore we show that S100A3 is able to bind Zn2+ under physiological conditions, demonstrating that the protein might be a Zn2+ rather than a Ca2+ signaling protein."

Mechanisms for ensuring specificity include protein modules for binding specific substrates, regulation via interactions with specific ligands, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and sequence and structural determinants of the active site (1Taylor S.S.

This enzyme, which is the product of the UL97 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),1 can phosphorylate nucleoside analogues such as the antiviral drugs acyclovir and ganciclovir (4Littler E. Stuart A.D. Chee M.S. Nature. 1992; 358: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 5Sullivan V. Talarico C.L. Stanat S.C. Davis M. Coen D.M. Biron K.K.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UL97 is also unusual in terms of its primary sequence. It is a member of the HvUL protein kinase family, which, although sharing many motifs typical of protein kinases, is relatively divergent (7McGeoch D.J. Coulter L.J. Moss H.W.M. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. 1. Academic Press, London1995: 391-393Google Scholar, 8de Wind N. Domen J. Berns A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5200-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Smith R.F. Smith T.F. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 450-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this family, UL97 diverges even further, so that it was not immediately assumed to be a protein kinase (10Chee M.S. Lawrence G.L. Barrell B.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that UL97 can autophosphorylate on serines and threonines (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation activity has uncommon features including a rather high optimal pH (9.5), high optimal NaCl (1.5 m), and a preference for Mn2+(11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, its exogenous protein substrates and, accordingly, its specificity for such substrates have remained unknown. UL97 is also interesting for its role in viral infection and as an antiviral drug target. Although not absolutely essential, UL97 is critical for HCMV replication in cell culture (12Prichard M.N. Gao N. Jairath S. Mulamba G. Krosky P. Coen D.M. Parker B.O. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that UL97 plays roles in viral DNA synthesis, virus assembly, and egress of assembled nucleocapsids from the nucleus (13Biron K.K. Harvey R.J. Chamberlain S.C. Good S.S. Smith A.A.

Recently, a new antiviral drug, maribavir, has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of HCMV replication in cell culture (13Biron K.K. Harvey R.J. Chamberlain S.C. Good S.S. Smith A.A. Davis M.G. Talarico C.L. Ferris R. Dornsife R.E. Stanat S.C. Drach J.C. Townsend L.B. Koszalka G.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 45 (in press)Google Scholar) and in human subjects. 3K. K. Biron, personal communication. Maribavir is a specific inhibitor of UL97 protein kinase activity (this report),3 and indeed its anti-HCMV activity is due to its effects on UL972,3. Thus, UL97 is a target for both established and promising new antiviral compounds. To investigate the specificity of UL97 for exogenous protein and peptide substrates, we first identified an exogenous protein substrate for this enzyme, calf thymus histone H2B, and then mapped the sites of phosphorylation to specific serine residues. Peptides containing these sites were synthesized and, using a new, chimeric electrophoresis technique, were assayed as substrates for UL97. One of these peptides was phosphorylated extensively by both UL97 and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) but with utilization of different serines and with susceptibility to different inhibitors. Remarkably, the extent of phosphorylation of peptides depended critically on the residue lying 5 positions downstream of the serine. Our results identify protein and peptide substrates of UL97 that could abet assays for novel inhibitors and reveal new information regarding its unusual substrate specificity, both of which could aid in the discovery of new anti-HCMV drugs. Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells (Sf9), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were maintained in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin B. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing wild type or mutant K355Q glutathione S-transferase (GST)-UL97 (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were propagated and maintained using standard methods (16Crossen R. Gruenwald S. Baculovirus Expression Vector System Manual. 5th Ed. Pharmingen, San Diego1998Google Scholar). Maribavir (5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-β-l-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole, also known as 1263W94) was synthesized and kindly provided by GlaxoSmithKline. Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All column materials were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. For initial studies, baculovirus-expressed GST-UL97 and GST-UL97K355Q were purified as detailed previously (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, to eliminate a contaminating protein kinase activity that was active on certain substrates, the previous protocol was modified as follows. The protein that eluted from a glutathione-Sepharose column was bound to a Q-Sepharose column, previously equilibrated with elution buffer (EB; 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) with 50 mm NaCl (EB-50). The Q-Sepharose was washed with 30 column volumes of EB-50 and 30 column volumes of EB-150 (EB with 150 mm NaCl), and protein was eluted with EB-500. This material was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (equilibrated with EB-1000), and the column was washed with 30 column volumes of EB-500 and 10 volumes of EB-300 with 0.1% Triton X-100. GST-UL97 was eluted with EB-0 with 0.1% Triton X-100, concentrated with a Centricon-30 concentrator, and dialyzed for 2 h against EB-50. The resulting protein was apparently homogeneous based on SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis performed by Angelo Dickerson at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the protein was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. For phosphorylation of calf thymus histone H2B by UL97, assays were performed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm ATP), with 5 μCi/sample [γ-32P] ATP at >5000 Ci/mmol (ICN), unless otherwise specified, and various concentrations (determined by amino acid analysis) of calf thymus histone H2B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; “electrophoretically homogeneous”) and selected amounts of GST-UL97, as specified. Synthetic peptides (200 μm) were phosphorylated under the same conditions except that either 300 ng of GST-UL97 or PKA were used, MgCl2 concentration was 20 mm, dithiothreitol concentration was 5 mm, and there was no NaCl. These buffer conditions were found to be optimal for GST-UL97 phosphorylation of peptides. 4M. C. Baek, P. M. Krosky, Z. W. He, and D. M. Coen, data not shown. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, unless otherwise specified, and terminated by the addition of 6× SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 3 min. Radiolabeled histones and protein kinases were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. PAGE of peptides is described below. The resulting gels were dried, the bands were visualized by autoradiography and excised, and the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Histone H2B (50 μg) was phosphorylated, as described above, and separated from GST-UL97 by SDS-PAGE. The portion of the gel containing H2B was prepared for phosphoamino acid analysis as previously described (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); spotted onto a cellulose thin layer plate with a mixture of unlabeled phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine; and subjected to electrophoresis (1200 V for 30 min) at pH 3.0 (acetic acid/pyridine/water, 75:5:920) in one dimension. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone, and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylated 32P-H2B (1 mg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and after the gel was dried, it was detected by autoradiography. The band containing phosphorylated H2B was excised and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. To reduce the concentrations of SDS and other contaminants that can inhibit trypsin, the slices were subjected to two cycles of dehydration, rehydration, and removal of liquid (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Following a third dehydration, the slices were suspended in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 50 μg TPCK-treated trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The phosphorylated protein was digested overnight at 37 °C. More TPCK- treated trypsin (25 μg) was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 6 h. Then excess ammonium bicarbonate was removed by evaporation under vacuum. The peptides were extracted into 400 μl of acetonitrile/formic acid (1:1) by intermittently vortexing for 20 min. This step was repeated three times to maximize extraction. The extracted peptides were pooled and dried. 32P-Labeled H2B tryptic peptides were loaded onto a 40% (w/v) alkaline acrylamide gel and electrophoresed overnight at 5 mA as described previously (18Dadd C.A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar, 19Mizzen C.A. Dou Y. Liu Y. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. J. Biol.

Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The resulting gel was dried, radioactivity was detected by autoradiography, radioactive bands were excised, and peptides were extracted into 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 4 °C for 3 h with vigorous shaking. The eluant was removed and reserved. The gel slices were further extracted overnight at 4 °C with fresh 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The two eluants were combined and dried by evaporation. Extracted peptides were dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the solutions were adjusted to pH <2 with 10% trifluoroacetic acid. RP-HPLC was performed on a C18 column (Vydac218TP52) by James Lee at the Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 70% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions were collected every 30 s, and radioactivity was monitored by Cerenkov counting. The radioactive HPLC fractions were analyzed by peptide sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) by James Lee at the Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. For sequencing, phosphopeptides were coupled to Immobilon-AA (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to sequencing. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems 477A system at the Molecular Biology Core Facility (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) using standard techniques except that 90% (v/v) methanol containing 15 ml of 85% (w/v) phosphoric acid/100 ml was employed for residue extraction because this gave better recovery of phosphorylated derivatives. An in-line split diverted a portion of each sequencing cycle to a fraction collector to determine 32P content by liquid scintillation counting while the remaining portion was employed for residue identification by RP-HPLC. Peptides were synthesized by Dr. Charles Dahl of the Biopolymer Facility (Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School). Each peptide was verified by laser desorption mass spectrometry for mass composition, and the concentration of each solution was quantified by amino acid analysis. In this chimeric gel system, the stacking gel is the standard 5% stacking gel for Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.47-18.53Google Scholar), whereas the resolving gel and running buffer have the same composition used for alkaline PAGE (18Dadd C.A.

When appropriate, the radioactive peptides were excised, extracted, and analyzed by mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing, as described above. HCMV UL97 is an unusual protein kinase that autophosphorylates on serine and threonine (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To find exogenous substrates of UL97 and study its substrate specificity, we tested a number of common substrates of protein kinases. Of these, histones H1, H2B, and H3 and histone mixtures were most robustly phosphorylated by purified GST-UL97. To investigate the specificity of this phosphorylation further, we initially tested the phosphorylation of calf thymus histone H2B in low salt (<5 mm NaCl). Under these conditions (Fig.1A, lane 1), H2B was efficiently radiolabeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-UL97 (which also became radiolabeled due to autophosphorylation; the more faintly labeled species between GST-UL97 and H2B co-migrates with histone H1 and is probably a contaminant of the commercial H2B preparation). Much less phosphorylation of either H2B or GST-UL97 was observed in the presence of maribavir (lane 2), a selective inhibitor of UL97 kinase activity3 (see below). Similarly, much less radiolabeling was observed with a mutant form of GST-UL97 (K355Q) that contains glutamine instead of lysine at residue 355 (lane 3). Lys-355 corresponds to the invariant lysine in subdomain II of protein kinases that is crucial for enzyme activity (22Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar), and this substitution eliminates autophosphorylation (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1A, lane 3). These results indicated that most of the phosphorylation of H2B in Fig. 1A was due to GST-UL97 and not a contaminant in the enzyme preparation. However, neither maribavir, the K355Q mutation, nor both (lane 4) completely eliminated radiolabeling of H2B. This residual phosphorylation was also observed when H2B was incubated in kinase buffer in the absence of GST-UL97 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the commercial preparation of histone H2B used in these experiments contains small amounts of a contaminating kinase activity. When the NaCl concentration was increased to 300 mm, the residual radiolabeling in the absence of GST-UL97 was eliminated (Fig. 1B, lane 3, and Fig. 1C, lane 2), and phosphorylation by GST-UL97 was eliminated by the K355Q substitution and by maribavir (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). Under these conditions, H2B phosphorylation by GST-UL97 remained strong (Fig. 1C, lane 1), being reduced only about 20% (Fig.1D). Higher concentrations of NaCl, up to 1 m, reduced but did not eliminate H2B phosphorylation by GST-UL97 (Fig.1D) and stimulated autophosphorylation (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).4Subsequent experiments with H2B were performed at 300 mmNaCl. To determine the stoichiometry of H2B phosphorylation, a time course study was performed (Fig. 2). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the incorporation of phosphate reached a maximum of nearly 2 mol of phosphate/mol of H2B. The addition of more ATP or more enzyme after the reaction had reached this value did not increase the incorporation of phosphate,4 indicating that the phosphorylation of H2B by UL97 was complete. UL97 is known to autophosphorylate on serines and threonines (11He Z., He, Y.-S. Kim Y. Chu L. Ohmstede C. Biron K.K. Coen D.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the amino acid(s) of H2B phosphorylated by GST-UL97, 32P-labeled H2B was hydrolyzed, and the resulting amino acid mixture was separated by thin layer electrophoresis. Essentially all the radioactive amino acids co-migrated with phosphoserine (Fig.3A). To identify the specific H2B residues phosphorylated,32P-labeled H2B that had been phosphorylated by GST-UL97 was digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were resolved through a 40% alkaline polyacrylamide gel to separate phosphorylated species from corresponding nonphosphorylated peptides (20West M.H.P., Wu, R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3B, there were five major species (TP1–TP5) that contained >95% of the radioactivity. Each of these five species was excised, eluted, and purified by RP-HPLC. Single peaks of radioactivity were detected for TP1–TP4, whereas three peaks of radioactivity were found for TP5 (TP5-A, TP5-B, and TP5-C). Each radioactive HPLC fraction was sequenced by Edman degradation, and a portion of the eluant from each cycle was collected and monitored for radioactivity, to identify which residue was phosphorylated (Fig.4). Sequence data consistent with a single phosphorylated species were obtained for all fractions except TP2, which yielded data consistent with a major species and minor species, both of which contained a serine residue at position 6. To determine which of these two species was phosphorylated or whether both were, the TP2 fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The spectrum contained a species with a mass corresponding to a monophosphorylated form of the major species predicted from the H2B sequence (accession number 70719), but not the minor species, and one corresponding to a nonphosphorylated form of the minor species but not the major species (Table I). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of each of the other HPLC fractions contained one species with a mass corresponding to a monophosphorylated form of the sequenced peptide (Table I).Table ISummary of HPLC from each peptide band and mass spectrometric analysis of radioactive HPLC fractionsBandHPLC fractionRadioactivity1-aCerenkov counting from the each radioactive HPLC fraction.Mass1-bMasses for peaks determined by (MALDI-TOF).Predicted peptide from H2B sequence1-cThe tryptic fragments of H2B derived from peptide masses using program MS-Digest (ProteinProspector Version 3.2.1) available on the World Wide Web at http://prospector.ucsf.edu.mincpmTP13712,0001345.734KESYSVYVYK43+ phosphateTP2234,00070373IAGEASR7911731PEPAKSAPAPK11 + phosphateTP33812,5001217.935ESYSVYVYK43 + phosphateTP41514,000744.787STITSR92 + phosphateTP5-A136,000908.5109HAVSEGTK116 + phosphateTP5-B115,500650.76SAPAPK11 + phosphateTP5-C94,000666.2121YTSSK125 + phosphate1-a Cerenkov counting from the each radioactive HPLC fraction.1-b Masses for peaks determined by (MALDI-TOF).1-c The tryptic fragments of H2B derived from peptide masses using program MS-Digest (ProteinProspector Version 3.2.1) available on the World Wide Web at http://prospector.ucsf.edu. Open table in a new tab Taken together, these results identify five different serine residues as sites of phosphate incorporation: Ser-6 (TP2 and TP5-B, the latter being the complete digestion product), Ser-38 (TP1 and TP3, the latter being the complete digestion product), Ser-87 (TP4), Ser-112 (TP5-A), and Ser-124 (TP5-C). These results are consistent with the results of phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3A) that showed only phosphoserine. The five sites were utilized to differing extents. Ser-38 (42% of the radioactivity), Ser-87 (24%), and Ser-6 (16%) were the three most utilized by UL97, whereas Ser-112 and Ser-124 contained only 10 and 7% of the radioactivity, respectively (Table I). The relatively weak phosphorylation at certain sites accounts for the discrepancy between the 2 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of H2B and the five phosphorylation sites detected. Interestingly, the Ser-38, Ser-87, and Ser-6 sites contain diverse residues at all positions around the phosphorylated serine except at the position 5 residues downstream (P+5), where all three peptides contain a basic residue (Lys or Arg). Peptides corresponding to portions of H2B containing each of the five phosphorylated serines (SP-6, SP-38, SP-87, SP-112, and SP-124) were synthesized and tested as substrates for UL97. The standard protocol to monitor peptide phosphorylation involves a filter-binding assay (23Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, such an assay was problematic, because autophosphorylation of UL97 obscured the signal due to peptide phosphorylation.4 To overcome this problem, a new “chimeric” gel electrophoresis technique was developed, in which an SDS-containing “stacking” gel from standard Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE was combined with a detergent-free resolving gel from an alkaline acrylamide gel (18Dadd C.A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 266-273PubMed Google Scholar, 20West M.H.P., Wu, R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-138Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Using this system to separate enzyme from peptide, we found that a synthetic peptide containing Ser-38 (SP38) was readily phosphorylated by GST-UL97 (Fig.5). SP-87, containing Ser-87, was also phosphorylated, but not as extensively. Faint phosphorylation of peptide SP-6 could also be discerned and, on longer exposure, weak phosphorylation of the other two peptides. This correlates well with the data on phosphorylation of full-length H2B, where Ser-38 and Ser-87 were the most highly phosphorylated sites, followed by SP6. Phosphorylation of H2B by PKA has been extensively studied (24Glass D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9728-9738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Glass D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1196-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hashimoto E. Takeda M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6287-6293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates both Ser-32 and Ser-36 of H2B (26Hashimoto E. Takeda M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6287-6293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter of which is contained in peptide SP38. To compare the specificities of PKA and UL97, the phosphorylation of SP-38 (RKESYSVYVYKV) by GST-UL97 and PKA was studied (Fig. 6A). Phosphorylation of SP-38 by UL97, but not PKA, was sensitive to maribavir, whereas phosphorylation by PKA, but not UL97, was sensitive to PKI, a specific pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKA (27Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Kemp B.E. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12166-12171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Glass D.B. Cheng H.-C. Mende-Muller L. Reed J. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8802-8810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of SP-38 by UL97 was sensitive to the K355Q substitution. When the phosphorylated peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF, only monophosphorylated forms were observed.4 Sequence analysis revealed that PKA phosphorylated the peptide specifically on Ser-36 and UL97 phosphorylated the peptide specifically on Ser-38, as predicted (Fig. 6B). Thus, presented with the same peptide, UL97 and PKA each have strong specificity for a particular serine as well as distinct inhibitor specificities. As noted above, the three sites in H2B and the two H2B-derived peptides most extensively phosphorylated by UL97 contain a Lys or Arg in the P+5 position. Interestingly, the site on UL97 that is most extensively autophosphorylated by UL97 5M. C. Baek, P. M. Krosky, and D. M. Coen, manuscript in preparation.also contains a basic residue at P+5 (Fig. 5B). The results raised the possibility that the rather distal P+5 position might be important for phosphorylation by UL97. To test this hypothesis, synthetic peptides derived from the two most extensively phosphorylated sites in H2B and the most extensively autophosphorylated site in UL97,5 but containing an Ala in place of Arg or Lys at the P+5 position, were synthesized. Phosphorylation of these mutant peptides was essentially eliminated, compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 7). Thus, phosphorylation of three different peptides by UL97 critically depends on the identity of the residue at the P+5 position. The work described here documents the phosphorylation by purified HCMV UL97 of an exogenous substrate, histone H2B, and of H2B-derived peptides on specific Ser residues. To show conclusively that phosphorylation was performed by UL97 rather than by a contaminant in the enzyme or H2B preparation, we not only purified the enzyme extensively but also used both a catalytically inactive, mutant form of UL97 (K355Q) and a specific UL97 inhibitor, maribavir. HCMV UL97 is a member of the HvUL protein kinase family (7McGeoch D.J. Coulter L.J. Moss H.W.M. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book. 1. Academic Press, London1995: 391-393Google Scholar, 10Chee M.S. Lawrence G.L. Barrell B.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been reported that certain members of this family are capable of phosphorylating various exogenous substrates in vitro, including certain preparations of histones (8de Wind N. Domen J. Berns A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5200-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ng T.I. Grose C. Virology. 1992; 191: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Daikoku T. Shibata S. Goshima F.

Hay J. Ruyechan W. Grose C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8854-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in these reports, the enzymes were not purified extensively and/or it was not shown that an inactivating point mutation or a specific inhibitor eliminated phosphorylation of the exogenous substrates. Indeed, in two cases (32Chen M.-R. Chang S.-J. Huang H. Chen J.-Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Kenyon T.K. Lynch J. Hay J. Ruyechan W. Grose C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8854-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), mutant forms akin to UL97 K355Q retained substantial kinase activity, suggesting that the enzyme preparations were contaminated with other kinases. Regardless, to our knowledge, the work presented here is the first to demonstrate phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate by UL97, an especially divergent member of this already divergent family of protein kinases, and the first to describe sites of phosphorylation by any member of this family. Aside from H2B, UL97 can phosphorylate histones H3 and H1 in vitro.4 It is not inconceivable that histones could be physiologically relevant substrates of UL97. UL97 is localized to the nucleus in HCMV-infected cells (34Michel D. Pavic I. Zimmermann A. Haupt E. Wunderlich K. Heuschmid M. Mertens T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6340-6346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35van Zeijl M. Fairhurst J. Baum E.Z. Sun L. Jones T.R. Virology. 1997; 231: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HCMV infection is known to affect host gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 36Mocarski E.S. Courcelle C.T. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology, 2. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2629-2673Google Scholar), and other herpesviruses are known to affect chromatin condensation (reviewed in Ref. 37Roizman B. Furlong D. Fraenkel-Contrat H. Wagner R.R. Comprehensive Virology. Plenum, New York1974: 229-403Google Scholar), both processes that can be regulated by histone phosphorylation (38Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar). These possibilities can be tested with the aid of maribavir and UL97 deletion mutants (12Prichard M.N. Gao N. Jairath S. Mulamba G. Krosky P. Coen D.M. Parker B.O. Pari G.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A goal of this study was to find clues to the specificity of phosphorylation by UL97, both to understand the mechanism of specificity and to help predict intracellular substrates of this enzyme. Sites of phosphorylation of HvUL protein kinases have not previously been identified. We anticipated that peptide and protein substrates of UL97 might have unusual characteristics based on its ability to phosphorylate nucleoside analogues, its sequence divergence from protein kinases, and its high pH and NaCl optima. That the specificity of UL97 differs from that of a prototypic protein kinase, PKA, is clearly illustrated by the phosphorylation of different Ser residues when both kinases are presented with the same peptide (SP-38). The phosphorylation of the Ser corresponding to Ser-36 by PKA is consistent with the established consensus substrate for PKA, (R/K)XXS (39Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 40Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E.

Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More generally, for diverse protein kinases, specific residues from P-3 through P+3 are most important for substrate specificity, with the P−3 (e.g. PKA) and P+1 positions usually being the most crucial; it is highly unusual for the P+5 position to be important (42Songyang Z., Lu, K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. Demaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Our results reveal, however, that the sites that are most extensively phosphorylated by UL97 contain an Arg or Lys at the P+5 position. Indeed, substitution of a P+5 Arg or Lys with Ala essentially eliminates phosphorylation of synthetic peptides. Thus, this rather distal residue is very important for UL97. In contrast, there were no obvious similarities in other positions of extensively phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 5B). The unusual importance of the P+5 position is consistent with the lack of conservation of UL97 with other protein kinases in subdomains typically involved in substrate recognition. In particular, UL97 lacks acidic residues in subdomains V and VI that are thought to stabilize binding of basic P−3 residues, and it does not have a readily recognizable subdomain VIII, which ordinarily makes up much of the P+1 binding site of other kinases (10Chee M.S. Lawrence G.L. Barrell B.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1151-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,22Hanks S.K. Hunter T.

At present, little is known about residues in any protein kinase that interact with the P+5 position. Further studies of the substrate specificity of UL97 should advance our understanding of this unusual kinase-substrate interaction. Our results may aid the discovery of new antiviral drugs that target UL97. The identification of exogenous substrates for UL97 permits development of assays for new inhibitors of UL97. It is especially advantageous to have identified a peptide substrate of UL97, since this can facilitate the development of high throughput assays. Moreover, peptide substrates can be the starting points for the design of peptidomimetic inhibitors of protein kinases. Such substrates can be abetted by combinatorial approaches to optimize affinity and conversion of serines to nonphosphorylatable moieties (43Nishikawa K. Sawasdikosol S. Fruman D.A. Lai J.

This report focuses on the mechanism of their inhibition by halides. Tyrosinases are monooxygenating enzymes catalyzing theortho-hydroxylation of monophenols and the subsequent oxidation of the diphenolic products to the corresponding quinones. The reactions take place under concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The formed quinones are reactive precursors in the synthesis of melanin pigments. In fruits, vegetables, and mushrooms, Ty1 is a key enzyme in the browning that occurs upon bruising or long-term storage. In mammals, Ty is responsible for skin pigmentation. Defects in the enzyme may lead to some forms of oculocutaneous albinism or vitiligo (1Oetting W.S. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme has been linked to Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases (2Tief K. Schmidt A. Beermann F. Brain Res. Mol.

The current knowledge of Ty at the biological, mechanistic, and structural levels has recently been reviewed (7Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 8Sánchez-Ferrer A. Rodrı́guez-López J.N. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Garcı́a-Cánovas F. Biochim. Biophys.

Ty harbors a dinuclear so-called type-3 copper center, the occurrence of which has also been established in hemocyanins, which act as oxygen carriers in arthropods and mollusks, and the catechol oxidases, which oxidize o-diphenols to the corresponding quinones. The two closely spaced copper ions in the type-3 active site are coordinated each by 3 histidine residues through the Nε nitrogen atoms (9Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). Although the known type-3 centers are found to be similar both in structure and in their ability to bind molecular oxygen, they perform different functions. These differences are believed to result from variations in the substrate binding pocket or the accessibility of substrates to the active site, although the exact reasons remain to be defined (7Decker H. Tuczek F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 392-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The reduced species (Tyred; [Cu(I) (CuI)], binds oxygen to render (b) the oxygenated form (Tyoxy; [Cu(II)-O22−-Cu(II)]. In Tyoxy, molecular oxygen is bound as peroxide in a μ-η2:η2 side-on bridging mode, which destabilizes the O-O bond and activates it for reaction with mono- or diphenols (9Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar). The Tyoxy species shows a strong LMCT (ligand to metal chargetransfer transition) at ∼345 nm (ε ≈ 18.5 mm−1cm−1) and is EPR silent. The latter property also holds for (c) the resting form of the enzyme, i.e. the oxidized derivative (Tymet; [Cu(II)-Cu(II)] where antiferromagnetic coupling between the unpaired spins of the Cu2+ ions occurs through spin super-exchange mediated by a Cu2 bridging ligand (11Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Solomon E.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because of the diamagnetic nature of both Tyoxy and Tymet in the ground state, magnetic resonance studies on Ty and its inhibitor bound species until now mainly dealt with (d) the EPR active half-reduced species (Tyhalf-met; [Cu(I) Cu(II)]), which can be prepared by partial reduction of Tymet (12Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Lerch K. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Albeit a nonphysiological derivative, EPR studies on Tyhalf-met have yielded a considerable amount of information on the structure of the active site and its ligand-bound derivatives (12Wilcox D.E. Porras A.G. Hwang Y.T. Lerch K. Winkler M.E. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 4015Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 13van Gastel M. Bubacco L. Groenen E.J. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The various species discussed above, with the exception of Tyhalf-met, fit into a reaction cycle that is represented by SchemeFS1. Recently, we have shown that the oxidized enzyme, Tymet, is amenable to paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,15Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Cat. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the Cu(II)-Cu(II) ground state is a diamagneticS = 0 singlet, the paramagnetic S = 1 triplet state appears to be populated at room temperature, providing sufficient paramagnetism for the signals originating from nuclei of the coordinated His residues and from exogenous ligands to shift outside the diamagnetic envelope, thereby providing a detailed fingerprint of the active site. Especially in the presence of chloride, 1H NMR resonances appear remarkably sharp for a Cu(II) system, by virtue of which it was possible to show that Ty contains a classical type-3 copper site as found in hemocyanins and catechol oxidases (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The1H paramagnetic NMR spectrum furthermore drastically changes when competitive inhibitors that mimic the transition state are bound to the active site (15Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Cat. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Ty by halides has already been reported a long time ago (16Martı́nez J.H. Solano F. Garcia-Borrón J.C. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 729-738PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martı́nez J.H. Solano F. Peñafiel R. Galindo J.D. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Comp. Biochem.

Acta. 1984; 788: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but, despite the universal presence of chloride in biological systems ([Cl−] 5–200 mm), it has never been addressed in kinetic and/or structural detail. The current knowledge concerning Ty halide inhibition is mainly limited to the observations that the inhibition is strongly pH-dependent and that the order of inhibition strength of F−, Cl−, Br−, and I− appears to be dependent on the source of the enzyme studied (16Martı́nez J.H. Solano F. Garcia-Borrón J.C. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 729-738PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martı́nez J.H. Solano F. Peñafiel R. Galindo J.D. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Comp. Biochem.

Acta. 1984; 788: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The latter differences have been explained mainly in terms of the accessibility of the halide ion to the Ty active site (17Martı́nez J.H. Solano F. Peñafiel R. Galindo J.D. Iborra J.L. Lozano J.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1986; 83: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EPR studies on halide-bound half-met hemocyanin derivatives have been reported (11Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Solomon E.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Himmelwright R.S. Eickman N.C. Solomon E.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), showing that halides interact directly with copper in the type-3 hemocyanin active site. Here we report on a detailed study of the inhibition of the 31-kDa Ty from Streptomyces antibioticus by halide ions, using paramagnetic 1H NMR as a complementary technique to the more conventional kinetic and optical spectroscopic methods. The pH dependence of halide inhibition in the conversion of l-DOPA and of halide binding to Tymet were studied, providing insight into the halide inhibition at a structural and at a mechanistic level and resulting in the proposal of a halide binding mode. Our results address for the first time the Ty halide inhibition by considering the interaction of halide with the physiologically relevant Ty species that participate in the enzymatic reaction pathway. The results show that the halide inhibition derives from the interaction of halide with the Cu2 center of both the oxidized and the reduced Ty species, where the halide binding affinity is found to be dependent on the nature of the halide ion as well as on the Ty oxidation state. Furthermore, we show that halides can be used as probes in paramagnetic 1H NMR investigations of the coordination mode of exogenously added ligands such as substrate and transition-state analogues as well as aromatic carboxylic acid inhibitors. The relevance of the findings toward understanding the reaction of diphenolic substrates with Tymet is discussed, forming the basis of a proposed structural scheme of Ty inhibition and of the reaction of Tymet with diphenolic substrates. The enzyme was obtained from the growth medium of liquid cultures of S. antibioticusharboring the pIJ703 Ty expression plasmid (15Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Cat. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein was purified according to published procedures (15Bubacco L. Vijgenboom E. Gobin C. Tepper A.W.J.W. Salgado J. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Cat. B. 2000; 8: 27-35Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and exceeded 95% in all preparations. Protein concentrations in pure samples were routinely determined optically using a value of 82 mm−1cm−1 for the extinction coefficient at 280 nm (20Jackman M.P. Hajnal A. Lerch K. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity assays usingl-DOPA as a substrate were performed at 21 °C by optically following the formation of the DOPAchrome reaction product at 475 nm according to the method described previously (21Lerch K. Ettlinger L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 31: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Over the time course of the experiment, linear product formation was observed in all cases. Inhibition constants were obtained by measuring values ofVmax/Km, corresponding to the slopes of the Michaelis-Menten plots, in the presence of at least 5 different concentrations of halide inhibitor, [I], and by using five different substrate concentrations at each [I]. The plots ofVmax/Kmversus[I] appeared linear within the error of the experiment (estimated at ±10%) in all cases, allowing for an estimation of Kiapp from the slope and the intercept. The halide concentrations in the assay mixture were chosen both well below and above the value of the apparent inhibition constant for the halide under consideration. For the pH dependence of halide inhibition, a 75 mm phosphate, 25 mm borate instead of a 100 mm Pi buffer was used to ensure efficient buffering at all pH values used. The enzyme was stored in the form of a 5 mm Pi stock solution at pH 7.2 to prevent protein degradation during storage prior to the experiments. Enzyme was added to the assay medium directly from this stock. The reported pH values were measured on the final mixed solutions. All steps were performed in a cold chamber (4 °C) using air-saturated buffers obtained by vigorous shaking under air for at least 1 h. The pH of the buffers used was 6.80 (measured at 21 °C) throughout the procedure. A mixture containing Tyoxy and Tyred was prepared by the incubation of a 5 mmPi solution containing the protein (∼5 μm) with 0.5 mm hydroxylamine resulting in complete reduction of Tymet to Tyred. The binding of oxygen from the air-saturated reaction buffer (∼ 0.27 mmO2) to Tyred results in the formation of a mixture of ∼95% Tyoxy and ∼5% Tyred(Kd = 17 μm). 2A. W. J. W. Tepper, L. Bubacco, and G. W. Canters, unpublished data. The reaction mixture was applied immediately to a small column containing ∼0.5 ml of CM-Sepharose column material, which had previously been equilibrated with 5 mm Pi buffer. To remove excess hydroxylamine, the column was washed extensively with the equilibration buffer after which the protein was eluted with 100 mm Pi buffer in a volume varying between 2 and 5 ml. Because the Tyoxy protein is unstable,2the protein solution was made immediately prior to the experiments. A solution of ∼95% Tyoxy and ∼5% Tyred (1 ml in a sealed cuvette; typically 3 μm total concentration) in 100 mm air-saturated Pi buffer at pH 6.80 and 4 °C was allowed to equilibrate to 21 °C after which halide was added in 5–20 μl volume steps from concentrated stock solutions of 2.00 m F−, 5.00 mCl−, 1.00 m Br−, or 100 mm I− made up in the assay buffer. Absorption changes were measured at 345 nm. NMR Tymet samples (∼0.6 mm in 100 mm NaPi at pH 6.80) were prepared as described previously (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Exogenous ligands were added to the samples from concentrated stock solutions prepared by using the same buffer as for the measurement. The pH of the NMR samples was varied by adding small aliquots of either dilute NaOH or 100 mm H3PO4 under continuous mixing and monitoring of the pH. 1H spectra were recorded at 600 MHz using a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer with the super-WEFT pulse sequence (22Inubushi T. Becker E.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 128-133Google Scholar). Depending on the required signal-to-noise ratio, 4,000–128,000 FIDs were recorded and Fourier-transformed using a 60 Hz exponential window function (LB); the base line was corrected using software provided by Bruker. One-dimensional NOEs on TymetF were measured as described previously (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,23Calzolai L. Gorst C.M. Bren K.L. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. LaMar G.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9341-9350Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To characterize the effect of halides on the enzymatic activity, we performed steady-state kinetic measurements using diphenolic l-DOPA as the substrate at pH 6.80 and room temperature. In all cases, product formation linear in time was observed, and the dependence of the reaction rate versus[l-DOPA] obeyed Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. For all halides studied, the plots ofKm/Vmax values obtained from the slope of the Michaelis-Menten plots versus[X−] showed the linear dependence (see Supplemental Material), indicating that the binding of a single halide ion is responsible for the inhibition (24Boyer P.D. The Enzymes: Kinetics and Mechanism 2. 3rd Ed. Academic Press, New York1970: 18-25Google Scholar). The fluoride and chloride inhibitions appeared competitive, whereas iodide and bromide inhibit through an apparent noncompetitive mechanism (supporting information). The order of strength of inhibition is I− > F− ≫ Cl− > Br− with apparent inhibition constants of 3.8 mm, 11 mm, 0.16 m, and 0.23 m, respectively. We studied the pH dependence of fluoride inhibition. The fluoride inhibition appeared very sensitive to the pH, as depicted in Fig.1; in the plot of p KI,F−appversus pH, an approximately linear dependence is observed. A linear least-squares fit to the data yields the relationship p KI,F−app = 8.9 − 1.06 × pH. These data can be explained by adopting Scheme 2,Ty⇋KaH+Ty*⇋Ki,F−F−TyFSCHEME 2 where Ty* denotes the acidic form of the enzyme, which is capable of binding fluoride. Assuming that TymetF is catalytically inactive, the equation relating the pH to the observed inhibition constant becomesKi,F−app=Ki,F−Ka[H+]+1(Eq. 1) In the region where [H+] ≪Ka, Equation 1 may be simplified to becomepKi,F−app=−log(KaKi,F−)−pH=(pKi,F−+pKa)−pH(Eq. 2) and p KI,F−appbecomes directly proportional to the pH. The data in Fig. 1 exhibit no curvature down to pH 5.5, indicating, according to Equation 1, that the pKa value is <5.5. Measurements at the lower pH values were prohibited because of complications arising from the less efficient chemical disproportionation of the enzymatic product DOPAquinone into l-DOPA and DOPAchrome (25Cánovas F.G. Garcı́a-Carmona F. Sánchez J.V. Pastor J.L. Teruel J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8738-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the latter being the measured substance, as well as the intrinsic instability of the enzyme at pH values lower than ∼5. We chose not to measure above pH 8.5 because of the very high fluoride concentrations (hence ionic strengths) required to accurately measure p KI,F−app values. The chloride inhibition constant was determined at both pH 6.80 and 5.40 (see Fig. 1), showing that a similar pH dependence occurs for the inhibition by chloride ion. For a comparison with 1H NMR data (see below), we also determined the apparent inhibition constant for fluoride at 4 °C and pH 6.80, which amounts to 3.4 mm(p KI,F−app = 2.5). Fig.2 shows the 600 MHz 1H NMR spectra of native S. antibioticus Tymet(panel A) and Tymet in the presence of 0.2m fluoride (panel B; TymetF), 0.5m chloride (panel C; TymetCl), and 0.5 m bromide (panel D; TymetBr) between 55 and 10 ppm. All investigated species displayed well resolved paramagnetically shifted NMR signals. No paramagnetically shifted signals could be detected in the up-field or in the >55 ppm down-field region in all cases. We did not attempt to detect paramagnetically affected signals under the diamagnetic envelope. The addition of iodide to a final concentration of 0.2 m to a sample of Tymet did not lead to changes in the 1H NMR spectrum apart from a significant loss of signal intensity, possibly indicating that iodide ion reduces the copper ions under the conditions of the experiment or that it destabilizes the Tymetprotein. The observed changes upon the addition of halide cannot be assigned to the increase in ionic strength, as the addition of 0.25m Na2SO4 to a sample of native Tymet in 100 mm Pi at pH 6.8 did not affect the paramagnetic part of the spectrum. The spectra of native Tymet and TymetCl have been discussed previously (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The spectra of the three halide-bound derivatives each displayed several well resolved paramagnetically shifted signals. The shift pattern is rather similar for the chloride- and bromide-bound species, whereas the signal distribution of the TymetF species appears to be quite different. Yet, in each halide-bound derivative, six sharp signals together with several broader, partially overlapping signals can be distinguished. For TymetCl, the hyperfine shifted resonances could be assigned (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) based on H2O/D2O exchange experiments, intra-residue NOE patterns, and T1 relaxation data. The total signal intensity in the 10–50 ppm range appeared compatible with what can be expected for the combined signals of six histidines (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The sharp solvent-exchangeable signals, marked withasterisks in Fig. 2, were assigned to the histidine Nδ protons, whereas the broader signals could be assigned to the His-Cε and His-Cδ protons of the coordinating histidines. The latter are closer to the copper and therefore experience stronger paramagnetic relaxation and hence more broadening compared with the Nδ protons. Furthermore, the observed NOE patterns allowed us to couple each of the six sharp Nδ proton signals with a broader Cε signal, thereby identifying each histidine residue in the six-coordinate ligand sphere of the Cu2 site. Because the observed signal shift pattern is quite different for the TymetCl than for the TymetF species, we repeated the assignment procedure for TymetF. Fig. 2B shows the spectrum recorded in D2O. It can be observed that five of the six sharp signals are readily solvent-exchangeable similar to what is observed for the chloride-bound species (14Bubacco L. Salgado J. Tepper A.W. Vijgenboom E. Canters G.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The detection of NOE couplings between the paramagnetically shifted 1H signals in TymetF is complicated due to both the relatively fast TymetFT1 proton relaxation2 and the presence of considerable signal overlap, for example for the signal at 31 ppm that is composed of both a sharp and a broad signal. Yet, we were able to establish four NOE connectivities as indicated in Fig.2. The expected NOE couplings from the sharp signals at 31.0 and 14.8 ppm to broader signals remain undetectable thus far. Further assignments must await the outcome of additional experimentation. The NMR spectra of samples of ∼0.5 mm Tymet containing 0.2 m fluoride or 0.5 m chloride are clearly pH-dependent, as shown in Fig. 3 for fluoride ion. The observed effects are fully reversible. For both of the halide-bound species similar titration behavior is observed. The spectra of Tymet recorded in the presence of fluoride or chloride at pH 9.6 superimpose well on the spectrum of native Tymet at pH 6.8 (Fig. 2A), showing that the protein reverts to native Tymet when the pH is increased. No signal broadening effects or shifts are observed over the whole titration range for all observable signals for both species, showing that the halide exchange process is slow on the NMR time scale in both cases. As a consequence, the signals of native Tymet and TymetF or TymetCl can be followed independently. The midpoint of the titration occurs at a pH of ∼8.2 for TymetF ([F−] = 0.2 m) and at pH ∼7.8 For TymetCl ([Cl−] = 0.5m). We did not quantify signal intensities because partial protein degradation at the extremes of the pH values used prevented accurate comparison between individual spectra. A quantitative analysis of the pH dependence of fluoride binding is presented below. A pH titration of native Tymet toward the lower pH values was unsuccessful because of irreversible protein degradation leading to a rapid loss of signal intensity. The observed pH dependence of fluoride binding and inhibition prompted us to investigate fluoride binding at fixed pH. More specifically, we performed a titration of native Tymet with fluoride at two pH values (pH 7.06, [F−] 0–38 mm, and pH 8.03, [F−] 0–375 mm). These pH values were chosen in the region of maximal stability of the protein to prevent protein degradation during the experiment. The observed titration behavior is the reverse of that observed in the pH titration described above (Fig.3), in agreement with a two-state model where both species are in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. There is no indication of the occurrence of intermediates during the titration, in agreement with the binding of a single fluoride ion. The relative amounts of native Tymet and TymetF were determined by measuring peak heights. For native Tymet, this was carried out on the isolated signals at 47.2 and 22.0 ppm where there is no overlap with signals originating from the fluoride-bound species. The relative amount of TymetF was determined by measuring the intensity of the sharp Nδ proton signals 28.8, 33.3, 35.9, and 41.4 ppm. The intensity of the signals were normalized and then fitted to the general equation for two-state binding under the conditions that the ligand is in large excess over the enzyme, Iobs,AImax,A=1−[F−]Kdapp+[F−](Eq. 3) Iobs,FImax,F=[F−]Kdapp+[F−](Eq. 4) where Iobs,F and Iobs,A represent the observed signal intensities of TymetF and native Tymet, respectively. Kdapp represents the apparent value for the dissociation constant of the fluoride-bound complex, Imax, A, the signal intensity of the native species at zero [F−] and Imax, Fthe TymetF signal intensity at [F−] ≫ Kdapp. For each of the two titration experiments, Kdapp was set as a shared parameter between the Iobs,F and Iobs,Aversus [F−] data sets, resulting in a single value for Kdapp, Imax, A, and Imax, Fat each pH. At both pH values, good fits were obtained as depicted in Fig. 4, left panel (pH 7.06) and right panel (pH 8.03). The values obtained for Kdapp amounted to 5.8 and 51 mm at pH 7.06 and 8.03 with corresponding p Kdapp values of 2.24 and 1.29, respectively. The difference in the p Kdapp values is 0.94, comparing well with the difference in the pH values of the experiments (0.97). This shows that the fluoride dissociation constant, like the fluoride inhibition constant (Fig. 1), is inversely proportional to the proton concentration in the pH range of 7 to 8, and it explains why the halide is displaced from TymetX at fixed [X−] upon increasing the pH (see Fig. 3). To obtain a better insight into the mode of halide and inhibitor binding in the oxidized [Cu(II)-Cu(II)] species, we recorded 1H NMR spectra of ∼0.5 mm native Tymet and TymetCl ([Cl−] = 0.5 m) in the presence of the bidentate inhibitor Kojic acid or the monodentate ligand p-nitrophenol. The resulting spectra are represented in Fig.5. It appears that the spectra of Tymet + Kojic acid recorded in the absence and presence of chloride are nearly identical (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that Kojic acid displaces chloride from the active site. The small differences between the spectra can be explained by assuming that there is still a small fraction of TymetCl present in solution (compare Fig. 2C with Fig. 5D). Analogous behavior is observed with the bidentate carboxylic acid inhibitor p-toluic acid (not shown). The situat"

However, GPCRs linked to the inhibition of Rho and downstream cytoskeletal reorganization have not been identified. We now report that somatostatin (SST), acting at the GPCR subtype SSTR1, inhibits Rho activity, attenuates the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, and inhibits cell migration. Five distinct SSTR subtypes that are activated by SST have been identified, and these receptors generally have potent inhibitory effects on diverse cell functions such as hormone secretion, neurotransmitter release, smooth muscle contractility, and cell proliferation (14Csaba Z. Dournaud P. Neuropeptides. 2001; 35: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 15Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Effector pathways regulated by SSTRs, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase and Ca2+ channel activity and stimulation of K+channel and phosphatase activity, are mediated by pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanisms, most likely involving GTPases of the Gαi family (15Patel Y.C.

Symp. 1995; 190 (discussion 101–10): 89-101PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for studying SST effects on Rho and the cytoskeleton was based on our previous studies with the Na+-H+exchanger NHE1. NHE1 acts downstream of Rho to play a critical role in regulating cytoskeletal organization (18Vexler Z. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22281-22284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). NHE1 is phosphorylated directly by the Rho-associated kinase ROCK (19Tominaga T. Narumiya S. Barber D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and activation of NHE1 by GPCRs, such as those for lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin, and by integrin receptors is mediated by Rho and ROCK (19Tominaga T. Narumiya S. Barber D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Tominaga T. Barber D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2287-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, through its direct association with the ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) family of actin-binding proteins, NHE1 acts as a plasma membrane anchor for actin filaments to control the assembly of cortical stress fibers and focal adhesions (21Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In contrast to lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin, which stimulate Rho and NHE1, SST, acting at the SSTR1 (but not SSTR2) subtype, inhibits NHE1 activity (16Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that inhibition of NHE1 by SSTR1 might be associated with an inhibition of Rho. Consistent with this rationale, the findings from this study indicate that SSTR1 (but not SSTR2) stably expressed in fibroblasts inhibits Rho activation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell migration by thrombin. We previously reported that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which express endogenous SSTR1, but not SSTR2, SST attenuates stress fiber assembly by serum (22Curtis S.B. Hewitt J. Yakubovitz S. Anzarut A. Hsiang Y.N. Buchan A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1815-H1822PubMed Google Scholar), and we have now determined that this attenuation is associated with a decrease in activated, GTP-bound Rho. Moreover, in contrast to most effects of SSTRs that are abolished by PTX, SSTR1 inhibition of NHE1 (16Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, as we now report, Rho activity is PTX-insensitive. CCL39 hamster lung fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human SSTR1 and SSTR2 were stably expressed in CCL39 cells using the inducible mammalian expression vector pCMV (16Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with pRSV-neo using calcium phosphate precipitation, and G418-resistant clones were selected and examined for their ability to bind [125I-Tyr11]SST-14 and to mediate SST inhibition of cAMP accumulation, as previously described (16Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine sensitivity to PTX, cells were pretreated with the toxin (List Biologicals) at 100 ng/ml for 18 h. Primary HUVECs (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.1% human endothelial growth factor, 0.1% gentamycin/amphotericin B, and 0.4% bovine brain extract (Clonetics). The abundance of activated, GTP-bound Rho was determined by a modification of previously described methods (7Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 9Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using affinity adsorption with a GST fusion protein of the Rho-binding domain of the Rho-associated kinase ROCK (amino acids 934–1015 of p160ROCK, kindly provided by S. Narumiya). The BL21 bacterial strain was transformed with this construct, and expression of the fusion protein was induced by 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed in buffer containing 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100. Bacterial lysates were sonicated with four 15-s pulses and then cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min, after which the fusion protein was recovered by addition of glutathione beads to the supernatant. Fibroblast cells and HUVECs (plated at a density of 1 × 106 in 100-mm plates) were maintained in medium containing 5% FBS for 24 h, washed, and then maintained for an additional 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were treated with 30 nm thrombin (Enzyme Research Labs) in the absence or presence of 100 nm SST (Bachem) for the indicated times. The effect of c-Src activity was determined in cells pretreated for 10 min with the c-Src inhibitor PP2 (25 μg/ml 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; Sigma). To determine the response to integrin activation, quiescent cells were trypsinized, diluted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing trypsin inhibitor (50 μg/ml; Sigma), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of FBS. Cells were then plated in the absence or presence of SST for 60 min in 100-mm plates coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml; Sigma) or fibronectin (20 μg/ml; Sigma). After washing three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mmorthovanadate, cells from each 100-mm plate were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmorthovanadate). The lysates from three plates were pooled, aspirated three times through a 26-gauge needle, and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. A 40-μl aliquot of the supernatant was collected for determination of total cellular Rho. The remaining supernatant was added to 75 μg of GST fusion protein-coated beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (Tris with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. GTP-bound Rho and total cellular Rho were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:250. Densitometry analysis was performed with NIH Image, and the amount of GTP-bound Rho is expressed as a percentage of total cellular Rho. The abundance of activated, GTP-bound Rac was determined by a modification of previously described methods (23Bernard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar) using affinity adsorption with a GST fusion protein of the GTPase-binding domain of PAK1 (cytoskeleton). CCL39-R1 cells (plated at a density of 1 × 106 in 100-mm plates) were maintained in medium containing 5% FBS for 24 h, washed, and then maintained for an additional 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were treated with SST (100 nm) or platelet-derived growth factor-BB (25 ng/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for the indicated times. After washing three times with PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate, cells from each 100-mm plate were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm orthovanadate). The lysates from two plates were pooled, aspirated three times through a 26-gauge needle, and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C. A 40-μl aliquot of the supernatant was collected for determination of total cellular Rac. The remaining supernatant was added to 50 μg of GST fusion protein-coated beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (Tris with 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. GTP-bound Rac and total cellular Rac were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to Rac (Transduction Laboratories) and quantified as described for determining the percentage of GTP-bound Rho. Cells grown on 22-mm glass coverslips were maintained for 24 h in 0.5% FBS and then treated with 30 nm thrombin in the absence or presence of 100 nm SST for 20 min. They were washed briefly with phosphate buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After thorough washing with PBS to remove excess fixative, the cells were permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100; immersed in 5% normal calf serum; and incubated with primary antibodies, including those against paxillin (1:200 for 1 h at 23 °C; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), RhoA (1:250 for 48 h at 4 °C; Transduction Laboratories), and LIMK (1:200 for 18 h at 4 °C; Transduction Laboratories). The bound antibodies were detected using the relevant fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (either goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Labs, Inc.) and screened using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (magnification ×1000). Representative images were collected using a Spot2 camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) and imported into Adobe Photoshop. The subcellular localization of Rho and LIMK was determined by immunostaining and immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, cells plated on 100-mm plates were maintained for 24 h in 0.5% FBS and then treated with thrombin (30 nm) in the absence or presence of SST (100 nm) for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS; collected by scraping in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 135 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, and 3 mm EDTA (pH 7.5); and lysed by sonication. Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation and separated into S100 and P100 fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Rho (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and LIMK. Migration of CCL39-R1 and CCL39-R2 cells was assessed using Transwell membranes (8-μm pore size and 6.5-mm diameter) in 24-well plates (Corning Costar Corp.). The cells were detached from the culture plates, and 200 μl of cell suspension at a density of 1 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the top chamber. Thrombin (30 nm final concentration) was added to the top chamber in the absence or presence of 100 nm SST, and migration of cells through the Transwell membrane was compared with untreated cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h, with agonists reapplied at 4 h. After 8 h, 2% paraformaldehyde was added to the top and bottom wells, and cells were fixed overnight. After washing with PBS, the cells in the upper well were removed by aspiration, and the nuclei of cells that had migrated through to the bottom surface of the filter were stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min at room temperature. To count migrated cells, the filter was cut out of the holder and placed bottom side up on a glass slide. Five fields at magnification ×40 were captured using a Spot2 camera, and the number of cells was counted using NIH Image. The results are expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical significance was assessed by Student's unpaired t test, withp < 0.05 considered significant. After removal of the Transwell, the individual wells were checked to determine whether cells had migrated through the filter, detached, and subsequently attached to the base of the 24-well plate. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP was determined in cell preparations similar to those described for detecting Rho-GTP. Following fibronectin plating or addition of secretagogues to adherent cells, cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate, lysed with a 500 μm concentration of a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF), and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-p190RhoGAP antibody (3 μg; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 60 min, followed by protein G-Sepharose for 60 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed three times, separated by 5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with antibody 4G10 (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) to determine tyrosine phosphorylation and reprobed with anti-p190RhoGAP antibody (1:500) to determine total p190RhoGAP in the immune complex. Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src was determined by immunoblotting total cell lysates with antibodies to tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and total c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Our initial studies investigated whether SST regulates stress fiber assembly in CCL39 fibroblasts stably expressing human SSTR1 or SSTR2. Receptor expression was determined by membrane binding to [125I-Tyr11]SST-14, and receptor function was confirmed by the ability of both receptor subtypes to mediate a PTX-sensitive inhibition of cAMP accumulation by SST (Fig. 1 A). Treating quiescent CCL39 cells with thrombin (30 nm) for 20 min resulted in the assembly of long parallel arrays of actin stress fibers that extended throughout the cell (Fig. 1 B), although the morphology of the cells was not markedly altered. In the presence of SST (100 nm), thrombin-induced stress fiber formation was unchanged in wild-type CCL39 cells and in CCL39 cells expressing SSTR2 (CCL39-R2), but was strikingly inhibited in CCL39 cells expressing SSTR1 (CCL39-R1) (Fig. 1 B). Actin stress fibers were absent in the cell body, and their abundance and size were markedly decreased in the cortex. To determine whether SSTR1 attenuation of stress fiber assembly is associated with an inhibition of Rho activity, we measured the abundance of GTP-bound Rho complexed to a GST fusion protein of the Rho-binding domain of its effector, ROCK. Thrombin (30 nm) increased the abundance of Rho-GTP, with maximal stimulation occurring at 10–20 min. Activation decreased between 30 and 60 min, but remained higher than in control cells (data not shown). In the presence of SST (100 nm), maximal Rho activation by thrombin at 20 min was inhibited by 75% in CCL39-R1 cells, but was unchanged in wild-type CCL39 cells and CCL39-R2 cells (Fig.2 A). In the absence of thrombin, SST had no effect on the abundance of Rho-GTP in all three cell types (data not shown), indicating that SSTR1 inhibits stimulated (but not basal) Rho activity. Although most effector actions of SST are abolished by PTX, SST inhibition of NHE1 is PTX-insensitive (16Hou C. Gilbert R.L. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Barber D.L. McGuire M.E. Ganz M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21038-21042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the inhibition of Rho activity and stress fiber assembly by SST was not blocked by preincubation with PTX (Fig. 2 B), although the inhibition of cAMP accumulation was completely reversed (Fig. 1 A). In PTX-treated cells, however, basal and thrombin-stimulated Rho-GTP levels were consistently less than in untreated cells, suggesting that PTX attenuates or blunts the activation of Rho. To confirm that SSTR1 inhibition of Rho activity is not an artifact of receptor overexpression, we examined this response in HUVECs, which express endogenous SSTR1, but not SSTR2. In HUVECs, the activation of Rho by thrombin (30 nm) for 20 min was inhibited by 80% in the presence of SST (Fig. 2 C). Because activation of Rho is associated with its translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, we determined whether changes in Rho translocation are associated with the SSTR1-mediated decrease in Rho-GTP. Immunoblotting for Rho indicated that thrombin increased the abundance of Rho in the P100 fraction by 2-fold in CCL39-R1 cells compared with quiescent (control) cells (Fig.3 A). In the presence of SST, this increase was inhibited by 92%. The serine/threonine kinase LIMK is activated downstream of Rho and ROCK, and this activation promotes the translocation of LIMK from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Consistent with this redistribution by activated Rho, we found that thrombin and SST regulated the abundance of membrane-associated LIMK. Compared with quiescent CCL39-R1 cells, thrombin induced a 1.5-fold increase in the abundance of LIMK in the P100 fraction (Fig.3 B). In the presence of SST, the abundance of LIMK in the P100 fraction was 60% less than that of quiescent cells and 90% less that that in the presence of the thrombin. Because SST did not reduce the level of Rho-GTP below that observed in quiescent cells, additional Rho-independent signaling mechanisms likely contribute to SST inhibition of membrane-associated LIMK in control cells. The caveat of using subcellular fractionation to determine protein localization is that the P100 fraction does not reveal which membranes are involved. We therefore used immunostaining to determine whether changes in the abundance of Rho and LIMK in the P100 fraction reflected changes in their localization at the plasma membrane. In thrombin-treated CCL39 and CCL39-R1 cells, the distribution of Rho immunoreactivity shifted from a predominant intracellular localization seen in quiescent cells to more marked staining at the cell membrane (Fig. 3 C). Pretreatment with SST blocked this redistribution of Rho immunoreactivity in CCL39-R1 cells, but not in wild-type CCL39 cells, indicating that SSTR1 inhibition of Rho-GTP is also associated with an inhibition of its translocation to the plasma membrane. The distribution of LIMK immunoreactivity in quiescent CCL39-R1 cells revealed a perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig.3 D). In the presence of thrombin, there was no detectable perinuclear immunoreactivity, but instead diffuse cytoplasmic staining and punctate accumulations in plasma membrane protrusions. These findings suggest that LIMK immunoreactivity in the P100 fraction of immunoblots from quiescent cells primarily reflects association with intracellular membranes, but that in thrombin-treated cells, it reflects, in part, association with the plasma membrane. In the presence of SST, LIMK staining was predominantly perinuclear, with no detectable immunoreactivity at the plasma membrane. In addition to its central role in mediating GPCR regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization, Rho is also activated by integrin receptors, and it regulates integrin-induced assembly of focal adhesions. CCL39 cells express α5β1integrins, which can be activated by plating the cells on fibronectin to promote the assembly of actin stress fibers and paxillin-rich focal adhesions (20Tominaga T. Barber D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2287-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether SSTR1 also inhibits activation of Rho by integrins, we determined the effects of SST in CCL39-R1 and CCL39-R2 cells plated on fibronectin. Compared with control cells plated on poly-l-lysine, plating on fibronectin for 60 min induced an increase in Rho activity in both cell types. Although preincubating cells with SST for 5 min prior to plating had no effect on cell attachment (data not shown), it inhibited Rho activation by fibronectin in CCL39-R1 cells, but not in CCL39-R2 cells (Fig.4 A). Moreover, SST treatment had a dramatic effect on the assembly of focal adhesions and stress fibers by fibronectin in CCL39-R1 cells. In the absence of SST, immunostaining showed that the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin was localized in densely packed bundles within peripheral focal adhesions, and phalloidin staining revealed densely packed actin filaments predominantly at the cortex (Fig. 4 B). With SST treatment, however, paxillin immunostaining revealed smaller, punctate focal complexes, indicating impaired assembly of focal adhesions (Fig.4 B). Additionally, in the presence of SST, fibronectin-induced stress fiber formation was dramatically inhibited in both the cell body and cortex (Fig. 4 B). Hence, SSTR1 inhibits the activation of Rho and cytoskeletal reorganization in response to both GPCR- and integrin-mediated signals. In addition to the stimulation of Rho and accumulation of stress fibers, activation of thrombin receptors is known to stimulate the migration of fibroblasts. To investigate the possibility that SST treatment inhibits thrombin-stimulated cell migration, a single-cell suspension of CCL39 and CCL39-R1 cells was added to the upper well of a Transwell chamber. Addition of thrombin (30 nm) to the upper well resulted in a significant increase in the number of both cell types migrating through the pores of the Transwell membranes (Fig.5). Although the migration of control cells was less in CCL39 cells compared with CCL39-R1 cells, the percent increase with thrombin in both cell types was similar (50% increase in CCL39 cells and 46% increase in CCL39-R1 cells). Co-treating the cells with SST (100 nm) and thrombin had no effect on the movement of wild-type CCL39 cells through to the lower surface of the membrane, but it abolished thrombin-stimulated migration of CCL39-R1 cells (p < 0.05; n = 4) (Fig.5). Because GPCRs coupled to the inhibition of Rho have not previously been identified, the signaling mechanism mediating this action remains undetermined. In fibroblasts, Rho activity is down-regulated by increased Rac activity, and a reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activity is a major determinant of cellular morphology and motility (25Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). We found, however, that in CCL39-R1 cells, the abundance of Rac-GTP was not regulated by SST, although it was markedly incr"

Three of the four rRNAs (25, 18, and 5.8 S) are transcribed as a single pre-rRNA by RNA polymerase I. The 35 S pre-rRNA, detected as the largest pre-rRNA, is cleaved at two internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1sequences and two external transcribed spacer (ETS) sequences (Fig.1). During pre-rRNA processing, ribosomal proteins that are transported into the nucleolus assemble onto pre-rRNAs to yield preribosomal particles. Thus, the processes of rRNA processing and ribosomal subunit assembly are closely linked to each other. It has been reported (3Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 4Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) that as many as 100 proteins are implicated in the necessary steps of these processes, but the regulatory mechanism and clear function of each factor remain to be elucidated. In yeast cells, ribosome synthesis is strictly regulated mainly at the level of transcription according to the changes in environmental conditions such as carbon source upshift (5Kief D.R.

RRS1 was originally isolated as the wild type allele complementing the rrs1–1 mutation in which the transcription of ribosomal protein genes was derepressed when the secretory pathway was blocked (14Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rrs1p is an essential nuclear protein of 203 amino acids with an important function in the maturation of 25 S rRNA and the 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly. However, it is unknown how Rrs1p functions in ribosome biogenesis. To learn the function of Rrs1p, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening by usingRRS1 as bait. In the screening, we had previously isolatedEBP2 encoding the yeast homolog of human EBNA1-binding protein 2 and demonstrated that Ebp2p had an essential role in ribosome biogenesis (15Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we isolate YKR081c/RPF2 in two-hybrid screening by using RRS1 as bait. Independently, it has very recently been demonstrated (16Fatica A. Cronshaw A.D. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that Rpf2p is involved in a discrete precursor to the 60 S ribosomal subunit, which is copurified with Ssf1p. Both Ssf1 and Rpf2p are members of the Imp4 superfamily that possess the ς70-like motif, a eukaryotic RNA binding domain with prokaryotic origins (17Wehner K.A. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Rpf2p is highly conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human. We show that Rpf2p interacts with the ribosomal protein L11 (Rpl11p) and is required for proper ribosome biogenesis in cooperation with Rrs1p. We discuss the role of Rpf2p in the regulation of ribosome synthesis through interaction with Rrs1p. The yeast strains used are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were grown in YPD-rich medium, synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose (SC) or 2% galactose (SCGal), or SC dropout medium depending on the plasmid markers (18Kaiser C.

The NruI-XhoI PCR fragment containing the RPF2 open reading frame (ORF) and the terminator (415 bp) produced with a set of primers (5′-TTTTCGCGAATGATTAGAACCGTAAAACCCAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTCGAGTACTCTGAAGATCTGTTGAAAAAG-3′) was inserted just after theGAL1 promoter of the resulting plasmid. A plasmid expressing Myc-tagged Rpf2p was constructed by the insertion of the HindIII-PstI PCR fragment containing the upstream promoter region of RPF2 (1,118 bp) and the RPF2 ORF produced with a set of primers (5′-TTTAAGCTTACCGAGGATAGGTCCATTTCG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGCAGTTTCTTCTGTCTTTTAGCAGAGGG-3′) into a single copy vector CTF, YCplac22 containing 9× Myc epitope and the TDH2terminator, kindly provided by D.

Sternglanz), a his3 strain carrying the lexA-HIS3 and lexA-lacZ constructs as reporter genes. This strain was then transformed with the pACT-basedS. cerevisiae cDNA library. After 3–7 days of incubation at 25 °C, His+ transformants were selected, and the DNA insert of pACT in the cells was characterized. The DNA fragment containing theRPF2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a set of primers (5′-TTTGGATCCGAATTAGAACCGTAAAACCCAAGAATGC-3′ and 5′-TTTCTCGAGTTATTTCTTCTGTCTTTTAGCAGAGG-3′), and the amplified DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI. The digested DNA fragment was introduced into pACTII and pBTM116 to produce the Gal4p activation domain- and lexA binding domain-Rpf2p fusion proteins, respectively. The construction of other plasmids for a two-hybrid assay was described previously (15Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A set of plasmids for the production of lexA binding domain fusion proteins and Gal4p activation domain fusion proteins were cotransformed into L40 strain cells. Leu+ Trp+ transformants were selected, and 5-fold serial dilutions of the cell cultures were stamped on SC lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SC/− Leu, Trp, His) plates containing 1 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was done as described previously (15Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K.

Secondary antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G) were diluted 1:300. After glass bead lysis of yeast cells, total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method. The oligonucleotide probes used for analyzing mature rRNAs were described previously (14Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis, each culture in SC/−Met was pulsed with [methyl-3H]methionine (10 μCi/ml) for 3 min and chased with nonradioactive methionine (500 μg/ml). Samples were taken by pouring cultures onto crushed sterile ice for preparing total RNA. 20 μg of total RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis and blotted to a Nytran membrane. The upper part of the membrane was sprayed with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to a film for 3 days. The lower part of the membrane was probed for snoRNA U3. For primer extensions, 2.5 μg of total RNA was annealed to 0.5 pmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA-3′) that hybridizes to ITS2. Extension was carried out using 100 units of ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) in 40 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.3, 75 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and dNTPs (0.25 mm each) for 1h at 42 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting analysis, polysome analysis, and the preparation of ribosome pellets from yeast lysates were performed as described previously (25Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Yoshida H. Maki Y. Wada A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mizuta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18334-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rrs1p, an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein, is required for pre-rRNA processing and the proper assembly of ribosomal subunits in S. cerevisiae (14Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that physically interact with Rrs1p, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on the yeast cDNA library usingRRS1 as bait. Among the 21 cDNA clones isolated in this screen, 3 cDNA clones had most of the YKR081c/RPF2sequence. In a yeast two-hybrid assay, the HIS3 reporter gene was activated in the presence of a set of the Gal4p activation domain-Rpf2p fusion protein and the lexA binding domain-Rrs1p fusion protein and in the presence of a replaced set (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 4). Another reporter gene, lacZ, was also activated in the same yeast transformant cells (data not shown). RPF2encodes a protein consisting of 344 amino acids with an isoelectric point of 9.75. The amino acid sequence of Rpf2p is highly conserved from yeast to human. The DNA sequences of putative homologues from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens can encode proteins with significant similarity to Rpf2p with 52, 37, 39, and 41% identities, respectively. Homologous sequences are also found in the genome sequences of plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa(data not shown). An RPF2-null allele was created by replacing one of theRPF2 ORFs of W303 with the HIS3 gene. Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA isolated from a candidate of W303rpf2Δ/+ demonstrated that the resultant diploid cells carried one intact RPF2 gene and one disrupted by the insertion of HIS3 (data not shown). Twenty tetrads from the transformant were dissected. All tetrads yielded only two viable spores, and all of them were His−, indicating thatRPF2 is essential (data not shown). To learn the subcellular localization of Rpf2p, we constructed a plasmid to express Rpf2p tagged with nine repeats of the Myc epitope at the C terminus. The single copy plasmid containing its own promoter-regulated RPF2-myc could suppress the lethality of the rpf2 null mutation, indicating that the construct is biologically functional. Western blotting with anti-Myc antibodies detected Rpf2p-Myc as a band with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa (Fig. 3 A), which is somewhat larger than the predicted molecular weight of the protein with nine repeats of the Myc tag (50 kDa). The subcellular localization of Rpf2p-Myc was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Nop1p-GFP, used as a nucleolar protein, was detected in the region adjacent to the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained region, the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3 B). Rpf2p-Myc was detected mainly in the same region as the Nop1p-GFP and also in the nucleoplasm. This suggests that Rpf2p is localized to the nucleus with enrichment in the nucleolus, similar to Rrs1p (14Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because Rrs1p showed physical interaction with both Ebp2 (15Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Rpl11p (Ref. 25Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Yoshida H. Maki Y. Wada A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mizuta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18334-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; for nomenclature, see Ref.26Mager W.H. Planta R.J. Ballesta J.-P.G. Lee J.C. Mizuta K. Suzuki K. Warner J.R. Woolford Jr., J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4872-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we checked whether Rpf2p interacts with Ebp2p and Rpl11p. Rpf2p showed two-hybrid interaction with Rpl11p but not with Ebp2p (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–7). The results were reproducible, and the assay using the lacZreporter gene showed similar results (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Rpf2p-Myc interacts with HA-Rpl11p (Fig. 2 B). We next examined whether Rpf2p associates with ribosomal particles. Cell extract containing Rpf2p-Myc was analyzed by ultracentrifugation and Western blotting. As shown in Fig.4 A, panel a, Rpf2p-Myc was detected in a ribosomal pellet fraction. To investigate how tightly Rpf2p associates with the ribosomal particle, the ribosome pellets were treated with various concentration of LiCl and subjected to a second ultracentrifugation. The pattern of Western blotting shows that the effect of LiCl on the dissociation of Rpf2p-Myc was very similar to that of ribosomal protein L3 (Rpl3p), which was used as the large subunit reporter. A part of Rpf2p remains to associate with the ribosomal particle even in the presence of 1 m LiCl (Fig. 4 A, panel b). To determine the type of ribosome with which Rpf2p associates, we performed sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by the detection of Rpf2p by Western blotting. The analysis revealed that Rpf2p-Myc was involved in fractions containing free 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 4 B). Considering that Rpf2p-Myc is localized in the nucleus, the results suggest that Rpf2p tightly associates with 60 S preribosomal subunits and/or 66 S preribosomal subunits. We demonstrated quite similar results previously with HA-Rrs1p, suggesting that Rrs1p associates fairly tightly with 66 S and/or 60 S preribosomal subunits (25Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Yoshida H. Maki Y. Wada A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mizuta K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18334-18339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As expected, the ribosomal protein Rpl3p, used as a control, was detected mainly in fractions containing 80 S monosomes and the polysomes. Because the gradient was pumped up from the bottom using a peristaltic pump and fractionated, it is probable that the fractions corresponding to 40 S subunits contain a considerable amount of 60 S subunits; both Rpf2p-Myc and L3 were also detected in 40 S fractions. Because Rpf2p was localized mainly in the nucleolus and associated with the ribosomal particle, Rpf2p was expected to have a role in ribosome biogenesis. To test this expectation, we analyzed a polysome pattern from the Rpf2p-depleted cells on sucrose density gradients. To achieve conditional expression of RPF2, we constructed a strain in which the chromosomal RPF2 gene was disrupted, and a plasmid containing the GAL1-promoter driven RPF2 gene was introduced. This strain, KM403, was shifted from galactose medium to glucose medium to deplete Rpf2p. After 8 h in YPD medium, the growth of the cells slowed gradually and was severely impeded after 16 h (Fig. 5 A). We performed sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation using the cells after 8 h in glucose. Lower amounts of both 80 S monosomes and polysomes were detected in the profile from the Rpf2p-depleted cells, even though cell lysates with equal A 260units were analyzed (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, the polysome profile showed that the depletion of Rpf2p caused an accumulation of the 40 S ribosomal subunits, and the appearance of half-mer polysomes, which contain 43 S initiation complexes, stalled at the AUG start codon (Fig. 5 B; Ref. 27Foiani M. Cigan A.M. Paddon C.J. Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3203-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Rpf2p depletion affects 60 S ribosomal subunit assembly. To investigate pre-rRNA synthesis and its processing in Rpf2p-depleted cells, we performed [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis as newly synthesized pre-rRNA was immediately methylated (28Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Chen-Schmeisser U. Garrett R.A. FEBS Lett. 1977; 74: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the 35 S pre-rRNA, the longest detectable precursor, is cleaved to the 27 and the 20 S pre-rRNAs, which are further processed to the mature 25 and 18 S rRNAs, respectively. In wild type cells, most precursor rRNAs were processed to 25 and 18 S after a 3-min chase (Fig. 6 A,lane 2). In the GAL1-RPF2 cells that were transferred into a glucose medium for 8 h, the processing rate of the 35 S pre-rRNA was slower than that of wild type cells, and a significantly smaller amount of the mature 25 S rRNA was produced. After a 3-min chase, much of the 27 S pre-rRNA remained in Rpf2p-depleted cells without further processing to 25 S rRNA (Fig. 6 A, lane 7). Furthermore, the amount of produced 25 S rRNA appeared to be less than that expected from the total amount of precursors detected at the beginning of the chase (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6–10), suggesting that the intermediates are unstable in Rpf2p-depleted cells. In contrast, 18 S rRNA appeared to be rather stable for at least 30 min, although a smaller amount of 18 S was detected in the Rpf2p-depleted cells than in wild type cells. Small nucleolar RNA U3 was used as a loading marker. We performed Northern analysis to show the steady-state levels of the mature rRNAs in wild type and Rpf2p-depleted cells after the shift to a glucose medium for various periods of time. Following transfer of the GAL1-RPF2 strain to glucose medium, the steady-state levels of both 25 and 18 S rRNAs were reduced with the time of incubation in glucose medium (Fig. 6 B). The level of the 25 S rRNA declined more rapidly than that of the 18S rRNA; after 12 h of growth in glucose medium, the amount of 25 S rRNA was reduced to 39%, and that of 18S rRNA was reduced to 64% (Fig.6 B). This is consistent with the result of the [methyl-3H] methionine pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 6 A). To determine the precise step at which pre-rRNA processing is blocked by Rpf2p depletion, we performed a primer extension analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the longest detectable pre-rRNA, 35 S pre-rRNA, is processed at A0, A1, and A2. The resulting intermediate, 27 SA2, is processed by two alternative pathways. In the major pathway, 27 SA2 is processed to 27 SBS via 27 SA3 and in the minor pathway to 27 SBL. For primer extension, we used an oligonucleotide probe that hybridizes to a region in ITS2 with which 27 SA2, 27 SA3, 27 SBS, and 27 SBL can be detected (Fig.7). When either Rpf2p or Rrs1p was depleted, the 27 SBS and 27 SBL intermediates were accumulated, whereas the level of the 27 SA2intermediate remained constant (Fig. 7). Accumulation of the 27 SA3 intermediate was not detected. The result indicates that both Rpf2p and Rrs1p are implicated in the processing from 27 SB to 25 S rRNA. In this paper we have isolated the RPF2 gene as an Rrs1p-interacting factor and showed that RPF2 is an essential gene for ribosome biogenesis. [methyl-3H]Methionine pulse-chase analysis has revealed that the depletion of Rpf2p results in retarded pre-rRNA processing and the inhibition of 25 S rRNA production. Consistent with this, the polysome profiles show that, in Rpf2p-depleted cells, 80 S monosomes and polysomes decrease significantly, 40 S subunits accumulate, and half-mer polysomes appear, suggesting a shortage of mature 60 S ribosomal subunits. Northern analysis for steady-state levels of rRNA shows that 25 S rRNA is severely reduced in Rpf2p-depleted cells. A comparison of the timing of the decrease of these two sets of mature rRNAs suggests that the decrease of 18S rRNA may be a secondary effect caused by the inhibition of 25 S rRNA production. In total, the results indicate that Rpf2p has important roles in the maturation of 25 S rRNA and the assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits. Primer extension analysis has revealed that both Rpf2p and Rrs1p are required for the processing of 27 SBS/27 SBL intermediates to the mature 25 S rRNA. In the pre-rRNA processing pathway (Fig. 1), 27 SA2 is processed via two alternative pathways. The major pathway involves cleavage at site A3, generating the 27 SA3 intermediate. This intermediate is very rapidly digested to yield 27 SBS. In the minor pathway, about 15% of the 27 SA2 molecules is processed at site B1L, generating 27 SBL. The subsequent processing pathways of both 27 SBS and 27 SBL appear to be identical. The processing at sites C1 and C2 generates 7 S pre-rRNA and the mature 25 S rRNA. Rpf2 and Rrs1p are therefore essential for ITS2 processing. Recent works (Refs. 17Wehner K.A. Baserga S.J. Mol.

Rpf2p was detected in one intermediate that was isolated by copurification with Ssf1p (17Wehner K.A. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The intermediate appears to contain 27 SB pre-rRNA, consistent with our conclusion. Pre-rRNA processing and the assembly of ribosomal subunits are tightly linked to each other because many ribosomal proteins associate with the 35 S pre-rRNA at early steps prior to its cleavage. About 100 proteintrans-acting factors have been found to be involved in both pre-rRNA processing and ribosomal subunit assembly (3Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 4Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Some proteins are considered to have enzymatic activities such as endo-RNase, exo-RNase, 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase, and rRNA pseudouridine synthase. A large class of thetrans-acting factors contains putative RNA helicases that may be required to melt structures of pre-rRNA. Some proteins might have a role in maintaining the structure of the complex containing pre-RNA(s) and many ribosomal proteins. The depletion of such a factor may cause a structural change in the complex and prevent further processing of pre-rRNA. It is highly possible that pre-rRNAs that are not processed normally are degraded rapidly. In the [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis, the depletion of Rpf2p results in a decrease of 25 S production by the slow processing of 35 S pre-rRNA and the degradation of the intermediates. This suggests that Rpf2p has a role in maintaining the normal structure of preribosomal particles. The consequences of Rpf2p depletion are quite similar to those observed in Rrs1p-depleted cells; the depletion of Rrs1p causes a slow maturation of 25 S rRNA, an abnormal polysome profile, and a less severe decline of 18 S rRNA levels compared with those of 25 S rRNA (14Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Both Rrs1p and Rpf2p are highly conserved proteins throughout evolution. It is highly possible that the regulatory system for ribosome synthesis containing Rpf2p and Rrs1p is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human. It is interesting to define their shared and distinctive functions. We have shown that Rpf2p interacts with Rpl11p and is detected in the ribosomal fraction containing free 60 S ribosomal subunits. Rpl11p is localized near the top surface of the central protuberance of the 60 S subunit (34Rotenberg M.O. Moritz M. Woolford Jr., J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Tsay Y.-F. Shankweiler G. Lake J. Woolford Jr., J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7579-7586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is suggested that Rpl11p interacts with Rps13p to form a bridge with the 40 S subunit, the 5 S rRNA binding protein Rpl5p, and the elbow of the P site-bound tRNA (36Spahn C.M.T. Beckmann R. Eswar N. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Blobel G. Frank J. Cell. 2001; 107: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the evidence showing that Rpf2p has a role in the processing of 27 S pre-rRNA to 25 S rRNA, because Rpl11p is considered to be a late-associating 60 S ribosomal protein (reviewed in Ref. 4Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that several factors are required for the correct assembly of a specific ribosomal protein into preribosomal particles. It was suggested that Rrb1p, a yeast homolog of the smallest subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), forms a direct complex with Rpl3p and assists its interaction with the rRNA precursor as a chaperone (37Schaper S. Fromont-Racine M. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Namane A. Yaniv M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and that Rrp7p is required for the correct assembly of Rps27A/Bp into pre-40 S ribosomal particles (38Baudin-Bailleu A. Tollervey D. Cullin C. Lacroute F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5023-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Eisinger D.P. Dick F.A. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5146-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sqt1p, a protein containing multiple WD repeats, is involved in the assembly of Rpl10p/Qsr1p on the 60 S ribosomal protein(39). It is possible that every ribosomal protein needs a specific chaperone for its assembly to preribosomal particles. Fig.8 presents our model for the function of Rpf2p in Rpl11p recruitment to pre-rRNA. Rpf2p has a RNA-binding domain (17Wehner K.A. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 329-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but it has not yet been determined whether Rrs1p itself has the ability to bind to RNA. It is possible that Rpf2p is required for the binding of Rrs1p to pre-rRNA. The fairly tight association of Rpf2p with the preribosomal particle suggests that this factor may have another role in addition to the recruitment of ribosomal protein onto pre-rRNA. Further studies about the protein trans-acting factors are needed to clearly understand how ribosomal subunits are assembled. We thank J. R. Warner for the anti-Rpl3p antibody, P. A.

Laser flash photolysis of a solution containing reduced cytbc1, Ru2D, and a sacrificial electron acceptor results in oxidation of cytc1 within 1 μs, followed by electron transfer from the iron-sulfur center (2Fe-2S) to cytc1 with a rate constant of 80,000 s−1. Experiments were carried out to evaluate whether the reaction was rate-limited by true electron transfer, proton gating, or conformational gating. The temperature dependence of the reaction yielded an enthalpy of activation of +17.6 kJ/mol, which is consistent with either rate-limiting conformational gating or electron transfer. The rate constant was nearly independent of pH over the range pH 7 to 9.5 where the redox potential of 2Fe-2S decreases significantly due to deprotonation of His-161. The rate constant was also not greatly affected by the Rieske iron-sulfur protein mutations Y156W, S154A, or S154A/Y156F, which decrease the redox potential of 2Fe-2S by 62, 109, and 159 mV, respectively.

In a key bifurcated reaction at the Qo site, the first electron is transferred from ubiquinol to the Rieske iron-sulfur center (2Fe-2S) and then to cyt c1 and cyt c (1Trumpower B.L. Gennis R.B. Annu.

The second electron is transferred from semiquinone in the Qo site to cyt bL and then to cytbH and ubiquinone in the Qi site. Extensive x-ray crystallographic studies of cytbc1 have revealed that the Rieske iron-sulfur protein occurs in several different conformations depending on the crystal form and the presence of Qo site inhibitors (Fig.1) (4Xia D., Yu, C.-A.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). In native I4122 bovine crystals an anomalous signal for 2Fe-2S is found close to cyt bL, but its intensity is small, suggesting that the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is conformationally mobile (4Xia D., Yu, C.-A.

Addition of the Qoinhibitors UHDBT or stigmatellin significantly increased the intensity of 2Fe-2S, indicating that the Rieske iron-sulfur protein was immobilized with 2Fe-2S near the surface of cytbL (7Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In both chicken and yeast cytbc1 crystals, grown in the presence of stigmatellin, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is in a conformation with 2Fe-2S proximal to the cyt bL heme, called theb state (5Zhang Z.

However, in native chicken or beef P6522 crystals, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is in a conformation with 2Fe-2S close to cyt c1, called the c1 state (Fig.1) (5Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M.

An intermediate conformation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein was found in P65 crystals of the bovine complex (6Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Wata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These structural studies have suggested a novel shuttle mechanism for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein during electron transfer. It has been proposed that the Rieske iron-sulfur protein changes conformation from the b state, where oxidized 2Fe-2S accepts an electron from ubiquinol in the Qo site, to the c1 state where reduced 2Fe-2S transfers an electron to cyt c1(4Xia D., Yu, C.-A.

This mobile shuttle mechanism has been supported experimentally by the finding that cross-linking the Rieske iron-sulfur domain to the cyt b subunit inhibited steady-state electron transfer (9Xiao K., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38597-38604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by studies involving mutations, which alter the conformation or flexibility of the neck domain of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (10Tian H., Yu, L.

However, the rate constant for electron transfer between 2Fe-2S and cytc1 is too fast to be measured by conventional techniques. Flash photolysis experiments in Rhodobacter sphaeroides chromatophores established that the rate constant was much larger than 5000 s−1, the rate of diffusion of photooxidized cyt c2 from the reaction center to cyt bc1 (19Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 223-227Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have recently introduced a new method to study electron transfer between 2Fe-2S and cytc1 that utilizes a ruthenium complex, Ru2D, to directly add or remove an electron from cytc1 within 1 μs (11Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The net charge of +4 on Ru2D allows it to bind with high affinity to the negatively charged domain on cyt c1. Laser flash photolysis of Ru2D generates the metal-to-ligand excited state, which rapidly reduces or oxidizes cyt c1 in the presence of appropriate sacrificial electron donors or acceptors (11Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The rate constant for electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cytc1 was found to be 80,000 s−1 inR. sphaeroides cyt bc1 and 16,000 s−1 in bovine cyt bc1 (11Tian H. White S., Yu, L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7146-7152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).In the present report, we further characterize the electron transfer reaction between 2Fe-2S and cyt c1 in R. sphaeroides cyt bc1. Experiments were carried out to evaluate whether the reaction is rate-limited by true electron transfer, proton gating, or conformational gating. The temperature dependence of the reaction is consistent with either a mechanism involving rate-limiting electron transfer according to Marcus theory or a mechanism involving rate-limiting conformational gating. The rate constant was nearly independent of pH over the range pH 7 to 9.5 where the redox potential of 2Fe-2S decreases significantly due to deprotonation of His-161. This result indicates that the reaction is not rate-limited by proton gating. The rate constant was also not greatly affected by the Rieske iron-sulfur protein mutations Y156W, S154A, or S154A/Y156F, which decrease the redox potential of 2Fe-2S by 62, 109, and 159 mV, respectively. These results indicate that the reaction is not rate-limited by electron transfer, because Marcus theory predicts that the increase in the driving force of the reaction for these mutants would increase the rate constant by up to 15-fold. It is concluded that conformational gating controls electron transfer between the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytc1.DISCUSSIONKinetic characterization of the electron transfer reactions involving cyt bc1 has proven to be a formidable task, because the rate constants are so large. The cytbc1 electron transfer reactions have been studied extensively in chromatophores from R. sphaeroidesand R. capsulatus using a light flash to initiate the electron transfer cycle (13Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15474-15483Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Daldal F. J. Biol.

Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The time resolution of this technique is limited by the diffusion of photooxidized cytc2 from the reaction center to cytbc1, which has a rate constant of about 5000 s−1 (19Meinhardt S.W. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 149: 223-227Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The rate constant for electron transfer from quinol to 2Fe-2S in the Qo site was found to be 1650 s−1 using this method, whereas electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cyt c1 was estimated to be greater than 105 s−1 (20Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Very recently, the electric field generated by the reaction center in R. sphaeroideschromatophores was found to induce electron transfer from cytbH to cyt bL with a half-time of 0.1 ms, establishing the rate constant for this important reaction (34Shinkarev V.P.

The rate constant for intracomplex electron transfer between cytc and cyt c1 was determined to be 60,000 s−1 by this method (38Tian H. Sadoski R. Zhang L., Yu, C.-A., Yu, L. Durham B. Millett F. J.

The development of a binuclear ruthenium complex to rapidly photooxidize cytc1 has allowed measurement of the rate constant for electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cyt c1 to be 80,000 s−1 in the R. sphaeroides cytbc1 complex (12Sadoski R.C. Engstrom G. Tian H. Zhang L., Yu, C.-A., Yu, L. Durham B. Millett F. Biochem. 2000; 39: 4231-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The rate constant for electron transfer from quinol to 2Fe-2S in the Qo site was found to be 1200 s−1 by this technique, in good agreement with flash photolysis studies in chromatophores (20Crofts A.R. Wang Z. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 22: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we report the effects of pH, temperature, and driving force on electron transfer between 2Fe-2S and cyt c1 using the ruthenium flash photolysis technique.Electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cyt c1 was studied in an attempt to elucidate some of the factors controlling the conformational states of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein required for efficient reduction of cyt c1. The amplitude of the fast phase of cytochrome c1 reduction is maximal in the presence of reduced QH2 to maintain 2Fe-2S and cyt c1 in the reduced state. As QH2 is oxidized by successive laser flashes, the amplitude of the fast phase decreases as 2Fe-2S and cytc1 become partially oxidized. Addition of ascorbate restored the fast phase of electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cyt c1, even when no reduced quinol was present and cyt bH was fully oxidized. Furthermore, addition of myxothiazol did not affect the rate constant of the fast phase. X-ray diffraction studies of the bovine enzyme indicate that binding myxothiazol to the Qo site decreases the fraction of Rieske iron-sulfur protein in the b state (7Kim H. Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8026-8033Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that the fast phase of electron transfer may only involve Rieske iron-sulfur protein that is initially in thec1 state or is undergoing rapid conformational changes between an ensemble of states involving the free state and thec1 state.The role of the 2Fe-2S ligand His-161 in electron transfer from quinol to 2Fe-2S has been extensively investigated (27Ugulava N.B.

The pH dependence of the redox potential of 2Fe-2S has been interpreted as shown in Scheme FS4. His-161 has a very high pK value when the iron-sulfur center is reduced and is fully protonated up to pH 9.5. However, His-161 has a pKa of 7.5 when the iron-sulfur center is oxidized (27Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 41Link T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 81-84Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The redox potential of the iron-sulfur center is +315 mV when His-161 is protonated at low pH and decreases as His-161 is deprotonated at higher pH (27Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from quinol to 2Fe-2S in the Qo site is coupled to proton transfer from quinol to unprotonated His-161, accounting for the pH dependence of the reaction (27Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Guergova-Kuras M. Duras R. Ugalava N. Hadad I. Crofts A.R.

However, much less is known about the deprotonation of the His-161 ligand after Rieske iron-sulfur protein rotates to thec1 state and reduces cytc1. If electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cytc1 is coupled to deprotonation of the 2Fe-2S His-161 ligand, then a large dependence on pH would be predicted. Using the equilibrium pH-dependent redox potential of the iron-sulfur center (27Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to calculate the driving force ΔG0, Marcus theory predicts the pH dependence as shown in the dashed line of Fig. 4. However, very little pH dependence was observed for the fast phase of electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cyt c1 (Fig. 4), indicating that the reaction is not rate-limited by deprotonation of His-161. Two possible explanations for the small pH dependence of the rate of cytc1 reduction will be considered. The first explanation is that proton release occurs after the rate-limiting electron transfer step in the mechanism of Scheme FS4 and does not affect the rate constant. In this case the driving force used in the Marcus equation should be calculated from the redox potential of the protonated form, +315 mV, which is independent of pH. With this assumption, Marcus theory is in good agreement with the experimental pH dependence of the rate constant, using an r value of 9.4 Å (Fig. 4). The second explanation is that the observed rate of reduction of cyt c1 is not limited by electron transfer at all but, rather, is limited by conformational gating (42Hoffman B.M. Ratner M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6237-6243Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 43Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This would require that dynamic fluctuations, in the conformation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein between an electron transfer-activec1 state and other inactive states, control the observed rate of reduction. It is not possible to distinguish between the two explanations suggested above on the basis of the pH dependence studies alone.SCHEME 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Temperature dependence studies are useful in determining whether electron transfer is rate-limited by conformational gating or by an actual electron transfer step (43Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the rate constant for electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cytc1 is in good agreement with the predictions of Marcus theory for electron transfer (Fig. 5). The value of the reorganization energy λ obtained from fitting Equation 2 to the data of Fig. 5 is 0.75 eV, which is in the range expected for electron transfer between an iron-sulfur protein and a cytochrome (31Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7655) Google Scholar, 32Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L.

The fitted value of r, 11.1 Å, is quite reasonable for the distance between the Rieske iron-sulfur center and the cytc1 heme in the c1 state (4Xia D., Yu, C.-A. Kim H. Xia J.-Z. Kachurin A.M.

Moreover, the value of the electronic coupling constant HAB, 1.31 cm−1, obtained by fitting Equation 1to the data is consistent with a nonadiabatic electron transfer mechanism (31Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7655) Google Scholar, 43Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the activation parameters ΔH‡ = +17.6 kJ/mol and ΔS‡ = −91.1 J/mol·K obtained by fitting the temperature dependence data with the Eyring transition state theory are also compatible with a conformational gating mechanism (42Hoffman B.M. Ratner M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6237-6243Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 43Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not possible to distinguish between the two mechanisms for the reaction from the temperature dependence studies.One of the most useful methods for characterizing electron transfer reactions is by measuring the effect of driving force on the rate constant (31Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 265-322Crossref Scopus (7655) Google Scholar, 32Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). If the reaction is controlled by a true electron transfer step, then the rate constant should depend on the driving force according to Equation 2. The effect of driving force on electron transfer in yeast cyt bc1 has been studied using the Rieske iron-sulfur protein mutants Y185W, S183A, and Y185F/S183A, which have 2Fe-2S redox potentials that are lower than that of wild-type bc1 by 90, 130, and 180 mV, respectively (44Denke E.

The decrease in redox potential of the mutants is presumably due to removal of the hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl group of Ser-183 and S-1 of the 2Fe-2S cluster and the hydroxyl group of Tyr-185 and Sγ of Cys-159 (Fig. 6). These yeast mutations decrease the steady-state enzyme activity to 30%, 10%, and 2% that of wild-type, respectively, consistent with decreases in the rate of the reaction between QH2 and 2Fe-2S due to decreases in driving force (44Denke E.

Mutation of the homologous residues in the P. denitrificans Rieske iron-sulfur protein led to similar decreases in redox potential and steady-state activity (45Schroter T. Hatzfeld O.M. Gemeinhardt S. Korn M. Friedrich T. Ludwig B. Link T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Guergova-Kuras et al. (39Guergova-Kuras M. Duras R. Ugalava N. Hadad I. Crofts A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) found that the Y156W mutation in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of R. sphaeroides cyt bc1 decreased the redox potential by 114 mV at low pH, and increased the pK of the 2Fe-2S ligand His-161 by 1 pH unit. The rate constant for electron transfer from quinol to 2Fe-2S was decreased to 7% that of wild-type by the Y156W mutation, suggesting that this reaction is controlled by proton-coupled electron transfer. In the present studies, the redox potentials of the Y156W, S154A, and S154A/Y156F R. sphaeroides mutants were decreased by 62, 109, and 159 mV, respectively, at pH 8.0 compared with that of the wild-type Rieske iron-sulfur protein. 2Fe-2S and cyt c1 have the same redox potential in wild-type cyt bc1 at pH 8.0, so the above mutations will significantly increase the driving force for electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cytc1. Based on Marcus theory calculations using Equation 2, these mutations would be predicted to increase the rate constant for electron transfer from 2Fe-2S to cytc1 by 3.3-, 8-, and 17-fold, respectively (Table I). The absence of a significant correlation between the rate constants and the driving force for these mutants indicates that the reaction is not rate-limited by the actual electron transfer event. The discrepancy between the prediction of Marcus theory and the experimentally determined rate constants of the mutants cannot be accounted for by using different values for the Marcus parameters. Changing the value ofr simply changes the predicted rate constants of all the mutants by the same amount, whereas changing the value of λ over a reasonable range of 0.7–1.0 eV has a very small effect on the relative rate constants. The larger rate constant for the Y156W mutant is probably due to a subtle conformational effect.FIG. 6Structure of bovine cyt bc1 P6522 crystals in thec1 state (6Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K.

Troponin itself consists of three subunits, TnI, TnC, and TnT, widely characterized as being responsible for separate aspects of the regulatory process. TnI, the inhibitory unit is released from actin upon calcium binding to TnC, while TnT performs a structural role forming a globular head region with the regulatory TnI- TnC complex with a tail anchoring it within the thin filament. We have examined the properties of TnT and the TnT1 tail fragment (residues 1–158) upon reconstituted actin-tropomyosin filaments. Their regulatory effects have been characterized in both myosin S1 ATPase and S1 kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments. We show that both inhibit the actin-tropomyosin-activated S1 ATPase with TnT1 producing a greater inhibitory effect. The S1 binding data show that this inhibition is not caused by the formation of the blocked B-state but by significant stabilization of the closed C-state with a 10-fold reduction in the C- to M-state equilibrium, KT, for TnT1. This suggests TnT has a modulatory as well as structural role, providing an explanation for its large number of alternative isoforms.

Early studies have provided a role for each of the components of Tn, TnI, TnC, and TnT (reviewed Refs. 1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). TnI has been shown to be responsible for the inhibition of ATPase due to its binding to actin (3Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition is relieved by Ca2+ binding to TnC that releases TnI from actin due to the strengthening of the TnI-TnC interaction (4Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). By both interacting with the TnI-TnC complex and with Tm, TnT tethers TnI and TnC to the thin filament during the Ca2+-dependent structural changes (5Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2125-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). TnT also has also been shown to influence Tm-Tm communication along the thin filament via its interaction at the Tm-Tm overlap (7Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recent studies (8McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys.

We have been interested in how each component affects the equilibria between the three states both allosterically (12Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and directly (8McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibition by TnI of the S1-actin·Tm ATPase appears to be due to the occupation of the “blocked” B-state, similar to the situation for the complete Tn system in the absence of Ca2+ (13Geeves M.A. Chai M. Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9345-9350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of TnT is particularly significant because it is a site for alternative splicing between the many different TnT isoforms expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The identification of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causing mutations in the N terminus of TnT may also reflect the importance of the Tm-Tm overlap region in influencing thin filament regulation. In this study we have characterized the regulatory effects of TnT and its proteolytic N-terminal fragment TnT1 upon reconstituted actin-Tm thin filaments using a combination of myosin S1 ATPase measurements with kinetic and equilibrium S1 binding measurements. The TnT1 fragment, which lacks the globular C-terminal region that interacts with TnI and TnC, contains the domain that overlaps the ends of the Tm on actin. We show that both whole TnT and TnT1 inhibit ATPase by stabilizing the C-state of the C- to M-state equilibrium, thereby inhibiting the isomerization of the myosin head. Portions of these data have been reported previously in preliminary form (14Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 365Google Scholar). Troponin and TnT were purified according to the methods of Greaser and Gergely (3Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4226-4233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Greaser M.L.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of rabbit myosin, as described by Weeds and Taylor (17Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Its molar concentration was calculated from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using anE1% of 7.9 cm−1 and a molecular mass of 115,000 Da. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then labeled at Cys-374 with N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide according to Criddleet al. (19Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phalloidin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-stabilized F-actin was made by incubating a solution of 10 μm pyrene-actin with 10 μm phalloidin overnight in experimental buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C. Cosedimentation assays were performed at 20 °C by mixing actin with binding proteins (Tm, TnT, and TnT1) at relevant concentrations in the standard assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) to a total volume of 200 μl. The actin was then pelleted (along with any bound proteins) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min (Beckman Instruments, TL100A). Equivalent samples of pellet and supernatant were then separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) using 13.5% acrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Quantification of proteins was carried out by using a Umax Powerlook III scanner with transparency adapter attached to a PC. The scanner was calibrated using a Kodak neutral density step tablet, and scanned images were analyzed using the Image-PC program (Scion Corp., based upon NIHImage). Stopped-flow experiments were performed at 20 °C with either a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61 or SF-61DX2 spectrophotometer in fluorescence mode. Pyrene fluorescence was excited at 365 nm and emission detected at right angles using a KV 389-nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz). Data were stored and analyzed using the Kinetasyst software provided with the instrument. Transients shown are the average of 3–5 shots of the machine. In these experiments the concentrations quoted are those after mixing the final concentrations being half of the stock solutions in the syringes. Binding is monitored by the ∼70% quenching of the pyrene-actin fluorescence upon binding of the S1 to actin (21Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The occupancy of the blocked state (KB) has been determined using the kinetic method of McKillop and Geeves (8McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The rate of binding of S1 to reconstituted filaments is measured under excess actin conditions such that the ratio of S1 to actin is 1:10. Under these conditions the rate of binding of S1 to actin is pseudo-first order and dependent upon the available actin concentration. The occupancy of the blocked state reduces the available actin concentration and can therefore be detected by the reduction in the observed rate constant of S1 binding to thin filaments reconstituted with regulatory proteins compared with filaments only containing actin. Fluorescence titrations were measured at 20 °C using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 365 nm with a 10-nm bandwidth and measuring emission at 405 nm with a 15-nm bandwidth. A total working volume of 2 ml was used in a 10 × 10-mm cell constantly stirred using a magnetic stirrer below the light path of the instrument. Autotitrations were made by the continuous addition of a concentrated S1 stock solution using a Harvard Apparatus Syringe Infusion Pump 22 driving a 100-μl glass syringe (Hamilton) as described previously (9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Data were acquired over a period of 250 s, with data points being collected every 0.5 s, using an integration time of 0.45 s. Buffer solutions for the titrations were filtered using a 0.22-μm disposable syringe filter to remove dust particles that can produce significant noise in the stirred cell at the low levels of sample fluorescence used. Mixing and equilibration of the reaction in the cell were checked as detailed previously (9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). ATPase assays were performed either by the colorimetric detection of phosphate described earlier (22Lehrer S.S. Golitsina N.L. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13449-13454Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or by the continuous coupled enzyme assay system (23Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) EnzCheck (Molecular Probes). Cooperative binding curves from titrations can be fitted using a version of the McKillop and Geeves model (Equation 1) with a varying cooperative unit size (9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). α=K1[M](KT(1+K2)Pn−1+Qn−1)KTPn+Qn+1/KB(Eq. 1) where α represents the fraction of total actin sites occupied; [M] is the concentration of free S1 heads; n is the cooperative unit size; P = 1 +K1[M](1 + K2) and Q = 1 + K1[M].KT defines the equilibrium between the closed C-state where only weak myosin binding is possible and the open M-state that allows rigor like binding (see Fig. 1). The occupancy of actin sites during a titration is given by the fluorescence change of the pyrene-actin (Equation 2),α=F0−FF0−F∞(Eq. 2) Parameter estimates from fitting a single data set produce meaningless standard errors of significantly less than 5% in the fitted parameters.

Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) gives a better estimate of standard errors of around 10–20% for K1 and KT, withn approximated to the nearest whole number. KB is determined by the stopped-flow experiments described. The blocked state reduces the available concentration of actin for rapid binding, which can be measured as a reduction in the observed rate (kobs) compared with that for unregulated actin (kact) (Equation 3).kact=[A]k+1andkobskact≈KB1+KB(Eq. 3) The data show that occupancy of the blocked state is very low apart from TmTn-Ca2+ and hence the 1/KB term is small and can be disregarded for fitting. The value of K2 is assumed to be 200 from previous work (21Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and all other parameters can then be fitted. The effects of TnT and TnT1 upon the regulation of actin-activated S1 ATPase are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2A shows the continuous measurement of the liberated Pi using a coupled assay. Under the conditions used (see figure legends), actin caused an ∼10-fold increase in the ATPase rate over the basal S1 level. Addition of a saturating level of Tm under these conditions was inhibitory, resulting in an ∼20% reduction in the actin-activated ATPase rate. The addition of TnT to actin-Tm produced an additional inhibition with the effect saturating at a 1:1 ratio of TnT to Tm.FIG. 3ATPase rates measured as a function of S1 concentration for actin (open circles) Tm (filled squares), actin-Tm·TnT (open triangles), and actin-Tm·TnT1 (filled triangles). Conditions are as follows: 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm ATP, plus 1 μmactin, 1 μm Tm, 1 μm TnT as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 2B shows the effects of increasing concentrations of TnT and TnT1 to actin-Tm plotted as S1 ATPase rate against concentration of TnT or TnT1 added. Both show inhibition with saturation at an ∼1:1 ratio of TnT or TnT1 to Tm indicating stoichiometric binding, with TnT1 producing a slightly greater inhibition than TnT but with a less clear saturation point. Thus, in the presence of Tm, TnT and TnT1 inhibit actin-activated S1 ATPase by ∼60% under these conditions. Fig. 3 shows representative data for the effects of TnT and TnT1 on the S1 concentration dependence of the actin-activated S1 ATPase. This demonstrates several important points. First, it can be seen that in the presence of all Tm-containing systems, there are dual effects on actin-activated S1 ATPase due to the induced cooperativity that causes sigmoidal activation with S1 concentration. Second, both TnT and TnT1 cause an inhibition of the S1 ATPase relative to actin-Tm across the S1 concentration range studied, although less than that produced by the whole Tn complex in the absence of calcium under similar conditions (24Lehrer S.S. Morris E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the relative inhibition of S1 actin-Tm ATPase produced by the addition of the TnT1 fragment is greater than that for whole TnT across the S1 concentration range. It should be noted that the ATPase rates of Figs. 2 and 3 are not directly comparable because lower actin and salt concentrations were used to produce reasonable ATPase rates across the range of S1 concentrations studied. In several similar experiments to that shown in Fig. 3, the exact degree of inhibition of the actin-Tm S1 ATPase by TnT and TnT1 varied from 10 to 50% depending on the conditions used, but qualitatively similar plots were produced in all cases. A cosedimentation assay was used to confirm the formation of a stoichiometric complex of TnT or TnT1 with Tm and to assess the effect of TnT and TnT1 upon Tm binding to actin under the solution conditions used in the following titration experiments (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Binding curves to actin for Tm in the presence or absence of an equal concentration of TnT is shown in Fig. 4. Under the conditions used there was no evidence of precipitation of either TnT or TnT1 within the concentration range studied. The results for the effect of TnT1 upon Tm affinity for actin were similar to that of TnT but are not shown on the figure for clarity. Curve fits shown are to the Hill equation commonly used for fitting sigmoidal Tm binding curves which gives a half-saturation pointK50% that can be used as a measure of Tm affinity for actin. Stoichiometry was obtained by comparison of band staining to bands containing known protein concentrations and validated against the known total protein concentrations added in the experiments. The results confirm that a 1:1 complex of TnT or TnT1 with Tm binds to actin in both cases. Under these conditions TnT or TnT1 only causes a comparatively small (∼2-fold) increase in the K50% of Tm for actin similar to that reported for a peptide consisting of residues 70–150 of cardiac TnT (25Palm T. Graboski S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Greenfield N.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2827-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and for the effects of TnT1 and TnT2 fragments on non-polymerizable Tm (26Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is a far smaller effect than the 2–3 orders of magnitude change seen for the whole Tn complex (27Wegner A. Walsh T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25455-25460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements of S1 binding to actin-Tm were made to determine whether TnT or TnT1 can induce occupancy of the blocked B-state in which S1 binding is prevented. Measurements of the rate of S1 binding to reconstituted thin filaments at a 1 to 10 ratio of S1 to actin are shown in Fig. 5A. As detailed under “Materials and Methods,” these experiments measure the fraction of actin available kinetically for S1 to bind according to Equation 3. The kobs for single exponential fits to the binding curves are shown in Table I. Within experimental error, the only significant inhibition of the rate of binding for any of the systems is for the presence of whole Tn in the absence of calcium. Thus, there is no evidence from this or previous in vitro data of significant occupancy of the B-state for thin filaments containing Tm alone or accompanied by either TnT or TnT1 (7Schaertl S.

TnTActin-Tm. TnT1Actin-Tm. Tn −CaRate (s−1)10.97.81110.43.3 Open table in a new tab Equilibrium binding measurements for S1 to actin-Tm were used to assess the effect of TnT or TnT1 upon the C- to M-state equilibrium. These are shown in Fig. 5B and Table II. It can be clearly seen that both TnT and TnT1 shift the S1 binding curves toward the right, indicating that a higher concentration of S1 is needed to cause the same degree of saturation. The filaments are therefore further switched “off” in comparison to actin-Tm with the shift for TnT1located at a higher S1 concentration, and hence it is further off than that seen for whole TnT. As the kinetic experiments show no blocked state to be present, these curves can be fitted to a 2-state version of the 3-state model described by Equation 1 ignoring theKB term (9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The value of K2(the rigor isomerization) has been shown to be dependent only upon the nucleotide bound to S1 and is hence set at the previously determined value of 200 for nucleotide-free S1 (8McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). As expected for systems containing the same S1 and actin, fitting produced similar values ofK1 (the weak binding) varying from 1.85 to 2.6 × 105 s−1m−1 for all the reconstituted filaments. The shape of the curve is therefore defined by the values ofKT (the C/M equilibrium) and n (the apparent cooperative unit size). In comparison to actin-Tm, the presence of TnT produces a 2-fold change in KT(0.034) with little effect upon n (7Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The TnT1data show a significantly greater 10-fold reduction inKT (0.006), along with an increase in the apparent cooperative unit size n (9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig.5B are representative curves from experiments performed in triplicate. There is some quantitative variation between the values forK1, KT, and ndetermined here and those previously published (7Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8McKillop D.F. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) for actin-Tm which showed a slightly lower value of K1(1 × 105 s−1m−1) and KT (0.14) and slightly higher n. However, the effects of TnT and TnT1 shown here were highly reproducible between replicates and represent an internally consistent data set.Table IIParameters determined from fitting of binding curvesActin-TmActin-Tm·TnTActin-Tm·TnT1K1(×103)260240185K2200200200KT0.0750.0340.006n679 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5C shows the titration curves from Fig. 5Bplotted with the y axis inverted (corresponding to fraction of actin bound) overlaid with a curve for S1 binding to unregulated actin. In this format the figure can be directly compared with the equivalent ATPase against S1 concentration curves for the same reconstituted filament systems, although at a lower salt concentration, shown in Fig. 3. The correspondence between the two can clearly be seen indicating the cooperativity of S1 binding in both cases. In both plots the three curves for actin-Tm, actin-Tm·TnT, and actin-Tm·TnT1 are offset from left to right, all crossing the actin curve at increasing S1 concentrations in the same order. The difference in salt concentration between the two experiments is not expected to have a substantial effect upon the form of the curves as regulation of S1 binding is similar at the lower salt concentration when sufficient Mg2+ (5 mm) is present (21Head J.G. Ritchie M.D. Geeves M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This study shows that the binding of either TnT or TnT1 to actin-Tm inhibits both S1 binding to actin and actin-activated S1 ATPase rates. In neither case is the inhibition due to the formation of a blocked B-state, whereby a fraction of the actin is unavailable for binding but purely through the C- to M-state equilibrium being biased further toward the C-state. The data show that the TnT1 fragment of TnT causes a much greater inhibitory effect than whole TnT. We suggest the TnT1 region has a significant role in modulating thin filament regulation. The difference in apparent cooperative unit size between TnT and TnT1suggests further interactions of the TnT2 “head” region of TnT. These results and their implications will now be discussed further. The combination of the ATPase and cosedimentation data indicate that both TnT and TnT1 interact with actin-Tm specifically to cause the formation of a stoichiometric A7TmTnT complex presumably resembling the native holocomplex. The cosedimentation data also show that both TnT and TnT1 have a relatively small effect on Tm affinity. Tm binding to actin has been described as a polymerization process controlled by two interactions, the single site affinity of Tm to actin which causes the initial binding and the Tm-Tm end-to-end interactions that drive polymerization (28Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wegner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 839-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The former will tend to govern the initial concentration at which binding starts, whereas the latter controls the cooperativity of the binding process once nucleation has occurred. There is some conflicting evidence for the effects of TnT and TnT1 upon the Tm-Tm interaction. It has been shown that both whole Tn, TnT, and TnT1 increase the cooperativity of S1 binding to actin-Tm (this work and Refs. 7Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15890-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and9Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, in contrast there appears to be a decrease in the cooperativity of binding of the regulatory complex to actin in these systems (28Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fisher D. Wang G. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29457-29461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore important to note that cooperativity of Tm and Tn binding to actin does not necessarily reflect the cooperativity of the regulation of S1-actin interactions. Hence the sigmoidal binding curves of Tm and Tm with Tn to actin are measuring a different form of cooperativity to the sigmoidal S1 ATPase and S1 binding curves. The small effect upon Tm affinity to actin indicates that neither TnT nor TnT1 interact strongly with actin to stabilize the actin-Tm complex. This should be contrasted to the fact that whole Tn increases Tm affinity by 2–3 orders of magnitude (27Wegner A. Walsh T.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 10153-10157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This is caused by interactions in the head region of Tn, notably by the known strong TnI interaction with actin in the absence of calcium, which causes a 2–10-fold tighter binding than in the presence of calcium and also by secondary Tn interactions even when calcium is present. There is still some debate about the exact nature and strength of the interactions between Tn, Tm, and actin in these studies. The ATPase data show the following two important facts: 1) under the conditions in Fig. 2, TnT and TnT1 both cause an inhibition of the S1 ATPase relative to actin-Tm; 2) as shown in Fig. 3, the S1 ATPase can be either inhibited or “potentiated” by Tm and TnT or TnT1 depending on the S1 and actin concentration used. This point has often caused confusion in the literature when interpreting S1 ATPase data. There is no true “potentiation” of the S1 ATPase by the regulatory proteins, and theVmax value at saturating S1 concentrations is similar in both the presence and absence of regulatory proteins (33Williams D.L., Jr. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6987-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). If there were no effect upon S1 affinity, then the sigmoidal S1 concentration-dependent S1 ATPase activation curve for a regulated filament would always produce an ATPase rate lower than that seen for"

Syt I protein should undergo several post-translational modifications before maturation and subsequent functioning on synaptic vesicles (e.g. N-glycosylation and fatty acylation in vertebrate Syt I), because the apparent molecular weight of Syt I on synaptic vesicles (mature form, 65,000) was much higher than the calculated molecular weight (47,400) predicted from the cDNA sequences both in vertebrates and invertebrates. Common post-translational modification(s) of Syt I conserved across phylogeny, however, have never been elucidated. In the present study, I discovered that dithreonine residues (Thr-15 and Thr-16) at the intravesicular domain of mouse Syt I are post-translationally modified by a complex form ofO-linked sugar (i.e. the addition of sialic acids) in PC12 cells and that the O-glycosylation of Syt I in COS-7 cells depends on the coexpression of vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP-2)/synaptobrevin. I also showed that a transmembrane domain of Syt I directly interacts with isolated VAMP-2, but not VAMP-2, in the heterotrimeric SNARE (SNAPreceptor) complex (vesicle SNARE, VAMP-2, and two target SNAREs, syntaxin IA and SNAP-25). Since di-Thr or di-Ser residues are often found at the intravesicular domain of invertebrate Syt I, and VAMP-dependent O-glycosylation was also observed in squid Syt expressed in COS-7 cells, I propose that VAMP-dependent O-glycosylation of Syt I is a common modification during evolution and may have important role(s) in synaptic vesicle trafficking.

(iv) The WHXL motif in the β-8 strand of the C2B domain of Syt I is involved in the synaptic vesicle docking step by binding to certain plasma membrane receptors (43Fukuda M. Moreira J.E. Liu V. Sugimori M. Mikoshiba K. Llinás R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14715-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Syt I (or II) is also present at growth cone vesicles and has been shown to be essential for neurite outgrowth of chick dorsal root ganglion neurons and PC12 cells (44Kabayama H. Takei K. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 45Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 295: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Syt I is involved in the axolemmal repair process in the squid giant axon and plasmalemmal repair in PC12 cells (46Detrait E. Eddleman C.S. Yoo S. Fukuda M. Nguyen M.P. Bittner G.D.

Although the roles of the conserved two C2 domains of Syt I have been well demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo as described above, the functions of other domains (i.e. a short N terminus, a transmembrane domain, and a spacer domain), which are not conserved among the Syt family, have not yet been characterized. Recently, I showed that the unique spacer domain of Syt IV is essential for Golgi localization (48Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and proposed that the unique spacer domain of each Syt isoform may be involved in distinct subcellular localization of Syt isoforms in the brain (Syts I, III, IV, VI, and VII) (11Fukuda M.

In contrast, however, roles of the transmembrane domain except for the function in membrane anchoring (5Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem.

In this study, I report a novel function of the transmembrane domain of Syt I as a protein interaction site. By using the mammalian coexpression system, I show that the transmembrane domain of Syt I is essential for interaction with vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP-2; also called synaptobrevin), another synaptic vesicle protein essential for neurotransmitter release (53Baumert M.

Based on our findings, I discuss the possible roles of Syt I-VAMP-2 interaction and O-glycosylation of Syt I in secretory vesicle trafficking. Restriction enzymes and recombinantTaqDNA polymerase were obtained from Toyobo Biochemicals (Osaka, Japan). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody and anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose were from Novagen (Madison, WI). HRP-conjugated monoclonal (M2) antibody against FLAG peptide and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were obtained from Sigma. Anti-Syt I (SYA148) and anti-VAMP-2 mouse monoclonal antibodies were from StreeGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, Canada). All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade.

The left and right halves were separately amplified by using pGEM-T-T7-Syt I as a template (13Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments of Syt IΔC2A mutants with a T7 tag were then excised from the pGEM-T Easy vector by NotI digestion and subcloned into the NotI site of a modified pEF-BOS mammalian expression vector (59Mizushima S.

Cotransfection of pEF-T7-Syt constructs and pEF-FLAG-VAMP-2, pEF-FLAG-SNAP-25, and/or pEF-FLAG-syntaxin IA constructs into COS-7 cells (7.5 × 105 cells, the day before transfection/10-cm plate) was achieved with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's notes (Invitrogen) (39Fukuda M.

Three days after transfection, COS-7 cells were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmleupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 900–1,000 rpm. After solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h, the supernatants (400 μl) were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Anti-T7 tag-conjugated agarose (wet volume 10 μl) and EGTA (final concentration 2 mm) or Ca2+ (final 500 μm) was added to the supernatants followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation, after which the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA (or 500 μm Ca2+), 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by immunoblot analysis as described previously (13Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Endoglycosidase H, N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics), and sialidase (neuraminidase; Sigma) treatments were performed as described with slight modifications (14Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.

Two μl of the cell lysates solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 was added to four volumes of the buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After the addition of 1 milliunit ofO-glycosidase (Roche Diagnostics), the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody as described previously (13Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

In a previous study, I showed that the apparent molecular weight of recombinant mouse synaptotagmin I (or II) expressed in COS-7 cells (immature form; about 55,000) was much smaller than that of endogenous Syt I in the brain or the recombinant Syt I expressed in PC12 cells where Syt I is endogenously expressed abundantly (complete mature form; about 65,000) (48Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 60Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41112-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (comparelanes 1 and 4 in Fig.1). The difference in size was partly attributable to the modification of N-linked sugar, because the recombinant Syt I in COS-7 cells was sensitive to endoglycosidase H that cleaves unmodified N-linked sugar and cannot cleave a complex form of N-linked sugar, but the recombinant Syt I in PC12 cells (or brain Syt I) was resistant to such treatment (14Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 627-635Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 48Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 6). By contrast, both proteins were sensitive to endoglycosidase F that cleaves all of the N-linked sugar (48Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5). Since the molecular mass of the recombinant Syt I in COS-7 cells was significantly smaller than that of the recombinant Syt I in PC12 cells even after N-glycosidase F treatment (compare lanes 2 and 5 in Fig. 1), additional modification(s) of Syt I should occur in PC12 cells or in the brain for maturation of the Syt I protein. One possible candidate is fatty acylation of the Cys cluster at the interface between the transmembrane and spacer domains as described previously (57Fukuda M. Kanno E. Ogata Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40319-40325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 67Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40319-40325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the shift of the molecular mass by fatty acylation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel was very small (see also Fig. 4C, lane 4) (57Fukuda M.

However, in recent times antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major health threat (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). This unmet medical need has prompted a new interest in the development of novel, potent, and orally available antibiotics. Among the many potential approaches to new antibiotics include those that target novel, bacteria-specific, biosynthetic pathways. Peptide deformylase is such a target. Inhibition of this enzyme would result in blockage of essential protein processing and has been shown to be bacteriostatic (2Clements J.M. Beckett R.P. Brown A. Catlin G. Lobell M. Palan S. Thomas W. Whittaker M. Wood S. Salama S. Baker P.J. Rodgers H.F. Barynin V. Rice D.W. Hunter M.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Chen D.Z.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).In eubacteria, as well as mitochondria and chloroplasts, the initiation of protein synthesis normally requires an N-formylated methionine residue (4Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meinnel T. Guillon J.M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schmitt E. Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The special initiation tRNA, tRNAfMet, is charged with methionine by the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6.1.10), which adds a methionine to either of the methionine tRNAs with the consumption of ATP. The formyl group is added to the charged tRNAfMetfrom 10-formyltetrahydrofolate by methionine-tRNAfMet formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.9). The f-Met-tRNAfMet is transferred to the ribosome where it is the preferred initiator of protein synthesis (7Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature proteins do not retainN-formylmethionine. In fact, a heterogeneous population of amino acids is normally found at the N terminus of mature proteins: alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, or methionine. Larger amino acids are rarely found (6Schmitt E. Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Dardel F. Blanquet S. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Hirel P.H.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that multiple catabolic processing might occur after or in concert with protein synthesis. This processing may be important for protein turnover (10Varshavsky A. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), conservation of methionine, or it may be required for the activity of some enzymes (11Tso J.Y. Hermodson M.A. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3532-3536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Persson B. Flinta C. von Heijne G. Jornvall H. Eur. J.

All known N-terminal peptidases cannot use formylated peptides as substrates (14Solbiati J. Chapman-Smith A. Miller J.L. Miller C.G. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of the formyl group is an essential first step in N-terminal processing. The formyl group is removed from the peptide N terminus by a metalloenzyme, peptide deformylase (EC 3.5.1.27) (15Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Ball L.A. Kaesberg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Livingston D.M. Leder P. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The processed protein is released for possible further processing by methionine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.18). Because the formylation/deformylation cycle is unique to eubacteria and does not occur in cytosolic eukaryotic or Archaebacteria protein synthesis (4Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), peptide deformylase is an attractive target for the design of new antibiotics.Previous analysis of peptide deformylase gene sequences revealed that the predicted protein coding regions have a significant sequence similarity and three characteristic stretches of highly conserved amino acids: motif 1 (GΦGΦAAXQ), motif 2 (EGCΦS), and motif 3 (HEΦDH), where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid (Fig.1). The Cys of motif 2 and the two His residues of motif 3 are involved in active site metal ion binding (18Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Villoing S. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fourth ligand of the tetrahedrally coordinated metal ion is a water molecule that is held in place by the Glu of motif 3. Subsequent analysis of diverse peptide deformylase sequences suggested that the enzyme family could be divided into two classes (19Meinnel T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Peptide deformylase enzyme from Gram-negative organisms represented byEscherichia coli (Class I) have ∼30% sequence identity with each other; whereas many Gram-positive organisms express a structural variant that includes three major insertions (20Dardel F. Ragusa S. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Meinnel T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Giglione C. Pierre M. Meinnel T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) relative to the E. coli sequence, some additional single amino acid insertions, and a distinct C terminus (Fig. 1). The overall sequence identity among Class II genes appears to be lower (15%) than Class I, and about half of these identities occur in or near the Class II-specific insertions. The first major insertion occurs after Tyr39 (E. coli) and consists of 12 amino acids with high sequence similarity. In this region the Mycoplasmagenes predict an insertion of only 11 amino acids (22Himmelreich R. Hilbert H. Plagens H. Pirkl E., Li, B.C. Herrmann R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4420-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The second characteristic insertion is of variable length and occurs after Asn65. A third insertion of three amino acids follows Ser81 and extends the sequence preceding the conserved motif 2. The last major difference between the two classes is the C terminus. In the Class II enzymes this sequence is more hydrophobic and nearly always shorter than the E. coli version.Class I peptide deformylase from the Gram-negative organism, E. coli, has been well characterized both in terms of enzymology and structure. Efforts to purify the enzyme were hampered for 3 decades by the rapid loss of activity upon purification. This lability was traced to the Fe2+ metal cofactor (23Rajagopalan R.T.R., Yu, X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar) and has been overcome by a combination of protein overexpression, elimination of oxygen, and the use of alternative active site metal ions. The Zn2+ form of the enzyme displays about a 100-fold drop in activity relative to Fe2+ peptide deformylase (23Rajagopalan R.T.R., Yu, X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar, 24Rajagopalan P.T. Datta A. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13910-13918Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 25Rajagopalan P.T. Pei D. J.

Charackterisierung des Eisenzentrum und des Katalysemechanismus von Peptide Deformylase aus Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Universitat Heidelberg, Germany1995Google Scholar). Ni2+-, Co2+-, or Cd2+-substituted peptide deformylase retains activity nearly identical to that of the Fe2+ enzyme, but is much less susceptible to oxidation (26Groche D. Becker A. Schlichting I.

The ligand-free structure of the enzyme was first reported by Chan et al. (31Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). They subsequently determined the structure of the complex of peptide deformylase with a transition state inhibitor, (S)-2-O-(H-phosphonoxyl)-l-caproyl-l-leucyl-p-nitroanilide (PCLNA)1 with Zn2+ and Co2+ peptide deformylase (32Hao B.

They also reported product complex x-ray structures of Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ peptide deformylase. Additionally, hydroxamate inhibitor complexes with actinonin and BB-3497 have been reported (2Clements J.M. Beckett R.P. Brown A. Catlin G. Lobell M. Palan S. Thomas W. Whittaker M. Wood S. Salama S.

A model of the thiol inhibitor, thiorphan, bound toE. coli peptide deformylase has been proposed (36Ragusa S. Mouchet P. Lazennec C. Dive V. Meinnel T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The structures of the Zn2+ and Ni2+ forms of the enzyme in solution have been determined by NMR (37Meinnel T. Blanquet S.

The three conserved sequence motifs that characterize peptide deformylase (20Dardel F. Ragusa S. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Meinnel T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 266: 939-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) contribute side chain residues that coordinate the active site metal ion and form part of a continuous binding pocket depression. Hydrophobic interactions accommodate the methionine side chain, and a number of hydrogen bonds are formed from the peptide substrate or inhibitor to enzyme (2Clements J.M. Beckett R.P. Brown A. Catlin G. Lobell M. Palan S. Thomas W. Whittaker M. Wood S. Salama S. Baker P.J. Rodgers H.F. Barynin V. Rice D.W. Hunter M.G. Antimicrob.

Biol. 1998; 5: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The focal point of the overall fold of the protein is α-helix 3 that includes the HEXXH metal binding sequence, motif 3. Positioned about this α-helix are three small β-sheets that cradle the helix and form a shallow depression for peptide binding (18Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Villoing S. Blanquet S. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Class I enzyme has a long C-terminal α-helix that extends away from the body of the enzyme. Genetic evidence suggests that this α-helix can be deleted without loss of function in E. coli(44Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Dardel F. Schmitter J.M. Blanquet S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In this report we present the x-ray structure of Class II peptide deformylase from the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus at 1.9 Å resolution. Comparison of this structure with the prototypic Class I enzyme from E. coli reveals minor structural variation arising from the insertions as well as specific, active site differences that may impact the design of pathogen-specific peptide deformylase inhibitors. Antibiotics that target cell wall biosynthesis, protein synthesis, or DNA replication in bacteria have been the mainstay for treatment of bacterial infections for decades. However, in recent times antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major health threat (1Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar).

Using a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of a cAMP- responsive element (CRE), the coupling efficiency of the MC4R and MC3R to G-proteins was previously shown to be different. MC4R exhibited only 30–50% of the maximum activity induced by MC3R. To assess the role of the different MC3R and MC4R domains in G-protein coupling, several chimeric MC3R/MC4R receptors were constructed. The relative luciferase activities, which were assessed after transfecting the chimeric receptors into HEK 293T cells, showed that the i3 (3rd intracellular) loop domain has an essential role in the differential signaling of MC3R and MC4R. To reveal which amino acid residue was involved in the MC4R-specific signaling in the i3 loop, a series of mutant MC4Rs was constructed. Reporter gene analysis showed that single mutations of Arg220 to Ala and Thr232 to either Val or Ala increased the relative luciferase activities, which suggests that these specific amino acids, Arg220 and Thr232, in the i3 loop of MC4R play crucial roles in G-protein coupling and the subtype-specific signaling pathways. An examination of the inositol phosphate (IP) levels in the cells transfected with either MC3R or MC4R after being exposed to the melanocortin peptides revealed significant stimulation of IP production by MC3R but no detectable increase in IP production was observed by MC4R. Furthermore, none of the MC4R mutants displayed melanocortin peptide-stimulated IP production.

It has been reported that the activation of melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R)1 by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) increases energy expenditure and decreases food intake. Moreover, the genetic disruption of MC4R was found to cause obesity in mice (13Huszar D. Lynch C.A. Fairchild-Huntress V. Dunmore J.H. Fand Q. Berkemeier L.R. Boston B.A. Cone R.D. Smith F.J.

We analyzed several α-MSH analogues upon stimulation of MC3R and MC4R using a CRE (cAMP responsive element)-mediated reporter gene transcription activity assay (16Lee E.J. Lee S.H. Jung J.W. Lee W. Kim B.J. Park K.W. Lim S.K. Yoon C.J. Baik J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and were able to show that both MC3R and MC4R, expressed in human cell line HEK 293T, stimulate transcription when stimulated using different analogues of melanocortin at different levels. Our previous studies have shown that MC3R and MC4R may have differential efficiencies and/or modes of signaling in terms of G-protein coupling, in addition to their specific ligand-receptor interactions, which can specify subtype-specific signaling pathwaysin vivo (16Lee E.J.

The role of the third intracellular (i3) loop in G-protein coupling specificity has been investigated extensively for many seven-transmembrane domain receptors, including adrenergic, serotonergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic receptors (17Cotecchia S.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). For example, swapping experiments performed upon two different G protein-coupled receptors demonstrated the importance of this loop in selective coupling to specific G-protein/effector systems (22Liggett S.B Freedman N.J.

To identify the role(s) of the third intracellular loop of the MC3R and MC4R receptors in terms of G-protein coupling specificity and receptor activation, several chimeras were constructed and characterized. We used the CRE-luciferase reporter gene assay to score the efficacy of receptor-G proteins coupling (24Chen W. Shields T.S. Stork P.J. Cone R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Baik J.H. Bahtia M. Picetti R. Thiriet G. Borrelli E. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 75-89Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In parallel, amino acid mutations were generated in the third intracytoplasmic loop of MC4R to identify the residues that play a role in G-protein coupling. These mutant receptors were examined in terms of their abilities to bind melanocortin receptor-specific ligands and with respect to signal transduction at the cAMP level. Chimeric receptors were made by using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence substitution of the i3 and carboxyl-terminal domain in rat MC3R (GenBankTM accession number X70667) and human MC4R (GenBankTM accession number S77415). Overlapping primers were designed from the junction of i3 and the carboxyl-terminal in MC3R and MC4R (Table I). To construct the chimeras, fragments originating from each receptor were first amplified in separate reactions with the indicated primers, namely, a vector primer and an overlapping primer directed against the desired junction sites between MC3 and MC4R receptors. Fragments were isolated and purified from agarose gel and used as templates in a second polymerase chain reaction performed with two outer vector primers. For example, to construct chimera 1, the MC3R sequence from the amino terminus to the carboxyl-terminal end of transmembrane domain V was amplified using a vector primer (MC3R-F, Table I) and an overlapping 36-mer primer (MC3R-R, Table I). This overlapping primer contained 24 bases (in bold, Table I) from the template sequence (MC3R) and an additional 12 bases from MC4R (initalics, Table I). In the same way, a second PCR was performed using two primers (MC4R-F and MC4R-R) with an MC4R template. These PCR products were purified and used as templates for another PCR, which was performed using the MC3R-F and MC4R-R primers. Final PCR products of each chimera were isolated and purified from agarose gel. All chimeric inserts were subsequently subcloned into pSV (16Lee E.J. Lee S.H. Jung J.W. Lee W. Kim B.J. Park K.W.

All chimeric inserts were sequenced on an automatic sequencer, ALFexpress (Amersham Biosciences), using a dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). No point mutations were observed, and exact substitutions of all domains were found.Table ISequences of overlapping primer for chimeric receptor construction The MC4R and MC3R sequences were extracted from the NCBI data base and aligned using the ClustalW and GENE DOC programs. Primers were designed from the sequences in the I3 loop domain of MC4R using a recommended protocol (QuikChangeTM Site-directed mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) (Table II). Briefly, denatured double stranded plasmid DNA was annealed to a mutagenic primer pair of forward and reverse oligonucleotides and the new strand of DNA so obtained was synthesized with pfu DNA polymerase (Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, Stratagene) by polymerase chain reaction (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min for 16 cycles). Methylated template DNA was digested withDpnI enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were then used to transform competent XL-1 blue Escherichia coliand the plasmid DNA was prepared. Inserts of plasmid DNAs were sequenced entirely and all amino acid changes were confirmed by full double stranded sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotide primers for MC4R mutant receptor construction Rat MC3R and human MC4R cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Roger D.

For receptor expression, HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with pSV-rMC3R and pSV-hMC4R, respectively, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5–7 × 105 cells were plated per six-well culture dish and transfected with 1 μg of pCRE-luc (Stratagene), 0.5 μg of plasmid pCH11O carrying the β-galactosidase gene, and 1 μg of each chimeric receptor or MC4R mutant plasmid DNA. After 6 h, the transfection mixture was replaced with fresh growth medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK 293T cells were treated for 3 h with various concentrations of α-MSH-ND or NDP-MSH in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After treatment, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega), and luminescence was measured using a 96-well luminometer (Microlumat; EG & G Berthold, Bad Wilbad, Germany). The expression of the reporter gene was normalized (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using β-galactosidase activity (27Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Transfection in the control group was performed under the transfection conditions described above with 1 μg of pCRE-luc, 0.5 μg of plasmid pCH110 carrying the β-galactosidase gene, and 1 μg of chimeric receptor or MC4R mutant plasmid DNA, but without stimulating by the melanocortin peptides. Results are expressed as the ratio of luciferase activity of the transfected cells to that of the unstimulated controls. The mean values of the data obtained were fitted to a sigmoid curve with a variable slope factor using nonlinear squares regression in GraphPad Prism software. EC50 values (nm) are described as mean ± S.E. Iodinated NDP-MSH,125I(iodotyrosyl-2)-[Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH, was prepared using the chloramine-T method, as follows. 1 mCi (10 μl) of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to 5 μg of NDP-MSH in 100 μl of 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and 20 μl of 2.8 mg/ml chloramine T solution in 200 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) was then added for 15 s, at which time the reaction was stopped with 50 ml of 3.6 mg/ml sodium metabisulfate. The reaction mixture was then diluted in 1 ml of 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) and Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography. A 100-μl aliquot of a 0.1% solution of bovine serum albumin was added to all radioactive fractions. Specific activity of the [125I]NDP-MSH was measured, which was ∼0.59 pmol/100,000 cpm. For the binding assay, 24 h after transfection in HEK 293T cells, medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2). The cells were then immediately incubated in wells at 37 °C for 2 h with 0.25 ml of binding buffer (containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% Hanks' balanced salt solution, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, at pH 7.2) containing a constant concentration of [125I]NDP-MSH and appropriate concentrations of the competing unlabeled ligand in each well. At the end of the incubation, the plates were placed on ice for 15 min and the cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. Cells were detached from the plates using 0.5 ml of 0.5n NaOH twice. Radioactivity was measured (Workman automatic γ-counter) and Kd and Bmaxvalues were calculated, to a 95% confidence interval, using GraphPad Prism software. HEK 293T cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates and allowed to recover for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with pSV-rMC3R and pSV-hMC4R, respectively, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described above, after which 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The medium was then aspirated, and cells were incubated for 16 h inmyo-inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml, 25 mCi/mmol) (DuPont Biotechnology Systems). The cells were then pretreated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm LiCl for 30 min, and then incubated in the absence or presence of different concentrations of α-MSH for 5 s to 3 or 45 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of perchloric acid to a final concentration of 5% (w/v). Cells were extracted and [3H]inositol polyphosphates were analyzed by anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography, using a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman), as described previously (28Downes C.P.

Cellular responses to the various peptides were compared using one-way analysis of variance and the Student's t test with Instat software (GraphPad). MC3R and MC4R share 60% overall amino acid identity and 76% similarity. The transmembrane regions show the highest degree of homology, whereas the intra- and extracellular loops show the lowest. As depicted in Fig. 1, four types of MC3R/MC4R chimeric receptors were constructed to investigate the role of the different domains of MC3R and MC4R in G-protein coupling. These chimeric receptors were designed to determine the contribution made by the i3 domain to G-protein coupling efficiency. Thus, the i3 loop and the remainder of the COOH-terminal domain of MC3R were swapped with the corresponding domain of the MC4R (named chimera 1), and in chimera 2, only the i3 loop of MC3R was swapped with that of MC4R. In chimera 3, the i3 loop and the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal loop of MC3R were swapped with that of MC4R, and in chimera 4, only the cytoplasmic loop of MC3R (named chimera 3 or 4, respectively) was swapped with the corresponding region of the MC4R. Wild type MC3R, MC4R, and the chimeric MC3/MC4R receptors were transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells. MC3R, MC4R, and all chimeric receptors all bound [125I]NDP-MSH with high affinity, as shown in Table III. The affinities of the expressed MC3R and MC4R receptors for [125I]NDP-MSH were 3.775 ± 0.4906 and 4.269 ± 1.0090 nm, respectively, and theBmax values estimated for the two receptors were very similar (361.7 ± 20.47 and 375.9 ± 40.07 fmol/mg of protein for MC3R and MC4R, respectively, Table III). The respective chimeric receptors were found to have affinities that were similar to those of the parent receptors. These data indicate that substitution of the third intracellular loop had no significant conformational influence on ligand-binding domains, which are localized mainly within the transmembrane domain regions.Table III125I-Labeled NDP-MSH binding to MC3R and MC4R, and to chimeric receptorsBmaxKdfmol/mg proteinnmMC3R361.7 ± 20.473.775 ± 0.4906MC4R375.9 ± 40.074.269 ± 1.0090Chimera 1329.2 ± 21.563.310 ± 0.5175Chimera 2329.3 ± 18.823.558 ± 0.4753Chimera 3298.7 ± 23.343.164 ± 0.5977Chimera 4381.2 ± 53.524.298 ± 1.3350 Open table in a new tab In parallel, wild type and chimeric MC3/MC4R receptors were transfected with the CRE-luciferase reporter gene into HEK 293T cells, as described earlier (16Lee E.J.

Jung J.W. Lee W. Kim B.J. Park K.W. Lim S.K. Yoon C.J. Baik J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a CRE in its promoter (pCRE-Luc), we were able to show that it is possible to monitor variations in intracellular cAMP levels induced by transient transfections of MC3 and MC4 receptors. When increasing concentrations of α-MSH analogues were added, a typical dose-dependent and saturable induction of luciferase activity was observed (Fig.2). However, we detected no significant effect of the α-MSH analogues on cells transfected with the reporter plasmid alone, which rules out the possibility of the presence of endogenous melanocortin receptors in the cell lines used for transfection, as the presence of such endogenous species might have affected the measured luciferase activity levels (data not shown). Another control transfection, using a luciferase reporter vector devoid of a CRE sequence, showed no significant response, demonstrating that the luciferase activity measured was dependent of the presence of the CRE site in the reporter plasmid (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the measured CRE-luciferase activity levels reflect the effects elicited by the receptors on changes in the intracellular cAMP levels, as represented by changes in cAMP-mediated gene expression, and thus provided evidence of receptor-G protein-effector interaction. Alterations in the abilities of different chimeric receptors to induce luciferase reporter gene activity were measured. As described previously the luciferase activity induced by MC4R was found to be about 30–50% of the level induced by MC3R. Interestingly, chimera 1, where the i3 loop with the rest of the COOH-terminal domain of the MC3R were swapped with the corresponding domain of the MC4R, was similar to native MC3R in terms of its maximal reporter gene activity. Chimera 4 showed a slight increase in maximal reporter gene activity. However, the abilities of chimeras 2 and 3 to induce luciferase reporter gene activity were significantly affected, and decreased by 60 and 45% in maximal reporter gene activity, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The EC50 calculated from the dose-response curves was in general highly reproducible over several experiments, results are summarized in Table IV. The ability to induce the luciferase reporter gene activity of chimera 2 receptors upon stimulation with α-MSH-ND was significantly affected by 8.7-fold (EC50 = 11.37 nm) versus MC3R (EC50 = 1.3 nm), whereas the EC50values of other chimeric receptors were not significantly changed (Table IV). Therefore, our analysis of the four chimeras suggests that the dominant loss of G-protein coupling efficiency was associated mainly with the 3rd intracytoplasmic loop of the MC3R and MC4R receptors.Table IVSummary of estimated EC50 values of the melanocortin agonist α-MSH-NDP for MC3R, MC4R and chimeric receptorsReceptorEC50nmMC3R1.309 ± 0.367MC4R1.007 ± 0.564Chimera 13.303 ± 0.7824-ap < 0.01 significantly different from corresponding MC3R value.Chimera 211.372 ± 6.128Chimera 33.163 ± 1.475Chimera 42.988 ± 0.7254-a p < 0.01 significantly different from corresponding MC3R value. Open table in a new tab To assess the role of the i3 loop and to establish whether mutations in the i3 loop of MC4R alter the coupling profiles of the receptor, amino acid mutations were generated in the i3 loop of MC4R (Fig. 3). Charged amino acids, such as, arginine 220, lysine 224, arginine 225, and arginine 236 were substituted with alanine (R220A, K224A, R225A, and R236A respectively), which lacks an amino acid chain beyond the β carbon and also avoids the introduction of steric hindrance or unwanted ionic interactions. We also substituted threonine 232 with valine (T232V), a nonpolar amino acid, or with alanine (T232A). In addition, isoleucine 235 and arginine 236 in MC4R were substituted with proline and glutamine, respectively (I235P and R236Q), which are native amino acids located at these positions in MC3R (Fig. 3). Other MC4R-specific amino acids in the i3 loop, such as glycine 238, alanine 239, and asparagine 240 were also substituted with the amino acids present at the same position in the i3 loop of MC3R, respectively (G238H, A239S, and N240C). These mutant receptors were examined in terms of their abilities to bind melanocortin receptor-specific ligands and for their abilities to transduce signals at the cAMP level. Table 5 summarizes ligand affinities for MC3R, MC4R, and the 11 mutant MC4 receptors. All mutant receptors were found to bind [125I]NDP-MSH, demonstrating that they were all expressed on the plasma membrane. In general, no significant differences in the binding of [125I]NDP-MSH to the mutant receptors were observed.Table V125I-Labeled NDP-MSH binding to MC3R, MC4R, and MC4R mutantsBmaxKdfmol/mg proteinnmMC3R361.7 ± 20.473.775 ± 0.4906MC4R375.9 ± 40.074.269 ± 1.0090R220A325.9 ± 25.233.893 ± 0.6862K224A297.9 ± 18.474.967 ± 0.6529R225A323.8 ± 26.674.066 ± 0.7527T232A334.8 ± 28.213.559 ± 0.7007T232V304.8 ± 34.293.514 ± 0.9270I235P309.6 ± 15.923.621 ± 0.4330R236A296.3 ± 38.754.081 ± 1.1980R236Q282.0 ± 41.174.529 ± 1.4400G238H397.5 ± 16.733.839 ± 0.3505A239S339 ± 28.434.858 ± 1.303N240C346.5 ± 32.563.005 ± 0.5872 Open table in a new tab To assess whether the G-protein coupling efficiencies of the mutant receptors differed from that of MC4R, we measured their abilities to induce CRE-luciferase reporter gene activity. Mutants R220A, T232V, and T232A showed enhanced reporter gene activity, which was very near that of MC3R, whereas the other mutant receptors had CRE-luciferase reporter gene activities similar to that of MC4R (Fig.4, A and B). The EC50 value of R220A was 12-fold lower than that of MC4R, and the EC50 value of T232V and T232A was 6.5- and 5.9-fold, respectively, lower than that of MC4R (Table VI). The mutant receptors K224A (2.1-fold), R225A (3.5-fold), R236A (3.9-fold), R236Q (3.9-fold), and G238H (1.9-fold) showed slightly enhanced EC50efficiencies, although their maximum CRE-luciferase reporter gene activities were unchanged (Table VI). The mutants I235P, A239S, and N240C showed no significant changes in EC50 values or maximal reporter gene activity (Fig. 4, Table VI). These data suggest that Arg220 and Thr232 are critical amino acid residues, and are implicated in the specific G-protein coupling properties of MC4R.FIG. 4Relative cAMP-mediated transcriptional activity of MC3R, MC4R , and mutant receptors by NDP-MSH in HEK 293T cells.A, cAMP-mediated transcriptional activity stimulated by NDP-MSH on MC3R and MC4R, and on mutant receptors in HEK 293T cells.

There are two naturally occurring isoforms of FVa, FVa1 and FVa2. These two isoforms differ by a 3-kDa polysaccharide chain (at Asn2181 in human FVa1 (Kim, S. W., Ortel, T. L., Quinn-Allen, M.

At concentrations well below its critical micelle concentration, C6PS binding to bovine FVa2 enhanced its affinity for FXa in solution by nearly 3 orders of magnitude (Kdeff = 40–2 nm over a C6PS range of 30–400 μm) but had no effect on the affinity of FVa1for FXa (Kd = 1 μm). This results in a soluble complex between FXa and FVa2, whose expected molecular weight was confirmed by calibrated native gel electrophoresis. This complex behaved as a normal Michaelis-Menten enzyme in its ability to produce thrombin from meizothrombin (apparentkcat/Km ≅ 109m−1 s−1).

This activation requires assembly of an enzyme complex, called prothrombinase (1Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which consists of blood coagulation factors Xa (a serine protease) and Va (a cofactor), Ca2+, and membranous vesicles derived from stimulated platelets (2Sandberg H.

PS is asymmetrically distributed to the cytoplasmic surface of resting platelet membranes (6Schick P.K. Kurica K.B. Chacko G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 57: 1221-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but is exposed when human platelets are activated (7Comfurius P. Senden J.M. Tilly R.H. Schroit A.J. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.

It has become clear only very recently that PS regulates the structure and function of factors Xa and Va(8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R.

Here we explore further the extent of this regulation. Factor V exists in plasma as an inactive, single chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 330 kDa. The active form of factor V, FVa, has a central domain removed to yield a heterodimer composed of two chains, a heavy chain (Mr= 94,000 in the bovine species; 105,000 in human) and a heterogeneous light chain (Mr = 74,000 in FVa1 or 71,000 in FVa2). The heavy and light chains form a tight complex in the presence of a calcium ion (11Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heterogeneity in the light chain is seen in both the bovine and human molecules. In the human form, it appears to arise from glycosylation of Asn2181 at the C-terminal end of the light chain (12Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Yoo L. Worfolk L. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11448-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Prothrombinase complexes assembled from the two molecular species derived from human plasma are observed to have somewhat different cofactor activities (13Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Christella M. Thomassen L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Koppaka V. Talbot W.F. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2638-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to substantially different affinities for binding to membranes (13Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Christella M. Thomassen L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21130-21136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our lab has reported that the two forms of both bovine and human FVa bind to membranes with only ∼3-fold different affinities (12Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Yoo L. Worfolk L. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11448-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Koppaka V. Talbot W.F. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2638-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This suggests that differences in the ability to support prothrombinase activity must reflect either different binding between factors FXa and FVa1versusFVa2 or different intrinsic activities of the FXa·FVa1 and FXa·FVa2 complexes. Although our results have favored the former possibility (14Koppaka V. Talbot W.F. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2638-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to prove this unambiguously because it is difficult to measure precisely the interaction between FXa and FVa on a membrane surface (15Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of FVa in a reaction mixture is critical to obtaining a maximal and physiologically significant rate of prothrombin activation (1Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, intense effort has been devoted to discerning the role of this cofactor in thrombin generation. The picture that emerges is that factor Va binds tightly to acidic lipid membranes (Kd ≈2 nm) (16Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then tightly binds factor Xa already bound to that surface (Kd ≈1 nm) (15Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it effectively an anchor to assemble the prothrombinase at the low concentrations of factor Xa and membranes expected to be found in vivo (17Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Hemker H.C. Tans G. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3331-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because the interaction between factors Va and Xa in solution is much weaker (Kd ≈1–3 μm) (18Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) than that reported on a membrane (15Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been speculated that either the membrane alters these two proteins so as to enhance their interaction or the presence of both proteins in the reduced dimensionality of the membrane surface leads to tighter association than would be seen in three dimensions (15Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the difficulty of assessing interactions between proteins on a membrane surface makes it hard to distinguish between these two possibilities. We have shown previously that a soluble form of PS, C6PS, binds to and FXa (8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Binding is accompanied by conformational changes in FXa that alter protein function (8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).2 Four C6PS molecules also bind to bovine FVa to induce conformational and functional changes (10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We present here compelling evidence that PS binding to these two proteins regulates their assembly into an active complex and thus regulates the functioning of the prothrombinase complex. In doing so, we answer five questions. First, do the two isoforms of factor Va (FVa1 or FVa2) form complexes of different affinities with FXa? Second, does soluble C6PS bind with similar affinities to these two isoforms? Third, does C6PS binding alter the affinities of the complexes between the two FVa isoforms and factor FXa? Fourth, can differential binding of the two FVa isoforms to FXa account for the apparently different cofactor activities of these two isoforms? Fifth, if C6PS induces tight association between FVa and FXain solution, is this sufficient to trigger formation of a prothrombinase complex in solution? If so, our ability to study the structure and function of this critical enzyme complex would be dramatically enhanced. Ecarin from Echis carinatus snake venom, heparin, and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. Dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA) was obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). The FXa as well as the IIa-specific substrates S-2765 and S-2238 were purchased from AB Kabi Diagnostica (Molndal, Sweden). The sodium salt of 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (C6PS) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). [5-(Dimethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonyl]glutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-CK) was purchased from Calbiochem. C6PS stock solutions, bovine FVa, FVa1, and FVa2 were prepared as reported previously (8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5460-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The final purity of the proteins was ascertained by SDS-PAGE to be greater than 90%. DEGR-Xawas prepared by sequential addition of 5-μl aliquots of DEGR-CK (1 mg/ml in 0.02 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5) to 1 ml of about 17 μm purified factor Xa until complete loss of enzymatic activity, as monitored by the S-2765 assay (20Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). DEGR-Xa was then dialyzed against 50 mmTris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, to remove free reagent (21Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DEGR-Xa was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized under UV light. Bovine MzIIa was generated with E. carinatus venom linked to Affi-Gel active ester-agarose (Bio-Rad) as described previously (22Wu J.R. Zhou C. Majumder R. Powers D.D. Weinreb G. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The diameters of C6PS aggregates were measured by quasi-elastic light scattering (8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Changes in the fluorescence intensity of DEGR-Xa in response to FVaaddition were measured at 37 °C using a SLM 48000TMspectrofluorometer (Spectronic Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY). Slits (8 × 8 and 4 × 4 nm for excitation and emission) were closed between measurements to avoid photo-degradation of the sample. Buffer solutions were filtered using 0.2-μm filters (Nalge Co., Rochester, NY). A stirred microcuvette (Hellma Cells, Jamaica, NY) was initially charged with a solution of 1 nmDEGR-Xa and 5/50 nmFVa1/FVa2 and then rinsed with buffer. This procedure prevented the formation of aggregates on the cuvette walls. To 0.95 ml of DEGR-Xa solution (1 nmDEGR-Xa in 30, 60, and 400 μm C6PS, 50 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mmCa2+, pH 7.5), FVa1 or FVa2 were added from stock solutions with 4 min of equilibration, and fluorescence intensity was recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 550 nm. Several intensity readings were averaged after each addition, and corrected, via controls, for dilution, buffer background, and any small amount of photobleaching. Changes in FVa1/FVa2 intrinsic fluorescence in response to C6PS was measured similarly, except that samples were excited at 295 nm (slits: 8 nm), and emission was recorded at 345 nm (slits: 8 nm). Rates of thrombin formation from MzIIa or of thrombin plus MzIIa formation from prothrombin at 37 °C were estimated from time-dependent changes in the fluorescence of DAPA, an active site inhibitor of the activation products (1Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow measurements were performed on the SLM 48000TMspectrofluorometer with 280 nm excitation (4-nm slits) and a 515-nm cut off filter and 8-nm slits in the emission path. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing equal volumes (200 μl) of the contents of the two driving syringes of a SLM-Aminco MilliflowTMstopped-flow reactor. Syringe A contained substrate solution and DAPA in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, and syringe B contained a mixture of factors Xa and Va and C6PS pre-equilibrated 37 °C for 2–3 min in the same buffer. The final concentration of FXa in the reaction chamber was always maintained as 1 nm, and the concentrations of FVa and C6PS were varied. The substrate/DAPA ratio was 1:5. The initial fluorescence intensity (F0) was obtained from mixing experiments with substrate and DAPA in syringe A and only lipid in syringe B. All fluorescence intensities were corrected for background light scattering. Fluorescence intensity at the completion of the reaction (F∞) reflected complete conversion of a given substrate to thrombin. The initial rate of thrombin generation was then determined from the initial rate of fluorescence change (5–10% completion) normalized to the intensity at completion times the concentration of substrate in the reaction mixture (23Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were prepared at five different percentages of cross-linking (5, 6, 6.5, 7, and 8% total acrylamide with bisacrylamide/acrylamide being 1:29 in all cases). A mixture of 1 nm factor Xa and 1 nm factor Va was incubated at 37 °C for 2 min in the presence and absence of 400 μm C6PS, and these two samples were run together with known marker proteins (270 to 14.2 kDa; Sigma) on these five gels in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean IITM minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad) and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (24Mitra P. Pal A.K. Basu D. Hati R.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Factor Xa and factor Va, at these same concentrations and in the presence of 400 μm C6PS, were run separately as controls.Rf values in each gel were measured relative to tracking dye. For each protein, a plot of log(Rf × 100) against the percent gel concentration gave a straight line, the negative slope of which is the retardation coefficient (25Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). A log-log plot of the retardation coefficient against the molecular weights of the marker proteins produced a linear curve from which the molecular weight of the FVa·FXa complex was determined (26Bryan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). There were two approaches to data analysis. The first recognized that FXaand FVa bind two and four C6PS molecules, respectively, and that their interaction with each other will depend on how many sites are occupied in each protein. This approach, described under the “” in its simplest form, requires knowledge of the mechanisms of C6PS binding to the two proteins as well as adjustment of the values of some unknown parameters, but provides physical insight into our results if one is willing to accept some uncertainty in parameter values. Alternatively, one can simply acknowledge that the interaction between DEGR-Xa and FVa2 depends on C6PS but make no assumptions about the mechanistic details of this dependence. In this instance, several equilibria are replaced by a single effective DEGR-Xa + Va binding equilibrium with an apparent Kdeff that depends on C6PS concentration (Equation 1), DEGR­Xa+Va↔C6PSKdcffDEGR­Xa·Va(Eq. 1) The total concentration of DEGR-Xa·Vacomplex at any given C6PS concentration ([DEGR-Xa·Va](C6PS)) is then given by the familiar expression for two-species binding (Equation 2),[DEGR­Xa·Va](C6PS)=[DEGR­Xa]tot+[Va]tot+Kdcff−([DEGR­Xa]tot+[Va]tot+Kdeff)2−4[DEGR­Xa]tot[Va]tot2(Eq. 2) where the concentration terms all are “total” concentrations of each species in a reaction mixture. The change in fluorescence signal of DEGR-Xa was taken as proportional to the fraction of DEGR-Xa bound to FVa (Equation 3)F−F0FSAT−F0=[DEGR­Xa·Va](C6PS)[DEGR­Xa]tot(Eq. 3) where the fluorescence parameter F0 was fixed as the DEGR-Xa fluorescence before titration began and FSAT is the fluorescence at saturation, which was obtained along with Kdeff by regression of the data to Equations 2 and 3. The interaction between FXa and FVa1 or FVa2 was also detected by an increase in the rate of prothrombin activation. In this case, the same analysis was used except that the increase in initial rate of activation (V) and [Xa] replaced F and [DEGR-Xa] in Equation 3. The kinetics of MzIIaactivation were parameterized according to the normal Michaelis-Menten model (Equation 4),Vini=Vmax[MzIIa][MzIIa]+Km;Vmax=kcat×[Xa·Va](C6PS)(Eq. 4) where the enzyme concentration ([Xa·Va](C6PS)) was calculated using the Kdeff values and Equation 2 described above. In all cases, regression of data sets to these models was performed using SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Initial rates of FXa-catalyzed prothrombin activation (see “Methods”) were determined as a function of added soluble C6PS concentration (Fig.1). In the presence of 5 nmFVa2, the initial rate saturated at about 100 μm C6PS (squares), but for 50 nmFVa1 (higher concentration needed to record rates comparable with those seen with FVa2) the initial rate increased rapidly up to a value larger than seen for FVa2by 100 μm C6PS and then slowly increased well beyond this rate up to and beyond 400 μm PS (triangles). For 5 nm FVa (the natural mixture of these two isoforms), the initial rate saturated at about 100 μmC6PS (circles) at about 2/3 the rate seen with FVa2. Because FVa is roughly 2/3 FVa2, it seems that the cofactor activity of the natural mixture is dominated under our conditions by a complex containing the lighter FVa2 isoform. It is important to know whether the effects recorded in Fig. 1 are due to individual molecules of C6PS or to an aggregated form of this moderately soluble amphipath. We have characterized previously (8Koppaka V. Wang J. Banerjee M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7482-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the formation of C6PS micelles and have reported the CMC at 5 mm Ca2+ to be 950 μm in a similar buffer. However, both FXa2 and FVa (10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) lower the CMC of C6PS to >800 μm and 800–900 μm, respectively. Thus, we determined by QELS the mean size of any C6PS aggregate or micelle that might form under our experimental conditions (i.e. in the presence of 1 nm FXa and 5 nm FVa) at increasing C6PS concentrations (Fig. 1, inset). No aggregates could be detected below ∼650 μm C6PS, which is lower than the CMC in the presence of either FXa or FVa individually but also greater than the highest lipid concentration we have used in our experiments. C6PS and other short chain phospholipids bind to bovine FVa to induce conformational changes detected by intrinsic fluorescence changes and CD spectral changes (10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the effect of increasing C6PS concentration on the tryptophan region of FVa1 (circles) or FVa2(squares) intrinsic fluorescence. The observed decrease indicates that C6PS binds to both FVa1 and FVa2with similar affinities and structural responses. We assumed that the change in intrinsic fluorescence should be proportional to the fraction of protein bound and fitted the titration data using a model that assumed four identical and independent sites (10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have shown that there is a 3-fold difference in the affinity of both human (12Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Yoo L. Worfolk L. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11448-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and bovine (14Koppaka V. Talbot W.F. Zhai X. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2638-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) FVa1 and FVa2 for PS-containing membranes. Unlike their interactions with membranes, we conclude that bovine FVa1 and FVa2 bind to soluble C6PS with comparable affinities (11 ± 0.6 μm for FVa1 and 12 ± 0.7 μm for FVa2) and changes in intrinsic fluorescence. We determined the CMC of C6PS (Fig. 2, inset) under exactly the conditions used for our titration (0.33 μmFVa) to be ∼750 μm, which is consistent with what we have found elsewhere in the presence of FVa(10Zhai X. Srivastava A. Drummond D.C. Daleke D. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5675-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and far above the lipid concentrations used for our C6PS titrations of FVa1/FVa2. This confirms that the responses we have seen are to a molecular rather than aggregated form of C6PS. Fig.3 shows the increase in DEGR-Xa fluorescence with addition of FVa1(squares) or FVa2 (circles) in the absence of C6PS (open symbols). Both FVa1 and FVa2 bind similarly to DEGR-Xa in the absence of C6PS (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.07 μm for FVa2 and 1.3 ± 0.07 μm for FVa1). These Kd values are in essential agreement with those derived from prothrombin activation kinetics, fluorescence experiments (18Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), affinity chromatography studies (27Persson E. Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22531-22539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ultracentrifugation experiments (28Pryzdial E.L. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8969-8977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of 400 μm soluble PS (filled symbols) dramatically enhanced the interaction of FVa2 with FXa( Kdeff = 2.0 ± 0.02 nm; inset) but had little effect on the interaction of FXa with FVa1( Kdeff = 1.1 ± 0.07 μm). Thus, at least part of the different effects of C6PS on the activation of prothrombin by FXa in the presence of FVa2 or FVa1 (Fig. 1) reflects a dramatic difference in how C6PS influences the FVa2- or FVa1-enzyme interaction. Because the presence of C6PS influenced the interactions of FVa1 and FVa2with FXa so differently, we could not compare the cofactor activities of FVa1 and FVa2 under a common set of conditions. For this reason, initial rates of active site formation from prothrombin were monitored by DAPA fluorescence in the presence of 400 μm C6PS and are shown in Fig.4 and its inset on different cofactor concentration scales. The rate saturated upon addition of very low concentrations of FVa2 (inset) to yield an initial rate of catalysis by the FXa·FVa2complex of 100 ± 2 nm/s. However, the initial rate of prothrombin activation did not saturate with addition of FVa1 (circles), and an estimate of the rate catalyzed by the FXa·FVa1 complex had to be made from the hyperbolic fit shown by the solid line in Fig.4 (540 ± 5 nm/s). Just as for titration of DEGR-Xa fluorescence, the Kdeff of FVa2interaction with FXa obtained from these hyperbolic fits (2.8 ± 0.3 nm) was ∼350-fold smaller than that for FVa1 interaction with FXa (1.0 ± 0.15 μm). It seems from these results that FVa1 is the more effective cofactor but that it has limited ability to bind FXa in a PS-dependent fashion. This explains why the behavior of the FXa·FVa2 complex seemed to dominate the whole FVa experiment presented asopen circles in Fig. 1. Next, we titrated DEGR-Xa with FVa2 at fixed C6PS concentrations of 30, 60, 150, and 400 μm (circles, squares, triangles, and diamonds, respectively, in Fig.5). Each titration curve was fitted as described under “Experimental Procedures” to obtain effective dissociation constant, Kdeff, for the Xa·Va2 complex. This yielded the variation with C6PS concentration of Kdeff shown in theinset in Fig. 5 as well as fluorescence parameters (F0 and FSAT, Equation 3) characterizing the complexes at different C6PS concentrations (not recorded in Fig. 5). Note that Kdeff obtained in this way is not related to the Kd of interaction between FXa and FVa in solution that is known to be ∼1–3 μm (18Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is an effective Kd of interaction between DEGR-Xa and FVa in which all C6PS-bound species of DEGR-Xaand FVa2 are in equilibrium with all possible C6PS-bound complex species (DEGR-FXa·FVa·C6PS) (see Equation 1 and “”). Because the species present in this equilibrium vary with C6PS concentration, Kdeff also varies with C6PS concentration. Native PAGE was performed with FXa/FVa2 samples in the presence and absence of 400 μm C6PS (see “Methods”). The inset to Fig. 6 shows one such gel. FXa and FVa2 samples in the presence of C6PS were also run as controls. A log-log plot of the retardation coefficient against the molecular weights of the marker proteins (circles), FXa (inverted triangle), or FVa2 (4-pointed open star) in the absence of C6PS, and of the FXa·FVa2 complex (5-pointed star) in the presence of C6PS is shown in Fig. 6. From this, we estimated the molecular mass of the complex in the presence of C6PS as 217 ± 2.5 kDa. In the absence of C6PS, no complex appeared (Fig. 6, inset, lane 1), and the measured molecular masses were 45.5 ± 1.0 and 167 ± 2 kDa for FXa and FVa2, respectively. These compare with literature values of 46 kDa (29Fujikawa K. Coan M.H. Legaz M.E. Davie E.W.

Dysfunction in mAChR signaling has been implicated in brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia (4Eisenach J.C.

Upon agonist binding, GPCRs bind and activate heterotrimeric G-proteins, which in turn activate various downstream targets. There are two distinct, well characterized G-protein signaling pathways activated by the five mAChR subtypes. M1, M3, and M5 couple to Gq, which stimulates phospholipase C-β, and thus releases calcium from intracellular stores and activates protein kinase C (7Lechleiter J. Hellmiss R. Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Peralta E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,8Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). These subtypes are expressed throughout the brain, and, in some brain regions, multiple subtypes are expressed in individual neurons (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity of physiological effects and the overlapping expression pattern of the muscarinic receptor subtypes suggest that there are signaling pathways initiated by the mAChRs independent of these two heterotrimeric G-protein pathways. Signaling pathways independent of heterotrimeric G-proteins have been reported throughout the GPCR superfamily (11Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 12Milligan G. White J.H. Trends Pharmacol.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting this hypothesis stems from the identification of novel binding partners of GPCRs other than the traditional heterotrimeric G-proteins. Within the muscarinic family in particular, there is an especially large body of evidence to suggest the existence of nontraditional signaling pathways. There are many reports of G-protein-independent regulation of ion channels by mAChRs (15Olesen S.P. Davies P.F. Clapham D.E. Circ.

Moreover, the M3 mAChR has been found to associate with ADP ribosylation factor and Rho in an agonist-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of ADP ribosylation factor and Rho abolished muscarinic activation of phospholipase D, whereas inhibition of heterotrimeric G-proteins had no effect on the activation of phospholipase D (19Mitchell R. McCulloch D. Lutz E. Johnson M. MacKenzie C. Fennell M. Fink G. Zhou W. Sealfon S.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of mAChRs, it is likely that other signaling pathways remain to be discovered. We set out to identify novel binding partners of the mAChR subtypes to further elucidate the molecular events involved in mAChR signaling in the central nervous system. GPCRs consist of seven transmembrane domains connected by three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops. The intracellular third (i3) loop connecting the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains is an important signaling structure in the GPCR superfamily providing key sites of interactions with the heterotrimeric G-proteins, G-protein receptor kinases, and arrestins (20Wu G.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233PubMed Google Scholar). The i3 loops of the mAChR are some of the largest in the GPCR superfamily (156–239 amino acids) and contain no homology between the mAChR subtypes except for ∼20 amino acids at the N and C termini. We used the most divergent portion of the i3 loops as bait to affinity isolate and identify brain proteins that are novel binding partners of the mAChR subtypes. We have found a novel interaction between the M4 mAChR and elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) both in vitro and in cells with endogenous proteins. eEF1A is a GTP-binding protein that is essential in protein synthesis mediating the binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome. The eEF1A2 isoform is only expressed in skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and brain in adult mammals (23Knudsen S.M. Frydenberg J. Clark B.F. Leffers H. Eur. J.

We demonstrate that M4 regulates the guanine nucleotide binding of eEF1A2, which has the potential to affect the role of eEF1A2 role in translation or other cellular processes. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Segments of the human muscarinic receptor genes of M1, M2, and M4corresponding to the most divergent portions of the intracellular third (i3) loop (126, 135, and 152 amino acids, respectively) were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX2T as previously described (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human eEF1A2 and eEF1Bα were subcloned into the pET30a vector. The mAChR glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (M1i3-GST, M2i3-GST, and M4i3-GST) were induced and purified following the protocol as previously described except for the following modifications (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial cultures were induced for 2 h with 500 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. One-liter cultures were pelleted, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of harvest buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 mm EDTA) with 1 mm lysozyme. The pellets then were frozen at −80 °C overnight. The samples were thawed and sonicated to remove any aggregated material. The solubilized proteins were obtained by two rounds of centrifugation each for 20 min at 15,000 × gat 4 °C. The fusion proteins were incubated with the glutathione-linked agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and then washed five times with harvest buffer for purification. Soluble protein from 1 liter of bacteria was incubated with 100 mg of glutathione-agarose beads. eEF1Bα-His and eEF1A2-His were induced following the protocol for the GST fusion proteins except for the following modifications. eEF1A2-His was induced overnight at room temperature with 30 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Harvest buffer did not contain EDTA, and 10% glycerol was added to the harvest buffer for eEF1A2. eEF1A2-His and eEF1Bα-His were purified according to the QIAexpress system (Qiagen) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). All fusion proteins were stored at −80 °C. One rat brain (Pel-Freez) was homogenized and incubated at 4 °C in 30 ml of harvest buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenate was centrifuged (15,000 ×g) twice at 4 °C, and then precleared twice with GST adsorbed to 100 mg of agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, mAChR i3 loop-GST fusion protein adsorbed to 100 mg of glutathione (GSH)-agarose beads was incubated with the 100 mg (6–10 mg/ml) of precleared brain homogenate for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed five times with 25 ml of harvest buffer. Finally, the beads were incubated with 2% SDS loading buffer for 15 min at 37 °C to elute adsorbed proteins from the bead matrix. Proteins were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Novex) and visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. GST, M2i3-GST, or M4i3-GST bound to 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 80 μg of eEF1A2 (0.8 μg/μl) for 1 h at 4 °C in an Eppendorf tube with harvest buffer (without EDTA) and 30 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin. The total volume of the reaction was 1 ml. The beads were pelleted at 1000 × g for 1min at 4 °C and washed three times with harvest buffer without EDTA. Finally, the beads were incubated with 2% SDS loading buffer for 15 min at 37 °C to elute adsorbed proteins from the bead matrix, and the proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. PC12 cells were maintained as previously described (24Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Muscarinic subtypes were immunoprecipitated from PC12 cells as previously described (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells were homogenized with the Brinkman Polytron 3000 tissue grinder in TE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C to isolate the membranes. The muscarinic receptors were solubilized at 1 mg/ml in TE containing 0.4% digitonin (Waco) and 0.08% cholate for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Each ml of solubilized material (1 mg/ml) was precleared with 50 μl of protein A beads at 4 °C overnight followed by preclearing for 6 h with 50 μl of protein A beads preincubated in normal rat serum (NRS). Immunoprecipitation reaction consisted of 750 μl of precleared soluble PC12 extract, 200 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin, and 5 μl of protein A beads preincubated overnight with M1 or M4 receptor crude rabbit antiserum. The immunoprecipitation was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. The protein A beads were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 min at 1000 ×g, and pellets were washed five times with 0.1% TEDC (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% digitonin (Waco), 0.02% cholic acid) with 150 mm NaCl. Finally, the beads were incubated with 2% SDS loading buffer for 15 min at 37 °C to elute adsorbed proteins from the beads, and the proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, 100 μmcarbachol (muscarinic agonist) or 10 μm atropine (muscarinic antagonist) were applied prior to the PC12 cells being harvested. Samples were prepared in 2% SDS, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were processed as previously described except for the following modifications (24Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal eEF1A antibody (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antibody to α subunit of calmodulin kinase II (α-CAMKII) (1:1000, Santa Cruz), or a mouse monoclonal GST antibody (1:5000, Bio-Rad). For some experiments, membranes were stripped by incubating them at 80 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS), and then washed to remove any stripping buffer with 0.2 m Tris-buffered saline before reprobing the membrane. Sprague-Dawley rats were sedated with sodium pentobarbital and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. 50-μm sections were cut on a Vibratome. Sections were stored at −20 °C in 30% sucrose and 30% ethylene glycol. All solutions were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The sections were rinsed in PBS and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. After rinsing, the sections were blocked in 5% normal horse serum and 10 μg/ml avidin for 60 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Primary antibody incubations were in buffer containing 1% normal horse serum, 50 μg/ml biotin, and 3 mm sodium azide. The primary antibodies used were M4 monoclonal (1:250) and eEF1A (1:1000). For double labeling, both primaries were incubated together. The sections were rinsed and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with donkey anti-goat rhodamine X (1:100, Jackson Immunoresearch) in secondary buffer (1% normal horse serum). The sections were rinsed and incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Jackson) in secondary buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The sections were rinsed and incubated in avidin-biotin complex (Vector) for 30 min, rinsed, and incubated in tyramide-fluorescein diluted in amplification diluent (1:100, PerkinElmer) for 10 min. The sections were rinsed and incubated for 30 min in 10 mm cupric sulfate in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, to eliminate autofluorescence. The sections were rinsed in PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting media for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories). Control incubations included omission of primary antibodies to test nonspecific secondary antibody binding and incubation with one primary but both secondary antibodies to demonstrate the absence of bleed-through and cross-labeling (data not shown). Sections were scanned using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope coupled to a Zeiss 100M Axiovert and a 63× Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens. Adobe Photoshop was used for final image preparation. eEF1A2-His was diluted in Buffer A (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 10% glycerol), and other fusion proteins were diluted in Buffer A without glycerol. MantGDP (Molecular Probes) was diluted in nucleotide buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdiothiothreitol), and unlabeled nucleotides were diluted in deionized water. Experiments were performed on 96-well black plates (Costar) on ice, and the total volume per well was 200 μl. For each experiment, one set of wells contained mantGDP plus buffer A (background) and a parallel set of wells contained mantGDP plus eEF1A2-His. Fluorescence was determined by subtracting these two sets of wells. In experiments using additional fusion proteins and unlabeled nucleotides, the background well contained mantGDP plus these additions. The plates were read at room temperature with the Fmax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using the SOFTmax program. The plates were excited at 355 nm and read at 460 nm. Fluorescence(F)=F[mantGDP+eEF1A2+(variables)]−F[mantGDP+(variables)]Equation 1 To identify binding partners of the mAChRs, we used a pull-down assay that has been used to identify binding partners of other GPCRs (20Wu G.

GST fusion proteins of the i3 loop, excluding the conserved N and C termini, of the M1, M2, and M4 subtypes (M1i3-GST, M2i3-GST, and M4i3-GST, respectively) were expressed individually in bacteria and purified by binding to glutathione-agarose beads. Each fusion protein-bead mixture was individually incubated in brain homogenate. After the beads were collected and washed, the bound proteins were eluted and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then Coomassie Blue staining was used to identify proteins interacting with the mAChR i3 loops. A band at ∼52 kDa was visualized in the brain pull-downs using the M4i3-GST (Fig.1 A). This band was not a bacterial protein from the purification of the M4i3-GST, because it was only present when the M4i3-GST was incubated with the brain extract. The 52-kDa band interacted selectively with the M4i3-GST, as it was not detected with the pull-down assays using M1i3-GST, M2i3-GST, or GST alone. Similar results were obtained in multiple independent pull-down experiments. To identify the 52-kDa protein, the band was sequenced after purification from brain using M4i3-GST pull-down assay, in-gel tryptic digestion, and fractionation by RP-HPLC. Four peptides were recovered and sequenced by Edman degradation at the Microchemical Facility at the Emory University. A PROWL search of the rodent SWISS-PRO data base with the recovered peptides showed three of them to be within the sequence of protein eEF1A2 (Fig. 1 B) and the fourth to be within α-CAMK-II. Both proteins have approximate molecular masses of 52 kDa. To verify the sequencing results using independent methods, we probed the M4i3-GST brain pull-down with α-CAMKII and eEF1A2 antibodies. The specificity of the interaction was assessed using the M2i3-GST, because this is the most closely related subtype to M4, and it shares coupling preferences to the Gi/o proteins. All the pull-downs including GST alone contained immunoreactivity with the α-CAMKII antibody (data not shown), suggesting this was a nonspecific interaction with GST or agarose beads. In contrast, only the M4i3-GST brain pull-down showed a 52-kDa band that was immunoreactive with the eEF1A2 antibody (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with our initial brain pull-downs, there was no detectable eEF1A2 immunoreactivity present in the M2i3-GST and GST brain pull-downs, even with excess levels of M2i3-GST and GST. Hence, these results confirm that endogenous eEF1A2 selectively interacts with the M4i3 loop. The results of the brain pull-down assay are consistent with either a direct interaction between M4i3 loop and eEF1A2 or an indirect interaction involving other brain proteins. To determine whether the M4i3 loop and eEF1A2 directly interact, we performed an in vitro binding assay using purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 2 B). Recombinant eEF1A2 tagged with six histidines (eEF1A2-His) was individually incubated with M4i3-GST, M2i3-GST, or GST alone adsorbed to glutathione beads. The GST fusion proteins were collected and washed, and the eluted protein was analyzed by Western blot. eEF1A2 immunoreactivity was detected in the M4i3-GST eluates, but not in eluates using M2i3-GST or GST (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the M4i3 loop and eEF1A2 are capable of binding directly without the presence of other proteins. Moreover, post-translational modifications are probably not required for the interaction, because the recombinant proteins are unlikely to be post-translationally modified to the same extent in bacteria as they are in mammalian cells. To begin to assess the biological relevance of this interaction, we sought to determine whether there is an interaction between the endogenous M4 mAChR and eEF1A2 proteins in cells. First, we used immunohistochemistry to determine whether M4 and eEF1A2 colocalize in the same neuronal population. We examined the rat striatum, where M4 is expressed in a subset of medium spiny neurons (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports using immunohistochemistry in mouse brain (27Khalyfa A. Bourbeau D. Chen E. Petroulakis E. Pan J. Xu S. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), eEF1A2 expression was found throughout the striatum (Fig. 3). Colocalization studies revealed that M4 was expressed in a subset of eEF1A2-expressing cells. Both proteins were localized principally in the cell bodies, with no significant immunoreactivity in the nuclei. Colocalization of the proteins was also detected in dendrites, where M4 is highly localized at postsynaptic sites, and where eEF1A is also expressed (28Walsh M.J. Kuruc N. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Hersch S.M. Gutekunst C.A. Rees H.D. Heilman C.J. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3351-3363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All neurons expressing M4 also expressed eEF1A2. Thus, a population of neurons in the striatum has overlapping expression patterns of M4 and eEF1A2 that would provide an opportunity for this interaction to occur in vivo. We also evaluated the neurotypic PC12 cell line for colocalization of the endogenous proteins in a simpler system more amenable to biochemical analysis. As in the striatum, the proteins were colocalized in the PC12 cells using immunocytochemistry (data not shown). M4 distribution was primarily at the cell surface in unstimulated cells and intracellular in a discrete punctae in agonist-treated cells as previously described (30Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). eEF1A2 immunoreactivity was found throughout the cell including at the plasma membrane, but no immunoreactivity was found in the nucleus. This staining pattern is similar as been reported in cultured human fibroblast cells using a different eEF1A antibody (37Sanders J. Brandsma M. Janssen G.M. Dijk J. Moller W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests there are numerous sites in intact PC12 cells where M4 and eEF1A2 could interact. To determine whether these two endogenous proteins physically interact in PC12 cells, we performed immunoprecipitations. The cells also express the M1 mAChR, which was used as a control. The mAChR proteins were solubilized, and the receptor subtypes selectively immunoprecipitated with either M1 rabbit antiserum, M4 rabbit antiserum, or NRS as previously described (10Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One set of immunoprecipitates was radiolabeled with the muscarinic antagonist N-[3H]methylscopalomine, confirming the presence of the mAChR (data not shown). A parallel set of immunoprecipitates was analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of eEF1A2 immunoreactivity. eEF1A2 co-immunoprecipitated with M4, but was not found in the immunoprecipitates of M1 or NRS (Fig. 4). Application of 100 μm carbachol (muscarinic agonist) or 10 μm atropine (muscarinic antagonist) at various time points (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 180 min) to the PC12 cells had no effect on the ability of M4 to co-immunoprecipitate eEF1A2. These findings indicate that an interaction exists between endogenous M4 and eEF1A2 in PC12 cells. To gain insight into the physiological relevance of this novel interaction, we explored the possibility that M4regulates eEF1A2 function. Upon activation, the mAChR i3 loop activates heterotrimeric G-proteins by acting as a guanine exchange factor (GEF), which stimulates the release of GDP allowing GTP to bind (31Richardson R.M. Mayanil C.S. Hosey M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 908-914PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Koppen C.J. Sell A. Lenz W. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, we hypothesized that M4 may activate eEF1A2 similarly by regulating the nucleotide exchange rate of eEF1A2. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of the M4i3 loop on the rate of GDP release using the fluorescence GDP analog mantGDP. The binding of mantGDP to a GTP-binding protein results in a change in fluorescence of the mant fluorophore. eEF1A2, unlike other GTP-binding proteins, has a very low affinity (0.01–3 μm) for guanine nucleotides (33Edmonds B.T. Bell A. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Leyh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10288-10295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An advantage of mantGDP over radioligand binding assays is that it is performed in solution, and there is no need to separate bound and free ligand, which allows the detection of low affinity interactions. First, we determined that eEF1A2-His was capable of binding guanine nucleotides. Increasing eEF1A2-His concentrations increased the fluorescence emitted by mantGDP (Fig.5 A). In contrast, increasing concentrations of other proteins, such as GST, did not produce significant changes in the fluorescence of mantGDP, indicating the increase in fluorescence induced by eEF1A2-His was specific. To confirm the specificity of nucleotide binding to eEF1A2-His, we preincubated eEF1A2-His with excess unlabeled GDP or unlabeled ATP. Because eEF1A2 is a guanine nucleotide binding protein, the mantGDP binding should be sensitive to excess unlabeled GDP and not to excess ATP. As expected, excess GDP quenched the increased mantGDP fluorescence induced by eEF1A2, whereas ATP had no effect (Fig. 5 B). Similar to experiments reported with the endogenous protein (34Negrutskii B.S. El'skaya A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 47-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 35Crechet J.B. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), eEF1A2-His requires glycerol for maximum nucleotide binding (data not shown). Hence, these experiments validate that eEF1A2-His binds guanine nucleotides similarly to the endogenous protein and validate the mantGDP assay for monitoring the effects of protein interactions on eEF1A2 nucleotide exchange. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the M4i3 loop behaves as a GEF for eEF1A2 by promoting the release of mantGDP from eEF1A2. We measured the release of mantGDP from eEF1A2-His by the decrease in fluorescence upon the addition"

This accumulation has been attributed to decreased VLCFA β-oxidation and peroxisomal very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) activity. The X-ALD gene, ABCD1, encodes a peroxisomal membrane ATP binding cassette transporter, ALDP, that is hypothesized to affect VLCS activity in peroxisomes by direct interaction with the VLCS enzyme. Recently, a VLCS gene that encodes a protein with significant sequence identity to known rat and human peroxisomal VLCS protein has been identified in mice. We find that the mouse VLCS gene (Vlcs) encodes an enzyme (Vlcs) with VLCS activity that localizes to peroxisomes and is expressed in X-ALD target tissues. We show that the expression of Vlcsin the peroxisomes of X-ALD mouse fibroblasts improves VLCFA β-oxidation in these cells, implying a role for this enzyme in the biochemical abnormality of X-ALD. X-ALD mice, which accumulate VLCFA in tissues, show no change in the expression of Vlcs, the subcellular localization of Vlcs, or general peroxisomal VLCS activity. These observations imply that ALDP is not necessary for the proper expression or localization of Vlcs protein, and the control of VLCFA levels does not depend on the direct interaction of Vlcs and ALDP.

Clinically, it affects the cerebral white matter, peripheral nerves, adrenal cortex, and testis. Mutations in the X-ALD gene,ABCD1, result in several phenotypic variants that vary in onset age, disease progress rate, and primary affected tissue.

ALDP has been grouped with the ABC protein superfamily on the basis of sequence homology, although its molecular function has not been established. All male X-ALD patients and the majority of X-ALD female carriers accumulate straight chain saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; 24 or more carbons) in their plasma and tissues. This accumulation is associated with decreased VLCFA degradation by peroxisomal β-oxidation as observed in patient fibroblasts.

All of these enzymes have been localized to both peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum, sites of VLCS activity in the cell, and shown to have VLCS activity as well as the ability to activate long chain fatty acids.

Our goal in this study is to investigate the functional and physical interactions of Vlcs and ALDP on the biochemical hallmark of X-ALD. We show that Vlcs is a reasonable candidate for the enzyme affected in X-ALD. It is the mouse gene most homologous to rat and humanVLCS, it encodes an enzyme with VLCS and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LCS) activity, and Vlcs protein can be found in peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum. The overexpression of Vlcsimproves the β-oxidation defect in mouse X-ALD fibroblasts when targeted to peroxisomes. Our investigation of Vlcsexpression, Vlcs localization, and peroxisomal VLCS activity in the X-ALD mouse demonstrates no differences from wild type. We conclude that ALDP is not necessary for maintaining peroxisomal VLCS activity in tissues and that ALDP and Vlcs do not physically or functionally interact to affect VLCFA accumulation. Wild type 129Svev mice were obtained from Taconic, Inc. (Germantown, NY) or bred from Taconic 129Svev stock in the animal facility at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. X-ALD mice are from the strain derived by Lu et al. (15Lu J.F. Lawler A.M. Watkins P.A. Powers J.M. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9366-9371Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and have been maintained at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions since their generation. All animals were housed under the same controlled conditions, between 22 and 27 °C, on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines that are in compliance with national and international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/609, OJ L 358, 1 DEC.12,1987; NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U. S. National Research Council, 1996). The peptide sequence of rat VLCS (22Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used to search the EST data base for homologous mouse ESTs. A mouse EST was identified, GenBankTM accession number AA038113, and obtained from Incyte Genomics (Palo Alto, CA). The EST clone contained 921 base pairs of open reading frame and eight nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated region. This EST clone insert was removed from its vector with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the same sites of the multiple cloning site of the mammalian cloning vector pcDNA3. The 5′-untranslated region of rat VLCS (17Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used to design a forward PCR primer, 5′-CGCGGGTACCGATCTCACCTGACCCCAGACG, with an engineered KpnI site (underlined), and this was used in an RT-PCR reaction to amplify the remaining 5′-end of Vlcs from liver total cDNA with a reverse primer, Vlcs R1096, 5′-tgccttcagtggatgcgtagaac-3′. The ∼1100-bp PCR product encompassed a second naturally occurring KpnI site near its 3′-end. TheKpnI sites in the PCR product were used to clone the PCR fragment into a KpnI site near the 5′-end of EST AA038113now in pcDNA3. The integrity of the final clone was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, and the full-length open reading frame ofVlcs was deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF033031). Probes for Vlcs and β-actin were generated by random primer labeling of cDNA with [α-32P]dCTP (23Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). The entire cDNA was released from its vector by restriction digestion and gel-purified. This fragment was labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Rediprime Random Prime Labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated nucleotide on a Sephadex G-50 column, and incorporation of dCTP was quantitated using a Beckman LS3801 liquid scintillation counter. Probes were heated to 100 °C for 5 min, quickly cooled on ice, and held for 5 min at 4 °C before using. A multiple tissue Northern blot of mouse mRNA samples (BD Biosciences CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was prehybridized in 15 ml of Rapid hyb buffer (AmershamBiosciences) for at least 30 min in a hybridization oven at 68 °C. Two × 106 counts/min of probe were used per ml of hybridization buffer, and the blot was hybridized at 68 °C for 3 h. The blot was washed twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C and exposed to film for 1 h to overnight on Eastman Kodak Co. AR film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The blot was probed sequentially and between hybridizations was stripped with boiling 0.1% SDS for 30 min and reexposed to film to confirm loss of signal. Total RNA prepared from wild type mouse tissues was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. Superscript II RT kit from Invitrogen was used with oligo(dT) primers for 1 h at 42 °C in a 25-μl reaction with 5 μg of RNA. Two μl of this cDNA was used in a 50-μl PCR for Vlcs or for β-actin. PCR primers used were Vlcs forward (5′-ATGCTGGAGGAAAGACCCAGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CACGCCATACACATTCACTTCTTC-3′) (233-bp product) and β-actin forward (5′-TTTGAGACCTTCAACACCCCAG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTTCATGGATGCCACAGGA-3′) (460-bp product). All cells were manipulated under sterile conditions and grown at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The X-ALD mouse fibroblast line 140 was described previously (15Lu J.F. Lawler A.M. Watkins P.A. Powers J.M. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9366-9371Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). X-ALD mouse fibroblasts (line 140) were cultured in 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from 12.5–14.5 days postcoitus X-ALD embryos (24Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). COS-1 cells (gift of C. Thompson) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells harvested for enzyme assays or transfection were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or Hanks' buffered salt solution, incubated with 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C, harvested in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and pelleted. Cell pellets for enzyme assays were washed twice with PBS or Hanks' buffered salt solution. Adult X-ALD mouse skin fibroblasts (line 140) were transfected with either empty pcDNA3 or recombinant pcDNA3 vector containing human X-ALD cDNA (pSK2ALD) or Vlcs cDNA (pSKmVLCS). For transfection, cells from a T75 tissue culture flask were washed twice with PBS, harvested with trypsin, resuspended in 10 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM with 10 μg of purified plasmid DNA. Transfection was performed using a Cell Porator (Invitrogen) in a 4-mm cuvette at 350 V, 330 microfarads. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and replated in a T75 flask. The medium was refreshed the next day, and cells were assayed at day 3. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3, pSK2ALD, pSKmVLCS, or both pSK2ALD and pSKmVLCS together. For transfection, cells from two 80% confluent T150 flasks between passages 2 and 4 were washed twice with PBS, harvested with trypsin, resuspended in 10 ml of Opti-MEM, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM. Twenty micrograms of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA were added in less than 20 μl of TE buffer. Transfection was performed using an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX Electroporation Systems, San Diego, CA) in a 4-mm cuvette at 280 V, 1500 microfarads, 129 ohms. Cells were allowed to for recover 5–10 min at room temperature, plated in one T75 flask, and grown for 2 days before harvesting for analyses. COS-1 cells were transfected with pSKmVLCS, rat long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase in pcDNA3, or pcDNA3 alone. For transfection, cells from a confluent T75 flask were washed twice with PBS, harvested with trypsin, resuspended in 10 ml of Opti-MEM, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM. Ten micrograms of plasmid DNA in TE buffer were added to each pellet and electroporated using an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 in a 4-mm curette at 250 V, 1500 microfarads, and 129 ohms. The cells were then plated in a T75 flask and cultured for 3 days before assaying. Acyl-coenzyme A synthetase activity was measured by the method previously described (25Watkins P.A. Ferrell Jr., E.V. Pedersen J.I. Hoefler G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-1 cells were harvested 3 days post-transfection and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot of cells containing 100–200 μg of protein, measured via the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough J.N. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was added to a 250-μl reaction containing 20 μm[1-14C]palmitic acid (C16:0; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) or 20 μm[1-14C]lignoceric acid (C24:0; Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Water-soluble radiolabled products were quantitated and expressed as nmol of CoA derivative generated in 20 min per mg of protein. Duplicate assays were performed for each measurement, and the average value was reported. β-Oxidation activity was measured as previously described (27Hoefler G. Hoefler S. Watkins P.A. Chen W.W. Moser A. Baldwin V. McGillivary B. Charrow J. Friedman J.M. Rutledge L. Hashimoto T. Moser H.W. J. Pediatr. 1988; 112: 726-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Freshly harvested fibroblast cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and held on ice. The 250-μl reaction contained 100–200 μg of protein, 4 μm[1-14C]lignoceric acid, and 16 μm unlabeled lignoceric acid substrate. Duplicate reactions were measured for each sample, and activity was expressed as nmol of radiolabeled acetate produced/h/mg of protein. A fusion protein of maltose-binding protein and the C-terminal 214 amino acids of Vlcs was created using a bacterial expression vector containing maltose-binding protein cDNA (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and mouse Vlcs cDNA. Protein synthesis was induced in BL21 DE3 Escherichia coli by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. E. coli protein extracts were solubilized in 0.4 mm NaCl, purified over a maltose column, and concentrated to 1 mg/ml. One hundred micrograms of this concentrate was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and inoculated into New Zealand White rabbits. A 50-μg boost was given at 2, 3, and 7 weeks. Serum from week 8 was affinity-purified against a glutathione S-transferase (Promega, Madison, WI) Vlcs fusion protein, in which the C-terminal 263 amino acids of Vlcs are fused to glutathione S-transferase. The purified sera were concentrated and used at 1:200 dilution for immunofluorescence studies and 1:500 dilution for Western blot analyses. Frozen mouse tissues were disassociated in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in cold PBS with protease inhibitors (Complete inhibitor tablets; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.1 m EDTA. A 5-min centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C removed insoluble material, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was estimated using the method of Lowry (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough J.N. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were diluted to 60 mg of protein/ml and combined with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for a final concentration of 30 mg protein/ml. Samples were boiled for 3 min and cooled on ice, and 750 μg of protein were loaded per lane on an SDS-8% PAGE gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.) in Tris/glycine/methanol transfer buffer for 2 h at 20 amps at room temperature. Proteins were affixed to the membrane by air drying for 15 min after a 30-s soak in methanol. Nonspecific proteins were blocked by presoaking in a solution of 5% dry milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was briefly washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) and incubated with primary antibody to the target antigen diluted in 0.01% bovine serum albumin in PBST and 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted from 1:100 to 1:1000. Rabbit IgG anti-human PEX14 antibodies were a generous gift from S. Gould and were used at a 1:100 dilution to detect mouse Pex14 protein in peroxisomal membranes (28Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Rabbit IgG anti-mouse Vlcs antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution. The blot was washed three times with PBST buffer, and a 1:3000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was incubated with the blot for 30 min at room temperature to detect attached primary antibodies. The blot was washed again three times with PBST before being developed with chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak AR film for 1–60 s to visualize Pex14 and Vlcs proteins. Several aliquots (50 μl) were taken from a 10-ml cell suspension prior to β-oxidation assays, replated onto sterile 1.8-cm glass coverslips, and cultured until they reattached (12–24 h). The coverslips were then removed from medium and washed three times in PBS buffer. Cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and rinsed three times with PBS. Fixed cells were either stored in cold PBS with 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C for 24 h or processed immediately. Fixed cells were made permeable with a solution of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and rinsed in PBS three times. Cells were incubated with two primary antibodies, one for Vlcs and one for ALDP, diluted 1:200 in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature in a humid container to minimize evaporation. The primary antibodies used in this method were rabbit anti-mouse Vlcs (19Steinberg S.J. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T. Watkins P.A. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or rabbit anti-human VLCS (29Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), mouse anti-human ALDP (MA2126, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or rabbit anti-human ALDP (30Watkins P.A. Gould S.J. Smith M.A. Braiterman L.T. Wei H.M. Kok F. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Smith K.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 292-301PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with primary antibody, cells were washed five times in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) to detect primary antibody bound to antigen. Cells were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in PBS for 20 min in a humid, darkened chamber. Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-mouse labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) or rhodamine (red). Coverslips were washed five times in PBS and mounted in a glycerol-based mounting medium, and the cells were photographed with an Axiovision digital camera at 1–10-s exposures with fluorescent light of the appropriate wavelength to excite the secondary antibody label. Control coverslips were processed without each primary antibody as controls. Linear 35-ml Nycodenz gradients (15–40%) were prepared from 15% (w/v) Nycodenz in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA (SME buffer) and 40% (w/v) Nycodenz in MOPS and EDTA only. Gradients were stored overnight undisturbed at 4 °C. Freshly dissected mouse liver (8 weeks old) from male X-ALD or wild type mice were minced and homogenized with one stroke in a Potter-Elvejham loose pestle homogenizer in cold SME buffer, 10 volumes (ml) to liver weight (g). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s. Equal amounts of X-ALD and wild type supernatant (about 5 ml) were loaded on separate gradients and centrifuged at 29,700 rpm in a Beckman VTi 50 ultracentrifuge for 76 min at 4 °C. Two-milliliter fractions were collected starting from the bottom of the gradient, assayed for catalase activity, and stored at −80 °C for analysis by Western blot and enzyme assays. Fractions from Nycodenz gradients were diluted 1:100 in water, and 20- or 40-μl aliquots were assayed for catalase activity in a reaction mixture of 200-μl total volume containing 20 mmimidazole, pH 6.8–7.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.06% hydrogen peroxide. To standardize the spectrophotometer, a blank control was prepared with no hydrogen peroxide, and a negative control was prepared with hydrogen peroxide and no sample. After exactly 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were stopped with 1 ml of stop solution (0.45% TiOSO4, 2 nH2SO4), and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Catalase activity degrades the hydrogen peroxide in the reaction and prevents the formation of a yellow peroxide-Ti complex. Catalase activity is reported as the decrease in absorbance from that of the negative control. The murine very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase cDNA (Vlcs) encodes a 620-amino acid protein (Vlcs) with 93% identity to rat VLCS and 83% identity to human VLCS (Fig.1). The N-terminal 22 amino acid sequence of Vlcs is predicted to be an endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal sequence by analysis with the PSORT algorithm (31Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The C-terminal sequence (-LKL) of Vlcs resembles the canonical mammalian peroxisomal targeting signal 1 consensus sequence, -SKL, which functions as a peroxisomal targeting signal 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(32Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An AMP binding domain typical of enzymes that form an enzyme-AMP intermediate is predicted for amino acids 220–233, and a VLCS-specific motif (33Watkins P.A. Pevsner J. Steinberg S.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 323-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is present between residues 476 and 499 (Fig. 1). To determine whether Vlcs encodes an enzyme with fatty acid acyl-CoA synthetase activity, VlcscDNA was expressed in COS-1 cells, and these cells were assayed for increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity toward a representative very long-chain fatty acid, lignoceric acid (C24:0), and long- chain fatty acid, palmitic acid (C16:0) (Fig. 2). As a control, rat acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (rACS-1) (34Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Gould S.J. Avigan J. Mihalik S.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2288-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA was expressed in COS-1 cells and assayed for activity. Rat ACS-1 has LCS activity but not VLCS activity. As expected, rat ACS-1-expressing COS-1 cells increased their LCS but not VLCS activity. Vlcsincreased lignoceric acid acyl-CoA synthetase activity in transiently transfected COS-1 cells 5-fold from 0.51 nmol of C24:0/20 min/mg of protein to 2.47 nmol of C24:0/20 min/mg of protein (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, Vlcs increased the palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity of transfected cells 3.5-fold from 14.4 nmol of C16:0/20 min/mg of protein to 51.4 nmol of C16:0/20 min/mg of protein) (Fig.2 B). This LCS activity was similar in magnitude to the amount in COS-1 cells transfected with a long-chain synthetase, rat long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (rACS-1; Fig. 2 B). The increase in LCS activity imparted on Vlcs transfected COS-1 cells is much greater than the corresponding VLCS activity (compare 0.5 increased to 3 nmol of C24:0 activated/20 min/mg of protein with 15 increased to 50 nmol of C16:0 activated/20 min/mg of protein). The preference of Vlcs for long-chain over very long-chain substrates is consistent with observations that rat (22Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and human VLCS (29Steinberg S.J. Wang S.J. Kim D.G. Mihalik S.J. Watkins P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) enzymes have significantly more LCS than VLCS activity. Fig.3 shows a Northern blot analysis of mouse tissue mRNA probed wit"

CD43 (sialophorin) is a sialoglycoprotein expressed on the surface of a wide variety of blood cells including T lymphocytes. Several studies have shown that CD43 ligation induces proliferation and activation of human T lymphocytes. We were thus interested in defining whether CD43-mediated signaling events can modulate the life cycle of HIV-1. We demonstrate here that CD43 cross-linking potentiates HIV-1 promoter-driven activity and virus production that is seen following the engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR)·CD3 complex. This effect is independent of the CD28 co-stimulatory molecule and is mediated by both NF-κB and NFAT transcription factors. A number of signal transducers known to be involved in the TCR/CD3-dependent signal transduction pathway, including p56lck, p36lat, and SLP-76, as well as capacitative entry of calcium, are crucial for the noticed CD43 co-stimulatory effect. Calcium mobilization studies indicate that a synergy is occurring between CD43- and TCR/CD3-mediated signaling events leading to an augmented calcium release.

The nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB) is playing a cardinal role in virus transcription via the two tandem conserved NF-κB-binding motifs that are located within the enhancer sequence (1Nabel G.J. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). More recently, the implication of the NFAT family of transcription factors in HIV-1 LTR activity has been suggested (2Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), although contradictory results are still questioning the role of the different NFAT members. The regulatory domain of HIV-1 can be activated in vivofollowing engagement of the antigen-specific TCR·CD3 complex, an event that can be mimicked in vitro in established T-cell lines using some specific anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. It has been shown that antibody-mediated signaling through the TCR·CD3 complex activates HIV-1 transcription and co-engagement of CD28 further augmented virus gene expression (3Tong-Starksen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin M.B. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 702-707PubMed Google Scholar, 4Copeland K.F.T. Hendrikx P.J. Haaksma A.G.M. Fiering S. Van Lier R. Goudsmit J. Heeney J.L. Virology. 1995; 209: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ligation of CD28 alone is sufficient to induce HIV-1 transcription and replication both in Jurkat cells (5Gruters R.A. Otto S.A. Al B.J. Verhoeven A.J. Verweij C.L. Van L.R. Miedema F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in naturally infected leukocytes (6Asjö B. Cefai D. Debré P. Dudoit Y. Autran B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4395-4398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the complex interplay between T-cell signaling events and HIV-1 replication, it is of prime importance to identify other cell surface constituents that are likely to affect HIV-1 transcription. An increasing number of accessory cell surface molecules are involved in up-regulation of T-cell activation. Among them, CD43 (sialophorin, leukosialin, or gpL115) is a constitutively phosphorylated 115-kDa sialoglycoprotein expressed in a wide variety of blood cells including lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets. It is considered as the most abundant membrane protein of T lymphocytes. On T-cells, CD43 is differently glycosylated in two major isoforms, i.e. a 113–123-kDa product, mainly present on resting CD4+ T cells, and a 125–135-kDa form expressed mostly on resting CD8 lymphocytes. Previous work has shown that this isoform is up-regulated following activation of both CD4-positive and CD8-positive T-cells (7Jones A.T. Federsppiel B. Ellies L.G. Williams M.J. Burgener R. Duronio V. Smith C.A. Takei F. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3426-3439PubMed Google Scholar). CD43 has been involved in the selection and maturation of thymocytes and in the migration, adhesion, and activation of mature T-cells. Four natural ligands have been identified for CD43, namely ICAM-1 (CD54), Galectin 1, major histocompatibility complex-I, and sialoadhesin (Siglec-1). However, there is no direct evidence of how the interaction of CD43 with these ligands regulates T-cell function (8Rosenstein Y. Park J.K. Hahn W.C. Rosen F.S. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J.

For example, CD43 ligation by monoclonal antibodies has been reported to increase proliferation of activated T-cells and to enhance antigen-specific activation of T-cells, resulting in secretion of IL-2 and expression of both CD69 and CD40L (12Alvarado M. Klassen C. Cerny J. Horejsi V. Schmidt R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Axelsson B. Youseffi-Etemad R. Hammarstrom S. Perlmann P. J.

Immunol. 1989; 30: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and require the intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell activation. Further studies revealed that CD43 is functionally coupled to the phospholipase C/phosphoinositides signaling pathway, resulting in translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane and calcium mobilization (18Silverman L.B. Wong R.C. Remold-O'Donnell E. Vercelli D. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F. Geha R. Chatila T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4194-4200PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wong R.C. Remold-O'Donnell E. Vercelli D. Sancho J. Terhorst C. Rosen F. Geha R. Chatila T. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1455-1460PubMed Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in CD43-dependent interleukin-2 gene expression (20Pedraza-Alva G. Merida L.B. Burakoff S.J. Rosenstein Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14218-14224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, CD43 cross-linking on the T-cell surface induces interaction between CD43 and Fyn leading to Fyn tyrosine phosphorylation and signal propagation (21Pedraza-Alva G. Merida L.B. Burakoff S.J. Rosenstein Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27564-27568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Downstream events of the CD43-mediated signaling cascade include activation of several transcription factors such as activator protein-1, NFAT, and NF-κB (22Santana M.A. Pedraza-Alva G. Olivares-Zavaleta N. Madrid-Marina V. Horejsi V. Burakoff S.J. Rosenstein Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31460-31468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides its co-stimulatory potential, a negative regulatory role in T-cell activation was proposed for CD43 based on the observation that CD43-deficient mice are hyperresponsive following both in vivo and in vitro activation (23Thurman E.C. Walker J. Jayaraman S. Manjunath N. Ardman B. Green J.M. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in another study, the absence of CD43 did not alter T-cell development and responsiveness (24Carlow D.A. Corbel S.Y. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CD43 has been shown to induce apoptosis in human T-cell lineages (25Brown T.J. Shuford W.W. Wang W.C. Nadler S.G. Bailey T.S. Marquardt H. Mittler R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27686-27695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and, paradoxically, a high level of CD43 expression can protect T-cell hybridomas from activation-induced cell death (26He Y.W. Bevan M.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Further studies are thus warranted to document the exact contribution of CD43 in T-cell functions. More relevant to the present work, persons infected with HIV-1 make autoantibodies that bind to CD43 on normal thymic lymphocytes (27Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Desroys du Roure L. Cottalorda J. Doglio A. Passeron A. Fuzibet J.G. Lefebvre J.C. Blood. 1995; 86: 2302-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, an altered glycosylation pattern of CD43 is observed on the surface of HIV-1-infected CEM cells and also on peripheral T lymphocytes from patients infected with HIV-1 (28Lefebvre J.C. Giordanengo V. Limouse M. Doglio A. Cucchiarini M. Monpoux F. Mariani R. Peyron J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Gallego M.D. Aguado E. Kindelan J.M. Pena J. Santamaria M. Molina I.J. Aids. 2001; 15: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These findings along with the previously reported implication of CD43 in T-cell signaling and the intimate link between T-cell activation and HIV-1 transcription (30Siekevitz M. Joseph S.F. Dokovich M. Peffer N. Wong-Staal F. Greene W.C. Science. 1987; 238: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) led us to scrutinize the effect of CD43 ligation on the regulatory elements of HIV-1. In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that, although CD43-mediated signal transduction events are weak inducers of virus transcription, co-ligation of CD43 with the TCR·CD3 complex markedly augmented both HIV-1 LTR-driven gene activity and virus gene expression. This CD43-dependent co-stimulus was independent of CD28 and promoted nuclear translocation of both NF-κB and NFAT transcription factors. Several intracellular second messengers known to participate to the TCR/CD3 signaling cascade were found to be important for the CD43 co-stimulating ability, therefore suggesting that stimulation via CD43 could act by lowering the threshold for T-cell activation that is seen upon the engagement of the TCR·CD3 complex. The cell lines used in this work include parental Jurkat (clone E6.1), 1G5, JCAM1.6, JCAM.2, J14-V-29, J14-76-11, CJ, CJ 5.13, CJ 1.1, and LuSIV. Jurkat is considered as a model cell line for the study of T-cell signaling machinery (31Gillis S. Watson J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whereas the 1G5 T-cell line is a Jurkat derivative that harbors two stably integrated constructs constituted of the luciferase gene under the control of the HIV-1 SF2 LTR (32Willard-Gallo K.E. Van de Keere F. Kettmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6713-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). JCAM1.6 and JCAM2 are Jurkat derivatives that are deficient in p56lck and p36latexpression, respectively (33Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 34Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The J14-V-29 cell line is also derived from Jurkat and lacks expression of the T cell specific adaptor SLP-76 that has been reintroduced using an expression vector, thus creating the J14-76-11 clone (35Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The CJ cell lines have been derived from Jurkat using a toxic gene under the control of the NFAT transcription factor (36Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The CJ parental cell line retains full calcium capacitative entry, whereas the CJ 5.13 and CJ 1.1 have, respectively, 40 and less than 10% of the wild-type capacitative entry of calcium following stimulation. The reporter LuSIV cell line, kindly provided by Janice E. Clements (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD), was derived from the CEMx174 parental cell line (B-cell/T-cell hybrid) and carries the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the SIVmac239 LTR (37Roos J.W. Maughan M.F. Liao Z. Hildreth J.E. Clements J.E. Virology. 2000; 273: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin except for CJ cell lines, which were grown in 20% fetal calf serum. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy donors and purified by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation. PBMCs were maintained in RPMI medium (described above) containing 1 μg/ml PHA-L and 50 units/ml IL-2 for 1 week. PBMCs were deprived from IL-2 for 24 h before being used in stimulation assays. Human T helper cells (i.e. CD4+) were negatively isolated from fresh PBMCs using the CD4+ T cells negative purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly, we have used an antibody mixture and a magnetic colloid that depletes the cell population of every cell type except CD4+ T lymphocytes upon application to a magnetically charged column. In our studies we have used pLTR-LUC and pmκBLTR-LUC that have been kindly provided by Dr. K. Calame (Columbia University, New York). These molecular constructs contain the luciferase reporter gene under the control of wild-type (GGGACTTTCC) or NF-κB-mutated ( CTC ACTTTCC) HIV-1HXB2 LTR (−453 to +80) (38Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pLTRX-LUC plasmid contains a 722-base pair fragment (−644 to +78) from HIV-1LAI placed in front of the luciferase reporter gene (39Schwartz O. Virelizier J.-L. Montagnier L. Hazan U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and was kindly given by Dr. O. Schwartz (Unité d'oncologie virale, Institut Pasteur, France). The pκB-TATA-LUC vector contains the minimal HIV-1 κB region and a TATA box placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (40Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (from Dr. W. C. Greene, The J. Gladstone Institutes, San Francisco, CA). The following reagents were obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS repository reagent program: pNL4-3, a full-length infectious molecular clone of HIV-1 (a prototypic T-tropic isolate of HIV-1) (41Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pCEP4-Tat, a plasmid that contains the HIV-1SF2 Tat gene ligated to the pCEP4 CMV-based expression vector (42Chang L.J. Urlacher V. Iwakuma T. Cui Y. Zucali J. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The dominant negative IκBα expressing vector pCMV-IκBα S32A/S36A has been described previously (40Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pNFAT-LUC is constituted of the luciferase reporter gene placed under control of the minimal IL-2 promoter that carries three tandem copies of the NFAT-binding site (kindly provided by Dr. G. Crabtree, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford, CA) (43Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). pNFκB-LUC contains five consensus NF-κB binding sequences placed upstream of the luciferase gene along with a minimal promoter (Stratagene). The expression vector for p56lck, pEFneo LCK-wt, as well as the pEFneo-based empty vector have already been described (44Couture C. Baier G. Oetken C. Williams S. Telford D. Marie-Cardine A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Fisher S. Burn P. Altman A. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5249-5258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were kind gifts from Dr. C. Couture (Lady Davis Institute, Montreal). The expression vector for p36LAT, pCDNA3.1 LAT, was generously provided by Dr. A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (34Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The luciferase-containing pNL4-3-LUC-E-R+ construct was generously provided by Dr. N. R. Landau (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). The pHCMV-G expressing the broad host-range vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G) from the human cytomegalovirus promoter has been described previously (45Yee J.K. Friedmann T. Burns J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The hybridoma cell line that produces the anti-CD3 OKT3 monoclonal antibody (specific for the ζ-chain of the CD3 complex) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Purified anti-CD28 antibody (clone 9.3) was a generous gift from Dr. J. A. Ledbetter (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ) (46Martin P.J. Ledbetter J.A. Morishita Y. June C.H. Beatty P.G. Hansen J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3282-3287PubMed Google Scholar). Two anti-CD43 antibodies reacting with different epitopes were used in this study: L10, which reacts with both sialylated and desialylated CD43 (15Mentzer S.J. Remold-O'Donnell E. Crimmins M.A. Bierer B.E. Rosen F.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), was purchased from Caltag (Burlingame, CA), whereas MEM-59, which is directed against a sialic acid-dependent epitope (47Stefanova I. Hilgert I. Kristofova H. Brown R. Low M.G. Horejsi V. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), is a kind gift from Dr. V. Horejski (University of Prague, Czech Republic). Purified goat anti-mouse IgG antibody was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Rabbit antisera raised against peptides from NFAT1 (48Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB were kindly supplied by Dr. N. Rice (NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). Polyclonal anti-NFATc (NFAT2) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were electroporated at room temperature using a gene pulser I apparatus (Bio-Rad) (960 microfarads, 250 V). Cells were concentrated at 37.5 × 106/ml in RPMI medium. Cells (400-μl aliquots) were electroporated either with 5 μg of the reporter construct DNA alone or, in the case of reconstitution experiments, with 5 μg of reporter construct DNA and 0, 10, or 20 μg of the expression plasmid. The total DNA amount for the reconstitution experiments was maintained constant at 25 μg using the empty vector. To minimize variations in plasmid transfection efficiencies, cells were transfected in bulk and were separated into various treatment groups at a density of 105 cells/well (100 μl) in 96-well flat-bottom plates at 36 h post-transfection. For studies using the pharmacological inhibitor FK506 (Sigma), cells were resuspended in fresh cell culture medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and FK506 was added at subcytotoxic concentrations of 1–10 ng/ml for 60 min before stimulation. Cells were either left unstimulated or treated with various combinations of anti-CD3 (clone OKT3, 0.25 μg/ml unless otherwise specified), anti-CD43 (MEM-59 at 3 μg/ml or L10 at 1 μg/ml), and anti-CD28 antibody (clone 9.3 at 1 μg/ml), and cross-linked with a goat anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/ml) in a final volume of 200 μl. Next, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h unless otherwise specified. Luciferase activity was determined following a previously described protocol (49Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Virus particles were produced by calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells with virus-encoding vectors as previously described (50Cantin R. Fortin J.-F. Tremblay M. Virology. 1996; 218: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 51Fortin J.F. Cantin R. Lamontagne G. Tremblay M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3588-3596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudotyped HIV-1 particles were generated by cotransfection of 293T cells with pNL4-3-LUC-E-R+ and an expression vector coding for the VSV-G full-length envelope protein. Virus stocks were normalized for virion content using an in-house sensitive double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for the major core viral p24 protein (52Bounou S. Leclerc J.E. Tremblay M.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Viral infection experiments were done using fixed amount of virus (5 ng of p24 protein) to inoculate 105 target cells (i.e. Jurkat, PBMCs, and purified CD4+ T lymphocytes). Cells infected with luciferase-encoding viruses were stimulated 48 h post-infection as described above and luciferase activity was monitored at 24 h post-stimulation. Cells infected with replication-competent viruses (i.e. NL4-3) were stimulated 8 h post-infection. Production of infectious viruses by NL4-3-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes at 3 days post-stimulation was assessed using the reporter LuSIV cell line. Briefly, cell-free culture supernatants were incubated with LuSIV cells (105), and luciferase activity was analyzed at 24 h after the initiation of the culture. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a previously described protocol (49Barbeau B. Bernier R. Dumais N. Briand G. Olivier M. Faure R. Posner B.I. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12968-12977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, unstimulated or activated cells (5 × 106) were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (Buffer A: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and kept for 15 min on ice before lysis with 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended with an hypertonic buffer (Buffer B: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by gentle agitation for 15 min. The solution was then centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by BCA assay (Pierce) and stored at −85 °C until use. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of 1× binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40% glycerol, 10% Ficoll, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin fraction V) containing 0.8 ng of γ-32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. The following double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were used as probes and/or competitors: the enhancer region (-107/-77) from the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 (5′-CAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGG-3′), and the consensus binding site for Oct-2A (used as a control for nonspecific competition). Oligonucleotides were synthesized in-house. DNA-protein complexes were resolved from free labeled DNA by electrophoresis in native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed on a KodakTM Biomax MR film at −85 °C. Cold competition assays were conducted by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide simultaneously with the labeled probe. Supershift assays were performed by preincubation of nuclear extracts with 1 μl of antibody in the presence of all of the components of the binding reaction for 30 min on ice before the addition of the labeled probe. Cells (1 × 107) were washed once and resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. The cell permeant calcium indicator Indo-1AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 3 μm and the cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h with moderate shaking. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold serum-free/phenol red-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and resuspended in Opti-MEM at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Thereafter, prewarmed cells (1 × 106) were stimulated with various combinations of anti-CD3 (clone OKT3) and anti-CD43 (MEM-59 or L10) along with a goat anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/ml) and the calcium content was then analyzed with an EPICS ELITE ESP apparatus (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL). The violet:blue ratios, representing the Ca2+-bound to Ca2+-unbound Indo-1 signals, were then continuously monitored over a 10-min period and analyzed using the 1.5 version of the System 2 software (Becton-Coulter). Data are presented as the geometric mean of the violet:blue ratio over time, using WinMDI version 2.8 freeware (J. Trotter, The Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). Because the engagement of CD43 has been shown to enhance T-cell activation and induce IL-2 gene expression, we were interested in analyzing the effects of CD43-mediated signals on HIV-1 LTR-driven transcriptional activity. To this end, we used two anti-CD43 antibodies reacting with different epitopes, i.e. MEM-59 and L10. 1G5 cells, a Jurkat-derived cell line that contains a stably integrated construct made of the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1LAI LTR, were incubated with anti-CD43 antibodies used either alone or in combination with anti-CD3 antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, no increase in luciferase activity was observed upon treatment with anti-CD43 antibodies alone. However, both MEM-59 and L10 showed a co-stimulating effect when used in combination with the anti-CD3 antibody OKT3. The up-regulating effect was even more dramatic when using pκBTATA-LUC, a molecular construct made of the luciferase reporter gene placed under the control of the minimal HIV-1 promoter region (Fig. 1 B). This could be attributed to the deletion of the HIV-1 LTR negative regulatory elements in this construct. In both cases the L10 antibody showed much stronger co-stimulating activity as compared with MEM-59. Data from a time course experiment revealed that the optimal co-stimulating capacity of CD43 was maximal after 8 h of treatment (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, a significant induction of HIV-1 LTR-dependent luciferase activity was seen (30-fold increase over untreated cells) even with concentrations of OKT3 that were not sufficient to mediate activation by itself (i.e.from 0.05 to 0.2 μg/ml) (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, the marked co-stimulating potential of the L10 antibody was not affected by a reduction in the concentration of OKT3 to as low as 0.05 μg/ml and was still observed at 0.025 μg/ml. In contrast, the co-stimulating potential of the MEM-59 antibody appears to be more dependent on the anti-CD3 concentration"

An efficient heterologous expression system was developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a four-step purification protocol, using n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, led to a homogenous detergent-solubilized protein fraction with a yield of over 2 mg of protein per liter of culture. The three-dimensional structure of the purified detergent-solubilized protein obtained at 2.4 nm resolution by electron microscopy showed a dimeric organization in which the size and the shape of each monomer was compatible with the reported structures of P-type ATPases. The purified MJ1226p ATPase was inactive at 40 °C and was active at elevated temperature reaching high specific activity, up to 180 μmol of Pi·min−1·mg−1 at 95 °C. Maximum ATPase activity was observed at pH 4.2 and required up to 200 mm monovalent salts. The ATPase activity was stable for several days upon storage at 65 °C and was highly resistant to urea and guanidine hydrochloride. The protein formed catalytic phosphoenzyme intermediates from MgATP or Pi, a functional characteristic specific of P-type ATPases. The highly purified, homogeneous, stable, and active MJ1226p ATPase provides a new model for further structure-function studies of P-type ATPases.

The protein formed catalytic phosphoenzyme intermediates from MgATP or Pi, a functional characteristic specific of P-type ATPases. The highly purified, homogeneous, stable, and active MJ1226p ATPase provides a new model for further structure-function studies of P-type ATPases. n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid transmembrane 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase The ability of Archaea to grow in extreme habitats has led to the exploration of the molecular mechanisms that confer stability to proteins under high temperature, high pressure, or extreme pH values. The basis of thermotolerance of the bioenergetic features of archaeal species is particularly intriguing. As in bacterial cells, membrane-residing systems in anaerobic Archaea use an electrochemical potential of either hydrogen ions or sodium ions for primary energy conservation (1Lancaster J.R., Jr. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1989; 21: 717-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, in archaeal methanogens, simultaneous primary gradients of both protons and sodium ions can be used to drive ATP synthesis (2Schafer G. Engelhard M. Muller V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 570-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, P-type ATPases were not suspected to be responsible for the generation of the primary electrochemical potential across archaeal membrane. This possibility has to be revisited because of the discovery through genome sequencing of several P-type ATPase genes. From the seven archaeal genome sequences annotated so far, 18 genes encoding P-type ATPases have been identified ([email protected] and www-biology.ucsd.edu/∼ipaulsen/transport/). Most archaeal P-type ATPases belong to the bacterial families of potassium- or metal-transporting P-type ATPases. However, four archaeal P-type ATPase sequences cluster with eucaryotic phylogenetic families. Among them, two new members of the family of H+-ATPases were identified in Methanococcus jannaschii (3Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M.

This observation is intriguing because H+-transporting P-type ATPases were believed to be restricted to yeast (5Dufour J.P. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, very few archaeal P-type ATPases have been characterized biochemically, and only one of them, the thermophilic Ag+/Cu+ ATPase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus, has been purified after expression in Escherichia coli (11Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Arguello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One of the main limiting factors is the inability to produce large amounts of pure transport protein from archaeal genes. Although heterologous expression systems have proven to be useful for phenotypic characterization of proteins that often cannot be produced in their original host, heterologously expressed membrane proteins are often of limited activity, and their purification in large scale is still cumbersome. Therefore, development and/or improvement of cloning systems for the heterologous production of large amounts of pure and stable transport proteins from archaeal genes would be of considerable interest. In this study, we describe the cloning, heterologous expression, purification, and biochemical and structural characterization of MJ1226p, a putative P-type H+-ATPase of the anaerobic hyperthermophilic Archaea Methanococcus jannaschii. MJ1226p was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a cloning system that was shown to be suitable for heterologous expression of mammal, plant, and fungi P-type ATPases (12Horowitz B.

A purification process, based on the hyperthermostability of the enzyme and the presence of a six-histidine tag, allowed large scale production of a highly purified protein. The purified MJ1226p ATPase activity was found to be thermophilic up to 95 °C. Its full activity required monovalent salts and acidic pH. The ATPase activity was highly resistant to denaturation by temperature or chaotropic agents such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride. It was able to form catalytic phosphoenzyme intermediates from both MgATP and Pi, a functional characteristic specific of P-type ATPases. The three-dimensional structure, of the purified detergent-solubilized protein, obtained at 2.4 nm resolution by electron microscopy showed a dimeric organization, in which each monomer compared well with the reported structures of the SERCA calcium ATPase, a prototypical P-type ATPase (20Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the MJ1226p ATPase of the hyperthermophilic M. jannaschii provides new possibilities for the functional and structural analysis of P-type ATPases. It also provides new insights into the thermostability of ion transport proteins, the bioenergetics of archaea, and the phylogeny of P-type plasma membrane H+-ATPases. The MJ1226 open reading frame containing 2,415 nucleotides, and coding for a putative plasma membrane H+-ATPase was obtained from two overlapping clones AMJFO85 (contained the 5′ end to nucleotide 2291) and AMJGG15 (started from position 167 and extended to the 3′ end) (3Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G. Blake J.A. FitzGerald L.M. Clayton R.A. Gocayne J.D. Kerlavage A.R. Dougherty B.A. Tomb J.F. Adams M.D. Reich C.I. Overbeek R. Kirkness E.F.

The 5′ end of the gene was amplified from the AMJFO85 clone by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: MJ1 (GGAATTCATGTGGGGGGTTGTTATGATTGT) and MJ3 (CTCCAATCCTAATTCTAACAA). The PCR product was then inserted in theEcoRI/EcoRV site of the AMJGG15 clone in order to reconstitute the full-length MJ1226 open reading frame. A His6-tagged version of theMJ1226 open reading frame was obtained with the same strategy using the MJ2 oligonucleotide (GGAATTCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACTGGGGGGTTGTTATGAATGTTGAG) instead of MJ1. The His6 tag was thus inserted at the amino-terminal end, between the 1st and 2nd residue of the protein. All the constructions were verified by sequencing. The coding sequence ofMJ1226 was inserted between the yeast PMA1promoter and the ADC1 terminator in a 2-μm multicopy vector, derived from Yeplac181 (22Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar) by a strategy similar to that described by de Kerchove d'Exaerde et al. (15de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The multicopy expression plasmids with the PMA1 promoter and ADC1 terminator were named MJ1p and MJ2p for the untagged and tagged version of MJ1226, respectively. The YAK2 strain (Mata, ade2-101, leu2-Δ1, his3-Δ200, ura3-52, trp1Δ63, lys2-801, pma1-Δ::HIS3, pma2-Δ::TRP1) has the chromosomal H+-ATPase genes, PMA1 and PMA2, deleted and the essential PMA1 gene under the control of the inducible GAL1-10 promoter on an URA3 centromeric plasmid (15de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

Yeast cells were transformed according to Ito et al. (23Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YAK2 cells transformed with either the MJ1226-containing plasmid (MJ1p or MJ2p) or the Yeplac181 (empty) plasmid were grown on a 2% (w/v) galactose medium depleted of His, Leu, Ura, and Trp. Cells were grown in liquid medium until they reached a density of 20.106 cells/ml.MJ1226 expression was induced by growing the cells in medium with 2% (w/v) glucose for 16 h. Cells were then harvested, washed twice with ice-cold water, and resuspended in 250 mmsorbitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmimidazole NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin, and chymostatin at 2 μg/ml each. Cells were broken in the presence of glass beads as described in Goffeau and Dufour (24Goffeau A. Dufour J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two centrifugations, the first at 3,500 rpm (SS34) for 5 min and the second at 6,000 rpm for 5 min, were followed by a third centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 40 min to obtain a crude particulate fraction. The pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Fractions were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty five mg of crude particulate fraction in 4 ml was solubilized withn-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM)1 at a detergent-to-protein ratio of 2:1 (w/w). The sample was thoroughly mixed at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, cooled in ice, and centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The new supernatant was incubated at room temperature with 1 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen) for 3 h on a rotary wheel. The matrix was loaded into a column, washed 5 times with 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM. Ni-NTA purified fractions of MJ1226p were concentrated on Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (cut-off 50 kDa) up to 2–3 mg of protein/ml. An aliquot of 100 μl was loaded on a Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) column, equilibrated, and eluted with 20 mm Mes-KOH, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% DDM, 10% glycerol. Fractions of 500 μl were harvested and analyzed for protein content. Standard ATPase assays were performed in the presence of 6 mm MgATP, 50 mm Mes-KOH, pH 5.0, 200 mm potassium acetate, 0.1% DDM, and 0.3 μg of protein at 95 °C for 3 min. The pH of this reaction medium at 95 °C was 4.2. The reaction was started by quickly raising the temperature from room temperature to 95 °C and was stopped by addition of 1% SDS. The activity of MJ1226p was defined as the difference between the activity measured in the MJ1226p fraction and the activity measured either in a similar fraction obtained from the control strain expressing the empty plasmid or with the MJ1226p fraction treated with 1% SDS before incubation at 95 °C. Formation of phosphoenzyme intermediates by ATP was carried out at 0, 30, or 65 °C by incubating 10 μg of purified MJ1226p in 0.2 ml of 20 mm citric acid, pH 5.0, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% asolectin. The phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 2 mm[γ-32P]ATP and stopped 10 s later by the addition of 50 ml of 50% (w/w) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, 100 mm ATP, 100 mm MgCl2. Inhibition of phosphorylation was checked by adding 10 mm ATP or 10 mm hydroxylamine 10 s after the reaction was started, and a further 10-s incubation was performed before trichloroacetic acid addition. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 20 mmKH2PO4/H3PO4, pH 2.0, 20 mm ATP, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by cationic detergent/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at acid pH as described (26Amory A. Foury F. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9353-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The gels were then rehydrated and stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the amount of protein loaded on the gel. Phosphoenzyme formation by inorganic phosphate (Pi) was carried out at 65 °C by first incubating 10 μg of purified MJ1226p in 0.2 ml of 20 mm citric acid, pH 5.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.05% asolectin. When indicated, 10 mm vanadate was added. The phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 5 mm32Piand stopped 10 min later by the addition of 50 ml of 50% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm KH2PO4. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 mm KH2PO4, 10% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed as described previously. Purified protein was diluted to about 0.05 mg of protein/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% DDM. Aliquots were deposited onto 400 mesh glow discharged carbon-coated grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Untilted electron micrographs and 45° tilted pairs of MJ1226p were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and a magnification of 45,000, using a low dose system, in a Philips CM120 electron microscope. All micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO-163 films. The focus values were −1.6 μm for tilted pairs and −0.8 μm for untilted images. Micrographs were digitized at 0.5 nm/pixel using a Leafscan 45 digitizer. A total number of 546 image pairs were windowed and centered by using X-MIPP software (27Marabini R. Masegosa I.M.

Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 13: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were performed over untilted images to identify homogeneous groups of projections. Average image of the major group was computed to perform a first three-dimensional reconstruction using SPIDER software (32Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J., Li, Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). This volume was used as reference for angular assignment and refinement of 1464 cryo-microscopic untilted images, which were used to compute the final three-dimensional reconstruction of frozen-hydrated protein (33Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Samples for cryo-microscopy were prepared on liquid ethane at −178 °C using a CPC station (Leica). Frozen grids were transferred into a Philips CM120 electron microscope using a Gatan 626 cryo-station before image recording under the same conditions as those described above for negatively stained samples. Final volume was filtered at the resolution estimated by FRC method (34Saxton W.O. Baumeister W. J. Microsc. 1982; 127: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Volume rendering was performed using ETDIPS version 2 software (35Mullick R. Venkataraman S. Warusavithana S. Nguyen H.T. Raghavan R. Annual Meeting of the Society for Computer Applications in Radiology. 1998; Google Scholar). After three-dimensional reconstruction computation, x-ray structure of the Ca2+-ATPase was docked into the volume obtained by electron microscopy by filtering the atomic structure at 2.4 nm resolution and searching for the best matching positions into the volume of a MJ1226p monomer using SPIDER software (32Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J., Li, Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Genome analysis of the hyperthermophileM. jannaschii revealed the presence of a putative P-type H+-ATPase, named MJ1226p. Blast analysis of this sequence showed high sequence similarity with plant and yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPases. The 80 closest orthologues of MJ1226p, ranging from similarity E scores of e−157 toe−86, were established plant, fungal, and ciliate plasma membrane H+-ATPases. The closest non-H+-ATPase was a putative Ca2+-ATPase fromClostridium perfringens with a much lower similarity (E score of e−85). Alignment analysis showed that MJ1226p (805 residues) shared 41 and 39% identity with the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia PMA4 (952 residues) and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe PMA1(919 residues) plasma membrane H+-ATPases, respectively. The MJ1226p P-type ATPase has therefore been phylogenetically classified among the family of plasma membrane H+-ATPases (36Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The recently identified TA1045p (787 residues) from the ArchaeaT. acidophilum, which has 39% identity to theMJ1226 gene product from M. jannaschii, makes with the latter a distinct two-member phylogenetic cluster in the proton-ATPase family. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of MJ1226p are shorter compared with plant and yeast H+-ATPases, but no significant differences can be detected throughout the rest of the sequence. Fig. 1 shows the alignments of the predicted transmembrane domains 4–6, which compose the Ca2+-binding sites of the SERCA P-type ATPase (21Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Among the 70 residues of TM 4–6 from MJ1226p, a total of 14 residues were strictly conserved in most plants and fungal proton ATPases. On the other hand, 11 residues were conserved in an alignment with the TM 4–6 from the SERCA Ca2+-ATPases, but only 3 among the 9 residues ligating the Ca2+ ions in SERCA were conserved in MJ1226p. It has been speculated recently (37Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the hydronium-binding site of the plant AHA2p ATPase composes Asp-684 in TM 6 (which is conserved as D654 in MJ1226p) and the three carbonyls from Ile-282, Gly-283, and Ile-285 in TM 4 (which become Val-264, Ser-265, and Ile-267, in MJ1226p). In this hypothesis, only two of the four postulated hydronium-binding residues of AHA2p would be conserved in MJ1226p. All together, these phylogenetic analyses render it unlikely that MJ1226p is a Ca2+-ATPase but do not prove that MJ1226p is a proton-ATPase. We have expressed the archaeal MJ1226 gene in the yeastS. cerevisiae using a cloning system, which was shown to be suitable for heterologous expression of plant and fungi plasma membrane H+-ATPases (15de Kerchove d'Exaerde A.

Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5513-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We used a yeast strain deleted of its own plasma membrane H+-ATPase genes, PMA1and PMA2. This strain was able to survive on galactose medium due to the presence of PMA1 under the control of theGAL1–10 promoter on a URA3 centromeric plasmid (15de Kerchove d'Exaerde A. Supply P. Dufour J.P. Bogaerts P. Thines D. Goffeau A. Boutry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23828-23837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This strain was transformed with either a multicopy plasmid carrying the M. jannaschii MJ1226 gene or with the empty plasmid Yeplac181. The ability of the archaeal MJ1226 gene to replace the yeast PMA1 was tested by replicating transformants from galactose to glucose medium containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid to chase the plasmid containing thePMA1 and URA3 genes. Under these conditions, transformants replicated on glucose medium were unable to grow at 30 °C indicating that at this temperature the Archaea gene was not able to replace the yeast PMA1. The Archaea MJ1226 protein was well expressed in yeast membrane fractions as observed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. A major band at 84 kDa appeared in crude particulate fractions of the yeast strain expressing MJ1226p compared with the control strain (Fig.2A). Additional evidence for the good expression of MJ1226 relies on a comparison of the temperature dependence of the total hydrolytic ATPase activities of crude membranes from yeast cells expressing either the empty vector or the MJ1226-containing plasmid. Two peaks of ATPase activity were detected at 50 °C and above 90 °C in the strain expressing MJ1226p, whereas only one peak was detected at 50 °C in the control strain (see below Fig. 4A). The peak observed at 50 °C in both strains should correspond to the yeast Pma1p activity. On the contrary, the peak observed above 90 °C corresponds to the overexpressed MJ1226p because it was not detected in the control strain.FIG. 4Dependence of MJ1226p ATPase activity on temperature and pH. Standard ATPase assays were performed using a buffer containing 200 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm Mg ATP, and 50 mm Mes-KOH at the desired pH.A, total ATPase activities of crude membrane fractions (75 μg of protein) of uninduced and induced S. cerevisiaedetermined at different temperatures. B, ATPase activities of the purified MJ1226p determined at different temperatures.C, ATPase activities of the purified MJ1226p determined at 95 °C and different pH values (measured at 95 °C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Solubilization of yeast membrane fractions with 1.25% DDM allowed a significant enrichment of the 84-kDa protein as shown in gel electrophoresis (Fig.2B). Heat treatment of the total solubilized extract for 5 min above 80 °C induced precipitation of protein contaminants and considerable purification of the 84-kDa band. As shown in Fig.2C, only faint contaminant proteins could be detected on an SDS gel loaded with 10 μg of heat-treated proteins. The heat shock treatment was remarkably efficient because over 80% of the ATPase units from the crude particulate fraction were recovered, whereas the specific activity was multiplied by a factor of 10 (Table I). For comparison, purification of the total solubilized extract by Ni-NTA chromatography also allowed exhaustive purification of the 6His-MJ1226p, but several minor contaminants could be detected (Fig. 2D). Finally, the combination of the heat treatment followed by a Ni-NTA chromatography led to the production of a highly purified 84-kDa protein. Only a weak high molecular weight component of unknown nature could be detected on silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D). Noteworthy, the Ni-NTA chromatography step after the heat treatment led to a 3-fold increase of the specific ATPase activity (Table I). Control experiments indicated that this increase could not be related to the removal of some detergent that could have been heat-denatured. Most probably, the marked increase of ATPase-specific activity by Ni-NTA chromatography was due to the separation in the flow-through fraction of a form of the enzyme with no affinity to Ni-NTA and with a much lower ATPase activity (25 μmol·min−1·mg−1) (data not shown) than that of the fraction eluted by 250 mm imidazole (150 μmol·min−1·mg−1).Table IPurification of MJ1226p ATPase from 1.5 liters of yeast cultureStepsProteinATPase unitsATPase-specific activitymgμmol·min−1(μmol·min−1·mg−1)Crude membranes61932645Solubilization279299011Heat shock52263051NiNTA91290143Superose 62.5438175 Open table in a new tab Homogeneity of the 84-kDa band from the heat plus Ni-NTA fraction was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 column leading to three protein peaks eluting at fractions 26, 29, and 31, respectively. Each of these peaks exhibited only the 84-kDa protein band as determined by silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E, fraction 29).

The method is based on the selection of repertoires of phage-displayed antibody fragments with small samples of tissues microdissected using a laser. Using a human muscle frozen section with an area of 4800 μm2 as a model target, we successfully selected monoclonal antibody fragments directed against three major (myosin heavy chain, actin, and tropomyosin-α) and one minor (α-actinin 2) muscle constituent proteins. These proteins were present in the sample in amounts less than one nanogram, and the antibodies were used to visualize the proteins in situ. This shows that the use of ISPS can obtain monoclonal antibodies for histochemical and biochemical purposes against minute amounts of proteins from microstructures with no requirement for large amounts of samples or biochemical efforts.

Here, we describe a novel nanoscale method, in situ phage screening (ISPS),1 which enables us to identify protein components in microstructures seen with microscopy.

For microdissection of tissues, we developed a new laser-microdissector by combining an industrial-use laser cutter and an inverted microscope. The procedure involves isolation of the target microstructures from the surrounding tissues on glass by dissection and then incubation with the phage antibody library. Phage antibodies were isolated after a single round of selection, and their specificities were identified by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Target antigens were identified by immunoscreening of cDNA expression libraries using the monoclonal phage antibodies. The clinical targets of ISPS are those characterized by abnormal or yet unknown protein accumulations, which closely relate with pathogenetic mechanisms, such as subcutaneous deposits or inclusion bodies and extracellular plaques often seen in neuromuscular and other degenerative diseases. ISPS is highly advantageous when the target microstructures can hardly be collected by standard biochemical methodologies; for instance, targets are very small (up to 1 μm in size) or rare (seen in few cells), or they appear in complex pathophysiological structures. Because muscle cells consist of relatively small numbers of proteins, we employed human skeletal muscle as a model target of ISPS. In this report, we describe model experiments of ISPS on human muscle, where we successfully identified the three major and one minor muscle antigens from an area of 4800-μm2 microfragments. A human synthetic scFv library “Griffin. 1” (9Goletz S. Christensen P.A. Kristensen P. Blohm D. Tomlinson I. Winter G. Karsten U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was provided from Dr. G. Winter (Medical Research Council, UK) and amplified in our laboratory. In this library, the VH and VL sequence connected with a spacer sequence (3Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G.

Recombinant scFv phages were rescued in Escherichia coli suppressor strain TG1 in the presence of helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene Cloning System, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (9Goletz S. Christensen P.A. Kristensen P. Blohm D. Tomlinson I. Winter G. Karsten U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar,10Coomber D.W.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 178: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). 2Details of the Griffin. 1 library and phage protocols are also given on the Winter group home page (www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/phage/index.html). Briefly, bacteria carrying scFv phagemid were cultured in a 2× YT medium (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose and infected in the log phase (absorbance at 600 nm (A600) was 0.5) with VCSM13 at a ratio of 1:20 (number of bacterial cells/phage particles) for 30 min at 37 °C without shaking. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in a 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin (4 volumes of the original), and grown overnight at 30 °C. Phages were purified from the culture supernatant by polyethylene glycol precipitation (2MacCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Chiswell D.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) and resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.15m NaCl). The working solution of the phage library was prepared at the concentration of 1013 colony forming units (cfu)/ml. An anti-thyroglobulin scFv phage was also provided by Dr. G. Winter. Histologically normal biopsy specimens of skeletal muscle (biceps brachii) were provided by the NCNP research resource network (Kodaira, Tokyo) after obtaining the informed consent of the patients. Transverse (experiments A and B) and longitudinal (experiments C through E) frozen sections that were 2-μm thick were cut with a cryostat, attached to silanized slides (Dako), and subjected to laser microdissection. Spaces 15 μm wide surrounding 40 × 40-μm square microfragments were made with pulsed shots of the ultraviolet laser. After the sections were immersed in acetone for 5 min and air-dried, they were blocked with TBS-10% (weight/volume) skim milk for 2 h and then incubated with the phage library (5 × 1011 cfu in 50 μl of TBS in experiments A and B or in 75 μl of TBS-10% skim milk in experiments C through E) for 12 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) four times ×30 min, the sections were overlaid with 0.2 ml of TBS-T. Three microfragments of 40 × 40 μm were then collected into a microcentrifuge tube with a hand-made micropipette (inner diameter, 60–80 μm) together with a minimal amount of overlaid TBS-T, and the microfragments were washed three times by brief centrifugation with 0.2 ml of TBS-T each. After washing, the contents of the tube were examined microscopically to determine whether the three microfragments remained in the tube. In the direct colony recovery protocol, phages were eluted from the pelleted fragments with 100 μl of 1.4% triethylamine for 10 min at room temperature with vigorous shaking followed by neutralization with 50 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. A TG1 culture (1 ml) in the log phase (A600 = 0.5) was infected with the eluted phage solution for 30 min at 37 °C and plated on LB-agar (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1% glucose. All of the ampicillin-resistant colonies obtained, which were carrying scFv phagemid, were subjected to the analysis of specificity. In the PCR fragment-subcloning protocol, the three pelleted microfragments were suspended in 10 μl of water, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then rapidly cooled in ice. The Fv sequences derived from the phages bound to the microfragments were amplified by PCR using forward (5′-CGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGAAAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTATGCGGCCCCATTCAGATC-3′) primers. The reaction (50 μl) contained 5 μl of a 10-fold-concentrated Taq reaction buffer (Takara, Japan), 0.8 μm each of the forward and reverse primers, 0.2 mm dNTPs (Takara, Japan), the heat-treated sample (10 μl as described above), and 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase (Takara, Japan) and was kept in ice. After heating at 98 °C for 1 min, 38 cycles of PCR (60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 95 °C for 20 s) were performed and followed by incubation at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR product (0.95 kbp) was digested with NcoI and NotI, ligated with NcoI- and NotI-digested pHEN2, and transformed into TG1. The bacteria were plated to form ampicillin-resistant colonies. It was confirmed that no PCR products were obtained by using the final wash supernatant of the muscle microfragment (see Fig. 1). A portion of the colonies was subjected to analysis of scFv specificity. The Fv sequence in each colony was amplified by PCR (30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) using the same primer set as described above, digested with HaeIII, and electrophoresed on 4.5% agarose for fingerprinting. The monoclonal phage was rescued from the representative clones showing unique patterns on fingerprinting and analyzed immunohistochemically and by Western blotting. For immunostaining, muscle frozen-sections preblocked with TBS-10% skim milk were incubated with one to four unique phages (5 × 1010 cfu each in 100 μl of TBS-10% skim milk) simultaneously for 12 h at room temperature. After washing twice with TBS-T for 15 min, the sections were incubated with 1000-fold-diluted anti-M13 mouse IgG (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg) in TBS-5% skim milk for 1 h. After washing twice as above, the sections were stained by using an Envision-HRP kit (Dako) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western blotting, muscle sections (about 25–50 μg as protein) were dissolved in a 2-fold-concentrated sample buffer of SDS-PAGE (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), electrophoresed on 10% preparative gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut into strips 1–3 mm wide, blocked with 10% skim milk in TBS for 1 h, and incubated with scFv phages in TBS-10% skim milk for 2 h. In another set of experiments (with Tween treatment), the membrane strips were incubated with TBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, followed by blocking and phage incubation as described above, but in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20 (12). After washing with TBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min six times, the strip was incubated with 10,000-fold-diluted anti-M13 mouse IgG-HRP conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After washing with TBS-0.1% Tween 20 as above, the blot was visualized with an ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Muscle sections (about 30 and 300 μg as protein for Western and mass analysis, respectively) were dissolved in 250 μl of a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis buffer (20 mm Tris base, 9 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithioerythritol, and 0.5% immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer (Amersham Biosciences)) and subjected to isoelectric focusing by using an IPGphor system (Amersham Biosciences) with a 13 cm-long IPG strip (pH range, 3–10) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The IPG strip was then applied to the top of an SDS-PAGE gel (7.5%, 14 × 12 cm). For mass fingerprinting analysis, proteins on the two-dimensional gel were visualized by using a copper-staining kit (Bio-Rad). The target protein spots were then cut out, digested in gel with trypsin, and analyzed with a MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) type mass spectrometer (Voyager-DEPRO, Applied Biosystems) (1Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar, 13Kinumi T. Tobin S.L. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Ohashi M. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 3: 367-378Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The peptide mass fingerprinting analysis was performed by using the program MS-FIT. Western analysis was carried out as described above. A human skeletal muscle 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was immunoscreened according to the manufacturer's protocol by using scFv phages. Library plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with scFv phages (5 × 1010 cfu/ml, for 2 h), and visualized by using anti-M13 mouse IgG-HRP conjugated and ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) as described above. ISPS is performed by 1) dissection and isolation of target microstructures from surrounding tissues on a tissue section, 2) incubation of the tissue section with an scFv phage library, 3) collection of targets, and 4) selection of target-specific phages (Fig. 1). A new laser microdissector was developed to cut out the microstructures under a microscope (Fig. 2A). The dissector produced a rectangular space of variable size (1–56 μm) on a tissue section with a single shot of an ultraviolet laser beam at 266 nm (Fig. 2B). Tissues surrounding the target were widely burnt off by precisely controlling the laser power. Spaces that were 15 μm wide surrounding a 40 × 40-μm2 square microfragment were usually produced in a muscle section by the dissector (Fig.2C). As a source of scFvs, we employed a phagemid library, Griffin. 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The scFv sequences were constructed with synthetic human V-gene sequences of immunoglobulin, VH and VL (3Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Midgley C. Lane D. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 8Griffiths A.D. Williams S.C. Hartley O. Tomlinson I.M. Waterhouse P. Crosby W.L. Kontermann R.E. Jones P.T. Low N.M.

When the phages were rescued by using helper phages derived from M13 (VCSM13), the V-gene was fused with the gene III of the M13 phage and expressed as an scFv at the tip of the phage particle (2MacCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Chiswell D.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). The Griffin. 1 library contained about 109 independent unique clones (9Goletz S. Christensen P.A. Kristensen P. Blohm D. Tomlinson I. Winter G. Karsten U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We first determined the optimal conditions for phage antibody reaction with muscle microfragments. Anti-human α-actin and anti-human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) phages (designated Actin89 and GFAP53, respectively) were obtained from the Griffin. 1 library by the conventional panning method using polystyrene tubes (10Coomber D.W.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 178: 133-145PubMed Google Scholar). Actin89 phage was used for the evaluation of specific binding to muscle microfragments, and GFAP53 phage was used for that of nonspecific binding, because GFAP is an astrocyte-specific protein. After reacting these phages with a muscle section, 3–5 microfragments (40 × 40-μm2 square) were collected and washed three times to eliminate contamination by phages from residual tissues other than the microfragments. The phages bound to the microfragments were eluted with 1.4% triethylamine and allowed to infect E. coli TG1. The phage titer was measured as the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies (cfu). Skim milk was employed as a blocking agent because of findings in studies of muscle immunostaining with phage antibody in which 10% skim milk, but not 5%, worked well as a blocking agent. We checked the blocking effect of 10% skim milk on the nonspecific binding of GFAP53 phage to muscle fragments (Table I). As seen, preincubation with 10% skim milk or its presence during phage incubation was optimal in preventing the binding of unrelated phage GFAP53 to muscle fragments. Elevated amounts of nonspecific phage binding were only seen in the absence of the blocking agent throughout the experiment. Interestingly, the binding of Actin89 phage to muscle fragments was not affected either in the presence or absence of 10% skim milk (Table I).Table IEffect of skim milk on specific or non-specific phage binding to muscle microfragmentsSkim milkPhage recoveryPreblockIncubationActin89GFAP53cfu/1000 μm2++11 ± 30.5 ± 0.2−+ND1-aND, not determined.0.6 ± 0.1+−ND0.2 ± 0.2−−9 ± 68 ± 41-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We next checked the relation between input phage concentrations and amounts of phage binding to muscle fragments (Table II). As seen, the numbers of Actin89 phage bound to muscle microfragments were linearly related to the concentrations of input Actin89 phage (108–1012 cfu/ml) under optimal conditions. Similar linearity was observed when Actin89 was reacted with purified α-actin bound to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (input 105–1012 cfu/ml, data not shown). When the input phage concentration was 1012 cfu/ml, the amount of Actin89 bound to the plate was 13,000 cfu/1000 μm2. An anti-thyroglobulin phage was examined as an unrelated phage.Table IIRelation between input phage concentration and phage recovery from muscle microfragmentsPhage inputPhage recoveryActin89GFAP53Anti-thyroglobulincfu/mlcfu/1000 μm21012850 ± 3002-an=5.0.5 ± 0.22-bn=3.1.0 ± 0.42-bn=3.101173 ± 312-an=5.ND2-cND, not determined.ND101015 ± 142-an=5.NDND1090.8 ± 0.42-bn=3.NDND10802-bn=3.NDND2-a n=5.2-b n=3.2-c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We also investigated the effect of the duration of incubation on the binding of Actin89 phage to a muscle microfragment. No significant difference was observed among the numbers of the phages collected after incubation for 3, 6, 12, and 60 h. The antigen retrieval effect of solvents on muscle microfragments was evaluated by quantifying the binding capacity of Actin89 to the microfragment. Among the solvents tested (acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, chloroform, sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.01 and 0.1%), Tween 20 (1%), and paraformaldehyde (2 and 4%)), acetone and ethanol pretreatment enhanced binding capacity the most, namely, three times more than in the absence of treatment. Acetone pretreatment was employed in the standard protocol for ISPS on human muscle. We produced various size microfragments on a transverse section of human muscle by laser-dissection and incubated them with the Griffin. 1 library. The bound phages were directly eluted from microfragments and used to infect TG1 (“direct colony recovery” protocol), or the scFv sequences of bound phages were amplified by PCR and subcloned into phagemid vector pHEN2 (“PCR fragment subcloning” protocol). Phages were rescued from ampicillin-resistant colonies, and after unique clones were picked up by HaeIII-fingerprinting, their specificity for muscle antigens was checked by both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting of muscle antigens. The PCR fragment subcloning protocol yielded no phage clones from an area of 100 (10 × 10) μm2 and three phage clones from 1100 (33 × 33) μm2. The three phage clones from the 1100 μm2 microfragment showed no specificity for muscle antigens, as judged by immunostaining. When the reaction area was enlarged to 4800 μm2 (3 microfragments of 40 × 40 μm), we obtained a number of unique phage clones in two independent trials both by direct colony recovery and PCR fragment subcloning protocols (Table III, experiments A and B). The PCR fragment subcloning protocol gave us larger numbers of unique clones than the direct colony recovery protocol (Table III), because less than 1 cfu of phagemid was amplified under our PCR conditions. About 8 phage particles were equivalent to 1 cfu. 3M. Furuta, T. Ito, C. Eguchi, T. Tanaka, E. Wakabayashi-Takai, and K. Kaneko, unpublished result. The two trials, A and B, yielded three positive clones, A28, B6, and B85, which specifically reacted with 37-, 100-, and 42-kDa muscle antigens, respectively (Tables III and IV and Fig.3A). In PCR fragment subcloning experiments, the collected phages (round 1) were amplified and applied to the second round of selection (round 2) as in the same manner. In experiment A, the positive clone obtained from round 1 (A28) was again recovered in round 2; however, in experiment B, the positive clone in round 1 (B85) was not found in round 2 (Table III). This suggested that repeated panning steps sometimes lost positive clones that were present in the earlier round of phage pool.Table IIIProfile of in situ phage screening on 4800 μm2 of muscle microfragmentsExperimentNumber of clonesAnalyzedUniquePositiveADirect330PCR round 172291PCR round 22481BDirect22141PCR round 172471PCR round 272230C PCR48132D PCR48111E PCR4893 Open table in a new tab Table IVFeatures of anti-muscle scFv clonesCloneWesternAntigenIHC4-aIHC, immunohistochemistry; IS, immunoscreening; ND, not determined.ISkDaA2837Tropomyosin-α++B6100α-Actinin 2++B8542α-Actin−NDC2242α-Actin−NDC43210Myosin heavy chain IIa++D242α-Actin−NDE2210Myosin heavy chain β++E642α-Actin+−E3042α-Actin−ND4-a IHC, immunohistochemistry; IS, immunoscreening; ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab We planned another series of experiments by using a longitudinal muscle section to obtain a homogeneous distribution at the reaction surface of muscle antigens which localized in muscle-specific, repeating zone structures such as the A- and I-bands. The screening was also performed on 4800-μm2 microfragments by using the Griffin. 1 library. Three independent trials (experiments C, D, and E) yielded scFv clones reactive with 210-kDa protein (C43 and E2) and 42-kDa protein (C22, D2, E6, and E30) by the PCR fragment subcloning protocol (Tables III and IV). The results of one-dimensional Western analysis using the representative phage clones (A28, B6, E2, and E6) are demonstrated in Fig. 3A. As seen, the reactivity of these scFvs was markedly enhanced by Tween treatment of the blot membranes (12Van Dam A.P. Van den Brink H.G. Smeenk R.J.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 129: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because these scFv phages were selected on a frozen-section mildly fixed by acetone, they may have preferentially reacted with renatured antigens on the membrane. A considerable number of phages with low specificity that reacted with multiple bands on muscle Western analysis were obtained through experiments A through E (data not shown). Two-dimensional Western blotting of muscle proteins was performed by using positive scFv phages, and their corresponding antigens were assigned on a Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel (Fig.3, B–D). The 42-kDa protein recognized by several clones (B85, C22, D2, E6, and E30) had a pI of 5.2 and was classified as α-actin (Fig. 3B, Ac), which accounts for about 20% of the total protein in muscle (14Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Similarly, the 210-kDa antigen had a pI of 5.8 and was classified as a myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3B, My), which weighed about 40% of the total proteins in muscle (14Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), although it was not efficiently displayed on our two-dimensional gel system when compared with the results of a previous researcher who used agarose gel for the first dimension (15Hirabayashi T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These assignments of the 42-kDa and 210-kDa spots were confirmed both by Western analysis of the same two-dimensional blots using anti-actin or anti-myosin heavy chain mouse monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Clone A28 recognized a doublet protein spot of 36–37 kDa with a pI of 4.7, suggesting that it reacted with more than one isoform of the antigen (Fig. 3C). Clone B6 recognized a single spot of 100 kDa with a pI of 5.3 (Fig. 3D). These antigens were also assigned to spots on the two-dimensional gel (Fig.3B, A28 and B6, respectively). Because the scFv phages A28 and B6 were highly specific, immunoscreening of a human muscle expression library (cloned in λ TriplEx vector, CLONTECH Laboratories) was performed to identify the corresponding antigens (Fig. 3E). We found 80 positive plaques for A28 out of 1.2 × 104λ clones and 3 positive plaques for B6 out of 1.2 × 105 λ clones. For A28, four of the five λ inserts had a sequence that matched the human cDNA sequence of tropomyosin-α (TPM3) 100%, and the other λ insert matched the other isoform of tropomyosin-α (TPM1). For B6, all three sequences of the λ inserts completely matched the human α-actinin 2 sequence. The observed molecular masses and pI values for the two protein spots were consistent with those calculated for tropomyosin-α (33 kDa and 4.6) and α-actinin 2 (104 kDa and 5.3). To confirm the results of immunoscreening, the 37- and 100-kDa protein spots visualized by copper-staining (Bio-Rad) were cut out, digestedin gel with trypsin (1Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar), and subjected to mass fingerprinting analysis with a MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometer (13Kinumi T. Tobin S.L. Matsumoto H. Jackson K.W. Ohashi M. Eur. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 3: 367-378Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The masses of the tryptic peptides obtained for the 36- to 37-kDa protein best matched those of α- and β-tropomyosin. Similarly, a mass fingerprint of the 100-kDa protein closely matched that of α-actinin 2. Histochemical examination revealed that scFv phages A28 (anti-tropomyosin) and B6 (anti-α-actinin) diffusely stained muscle cells (Fig. 4). Anti-myosin heavy chain phage E2 stained muscle cells in an isoform-dependent manner (Fig. 4), and another anti-myosin heavy chain phage, C43, also showed an isoform-dependent staining pattern (data not shown). As expected, the isoforms of the myosin heavy chain recognized by the phage clones C43 and E2 were identified by immunoscreening to be the myosin heavy chains IIa and β (MYH7), respectively. By contrast, only one of the five clones of anti-actin scFv phage, E6, weakly stained the muscle cells, possibly because of the low affinity of anti-actin scFvs for F-actin. The features of the anti-muscle scFvs are listed in Table IV. We performed ISPS on a 4800-μm2 microarea of muscle. The 40 × 40-μm area corresponded to about 0.5–1.0 transverse sections of muscle cells (see Fig. 2C). A single round of selection was fruitful in all of our trials (experiments A through E) to obtain specific scFvs against minute amounts of antigens present in a microarea, resulting in the identification of the muscle proteins by immunoscreening. Most of the specific scFv phages obtained here were for major muscle antigens, i.e. myosin heavy chain, α-actin, and tropomyosin-α, present in the reaction area. Myosin and actin are the two major constituents of muscle and account for about 40 and 20%, respectively, of the total weight of muscle protein (14Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). One or more tropomyosins comprise the third major protein in muscle (accounting for about 5% of the total (14Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). Because the total amount of proteins in a 4-mm2 muscle section that was 2-μm thick was measured 2.5 μg (n = 4), the amount of tropomyosin in a 4800-μm2 microfragment was 150 pg; therefore, 31 fg = 6 × 105 molecules of tropomyosin was estimated to exist in 1-μm2microfragments (2-μm thick). To our surprise, we also succeeded in obtaining an scFv phage against α-actinin 2, which accounts for only 1% of muscle protein (14Ohtsuki I. Maruyama K. Ebashi S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 1-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar); hence, the total weight in 4800 μm2 is 30 pg (similarly, 6.3 fg = 4 × 104 molecules of α-actinin/μm2microfragments). The reason why the scFv for such a minor component (α-actinin 2) was selected may have been the strong antigenicity of the antigen or the high abundance of one or more anti-α-actinin scFvs in the Griffin. 1 library. Another possibility is that a portion of the Z-disk, in which α-actinin is localized (16Masaki T. Endo M. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. 1967; 62: 630-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), was efficiently exposed to the reaction surface on the transverse sections. To select scFvs against minor antigens existing in target structures, a single round, rather than multiple rounds, of selection was recommended, because positive clones could be lost during repeated rounds of selection. Presumably, changes in phage population in a phage pool through the steps of panning are affected not only by the reactivity of scFvs displayed on the phage particles but also by biological factors such as the efficiency of phage production or the growth rates of E. coli in each clone. High throughput analysis of the initial round of clones, which involves picking up unique clones from a large pool of redundant colonies and producing each clone phage, is a key for the further advance of ISPS. We noted the high quality of the phage antibodies (scFvs) selected against such minute amounts of antigens in situ from the Griffin. 1 library. Among the phage antibodies obtained here, anti-myosin heavy chain phage antibodies are definitely specific for one or more isoforms on immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4) and immunoscreening, indicating that they are reliable for immunological examinations. As expected, many of the antibodies obtained by ISPS in this study can be used for Western analyses, immunohistochemistry, and immunoscreening (Table IV). Interestingly, the obtained phage antibodies showed higher reactivity against renatured antigens (Fig.3A), suggesting that “conformation-dependent” phage antibodies can be selected by ISPS. Thus, phage antibodies that are useful for a wide variety of immunological and biochemical analyses of the target antigens could be obtained by ISPS in combination with the Griffin. 1 library. Theoretically, ISPS can also be applied to structures consisting of non-protein components, such as complex sugars and lipids. When monoclonal antibodies are obtained against non-protein components, the antigens can be identified by other methods besides immunoscreening, for example, by immunoaffinity purification. A major technical problem encountered in this study was that the collected target fragments tended to stick to the inside of glass capillaries. This was partially prevented by the addition of detergent to the buffer overlaid on tissues or by careful manipulation of the capillaries. Siliconization of capillaries was not effective to solve this problem. In this case, fragments collected from paraffin sections were not very sticky to glass capillaries. When the target structures were very small (less than 10 μm), we found another problem, namely that substantial amounts of the collected targets were lost during washing by centrifugation. This problem remains to be solved. On the other hand, when the target structures were rather large (100 μm or more), no such problems were encountered through the experimental steps. Relatively large targets could be collected directly into PCR reactions by using a needle under a stereomicroscope after tissue sections were washed on glass and dried. In this method, it was not necessary to overlay a buffer on tissue sections during collection or to wash the collected targets by centrifugation. There are four factors that may affect the sensitivity of ISPS: 1) the avidity of scFv phages for their target antigen (which depends on theKd and the valence of the displayed scFvs), 2) the phage concentration, 3) the amount of antigens involved in the reaction, and 4) the reactivity of the antigens (affected by treatment of tissue section, such as by fixation, antigen retrieval treatment, drying, or others). The proteins in paraffin sections, the most common source of tissue samples, seemed to be less reactive with scFvs, possibly due to the lower reactivity of the antigens (data not shown). It is important to find an effective method of antigen retrieval for a variety of histopathological structures when paraffin sections are used for ISPS. The scFv library can be modified to further improve the sensitivity of ISPS, because higher concentrations of individual phages are needed to detect lower amounts of antigens. Libraries with different diversities may be applied to a target structure depending on the amount of antigens to be identified. In the last decade, applications of mass spectrometry (MS) to peptide profiling (17Jimenez C.R., Li, K.W. Dreisewerd K. Spijker S. Kingston R. Bateman R.H. Burlingame A.L. Smit A.B. van Minnen J. Geraerts W.P.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2070-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), protein profiling (18Chaurand P. Stoeckli M. Caprioli R.M. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 5263-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and imaging of protein distribution (19Stoeckli M. Chaurand P. Hallahan D.E. Caprioli R.M. Nature Med. 2001; 7: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) in tissue samples have been developed. The literature does not describe the amount of tissue needed for MS-based protein identification, although as little as 5 ng of protein has been identified by MS after separation on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out, however, that ISPS was the only approach that enabled us to obtain highly specific monoclonal antibodies by using such a minute amount of tissue components. We were able to collect more than 100 target microstructures in 1 day, depending on their abundance in a tissue section. ISPS may enable the identification of even minor components of bodies, plaques, or microdeposits of unknown components in various organs or subcutaneous lesions in focal and systemic disorders. Some of these microstructures seen in neuromuscular and systemic disorders are now under investigation.

We have designed Gi/oα subunits fused to the cyan fluorescent protein and assayed their function by studying the following two signal transduction pathways: the regulation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir3.0 family) and adenylate cyclase. Palmitoylation and myristoylation consensus sites were removed from Gi/o α subunits (Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, and GoAα) and a mutation introduced at Cys−4 rendering the subunit resistant to pertussis toxin. This construct was fused in-frame with cyan fluorescent protein containing a short peptide motif from GAP43 that directs palmitoylation and thus membrane targeting. Western blotting confirmed Gi/oα protein expression. Confocal microscopy and biochemical fractionation studies revealed membrane localization. Each mutant Gi/o α subunit significantly reduced basal current density when transiently expressed in a stable cell line expressing Kir3.1 and Kir3.2A, consistent with the sequestration of the Gβγ dimer by the mutant Gα subunit. Moreover, each subunit was able to support A1-mediated and D2S-mediated channel activation when transiently expressed in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Overexpression of tagged Gi3α and GoAα α subunits reduced receptor-mediated and forskolin-induced cAMP mobilization.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 211-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cloning techniques have enabled GFP to be fused with a protein of interest, and localization of such fusion proteins can then be studied in a dynamic fashion in living cells using fluorescence microscopy. In addition, protein-protein interactions can be studied using spectrally shifted variants of GFP and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (4Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Presley J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Selvin P.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The mobility of proteins can be assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (2Lippincott-Schwartz J. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 557-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7Reits E.A. Neefjes J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E145-E147Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). It is clear that an enormous number of distinct intellectual areas have benefited from the use of this technology. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) present at the cell membrane transduce signals to effectors via heterotrimeric G-proteins (8Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Given the importance of these pathways in physiology and pharmacology, it might be expected that fluorescent protein technologies would have a significant bearing. A major limitation, however, of these techniques is that the addition of GFP, which has a compact structure, can abolish or severely impair the function of the protein to which it is attached. However, it is apparent that some GPCRs can be fused in-frame with GFP such that function is preserved, and these have been used to study agonist-dependent receptor internalization (9Milligan G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although it is possible to tag Gβ with these fluorescent proteins (10Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 537: 679-692Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the expression of functional G-protein α subunits has proved more elusive. In the studies published to date, investigators have placed GFP internally in a region known to tolerate insertions (10Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 12Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4227-4235Google Scholar, 13Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we adopt a novel strategy. We fuse in a chimeric open reading frame CFP with the G-protein α subunit, and membrane attachment is directed by a short peptide motif from another protein (GAP43) that leads to palmitoylation. To engineer CFP-tagged Gα subunits, we based our constructs on the ECFP-Mem vector obtained from CLONTECH. PCR primers were designed for the Gi/o α subunits. The forward primer included the C terminus of CFP (including the native BsrGI site) minus the stop codon in-frame with the Gi/o α subunit. It simultaneously introduced the mutations to remove the native myristoylation and palmitoylation signals (Fig. 1). The reverse primer contained a NotI site and introduced the C-I mutation to render the subunit resistant to pertussis toxin (PTx) (Fig.1). PCR was performed using high fidelity Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the products were subcloned in-frame with ECFP-Mem using a BsrGI/NotI digest and standard subcloning techniques. The final cDNAs were sequenced using an automated sequencer (ABI377 from Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Cell culture, transient transfection, and generation of HEK293 stable cell lines were as described previously (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stable HEK293 lines expressing Gi3α-CFP and GoAα-CFP α subunits were selected with media containing 727 μg/ml G418 and clonal isolates selected and screened with fluorescence microscopy. In electrophysiological experiments transfected cells were identified by epifluorescence after transfection of the intrinsically fluorescent G-protein or after cotransfection with 50 ng of enhanced GFP-N1. For the images obtained in Fig.2 A, living HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the constructs as indicated and imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Samples were excited using a 458-nm laser line, and images were obtained using an emission 500–550-nm bandpass filter. For the images obtained in Fig. 2 B, clonal isolates of stable HEK293 cells expressing Gi3α-CFP and GoAα-CFP α subunits were imaged using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Samples were excited using a 458-nm laser line, and images were obtained using a 500-nm long bandpass filter. Images were processed using Confocal Assistant version 4.02. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum that recognizes GFP and its spectral variants was obtained from CLONTECH. It was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and preparation of cell lysates, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (16Tinker A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Giblin J.P. Leaney J.L. Tinker A. J. Biol.

Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping into ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 NaCl, pH 7.4; TBS), pelleted, and resuspended in 1% deoxycholate in TBS with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,800 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a volume of TBS equivalent to that of the supernatant, and equal quantities were denatured with 6× gel loading buffer. Equal volumes were visualized using Western blotting as above. To isolate a cytosolic and membrane fraction, HEK293 cells were harvested as above. The cell pellet was resuspended and subjected to hypotonic osmotic shock in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 15 min an equal volume of 500 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added, and the suspension was further fragmented by homogenization with a glass-on-glass Dounce homogenizer. This suspension was subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove unfragmented cells and nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended and homogenized in a volume of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, equal to that of the supernatant. Equivalent quantities were denatured with 6× gel loading buffer and prepared for Western blotting as above. The supernatant represents the cytosolic fraction and the pellet the particulate fraction. Signal was quantitated from brief exposures of nitrocellulose to photographic film and was analyzed using Scion Image according to the protocols for gel quantification described in the program. HEK293 cells lines were loaded with 2-[3H]adenine (Amersham Biosciences; 2 μCi/ml) overnight, washed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), and incubated in 10 μm Ro-1724 in Opti-MEM for 30 min. Experiments were performed to measure basal cAMP accumulation and cAMP accumulation after treatment with 5 μm NECA or 10 μm forskolin for 15 min at 37 °C. Experiments were performed in triplicate at least four times. Assays for cAMP were performed using dual column chromatography as described previously (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Results were calculated as the fraction of the total labeled pool converted to cAMP. Results are shown in the figure as a relative increase over basal accumulation. Whole cell membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were pulled from filamented borosilicate glass (Clark Electromedical) and had a resistance of 1.5–2.5 megohms when filled with pipette solution (see below). Prior to filling, tips of patch pipettes were coated with a parafilm/mineral oil suspension. Data were acquired and analyzed using a Digidata 1200B interface (Axon Instruments) and pClamp software (version 6.0; Axon Instruments). Cell capacitance was ∼15 picofarads and series resistance (<10 megohms) was at least 75% compensated using the amplifier circuitry. Recordings of membrane current were commenced after an equilibration period of ∼5 min. Cells were perfused using a simple gravity-fed bath perfusion system. Drugs were applied using a “sewer pipe” system (Rapid Solution Changer RSC-160; Bio-Logic; experiments shown in Fig. 5, Band C, and Fig. 6) as described previously (19Leaney J.L. Dekker L.V. Tinker A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 367-379Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Membrane currents were measured at the potential indicated, and all data are presented as mean ± S.E. where n indicates the number of cells recorded from. Solutions were as follows (concentrations in mm): pipette solution, 107 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP (KOH to pH 7.2, ∼140 mm total K+); bath solution, 140 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. All chemicals were from Sigma orCalbiochem. Drugs were made up as concentrated stock solutions and kept at −20 °C.Figure 6Functional rescue of D2S receptor-channel coupling by expression of CFP-labeled Gi/o proteins in PTx-treated cells (0.5 μg of cDNA for a 35-mm well transfection).

Gi/o α subunits are acylated by both myristate at a glycine 2 and by palmitate at a cysteine 3. Myristoylation is irreversible, whereas palmitoylation is reversible and potentially regulated (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 21Chen C.A. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

G-proteins of the Gi/o class are also characteristically inhibited by PTx which acts by ADP-ribosylating a cysteine four amino acids from the end of the C terminus (8Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to either glycine or isoleucine renders it resistant to the action of the toxin but still functional (23Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hunt T.W. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus by PTx treating cells to inactivate endogenously expressed Gi/oα subunits, it is possible to selectively study the interaction of a transfected and potentially chimeric or mutant G-protein. We have shown the usefulness of this approach for dissecting out the interaction of different receptors with different Gi/o isoforms (15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, it is becoming clear that proteins are targeted to different subcellular compartments using short peptide motifs or because of post-translational modifications. Indeed, the acylation of G-protein α subunits is thought to be responsible for their plasma membrane localization. Removal of these consensus sites results in cytosolic localization and failure of activation by surface membrane-located receptors (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 26Milligan G. Grassie M.A. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inclusion of short peptide sequences directing palmitoylation and/or myristoylation motifs to a soluble heterologous protein results in membrane localization of the chimeric protein (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Given these considerations we have constructed chimeric mutant molecules that contain the dual palmitoylation signal from GAP43, fused in-frame with CFP. This in turn is fused with the Gi/o α subunit (Gi1α, Gi2α, Gi3α, and GoAα) mutated so that the native myristoylation signal and palmitoylation signals are removed and a C-terminal C-I mutation renders it resistant to the actions of PTx (15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,23Senogles S.E. J. Biol.

It is unlikely that the Gi/o-CFP α subunit would be myristoylated or palmitoylated if the signal were not removed. However, it means a potential ambiguity is eliminated, and membrane attachment is directed solely by the engineered signal. We first examined the subcellular distribution of these proteins. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed after transient transfection of these constructs into HEK293 cells. All CFP-Gi/oα constructs showed a qualitatively similar picture of localization. Representative images for two of these, Gi2α and GoAα, are shown (Fig.2 A), and it is clear that there is prominent membrane staining. However in some images, in addition to a plasmalemmal localization, a fraction of the Gi/o protein α subunit is also present within the cell in intracellular structures. To facilitate the functional characterization of these chimeric proteins, we constructed monoclonal stable lines in HEK293 cells. Confocal microscopy confirmed similar localization with Gi3α and GoAα after stable expression (Fig.2 B). We next investigated the biochemical characteristics of these chimeric G-protein α subunits. Western blotting confirmed that full-length proteins could be identified. A fraction of the cell lysate was immunoblotted with a commercially available antibody to GFP and its spectral variants. There is a band of the expected molecular weight present in transfected but not sham-transfected (control) cells (arrow in Fig. 3 A). There is also a background band recognized by the antibody in all lanes but this has a different mobility (∼ in Fig. 3 A). There were no bands at the molecular weight of GFP indicating that there was little, if any, cleavage of the fusion protein. One potential explanation for the intracellular staining as shown in Fig. 2 is that some of the protein resides in insoluble intracellular aggregates. We tested this by isolating aggregosomes according to established procedures (18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”) from a clonal isolate of a HEK293 stable line expressing GoAα-CFP. It is apparent that some of the protein is insoluble, but the majority is present in a detergent-extractable form (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained with Gi3α-CFP (not shown). We further investigated the membrane localization of these proteins and by performing cell fractionation studies from monoclonal isolates of HEK293 cells expressing Gi3α-CFP and GoAα-CFP. It is apparent both qualitatively and quantitatively that the majority of protein resides in a particulate fraction (Fig. 3 C). The background band (∼ in Fig. 3,A and B) disappears after removal of the cell nuclei. G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels were first identified in atrial myocytes where they were activated by acetylcholine at muscarinic M2 receptors (28Trautwein W. Dudel J. Pfluegers Arch. 1958; 266: 324-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Noma A. Trautwein W. Pfluegers Arch. 1978; 377: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Stimulation of this current was responsible for slowing of the heart rate in response to vagal nerve stimulation. It was subsequently shown that this activation was sensitive to PTx implicating the family of Gi/o proteins (30Pfaffinger P.J. Martin J.M. Hunter D.D. Nathanson N.M. Hille B. Nature. 1985; 317: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The channel is a heteromultimer of members of the Kir3.0 subfamily (31Kubo Y. Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Activation of these channels, both native and cloned, has been shown to be membrane-delimited, involving a direct interaction with the G-protein βγ dimer (35Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of different Gβγ subunit combinations have been shown to be similarly effective at potentiating these currents (36Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) with the exception of dimers composed of Gβ5 (37Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our own studies (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Leaney J.L. Dekker L.V. Tinker A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 367-379Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have been concerned with how selective activation of Kir3.1/3.2A is achieved. By using a number of Kir3.1 + 3.2A-expressing stable cell lines we have developed, some of which additionally express a GPCR, we can examine the functionality of the engineered G-protein α subunit in two ways. First, basal channel activity is determined by the availability of free Gβγ in the membrane. By overexpressing proteins or domains of proteins known to bind Gβγ, basal channel activity can be reduced. A HEK293 stable line cell line expressing Kir3.1 and 3.2A has significant basal inwardly rectifying K+ currents in the absence of receptor activation (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have observed previously (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that overexpression of G-protein α subunits can suppress basal currents. Similarly, in the current study, we overexpressed the CFP-tagged G-protein α subunits in this same cell line. Fig.4 A shows representative whole cell recordings, and Fig. 4 B summarizes the data. Channel activity was significantly reduced indicating that these G-protein α subunits can interact with Gβγ. Second, by treating a HEK293 cell line expressing the A1 adenosine receptor and the channel complex Kir3.1/3.2A with PTx (100 ng/ml for 16 h), we abolished the coupling of the A1 receptor with endogenous Gi/o α subunits and subsequent channel activation (15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In PTx-treated cells, overexpression of the CFP-tagged Gi/o α subunits can rescue coupling between the receptor and channel. Fig. 5 A shows whole cell recordings after transient expression of the A1 receptor and the CFP-tagged Gi2α α subunit in a cell line expressing Kir3.1 and Kir3.2A. Application of NECA, an A1 receptor agonist, in PTx-treated cells leads to significant stimulation of an inwardly rectifying K+ current. We next examined the effect of expression of the CFP-tagged Gi/o α subunit in a HEK293 stable cell line that expresses a fixed level of A1 receptor and channel complex, Kir3.1 and Kir3.2A (designated HKir3.1/3.2/A1). Fig.5 B shows current records at a fixed holding potential of −60 mV using a perfusion system that allows the rapid application of agonist. The control is shown in the upper left panel where the application of a saturating dose of NECA (1 μm) results in significant current activation in HKir3.1/3.2/A1 cells. PTx completely abolished current activation (Basal = −65.5 ± 9.9 pA/pF; +1 μm NECA = −57.2 ± 9.3 pA/pF; Wash = −56.4 ± 9.0 pA/pF, n = 12). In contrast, transfection of HKir3.1/3.2/A1 cells with a PTx-insensitive Gα subunit and subsequent PTx treatment leads to rescue of coupling between receptor and channel (Gi2αCG, upper right panel) (15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analogous experiments were performed in which CFP-tagged G-protein α subunits were expressed in the Kir3.1/3.2/A1 cell line. The CFP-Gi2α and CFP-GoAα shown in the lower panels of Fig. 5, B andC, summarize the data from a number of experiments. It shows that the CFP-tagged Gi/o variants are able to support equivalent current increases to that seen through untagged Gi/o PTx-resistant G-proteins (Gi2α is shown as an example in Fig. 5 C) and through native G-proteins without PTx treatment. The transient increase observed in currents on removal of agonist was found consistently in a proportion of the cells studied, and we are investigating this in more detail. Can the chimeric fluorescent G-protein α subunits rescue coupling to a receptor other than the A1 receptor? We performed an analogous series of experiments to those in Fig. 5, B and C, with a stable cell line expressing the D2S receptor and Kir3.1/3.2A (HKir3.1/3.2/D2S). The GoAα-CFP construct was expressed transiently in PTx-treated cells and was able to rescue coupling between the receptor and channel complex (Fig.6, A and B). However, as shown previously (15Leaney J.L. Tinker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5651-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the efficacy of coupling to the D2S receptor through mutant G-proteins was reduced compared with that occurring through endogenous G-proteins. We are currently undertaking more detailed studies of the kinetic responses of the channel to receptor stimulation using these and other tools. Our data show that the CFP-tagged G-proteins are able to interact productively with receptors, to exchange GTP for GDP, and liberate free Gβγ that is able to activate Kir3.1/3.2A. Finally, we investigated the functionality of these G-proteins with another signaling pathway, specifically the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. We examined the effects of overexpression of the fluorescent chimeric G-protein α subunits on cAMP accumulation after receptor stimulation and after treatment with forskolin; an activator of all isoforms of adenylate cyclase. Our studies had previously revealed (14Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) a small but statistically significant increase in cAMP accumulation in cells treated with 1 μm NECA. Other investigators (38Cooper J. Hill S.J. Alexander S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that HEK293 cells possess an endogenous Gs-coupled A2B receptor. In agreement with this, the addition of 5 μm NECA led to a substantial and significant increase in cAMP in HEK293 cells and also in clonal isolates of stable cell lines expressing Kir3.1/3.2A and SUR2B/Kir6.1 (Fig.7 A). In contrast, in clonal isolates of HEK293 stable lines overexpressing Gi3α-CFP (two separate isolates) and GoAα-CFP, the increase was essentially abolished (Fig. 7 A). The relative effects of forskolin were also examined. Similarly, 10 μm forskolin led to substantial increases in cAMP in these cell lines (Fig.7 B). However, the increase was reduced in clonal isolates of stable HEK293 lines overexpressing Gi3α-CFP (two separate isolates) and GoAα-CFP (Fig. 7 B). The difference in the magnitude of reduction, between receptor-mediated pathways and that occurring with forskolin, is explained potentially by the greater number of adenylate cyclase isoforms stimulated by forskolin. Indeed some isoforms are not sensitive to Gi3α or GoAα (39Tang W.J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40Hurley J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7599-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus overexpression of these chimeric fluorescent G-proteins results in significant attenuation of cAMP signaling. Plausibly, this occurs because overexpression results in a significant (but proportionately small) fraction that is GTP bound and is active in the absence of receptor stimulation. Our data clearly demonstrate that it is feasible to engineer a functional and fluorescent Gi/o α subunit. In particular, it is possible to remove the native acylation signal but generate membrane attachment and functionality by substituting the signal from another protein (GAP43) in a distinct and separate position in a chimeric molecule. It is apparent that it is possible to construct functional receptor-G-protein fusions. In this case the acylation signal is removed in an analogous fashion, and the complex is targeted to the plasma membrane by fusion in a chimeric reading frame with a receptor, a seven-pass transmembrane protein (41Wise A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24673-24678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Attempts to introduce GFP into this construct led to a complex that expressed and was able to bind GTP in an agonist-dependent fashion but did not functionally couple with adenylate cyclase (42Bevan N. Palmer T. Drmota T. Wise A. Coote J. Milligan G. Rees S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our strategy is novel because it uses a short peptide motif directing lipid modification that targets the protein to the plasma membrane. Other investigators have relied on inserting the fluorescent protein in internal sites in the G-protein α subunit known to tolerate the introduction of short epitopes. GAP43 is involved in neuronal growth cone development and is membrane-targeted by a dual palmitoylation signal at Cys3and Cys4. The native signal on Gi/o subunits is myristoylation and palmitoylation on Gly2 and Cys3, respectively. We have also engineered, in comparable manner to that shown in Fig. 1 A, a fusion that includes an analogous signal from the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Lyn, and this too is functional (not shown). We are actively investigating differences between these two constructs. There has also been interest in the localization of Gi/o α subunits to cholesterol-rich and cold detergent-insoluble domains in the plasma membrane such as rafts and the related caveolae. There is evidence suggesting that both kinds of modification can target their cognate protein (GAP43, Gi/o subunit, Lyn) to such membrane specializations (20Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 43van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 44Galbiati F. Milligan G.

J. 2001; 80: 2120-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Theoretically, it should be possible to design tethering signals that do not target the G-protein to rafts and thus examine the consequences for signaling (47Wenzel-Seifert K. Lee T.W. Seifert R. Kobilka B.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, recently differential trafficking to membrane domains has been observed for a variety lipid modifications attached to fluorescent proteins (48Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Our fluorescent Gi/o α subunits are novel tools that can be used to dynamically study the Gi/oα subunit localization, while simultaneously and selectively investigating functional consequences by treating with PTx. Furthermore, they can potentially be used for investigating protein-protein interactions using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based technologies and G-protein mobility using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Finally, they provide an easy means of assessing expression level and potentially titrating this at the membrane in individual living cells. A.

For example, the assembly of a gene into chromatin represses transcription by limiting access of the transcriptional machinery to the DNA template (1Tyler J.K. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1999; 99: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulatory proteins therefore recruit chromatin remodeling activities to either facilitate or inhibit access of DNA-binding proteins to their target sequences (2Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 3Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). It can be predicted, therefore, that proteins associated with DNA replication and repair will also have to be able to regulate chromatin structure. Consistent with this, the largest subunit of the human origin recognition complex, ORC1, and the replication factor minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) have both been found to interact with factors containing histone acetyltransferase (HAT)1 activity (4Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 5Burke T.W. Cook J.G. Asano M. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15397-15408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that ORC1 might fulfill an important function regulating chromatin structure and facilitating the binding of other components of the DNA replication machinery. Acetylation of the amino-terminal tails of core histones alters nucleosome structure and facilitates both the recruitment of DNA-binding proteins and other chromatin remodeling activities (2Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 6Winston F. Allis C.D. Nat. Struct.

In the context of transcriptional regulation, HAT activity is therefore generally associated with the stimulation of gene expression, and it can be assumed that it will be similarly associated with the positive regulation of DNA replication and repair (8Chen H.W. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Proteins with HAT activity, however, do not always acetylate histones. Many non-histone substrates have been identified, including DNA-binding proteins such as the tumor suppressor p53, components of the basal transcription apparatus, and the architectural transcription factor high mobility group protein I(Y) (HMG I(Y)) (2Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this latter case, acetylation of HMG I(Y) on lysine 71 by GCN5 stimulates the ability of the protein to promote transcription from the β-interferon promoter. In contrast, acetylation on lysine 65 by CREB-binding protein (CBP) inhibits HMG I(Y) function and is associated with the termination of β-interferon transcription (11Munshi N. Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Merika M. Chen G.Y. Thanos D. Science. 2001; 293: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus the association of HAT activity with a protein should not automatically be interpreted as an indication of an effect on chromatin structure. In contrast to proteins with HAT activity, histone deacetylases are often associated with transcriptional repression (12Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 13Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). However, proteins that participate in DNA replication and repair have also been described associating with histone deacetylase activity. For example, the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) have been shown to interact with histone deacetylases (14Yarden R.I. Brody L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4983-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Kim G.D. Choi Y.H. Dimtchev A. Jeong S.J. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31127-31130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RbAp48 subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), a protein complex that facilitates the assembly of nucleosomes onto newly replicated DNA (16Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 17Gaillard P.H.L. Martini E.M.D. Kaufman P.D. Stillman B. Moustacchi E. Almouzni G.

RFC (p140) is a component of the pentameric replication factor C (RFC) complex (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). RFC functions as a clamp loader and facilitates both the loading and unloading of PCNA at sites of DNA synthesis (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA functions both to recruit DNA polymerase and CAF1, giving it a role both in stimulating DNA synthesis and in subsequent chromatin assembly (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). It is apparent, however, that RFC (p140) has the potential to regulate other cellular processes and participate as a component of many protein complexes. RFC (p140) has been described in a large protein complex containing both BRCA1 and ATM, termed the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC), which has been postulated to act as a sensor for DNA damage (22Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, RFC (p140) contains an LXCXE motif and can bind directly to Rb (23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and consistent with it having a dynamic regulatory function, RFC (p140) binding to Rb was shown to have a prosurvival function following ultraviolet light stimulation (23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both Rb and BRCA1 have important functions as transcriptional regulators (24Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 25Chen Y.M. Lee W.H. Chew H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that RFC (p140) might also have a dual role as a regulator of gene expression. Consistent with this, RFC (p140) was recently described as a transcriptional coactivator for the bZIP transcription factor C/EBPα (26Hong S.H. Park S.J. Kong H.J. Shuman J.D. Cheong J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28098-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that RFC (p140) is associated with histone deacetylase activity and can directly bind HDAC1. Moreover, we demonstrate that when directly targeted to a promoter, RFC (p140) functions as a potent, histone deacetylase-dependent repressor of transcription. These results suggest that the cellular function of RFC (p140) is complex, and that in addition to its role as a clamp loader it also has the potential to regulate chromatin structure and repress transcription. The full-length RFC (p140) cDNA was isolated from human foreskin fibroblast cell RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into the KpnI site of pCDNA3 or pCGN, which inserted an HA tag at its amino terminus and the NcoI/NotI sites of pVR1012Gal4 (27Snowden A.W. Anderson L.A. Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2676-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fragments of RFC (p140) were isolated by PCR from the original clone and inserted into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pGEX CD1 (to make glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins), the KpnI site of pCGN (to make HA epitope-tagged proteins), or the SalI/XhoI sites of pVR1012Gal4. RFC (p140) F1Δ1–36 was generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primer: CTGCGGCCGCCAGCAAAGAAAGGAATAAAGGAAATC. RFC (p140) F3 LXGXK was generated by overlap extension PCR using the following primers to create the mutation: ctggtgggtcagaagttgggatacagctacgtggaactg and cttctgacccaccagggaagctgtggtggttttgccaacacc. GST fusions were created by subcloning into the NcoI and XhoI sites of PGEX CD1, similar to their wild type equivalents. Gal4 fusions were created by subcloning into the NotI/XbaI sites of pVR1012Gal4. Since these sites differed from the wild type versions of Gal4-RFC (p140) F1 and F3 described above, the wild type versions were remade using the same sites. These latter plasmids were used only in Fig. 3, D and E and were functionally identical to the original Gal4 fusion proteins. All PCR products and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The pCDNA3 HA-tagged HDAC1 and pING 14A-HDAC1 plasmids were supplied by Dr. Andy Bannister and Professor Tony Kouzarides (University of Cambridge). The reporter plasmids G5 TK-CAT and G0 TK-CAT were supplied by Dr. Stefan Roberts. The polyclonal RFC (p140) antibody was generated using a purified, His-tagged fragment of the protein (amino acids 1–369) expressed in Escherichia coli. The antibody was raised in sheep by the Scottish Antibody Production Unit (SAPU). The HA tag antibody was obtained from Dr. Barbara Spruce (University of Dundee). The Gal4 antibody was supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (cat. no. sc-510). The HDAC1 antibody was supplied by CN Biosciences (cat. no. PC544T). Nuclear extracts, Western blots, and immunoprecipitations were prepared and performed essentially as described previously (28Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear protein extracts were obtained from the Computer Cell Culture Center (Belgium). HEK293 cell nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (29Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Where indicated, addition of ethidium bromide occurred at the point of addition of RFC (p140) antibody to the HeLa nuclear protein extract. GST and GST·RFC (p140) domains F1–F4 were expressed in E. coli and purified using glutathione-agarose as described previously (30Chapman N.R. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). GST pull-down assays were also performed as previously described (30Chapman N.R. Perkins N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4719-4725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To enhance solubility, protein extracts for both wild type and mutant versions of GST·RFC (p140) F3 were made in the presence of 2% sarkosyl. Subsequent purification was then performed in the presence of 1.5% Triton as described previously (31Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Where indicated, addition of ethidium bromide occurred at the point GST fusion proteins were mixed with reticulocyte lysate extracts. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Calcium phosphate transfections of HEK293 cells have been described previously (28Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were split 2 h before transfection and harvested after 48 h. Inhibition of enzyme activity by trichostatin A (TSA) (Upstate Biotechnology) was performed by incubation of samples with 300 nm TSA for 24 h before harvesting cells. All CAT assays shown are representative of at least three separate experiments. 3H-acetylated H4 peptide (corresponding to the amino terminal 24 amino acids of bovine histone H4) was supplied by Prof. Tony Kouzarides and has been described previously (32Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). HeLa cell nuclear protein extract (Computer Cell Culture Center, Belgium) was immunoprecipitated with either an anti-RFC (p140) antibody or an IgG control antibody. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with H4 peptide for 3 h at 37 °C. HDAC activity was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl acetate-soluble [3H]acetic acid. To determine whether RFC (p140) associates with histone deacetylase activity, the endogenous protein was immunoprecipitated from either HeLa or HEK293 cell nuclear protein extracts. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated complex in a histone deacetylase assay demonstrated the presence of deacetylase activity associated with the endogenous RFC (p140) complex (Fig. 1, A and B). No significant deacetylase activity was observed with preimmune serum. To confirm this interaction, RFC (p140) was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with both RFC (p140) and (HA) epitope-tagged HDAC1 expression plasmids. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated complex with anti-HA antibody revealed that RFC interacted with HDAC1 (Fig. 1C). To extend this observation, endogenous RFC (p140) was again immunoprecipitated from either HeLa or HEK293 cell nuclear protein extracts, but here the complex was Western blotted with an anti HDAC1 antibody. In both cases it was found that endogenous HDAC1 associated with endogenous RFC (p140) (Fig.1D). Some co-immunoprecipitations have been reported to result from binding to contaminating DNA fragments (33Lai J. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To eliminate this possibly artifactual explanation for these results, this experiment was repeated using HeLa cell nuclear protein extracts but with the inclusion of ethidium bromide, which has been shown to disrupt such nonspecific DNA-protein interactions (33Lai J. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Demonstrating that this is a real and specific interaction, endogenous HDAC1 still co-immunoprecipitated with RFC (p140) to the same extent as the ethidium bromide-free sample (Fig. 1E). We next wished to determine if this interaction was functional in vivo. Recruitment of histone deacetylase activity to a promoter should result in transcriptional repression. It was decided, therefore, through the creation of a Gal4 fusion protein to investigate whether DNA-targeted RFC (p140) could repress transcription. Cotransfection of Gal4-RFC (p140) with Gal4-E1B-CAT, a reporter plasmid with a low basal level of activity, demonstrated that RFC (p140) did not activate transcription (data not shown). Gal4-RFC (p140) was next analyzed using a G5 TK-CAT reporter plasmid, which has five Gal4 sites upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The TK promoter has a significant level of activity that facilitates the analysis of transcriptional repression by Gal4 fusion proteins. Interestingly, strong repression of CAT activity by Gal4-RFC (p140) was observed in HEK293 cells (Fig.2A), whereas Gal4-RFC (p140) did not repress the G0-TK-CAT reporter plasmid, which lacks Gal4 sites (Fig 2B). Many histone deacetylases including HDAC1 are inhibited by TSA (34Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the transcriptional repression observed with RFC (p140) resulted from its association with histone deacetylase activity, the experiment performed above was repeated in the presence of TSA. Significantly, TSA virtually abolished transcriptional repression by RFC (p140) (Fig. 2C). These experiments confirmed that the physical interaction between RFC (p140) and HDAC1 has functional consequences in vivo. We next wished to determine which domain of RFC (p140) interacts with HDAC1. To facilitate this, a series of Gal4 and GST fusions with different fragments of RFC (p140) were constructed (Fig.3A). RFC (p140) F1 (amino acids 1–369) encodes the amino terminus of the protein. RFC (p140) F2 (amino acids 367–493) encodes a domain with homology to DNA ligases and has a BRCT domain also found in BRCA1 and other proteins involved in DNA repair (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). RFC (p140) F3 (amino acids 480–882) is responsible for binding to PCNA and also contains the domain homologous to other RFC subunits, an LXCXE motif required for binding to Rb and a caspase-3 cleavage site (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6346-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RFC (p140) F4 (amino acids 728–1148) contains a domain required for association with other RFC subunits and also has two caspase-3 cleavage sites (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rheaume E. Cohen L.Y. Uhlmann F. Lazure C. Alam A. Hurwitz J. Sekaly P.P. Denis F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6346-6354Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Montecucco A. Rossi R. Levin D.S. Gary R. Park M.S. Motycka T.A. Ciarrocchi G. Villa A. Biamonti G. Tomkinson A.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3786-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis demonstrated that Gal4-RFC (p140) F1–F4 were all expressed close to their expected sizes (57, 30, 60, and 62 kDa, respectively), although Gal4-RFC (p140) F1 ran with an apparent molecular mass slightly higher than expected. Sequencing confirmed that the insert was correct, suggesting that this slightly altered mobility results from a structural feature of the protein fragment, possibly reflecting its high basic content. Gal4-RFC (p140) F1 was also expressed at a slightly higher level relative to the other fragments, and some protein degradation or premature translational termination was observed (Fig. 3B). Initially, we investigated the ability of these RFC (140) fragments to repress transcription using G5 TK-CAT. Strong repression of CAT activity, relative to Gal4 alone, was observed with Gal4-RFC (p140) F1 and F3 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, RFC (p140) F2 and F4 had only a weak inhibitory effect. RFC (p140) therefore contains two domains capable of strongly repressing transcription. The RFC (p140) F1 fragment has been shown to possess a PCNA binding site between amino acids 1 and 24 (36). Deletion of this domain, which had no effect, demonstrated that transcriptional repression was not mediated by PCNA binding to this region (Fig. 3D). Recently, RFC (p140) has been shown to interact with the Rb tumor suppressor through an LXCXE motif present within the F3 region (23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since Rb is a strong repressor of transcription that has also been shown to interact indirectly with histone deacetylases (18Nicolas E. Morales V. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Harel-Bellan A. Richard-Foy H. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9797-9804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Laj A. Lee J.M. Yang W.M. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin W.G. Seto E. Branton P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) it was important that its involvement in repression by the RFC (p140) F3 region be determined. To facilitate this, a mutant form of RFC (p140) in which the LXCXE motif was mutated to LXGXK was generated. This mutation has previously been found to disrupt the interaction between Rb and RFC (p140) (23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As a Gal4 fusion however, RFC (p140) F3 LXGXK still repressed transcription to the same extent as wild type RFC (p140) F3, suggesting that association with Rb does not account for the effects seen here (Fig. 3E). We next investigated whether these domains could interact with HDAC1. Consistent with their ability to repress transcription, both Gal4-RFC (p140) F1 and F3 co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC1, whereas no association was seen with Gal4-RFC (p140) F2 and F4 (Fig.4A). Finally, we determined whether this interaction could be seen in vitro in a GST pull-down assay. Bacterially expressed GST·RFC (p140) F1 and F3 bound reticulocyte lysate-translated HDAC1 (Fig.4B). No significant interaction was seen with GST alone or GST·RFC (p140) F2 and F4. None of these proteins interacted with a luciferase control protein. Consistent with the results seen as Gal4 fusion proteins (Fig. 3, D and E) both RFC (p140) F1Δ1–36 and RFC (p140) F3 LXGXK still interacted with HDAC1in vitro (Fig. 4, C and D). Similar to the result seen in Fig. 1E, the inclusion of ethidium bromide failed to disrupt the interaction between RFC (p140) F1 or F3 with HDAC1 in vitro (Fig. 4E). Similar results were seen with DNase I (data not shown). Association between these proteins does not, therefore, result from fortuitous colocalization on DNA present in the assay. Interestingly, the inclusion of ethidium bromide actually stimulated the association between these proteins, suggesting that DNA might have an inhibitory effect on their association. In this report we have demonstrated that the large subunit of replication factor C, RFC (p140), can interact with the histone deacetylase HDAC1 through two distinct domains. It cannot be ruled out that RFC (p140) might interact with other cellular deacetylase activities, because these were not investigated. Although the in vitro association between these proteins suggests a direct interaction (Fig. 4), it cannot be ruled out at this time that an intermediary protein exists that facilitates the association of HDAC1 with RFC (p140). These interactions are functional in vivobecause RFC (p140) can repress transcription in a TSA-sensitive manner when targeted to a promoter. The actual function of this RFC (p140)-associated deacetylase complex in vivo is unclear, however. RFC (p140) has been previously implicated as a transcriptional regulator. For example, it has recently been shown to interact with the bZIP transcription factor C/EBPα and was reported to stimulate transcription (26Hong S.H. Park S.J. Kong H.J. Shuman J.D. Cheong J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28098-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This observation is not obviously consistent with an interaction between RFC (p140) and histone deacetylases, suggesting that such effects might be context specific or influenced by the cell type in which the study is performed. Significantly, as a Gal4 fusion we did not find that RFC (p140) stimulated gene expression (data not shown), suggesting transcriptional activation is not an intrinsic property of RFC (p140). More consistent with our observations is the report that RFC (p140) can interact with the tumor suppressor Rb (23Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y.J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Rb is an important repressor of E2F transcriptional activity. Moreover, it accomplishes this in part through interacting with proteins that recruit histone deacetylase activity (18Nicolas E. Morales V. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Harel-Bellan A. Richard-Foy H. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9797-9804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 37Laj A. Lee J.M. Yang W.M. DeCaprio J.A. Kaelin W.G. Seto E. Branton P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that RFC (p140) might participate in this process. Although we show that the RFC (p140) histone deacetylase complex has the potential to repress transcription as a Gal4 fusion, it is perfectly possible that this activity could be involved in a process other than the regulation of gene expression. Replication factor C also participates in the removal of PCNA following replication (20Mossi R. Hubscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). As such, it might have a function in regulating newly assembled nucleosomes and re-establishing chromatin structure following DNA synthesis. Alternatively, this deacetylase activity might regulate the function of an RFC (p140)-associated protein. The Gal4 fusion experiments were performed principally to allow the activity of RFC (p140)-associated histone deacetylase activity to be analyzed in vivo, and it would be an overinterpretation to assume that it must therefore have a role in transcriptional regulation. In conclusion, there are a number of possible roles that the RFC (p140)-associated deacetylase activity might perform, and these will require further experimentation to fully understand. Nonetheless, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that the function of RFC (p140) is more complex and dynamic that originally thought. It also highlights the similarities and possible dual functions of proteins associated with replication and transcription. Given the complexity of chromatin-remodeling activities associated with transcriptional regulators, it can be anticipated that many similar interactions remain to be discovered.

They have very similar folding structures (15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Diederichs K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol.

Biol. 1995; 246: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) although they differ in length (19Schulz G.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; LIII: 429-439Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and subcellular distribution (20Heil A. Müller G. Noda L. Pinder D. Schirmer H. Schirmer I. von Zabern I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Frank R. Trosin M. Tomasselli A.G. Noda L. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J.

They can be grouped into three subtypes. AK1 (myokinase), a so-called short form of about 21 kDa molecular mass, is the major species in muscle cells of vertebrates and occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm (20Heil A. Müller G. Noda L. Pinder D. Schirmer H. Schirmer I. von Zabern I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Ura6p, a UMP/CMP/AMP kinase, is the yeast equivalent of AK1 (23Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene. 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The other two isoforms have molecular masses of ∼25 kDa because of an internal insertion of 28 amino acids. AK3/Aky3p is a GTP:AMP phosphotransferase and resides in the mitochondrial matrix (22Tomasselli A.G. Frank R. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 202: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene. 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Schricker R. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Schricker R. Magdolen V. Strobel G. Bogengruber E. Breitenbach M. Bandlow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31103-31110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas Aky2p, the major isoform in yeast, is found in both cytoplasm (about 90% of the total adenylate kinase present in a yeast cell homogenate) and mitochondrial IMS (6–8% of total) (12Bandlow W. Strobel G. Zoglowek C. Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The small fraction imported plays a prominent role in oxidative metabolism (23Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene. 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), presumably by facilitating ATP/ADP exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane (12Bandlow W. Strobel G. Zoglowek C. Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism of mitochondrial targeting and uptake of Aky2p is largely unknown. Recently, it has been reported that, despite its physical properties, which are highly unfavorable for import, the extreme N terminus of Aky2p has the ability to target cytoplasmic passengers, i.e. murine dihydrofolate reductase or Ura6p from yeast, to mitochondrial locations (26Bandlow W. Strobel G. Schricker R. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal region of Aky2p tolerates large sequence variations without abolishing a basal rate of import, arguing that it is not the only topogenic sequence in Aky2p and hinting at the presence of additional signal(s) for mitochondrial import. To identify internal import information, we constructed chimeras of Aky2p and the purely cytoplasmic isoform, Ura6p, as well as mutant Aky2 proteins affected in the presumptive target sequence, and determined the steady state distribution of hybrid and mutant Aky2 proteins between cytoplasm and mitochondria. The AKY2-disrupted yeast strains DL1-D16 aky2::LEU2 (23Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene. 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or WCG4 aky2::LEU2 (this work) served as recipients for all mutant constructs in transformations using multicopy yeast shuttle plasmids. Yeast cells were grown on semi-synthetic medium supplemented according to the auxotrophic requirements and 3% lactate or galactose as the carbon source. Spheroplasts were prepared from midlogarithmic cultures (1–2 × 107 cells/ml) and lysed in 0.6 m mannitol in the presence of a mix of protease inhibitors. After discarding whole cells, debris and nuclei (2 × 3,000 × g, 5 min), mitochondria were prepared from the 10,000 × g pellet, washed, further purified by Percoll (28%) gradient centrifugation, and subfractionated into intermembrane space, matrix, and innerplus outer membranes as described earlier (27Müller G. Bandlow W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9957-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The 10,000 × g supernatant was used as the cytoplasmic fraction. Aliquots containing equal amounts of protein (usually 15 μg/slot) were immediately mixed with gel loading buffer and used for SDS-PAGE. Wild-type or hybrid proteins were detected using a mixture of anti-Aky2p and anti-Ura6p antisera and the chloronaphthol/peroxidase system for visualization. The genes AKY2 and URA6 were divided into four structurally homologous segments each (Fig.1 A): Segment 1, N terminus (family numbering (FN) pos. 2 in Ura6p or pos. 12 FN in Aky2p to pos. 32 FN; for FN see Ref. 28Magdolen V. Schricker R. Strobel G. Germaier H. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); segment 2 (pos. 33–108 FN), segment 3 (pos. 109–185 FN), and segment 4 (C terminus, pos. 186–242 (Aky2p) or pos. 243 (Ura6p) FN). The three junction sites lie within conserved amino acid sequences (Fig.1 A). Fusions of homologous segments were achieved by splicing by overlap extension PCR (29Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). All fusion constructs were ligated as XbaI/NcoI fragments to theAKY2 expression cassette of vector pEX (24Schricker R. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 233: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using the promoter proximal SpeI restriction site and theNcoI site introduced immediately 3′ of the termination codon. The cassette comprising the promoter, the context of the translational initiation triplet, and the terminator fromAKY2 together with the respective hybrid gene replacing theAKY2-coding sequence was subsequently ligated to YEp352 (URA3) (30Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Fusion constructs were named systematically according to the segments originating from either AKY2 (A) or URA6 (U) (Fig. 1 A). As a first step in building the fusion genes UAUU,UUAU, and AUUA, the two reciprocal hybrid genesUUAA and AAUU were constructed by fusing the respective segments of AKY2 and URA6 within the central DGFPR consensus motif (pos. 106–110, Fig.1 A). UAUU was built from genes UAAA and AAUU by replacing the second two segments of UAAA, encoded on aBglII/NcoI fragment, by the homologous 556-bpBglII/NcoI fragment of AAUU. The resulting protein, UAUUp, is a Ura6p derivative containing Aky2p sequences between pos. 33 and 108 FN. Fusion gene UUAU was made by exchanging a 400-bp C-terminal HindIII fragment of pUUAA containing the 3′-noncoding region of AKY2 and theHindIII site of the pUC19 multiple cloning site with a homologous PCR fragment from pURA6 containing the promoter fromAKY2 (23Schricker R. Magdolen V. Kaniak A. Wolf K. Bandlow W. Gene. 1992; 122: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The internal HindIII was introduced into URA6 via PCR, 6 amino acids N-terminal of the conserved DDN sequence (pos. 184–186 FN). Fusion gene AUUA was constructed by replacing the 509-bp SpeI/NcoI fragment of pAUUU by the corresponding 518-bpSpeI/NcoI fragment of pUUUA. Mutants Aky-imp1, Aky-imp3, Aky-P3, and URA6-h5 as well as Aky-LD3 were constructed by use of site-specific in vitro mutagenesis (28Magdolen V. Schricker R. Strobel G. Germaier H. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The sequence of the mutagenic primer imp1 (5′-CCAAAGGGGTACCTTTATTGTCCAATTTTTC-3′) covers the region between pos. 120 and 125 (FN) of Aky2p (Fig. 1 B) and replaces the amino acid sequence QMLKEQ by NK (Fig. 1 B), thereby introducing a net deletion of 4 amino acids to approximate the sequence to that of the short isoforms. In mutant Aky-P3, the loop motif C-terminal of helix 5, GTP, was changed into TSN by primer 5′-CCAAATGTTGAAAGAACAAACGTCCAACTTGGAAAAA-GCCATC-3′. In mutant Aky-imp3, the sequence from pos. 94 to 98 was adjusted to the one observed in short isozymes (BOAK1) using mutagenic primer 5′-CCAAGATGAACCCTTTCGAAGTGTCGACATTGTTGGTC-3′. Aky-LD3 was designed as a substitution of the long isozyme-specific large loop sequence (pos. 150–181, FN) by the short isozyme-specific consensus sequence (GDTSG), resulting in a net deletion of 28 amino by use of primer 5′-GGCGTCTGCATTGTCATCAACTCTGCCACTAGTGTCTCCTCTACCGGT-3′ (Fig.1 C). In URA6-h5, helix 5 (sequence PRKMDQAISFERDIVESK) was replaced by theAKY2/AK2-derived sequence PRNIPQAEKLDQLMEKRKVESK (helical residues in italics) (primer 5′-CTTAATTGACGGATTTCCTAGGAATATCCCTCAAGCTGAAAAGCTAGATCAGCTGATGGAGAAACGTAAAGTTGAAAGCAAATTCATCCTGTTC-3′). AURA6-h5 was constructed by using the same primer as for URA6-h5 and construct AUUU as the template. In mutant AKY-N1 the ATG translational initiation codon was changed to ATT so that the second Met triplet (pos. 7 of the mature protein) was used for initiation of translation. All constructs, including URA6 (UUUU), were expressed under the control of the AKY2 promoter including the authentic context of the translational start site (except AKY-N1). Antibodies against yeast Ura6p and Aky2p were raised in chicken using purified hexa-His-tagged yeast Ura6p or Aky2p, respectively, as the antigen. Recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli under the bacterial tac fusion promoter from plasmid pQE8 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and purified from bacterial lysates by one-step Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Two chicken were immunized (32Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Weiser T. Hübscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) with about 80 or 120 μg, respectively, of the homogenous recombinant protein per injection using complete Freund's adjuvant. Two booster injections using the same amount of protein were performed 4 and 8 weeks after the first immunization. The polyclonal antibodies were prepared from the egg yolks by dextran sulfate precipitation (33Jensenius J.C. Andersen I. Hau J. Crone M. Koch C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Published procedures were used to determine adenylate kinase activity (12Bandlow W. Strobel G. Zoglowek C. Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), for determination of protein concentrations (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar), for Western blotting, and for all other molecular procedures (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Helical wheel projections were calculated with the help of the DNASTAR (PROTEANTM) program. Secondary structure predictions were based on the algorithm of Chou and Fasman (36Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) or the secondary structure prediction algorithm offered by the PHD server (www.embl-heidelberg.de/predictprotein; Ref.37Rost B. Sander C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sequences were screened for surface exposition and flexibility using the algorithm described by Margalit et al. (38Margalit H. Sponge I.L. Comette I.L. Cease K.B. Delisi C. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2213-2229PubMed Google Scholar) with alternative window sizes of 6 and 10 amino acids. The hydrophobic α-helical moment was calculated applying the equation developed by Eisenberg et al. (39Eisenberg D. Schwarz M. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 125-142Crossref Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Aky2p has been shown to contain mitochondrial target information that is sufficient to direct heterologous passengers to the correct submitochondrial compartment, the IMS (26Bandlow W. Strobel G. Schricker R. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test whether additional internal import information is present in Aky2p, the N terminus was either deleted (AKY-N1) or replaced with the N terminus of the exclusively cytoplasmic isozyme, Ura6p (UAAA). Cell lysates were fractionated into cytoplasm (amounting to about 50% of total homogenate proteins (12Bandlow W. Strobel G. Zoglowek C. Oechsner U. Magdolen V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) and purified mitochondria (about 10% of total proteins). Aky2p and marker proteins (hexokinase for the cytoplasm, cytochrome c 1 for mitochondrial membranes, and Hsp60 for the mitochondrial matrix were used as loading control and to indicate mutual contamination) were assayed by Western blotting (Fig.2 A). Equal amounts of protein have been applied per slot so that mitochondrial proteins are about 5-fold enriched relative to cytoplasm. Only about 10% of the total Aky2p (25 kDa) is imported into mitochondria in vivo in the steady state in agreement with previous reports (compare Aky2p mitochondrial (m) and cytoplasmic (c) fractions, positive control), whereas Ura6p (21 kDa) is cytoplasmic (Ura6p, m, negative control). No Ura6p-specific signal is also seen in the AKY2-disrupted recipient strain DL1-D16 (not shown) or in the multicopyAKY2 wild-type transformant (Aky2p,c), because the concentration of Ura6p expressed from the wild-type URA6 gene is too low for detection. Both Aky2 mutant proteins, UAAAp and AKY-N1p, are imported. Subfractionation of AKY-N1 mitochondria shows that AKY-N1p is correctly sorted to the IMS (i in Fig. 2 A; IMS proteins amount to about 15% of whole mitochondria). Thus, internal regions of Aky2p are sufficient to direct the hybrid proteins to mitochondria. To identify internal targeting information in Aky2p, AKY2 andURA6 were each divided into four homologous segments (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1 A), and a series of constructs was made in which one or more segments of Ura6p were exchanged for their Aky2p counterparts by homologous in vitro recombination (i.e. AAUU, UUAA, UUAU, UAUU, AUUA, and UUUA; the latter fusion protein is not shown in Fig.2 B). The difference in length between short and long isoforms of nucleoside monophosphate kinases resides mainly in the variable loop contained in segment 3, which is shorter by 28 amino acids in the short versions (i.e. in Ura6p and all constructs carrying segment 3 from Ura6p). All chimeras and Ura6p were expressed from the AKY2 promoter in the context of the translational start triplet of Aky2p (shaded in Fig. 1 A) to warrant identical expression. The cytoplasmic concentration of some chimeras, however, was low to undetectable (AAUUp, UUAUp, UAUUp, and AUUAp). In these cases, total adenylate kinase present in cytoplasm plus mitochondria is considerably lower than wild type (e.g.about 10% in AAUU), indicating proteolytic instability in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, all constructs were taken up by mitochondria, suggesting that each of the constructs harbors import information. The uptake efficiencies vary, however (Fig. 2 B). In detail, fusion proteins containing either half of Aky2p were both targeted to mitochondria to about the same extent as wild type (AAUUp, UUAAp), indicating that both the N- and the C-terminal halves of the Aky2 molecule harbor mitochondrial targeting information that suffices as the import address. Among the constructs containing a single segment of Aky2p, only UUAUp was imported efficiently, pointing to segment 3 as the carrier of a major internal mitochondrial target signal. The remaining three constructs, UAUUp, AUUAp, and UUUAp (latter not shown), were imported poorly. The extremely low efficiency of import of UUUAp (not shown) suggested that the C-terminal region of Aky2p did not carry sequences relevant to mitochondrial import. This conclusion agrees with the observation that a deletion mutant missing the last 24 amino acid residues of Aky2p showed an import efficiency that was even increased compared with wild-type protein (40Angermayr M. Strobel G. Zollner A. Korber D. Bandlow W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In an independent approach to identifying candidate internal mitochondrial targeting information of Aky2p, we screened the amino acid sequence for surface-exposed regions (38Margalit H. Sponge I.L. Comette I.L. Cease K.B. Delisi C. Berzofsky J.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2213-2229PubMed Google Scholar) that differed between members of the 25-kDa mitochondrial subfamily and cytoplasmic 21-kDa isozymes. One obvious divergence is constituted by the so-called “extra loop,” a surface-exposed structure forming a β-meander in the long-form enzymes, which is absent from the short versions (15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Additionally, the region following the DGFPR consensus motif (AMP-binding motif), comprising helix 5 (FN 111–125), was identified as a candidate. Both motifs are contained in segment 3. They were tested individually for the presence of mitochondrial target information, to narrow down the region containing the targeting element in question. In mutant Aky-LD3, the surface-exposed variable loop was replaced exactly by the respective loop of the short isoforms on the basis of primary structure alignments taking into account recent x-ray crystallographic data (15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Diederichs K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) to achieve the exact excision and replacement of the loop sequence on a structural basis (Fig.1 C; pos. 150–181 FN). Aky-LD3 mutant protein is imported into mitochondria with about the same efficiency as the wild type (Fig.3 A, Aky-LD3 c andm), ruling out the implied involvement of the variable loop in mitochondrial targeting and leaving helix 5 as the prime candidate. In Aky2p (and other long-form AKs), helix 5 is more amphipathic (Fig.4, left panel), more surface-exposed, and 4 amino acids longer than in the short versions (13 helical residues in BOAK2 and Aky2p compared with nine in BOAK1 and Ura6p). To check whether helix 5 carries import-relevant information, several mutations were established at or near the region of heterology (Fig. 1 B). Unfortunately, those mutants that affected helix 5 directly (by deleting the whole structure or by changing the number of charges, the propensity of helix formation, or the amphiphilic α-helical moment) were highly unstable so that even in a proteasome-negative background (pre1 pre2) or by rapid preparation of cellular proteins, mutant adenylate kinase was barely detectable (not shown). Two types of stable mutants could be obtained; one affected the helix-flanking regions (Aky-imp1, Aky-imp3, and Aky-P3) and the other was, in a complementary approach, aURA6 mutant, URA6-h5, in which helix 5 was replaced with an Aky2/BOAK2-derived helix 5. Amino acid residues C-terminally adjacent to helix 5 are altered by mutations Aky-imp1 and Aky-P3 (Fig. 1 B). Mutant Aky-imp1 deletes 4 α-helical amino acids that are absent from short isoforms, and thus it adjusts the amino acid sequence of Aky2p to the short-form cytoplasmic isozymes in this respect. According to the algorithm of Chou and Fasman (36Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) the propensity of helix formation extends beyond helix 5 in long-form isozymes by about one helical turn (see Refs. 15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholarand 16Diederichs K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mutation Aky-P3 immediately follows the Aky-imp1 mutational site on the C-terminal side. It contains a change of pos. 126–128 (FN) including Pro-128 (Fig. 1 B). Aky-imp3 is mutated in the most heterologous part of segment 2, to make it resemble the sequence of the short isozymes in this region. This stretch lies in the vicinity of the imp1 and P3 sites in the folded protein (15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) but is contained in segment 2 rather than segment 3 (Fig. 1 B). The amount of Aky-imp1p and Aky-P3p found in mitochondria is not significantly altered compared with wild type (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that these two mutations do not affect sequences relevant to import. As expected from results obtained with the UAUU fusion protein, mutant Aky-imp3 also does not show a significant change of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial distribution. Helix 5 of Aky2p is amphipathic and comprises 13 amino acids (Fig. 4,left), whereas the respective structure from Ura6p is significantly less amphipathic and four amino acids shorter (Fig. 4,center). Because AKY2 mutants directly affecting helix 5 were proteolytically unstable in vivo, we exchanged helix 5 in the exclusively cytoplasmic short-form isoprotein Ura6p for the corresponding sequence derived from what was considered the optimization of helix 5 from both Aky2p and BOAK2 (“Experimental Procedures” and Figs. 1 C and 4, right panel). This hybrid protein, URA6-h5p, not only is relatively stable in the cytoplasm (although it is evidently degraded to some extent) but is also imported into mitochondria with at least the same efficiency as Aky2p (Fig. 3 B). (The band in the cytoplasmic fraction exhibiting slightly higher mobility likely represents a cross-reacting protein that can serve as loading control.) The crystal structure of yeast adenylate kinase (15Egner U. Tomasselli A.G. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) shows that helix 5 and the N terminus are in close proximity. This raises the possibility that the import specificity of Aky2p may be determined by the interaction of helix 5 with the N-terminal peptide of Aky2p. Hairpin interactions between the N terminus and an internal amphipathic helix have been found to occur and to be essential for import of the Bcs1 protein (41Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which, like Aky2p, is taken up into the IMS without a cleavable presequence. In addition to helix 5, the N terminus of Aky2p also has mitochondrial target information"
https://openalex.org/W2045079065,"ATP synthases (F0F1-ATPases) mechanically couple ion flow through the membrane-intrinsic portion, F0, to ATP synthesis within the peripheral portion, F1. The coupling most probably occurs through the rotation of a central rotor (subunits c10eγ) relative to the stator (subunits ab2δ(αβ)3). The translocation of protons is conceived to involve the rotation of the ring of c subunits (the c oligomer) containing the essential acidic residue cD61 against subunits ab2. In line with this notion, the mutants cD61N and cD61G have been previously reported to lack proton translocation. However, it has been surprising that the membrane-bound mutated holoenzyme hydrolyzed ATP but without translocating protons. Using detergent-solubilized and immobilized EF0F1 and by application of the microvideographic assay for rotation, we found that the c oligomer, which carried a fluorescent actin filament, rotates in the presence of ATP in the mutant cD61N just as in the wild type enzyme. This observation excluded slippage among subunit γ, the central rotary shaft, and the c oligomer and suggested free rotation without proton pumping between the oligomer and subunit a in the membrane-bound enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2010815278,"The gene of chitinase in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, generates four mRNA products by alternative splicing. Nucleotide sequences of the entire gene for chitinase and respective cDNAs demonstrate that the pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing at both the 5′ and 3′ regions. At the 5′ region, the pre-mRNA experienced differential splicing through two alternative 5′-intron consensus splicing sites. These products differ in the last amino acid of the signal peptide and the first amino acid of the mature N-terminal sequences: one with Cys20-Ala21 and the other with Ser20-Asp21. The product with Cys20-Ala21 residues is one amino acid larger than the other with Ser20-Asp21. At the 3′ region the pre-mRNA of the chitinase gene undergoes alternative splicing in three different fashions. It is spliced either through retaining or excluding the upstream 121-bp direct repeat found at the 3′ region of the coding sequences or through retaining or excluding of an insertion of 9 bp in a combinatorial manner. Retention or exclusion of the upstream 121-bp direct repeat results in a protein with a deduced amino acid sequence similar in size to the one retaining both direct repeats. However, exclusion of the insert of the 9 bp from the mRNA results in a protein with 22 extra amino acids. All of the mRNA products appear to be generated from a single gene as demonstrated by testing the 3′ region of the genomic DNA and variant chitinase mRNA products. B. mori chitinase expression in the fifth instar larvae epidermal tissues appears to be developmentally regulated, but the phenomenon of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA is not stage-dependent. Furthermore, the four mRNA products showed chitinase activity when expressed inEscherichia coli, which demonstrates the role of the alternative splicing process in generating multiple isoforms of the silkworm's chitinase. The gene of chitinase in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, generates four mRNA products by alternative splicing. Nucleotide sequences of the entire gene for chitinase and respective cDNAs demonstrate that the pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing at both the 5′ and 3′ regions. At the 5′ region, the pre-mRNA experienced differential splicing through two alternative 5′-intron consensus splicing sites. These products differ in the last amino acid of the signal peptide and the first amino acid of the mature N-terminal sequences: one with Cys20-Ala21 and the other with Ser20-Asp21. The product with Cys20-Ala21 residues is one amino acid larger than the other with Ser20-Asp21. At the 3′ region the pre-mRNA of the chitinase gene undergoes alternative splicing in three different fashions. It is spliced either through retaining or excluding the upstream 121-bp direct repeat found at the 3′ region of the coding sequences or through retaining or excluding of an insertion of 9 bp in a combinatorial manner. Retention or exclusion of the upstream 121-bp direct repeat results in a protein with a deduced amino acid sequence similar in size to the one retaining both direct repeats. However, exclusion of the insert of the 9 bp from the mRNA results in a protein with 22 extra amino acids. All of the mRNA products appear to be generated from a single gene as demonstrated by testing the 3′ region of the genomic DNA and variant chitinase mRNA products. B. mori chitinase expression in the fifth instar larvae epidermal tissues appears to be developmentally regulated, but the phenomenon of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA is not stage-dependent. Furthermore, the four mRNA products showed chitinase activity when expressed inEscherichia coli, which demonstrates the role of the alternative splicing process in generating multiple isoforms of the silkworm's chitinase. open reading frame reverse transcription isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside 3(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol glutathione S-transferase There are many sources of chitinases, including bacteria, fungi, plants, marine organisms, insects, and mammals (1Koga D. Mitsutomi M. Kono M. Matsumiya M. Chitin and Chitinases. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel/Switzerland1999: 111-123Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The role of these enzymes differs among the organisms. In insects, they degrade the biopolymer chitin, which is found in the exoskeleton and gut lining. Insect chitinases are induced by ecdysteroids at the time of molting and metamorphosis of the larvae to degrade most of the older chitin (2Kimura S. J. Insect Physiol. 1973; 19: 115-123Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar,3Koga D. Funakoshi T. Mizuki K. Utsumi T. Ide A. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 123-128Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Chitinase expression in the insects' exoskeletons and the guts normally occurs only during molting, where the chitin of the integument and the peritrophic membrane is presumably degraded (4Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Johnson L. White F. Carozzi N. Koziel M. Advances in Insect Control: The Role of Transgenic Plants. Taylor and Francis Publishers, Washington, D. C.1996: 185-193Google Scholar). Expression of the chitinase at a precise timing in insects demonstrates its fundamental role in the process of ecdysis. To elucidate the functions of the chitinases, the genes for these enzymes have also been isolated and characterized from many organisms, including mammals, insects, fungi, nematodes, and bacteria (5Overdijk B.

One of the structural features observed in chitinases is a multidomain architecture that includes catalytic domains, a cysteine rich chitin-binding domain, and a serine/threonine-rich domain that is glycosylated (13Tellam R.L. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 291-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conserved motifs in most of the insects' chitinase genes reside in the central domains, which include the two regions implicated in catalysis (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Differences occur in the cysteine-rich carboxyl domain and the proline/glutamate/serine/threonine-rich domain that is presumed to increase the susceptibility to proteolysis by a calcium-dependent protease (14Rogers S.G. Horsch R.B. Fraley R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 627-640Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 887-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The silkworm, Bombyx mori, chitinases are well studied in our laboratory at both the enzymological and DNA levels (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 29: 537-547Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).We have previously reported a complete exploration of the gene for the chitinase from B. mori (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The gene's structural organization and functional motifs are consistent with the multidomain architecture of the proteins (13Tellam R.L. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 12: 291-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The organizations of its functional domains are identical to the related gene from Manduca sexta(18Choi H.K. Choi K.H. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hence, the genes for cuticular chitinases may be conserved among insect species (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The coding regions of the genomic clone for the gene of B. mori chitinase have unique features both at exon 1/intron 1 splicing junctions and the 3′-end of the gene's coding regions (Fig. 1). First, the invariant nucleotides, GT, at the 5′ boundary of intron 1 are repeated in near proximity, so we suggested a differential splicing of the pre-mRNA (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another feature of this gene includes the incorporation of an additional sequence of 9 bp at the 3′-end of the coding regions (Fig.1). This sequence is absent from a chitinase cDNA clone studied earlier (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The open reading frame (ORF)1 is interrupted by the inclusion of the 9 bp due to the stop codon within these nucleotides. Therefore, the protein encoded by our chitinase gene is 22 amino acids smaller in size. Furthermore, another cDNA encoding a putative chitinase of B. mori has been reported recently (8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). There are some discrepancies between these two sequences of the chitinase cDNAs (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). They differ in the first amino acid of the mature N-terminal region and in the C-terminal coding region. In addition, there are direct repeats of 112 bp in the former cDNA sequence (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but these were not found in the latter study (8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our previous studies on B. mori chitinases revealed that the first amino acid of the mature N-terminal sequences is alanine (16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results are supported by deduced amino acid sequences of the chitinase cDNA that was studied by Mikitani et al. (8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our study of the genomic clone for the gene of chitinase suggested the possible occurrence of all cDNAs sequences in a condition where an alternative splicing of the primary transcript of the chitinase occurs in the cell's nucleus.Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important mechanism in gene regulation and can include the use of alternative 5′- and/or 3′-splice sites, exon skipping, mutual exon exclusion, and/or intron retention (19Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28017-28023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although intron retention is common in viral pre-mRNAs, it appears to be a relatively rare form of alternative splicing in vertebrates (22Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2677-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is believed that intron-containing mRNAs normally are prevented from being transported to the cytoplasm due to the formation of the spliceosome complex, which commits the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway (23Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 24Chang D.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 789-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 25Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 109-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Legrain P. Rosbash M. Cell. 1989; 57: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, there are examples of alternative intron retention in vertebrates that result in novel proteins due to translation of the intron sequences (27Cooke N.E. Ray J. Emery J.G. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9001-9006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Crabtree G.R. Kant J.A. Cell. 1982; 31: 159-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Hampson R.K. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2673-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Weil D. Brosset S. Dautry F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5865-5876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be a mechanism by which a fraction of the mRNA molecules, containing an intact intron, escape the splicing pathway (20Dirksen W.P. Hampson R.K. Sun Q. Rottman F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6431-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both the 5′- and 3′-splice sites are required for commitment of spliceosome complex formation (31Michaud S. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it is possible that some suboptimal splice sites may prevent complex formation, thereby allowing an intron to be retained and intron-containing mRNAs to be transported to the cytoplasm.To obtain more insight into the splicing mechanism of chitinase primary transcript and to clarify the discrepancies observed on the N- and C-terminal amino acids, we have cloned B. morichitinase cDNAs from different stages of the fifth instar larvae and investigated the role of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in generating heterogeneous chitinase cDNAs within the silkworm. The results of this study are here described and discussed.DISCUSSIONSequence alignment of the coding regions in the B. morigenomic clone for the gene of chitinase (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the chitinase cDNA (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed the correspondence of the two clones. However, the genomic clone incorporated an insert of 9 bp (5′-GTTCGTAAG-3′) at the C-terminal end of the gene, which was not reported in the chitinase cDNA (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The fifth nucleotide of the 9 bp was found to be A instead of G in some of the cDNA clones, which may be due to sequencing ambiguities. It appears that these nucleotides increase the size of the encoded protein by three amino acids. In contrast, the protein encoded by this clone was found to be of smaller size when compared with the one deduced from the chitinase cDNA (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) because of the presence of a stop codon within the 9-bp insert DNA (Fig.1).Previous results of the amino acid sequence analysis of the silkworm chitinases (16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that the first residue of the N-terminal sequence is the nonpolar aliphatic amino acid, alanine. However, the reported cDNA clone (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed the first residue of the mature N-terminal sequence is the negatively charged amino acid, aspartate. Our results from the genomic clone of the B. mori chitinase gene suggested both cases to be true. To clarify the ambiguous results observed at the N-terminal region of the chitinase gene, to verify the existence of the 9-bp insert DNA in the mRNA, and to determine at which level these sequence differences are regulated, cDNA clones from the same insect species were synthesized at different stages of the fifth instar larvae and analyzed. Previously, we proposed that these discrepancies might be due to the insects' strains used in the different studies or otherwise regulated at the level of pre-mRNA splicing (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).There are many genes reported to exhibit alternative RNA splicing in various organisms (34Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Among insects, the tobacco hornworm, M. sexta, serpin gene produces 12 different serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) through alternative pre-mRNA splicing (19Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Jiang H. Wang Y. Huang Y. Mulnix A.B. Kandel J. Cole K. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28017-28023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This splicing process generates inhibitor diversity and potentially regulates a variety of proteinases, using the same protein framework joined to different reactive site region cassettes (19Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also about ten genes in Drosophila melanogasterfound to exhibit different patterns of alternative splicing. The class I glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene family was also found to undergo alternative splicing in Anopheles gambiae (35Ranson H. Collins F. Hemingway J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14284-14289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Anopheles dirus (36Pongjaroenkit S. Jirajaroenrat K. Boonchauy C. Chanama U. Leetachewa S. Prapanthadara L. Ketterman A.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In both species the GST gene contains six exons for four mature GST transcripts, which share exons 1 and 2 but vary between four different exon 3 sequences (exons 3A–3D) (36Pongjaroenkit S. Jirajaroenrat K. Boonchauy C. Chanama U. Leetachewa S. Prapanthadara L. Ketterman A.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sericin 1 primary transcript of B. mori is differentially spliced via a tissue- and developmentally regulated process (37Garel A. Deleage G. Prudhomme J.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The structure of the sericin 1 gene is characterized by the presence of a large central alternative exon, which encodes an internally repetitive sequence (37Garel A. Deleage G. Prudhomme J.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The serpin gene-1 from M. sexta is characterized by the presence of 12 alternate forms of exon 9. The splicing pathway apparently allows inclusion of only one exon 9 per molecule of a mature serpin-1 mRNA (21Jiang H. Wang Y. Huang Y. Mulnix A.B. Kandel J. Cole K. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28017-28023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In this study we demonstrated that the B. mori chitinase gene exhibits four patterns of alternative pre-mRNA splicing: one at the 5′ region and three at the 3′ region (Figs. 5 and 6). In some of the cDNA clones amplified (SP-1/(1–10)2, SP-2/ (1–10)1, SP-2/(1–10)2, and SP-2/(1–14)), the 3′ border of exon 1 was found to be three nucleotides downstream (GTG/gtgagt), giving a more conventional intron entry site, gtgagt (37Garel A. Deleage G. Prudhomme J.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Tables I and II and Fig. 1). In this case the gene undergoes differential splicing through two alternative 5′-intron splicing consensus sites at the boundary between exon 1 and intron 1 (FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6). Although the selection of the correct pairs of 5′- and 3′-intron splicing sites in pre-mRNA splicing process is the central problem, evidence is accumulating in support of the notion that combinations between certain intron entry sites are preferred to others (34Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Based on this result, we were able to interpret that the discrepancies observed in the mature N-terminal sequences among the N-terminal amino acid sequence ofB. mori chitinases (16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), chitinase cDNAs (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the genomic clone for the gene of chitinase (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were due to this alternative splicing process. The products of the splicing are two mature transcripts encoding two mature proteins: one starts with alanine and the other with aspartate. The splicing product that yields alanine as the first residue of the mature N-terminal increases the coding region of the chitinase gene by one amino acid, whereas the one that produces aspartate as the first residue of the mature N-terminal is one residue shorter. Exclusion or inclusion of the alternatively spliced triplet does not interrupt the ORF of the corresponding mature transcripts. It is noteworthy that the 5′ region in the B. mori chitinase gene (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is very unique compared with its closely related gene from M. sexta (18Choi H.K. Choi K.H. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), both in sequence and structural motifs, because there is only one functional 5′-intron splicing consensus sequences in the junction between exon 1 and intron 1 in the M. sexta gene for chitinase (Table I). This might be attributed to species differences.Another striking feature of the B. mori chitinase gene is its incorporation of 9 bp at the 3′ region (9Abdel-Banat B.M.A. Koga D. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This insertion mediates direct repeats of 112 bp. However, if the 9-bp insert DNA is summed up to the upstream 112 bp, the direct repeats will be 121 bp (Fig. 5). There are two types of splicing patterns in this region of the gene. A splicing occurs via exclusion of the upstream 121-bp direct repeat in some of the mature transcripts (SP-1/(1–10)2, SP-2/(1–10)2, and SP-2/(1–14)) (Table II), because the 3′-end of the 9-bp insert DNA serves as an alternative intron splicing site. The stop codon in the product of this splicing pattern was shifted to the downstream 121-bp direct repeat. The proteins encoded by either inclusion or exclusion of the upstream direct repeat will be of similar size in terms of their amino acids (Fig. 6).To verify that the cDNAs described were produced by splicing and were not transcribed from additional gene sequences elsewhere in the genome, the same primer set was used in PCR with genomic DNA as the template to amplify the 3′ region around the direct repeats. Nucleic acids that differ by 121 bp are detectable on agarose gel. The DNA fragments amplified from SP-0 through SP-3 genomic DNAs were typically the same size as expected (Fig. 7A). The same primer set was used in PCR with cDNA clones that exhibited differential splicing of the upstream 121-bp direct repeat as the templates (Fig.7B). The results clearly indicated that the variant mature transcripts investigated are the products of a single gene, which in turn supports the concept that the copy number of B. morichitinase gene is 1 per haploid genome (8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, these results are inconsistent with the possibility that the nucleotides of the 9 bp are part of a large intron separating the repeated sequences. Moreover, the 9-bp insert DNA was also determined by sequencing to be alternatively spliced (Figs. 4 and 5). The mechanism by which the gene undergoes splicing of the 9 bp is not clear. However, the 9 bp may be spliced in a combinatorial fashion, because, in this pattern of splicing, the alternatively spliced genes contain entire exons that are individually included or excluded from the mature mRNA (34Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The combinatorial exons, each 12–18 bp long, are among the smallest reported (34Breitbart R.E. Andreadis A. Nadal-Ginard B. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 467-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, the cardiac troponin T (TnT) gene has an exon of only six nucleotides in length (38Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A previously reported B. mori chitinase cDNA (7Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) incorporates the 112-bp direct repeats but is devoid of the 9 bp, whereas the other reported cDNA from the same insect (8Mikitani K. Sugasaki T. Shimada T. Kobayashi M. Gustafsson J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37725-37732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) lacks the upstream 121-bp direct repeat. All of these results together support the possibility of splicing of the 9 bp separately and irrespective of the other sequences of the primary transcript. Furthermore, exclusion of this insertion from the primary transcript yields a mature mRNA that encodes a protein 22 amino acids longer than that from a mature transcript including the insertion due to generation of a premature stop codon (Figs. 3 and 6). Exclusion of the triplet (GTG) at the exon 1 and intron 1 boundary and retention of the 9 bp at the 3′ region appeared more commonly in the mature transcripts from the late stages of the fifth instar larvae. However, generally, the alternative splicing phenomenon in the B. mori chitinase gene is not dependent on the fifth instar developmental stage (Table II).To assess the changes in the levels of chitinase mRNAs in the fifth instar larvae epidermal tissues, total RNAs from the respective tissues were analyzed by Northern blotting. Chitinase mRNA was undetected by Northern blotting on the day when the fifth instar larvae started spinning behavior. However, it was present at a very low level 1 day later, and its level increased sharply on the second day and gradually onward (Fig. 8A). The mature mRNAs expressing chitinase were also detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 8B). These data demonstrated the chitinase mRNA was transcribed even at the SP-0 stage, and it was detectable by RT-PCR when using only half of the amount of total RNA that was used in Northern blotting. This result strongly supports the concept of a gradual expression of the chitinase mRNA in B. mori from the day when the fifth instar larvae initiated spinning behavior and also supports the development-specific expression of chitinase, which was also detected in M. sexta larvae (6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L.M. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Two mechanisms were proposed for the generation of multiple functional chitinases from a single gene in B. mori. The chitinases may be processed from a larger one by limited proteolysis from the C-terminal side (16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another mechanism is the regulation of the enzymes expression at the gene level through alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. We present here the data that prove the alternative splicing mechanism. The role of this splicing mechanism in generating multiple functional chitinases in the silkworm was further demonstrated by expressing the alternatively spliced cDNA clones in E. coli.
