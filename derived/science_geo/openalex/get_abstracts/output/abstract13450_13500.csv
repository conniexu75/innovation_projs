https://openalex.org/W1605482400,"The DNA unwinding protein of Escherichia coli (Sigal, N., Delius, H., Kornberg, T., Gefter, M., and Alberts, B. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 69, 3537-3541) has been purified to homogeneity by a simple procedure which utilizes its stability to heating. The protein is an asymmetric tetramer of 18,500 dalton subunits which binds preferentially to single-stranded DNA at a ratio of one protein molecule per 32 nucleotides. Binding to DNA is complete in less than 10 s at 0 degrees while release of the protein from single-stranded DNA is relatively slow even at 37 degrees. A simple functional assay for unwinding protein depends on its essential role in the conversion of phage G4 single-stranded DNA to the replicative form. Unwinding protein stimulates initiation of replication of all single-stranded phage DNAs. Approximately 300 copies of unwinding protein are present per cell, as estimated by antibody titration, an amount sufficient to cover substantial lengths of DNA in several replicating forks."

This suggests that the development of severe diabetic hyperglycemia requires the presence of glucagon, whether secreted by pancreatic or newly identified gastrointestinal A cells, as well as a lack of insulin. Glucagon suppression could improve therapeutic glucoregulation in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1577674984,"Cells of Escherichia coli selectively degrade proteins that have incorporated amino acid analogs. Within 1 hour after exposure of cells to canavanine, 50% of the analog-containing proteins were degraded to acid-soluble form. At the same time, no net loss of canavanine-containing protein occurred from the 100,000 X g supernatant. Instead, most of the proteins containing the analog, unlike normal ones, accumulated in particulate fractions sedimenting at 10,000 X g or 100,000 X g. They were then lost from these fractions concomitant with the degradation of the abnormal proteins. The loss of such proteins from particulate fractions accounted for all of the protein degraded to acid-soluble form. Similar observations were obtained after incorporation of other analogs or puromycin. The 10,000 X g pellets correspond to amorphous dense intracellular granules visible in electron micrographs of cells exposed to canavanine. Upon removal of the analog, these granules disappeared, simultaneously with the degradation of the analog-containing proteins. These pellets do not resemble a degradative organelle, like the lysosome; they are not osmotically sensitive, do not exclude inulin, are not enclosed by a membrane, and do not show autolytic activity. The proteins in the granules could be solubilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate but not by Triton, NaC1, dithiothreitol, RNase, DNase, or phospholipase. The proteins extracted from the pellet with sodium dodecyl sulfate tend to become particulate again upon removal of this detergent. Incorporation of canavanine caused a normally soluble polypeptide, the monomer of beta-galactosidase, to be inactive and found in the sedimentable fraction. These findings suggest that (a) the presence of amino acid analogs in proteins can make them less soluble, and (b) the inclusions are formed by the spontaneous precipitation of abnormal proteins rather than by an active granule-forming process."
https://openalex.org/W1502953132,"The DNA-directed in vitro synthesis of beta-galactosidase has been investigated in a system dependent on Escherichia coli ribosomes, a salt wash of the ribosomes, and a supernatant fraction. Fractionation of the supernatant has made it possible to obtain dependencies on RNA polymerase and another protein factor for beta-galactosidase synthesis. The other factor (called L factor) cannot be replaced by a variety of proteins known to be required for transcription and translation. It has been purified to homogeneity and has a molecular weight of approximately 65,000. Although it is required for the in vitro synthesis of beta-galactosidase, it has no effect on total DNA-dependent amino acid incorporation under the conditions of the incubation. However, total RNA synthesis is depressed by the addition of L factor in a manner similar to what is observed with rho factor could not replace L factor in beta-galactosidase synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1565133908,"Fluorescent beta-galactosides (1-(N-dansyl)amino-beta-D-galactopyranoside (DG0), 2'-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (DG2), 2'-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (oxy-DG2), and 6'-(N-dansyl)aminohexyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (DG6)) competitively inhibit lactose transport by membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli ML 309-225, but are not actively transported. An increase in the fluorescence of these dansylgalactosides is observed upon addition of D-lactate, imposition of a membrane diffusion potential (positive outside), or dilution-induced, carrier-mediated lactose efflux. The increase is not observed with 2'-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-beta-D-thioglucopyranoside nor with membrane vesicles lacking the beta-galactoside transport system. Moreover, the D-lactate-induced fluorescence increase is blocked or rapidly reversed by addition of beta-galactosides, sulfhydryl reagents, inhibitors of D-lactate oxidation, or uncoupling agents. The fluorescence increase exhibits an emission maximum at 500 nm and excitation maxima at 345 nm and at 292 nm. The latter excitation maximum is absent unless D-lactate is added, indicating that the bound dansylgalactoside molecules are excited by energy transfer from the membrane proteins. Titration of vesicles with dansylgalactosides in the presence of D-lactate demonstrates that the lac carrier protein constitutes 3 to 4% oof the total membrane protein, and that the affinity of the carrier for substrate is directly related to the length of the alkyl chain between the galactosidic and the dansyl moieties of the dansylgalactosides. In addition, there is excellent agreement between the affinity constants of the various dansylgalactosides as determined by fluorimetric titration and their apparent Kis for lactose transport (KDs and/or apparent Kis are approximately 550, 3o, 40, and 5 muM FOR DG0, DG2, oxy-DG2, and DG6, respectively). Polarization of fluorescence measurements with DG2 and DG6 demonstrate a dramatic increase in polarization on addition of D-lactate which is reversed by addition of lactose or anaerobiosis. These findings provide strong evidence for the contention that the fluorescence changes observed on energization of the membrane are due to binding of the dansylgalactosides per se, rather than binding followed by transfer into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane"

https://openalex.org/W1528999178,"DNA polymerase III has been purified 4,500-fold from the Escherichis coli mutant, HMS83, which lacks DNA polymerases I and II. When subjected to disc gel electrophoresis, the most purified fraction exhibits a single major protein band from which enzymatic activity may be recovered. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions produces two protein bands with molecular weights of 140,000 and 40,000. The sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme is 7.0 S, and the Stokes radius is 62 A. Taken together these tow parameters indicate a native molecular weight of 180,000. Purified DNA polymerase III catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides into DNA when provided with both a DNA template and a complementary primer strand. The newly synthesized DNA is covalently attached to the 3' terminus of the primer strand. Because the extent of polymerization is only 10 to 100 nucleotides, the best substrates are native DNA molecules with small single-stranded regions. The most purified enzyme preparation is devoid of endonuclease activities. In addition to the two exonuclease activities described in the accompanying paper, purified polymerase III also catalyzes pyrophosphorolysis and the exchange of pyrophosphate into deoxynucleoside triphosphates. DNA polymerase III has also been isolated from wild type E. coli containing the other two known DNA polymerases. Futhermore, the enzyme purified from three different polC mutants exhibits altered polymerase III activity, confirming that polC is the structural gene for DNA polymerase III (Gefter, M., Hirota, Y., Kornberb, T., Wechsler, J., and Barnoux, C. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 68, 3150-3153)."
https://openalex.org/W1571651058,"We have studied the accumulation of dibenzyldimethyl-ammonium ion (DDA+) by respiring membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli, as an index of the generation of an electrical gradient during respiration. Nonrespiring vesicles accumulated DDA+ when K+ efflux was induced by valinomycin or monactin. By various criteria this was shown to be the exchange of one cation for another, independent of metabolism and coupled entirely by electrical forces. Uptake of DDA+ by respiring vesicles was inhibited by ionophores that translocate electrical charge and by reagents that block the respiratory chain. Oxamate and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited accumulation of DDA+ but did not dissipate a preformed pool; the reason appears to be that these reagents are less inhibitory to transport after lactate oxidation has begun than they are in resting vesicles. Uptake does not appear to involve a biological carrier, but requires trace amounts of a lipid-soluble anion such as tetraphenylboron, which has a catalytic role in DDA+ translocation. Respiring K+ vesicles accumulated substantially less DDA+ than did Na+ vesicles. Na+ was expelled from the vesicles concurrently with DDA+ uptake, whereas Rb+ and K+ were not. Thus, DDA+ uptake, whereas Rb+ and K+ were not. Thus, DDA+ uptake may be limited in the latter case by the availability of anionic groups. This explanation was supported by the finding that the addition of nigericin doubled the capacity of K+ vesicles to take up DDA+, presumably by providing a route for K+ to exit in exchange for H+. Parallel experiments on the valinomycin-dependent accumulation of Rb+ by respiring vesicles indicate that this process is analogous to the uptake of DDA+. Ionophores that elicit electrogenic K+ movement also induced respiration-linked transport. Proton-conducting ionophores and several inhibitors of respiration block Rb+ uptake and dissipated a preformed gradient. Preincubation of the vesicles with oxamate or p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited Rb+ uptake, but their addition to respiring vesicles again did not cause efflux. Rb+ and DDA+ complete for uptake when present simultaneously. We conclude that the accumulation of both DDA+ and Rb+ occurs in response to an electrical gradient, vesicle interior negative, produced by respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1480942814,"Escherichia coli formylmethionly-tRNA-tMet is unique among N-acylaminoacyl-tRNAs in its resistance to cleavage by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. Chemical modification of tRNA-fMet with sodium bisulfite converts fMet-tRNA-fMet into a good substrate for the hydrolase. The products of the enzymatic cleavage are free tRNA-fMet and formylmethionine. Bisulfite treatment produces cytidine to uridine base changes at several sites in the tRNA structure. One of these modifications results in formation of a new hydrogen-bonded base pair at the end of the acceptor stem of tRNA-fMet. We have shown that this modification is responsible for the observed change in biological activity. Enzymatic cleavage appears to be facilitated by the presence of a 5-terminal phosphate at the end of a fully base-paired acceptor stem, because removal of the 5-phosphate group from N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA-Phe or bisulfite-modified fMet-tRNA-FMet reduced the rate of hydrolysis of these substrates. The unpaired base at the 5 terminus of unmodified fMet-tRNA-fMet appears to reduce susceptibility of the tRNA to hydrolytic attack both by positioning the 5-phosphate in an unfavorable orientation and by directly interfering with enzymatic binding. The unusual structure of the acceptor stem of this E. coli tRNA thus plays a critical role in maintaining the viability of the organism by preventing enzymatic cleavage of the fMet group from the bacterial initiator tRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1553509664,"N-Acetylglutamate synthase, the first enzyme of arginine biosynthesis, was stabilized in crude extracts from Escherichia coli. At 4 degrees the enzyme lost less than 5% of activity per day. L-Arginine repressed the formation of N-acetylglutamate synthase. Under conditions of genetic or physiological derepression, a specific activity of approximately 50 nmol per min per mg of protein was measured. No activity (i.e. less than 0.2 nmol per min per mg of protein) could be detected in extracts from cells grown under conditions of repression, whereas an intermediate level was found in cell cultivated on minimal medium. In a 6-fold purified preparation L-arginine inhibited the enzyme. Of 11 precursors and analogues of arginine tested only O-[L-norvalyl-5]-isourea inhibited N-acetylglutamate synthase as strongly as L-agrinine."
https://openalex.org/W2104375125,"We have determined the in vitro assembly sequence of ribosomal proteins L7, L10, L11, and L12 on Escherichia coli 50 S subunits by reconstitution experiments with the use of various ribosomal core particles and split protein fractions produced by treatment of 50 S subunits with 1 m NH4Cl and 50% ethanol. Proteins L7, L10, L11, and L12 were removed by a two-step treatment, first at 0 degrees, then at 37 degrees. Small amounts of proteins L1, L5, and L6 were also removed under these conditions. A one-step extraction of 50 S subunits at 0 degrees removed only proteins L7 and L12, while a similar one-step extraction of intact 50 S subunits at 37 degrees removed proteins L7, L12, and L10. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the protein components and measurement of the ribosome-elongation factor G-guanosine diphosphate complex formed with the various reconstituted particles showed that the binding of proteins L7 and L12 is dependent on the binding of protein L10 and in turn, that the binding of protein L10 is dependent on the binding of protein L11."
https://openalex.org/W1522028543,"2-Nitro-4-azidophenyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (azidophenylgalactoside) is a competitive inhibitor of lactose transport in membrane vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli ML 308-225, exhibiting an apparent Ki of 75 muM. The initial rate and steady state level of [3H]azidophenylgalactoside accumulation are markedly stimulated by the addition of D-lactate to vesicles containing the lac transport system, and kinetic studies reveal an apparent Km of 75 muM. Membrane vesicles devoid of the lac transport system do not take up significant amounts of azidophenylgalactoside in the presence or absence of D-lactate. When exposed to visible light in the presence of D-lactate, azidophenylgalactoside irreversibly inactivates the lac transport system. Strikingly, photolytic inactivation is not observed in the absence of D-lactate. Kinetic studies of the inactivation process yield a KD of 77 muM. Since lactose protects against inactivation and azidophenylgalactoside does not inactivate amino acid transport, it is apparent that these effects are specific for the lac transport system. The results are consistent with the proposal that the lac carrier protein is inaccessible to substrate in the absence of energy coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1504884676,"Sulfhydryl reagents, as well as mild hydrogen peroxide oxidation, do not inhibit the activity of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, indicating that the single thiol group and 3 methionine residues present in the enzyme are not essential for activity. Nitration of phosphoglycerate kinase by tetranitromethane inhibits the enzyme by reaction with a single tyrosine residue. Substrates provide partial protection against inactivation by nitration. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that no conformational changes occur upon nitration. However, perturbation of the microenvironment surrounding the aromatic amino acid residues, particularly tyrosine, was observed. The same perturbation was observed on addition of the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate kinase to native phosphoglycerate kinase. The role of lysine in the action of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase has been studied by modification with O-methylisourea, 2-methoxy-5-nitrotropone, and pyridoxal phosphate. Guanidination shows that there are lysines essential for phosphoglycerate kinase; extrapolation to zero activity indicates that there are three essential lysines as judged by nitrotroponylation and three essential lysines when the enzyme is reacted with pyridoxal phosphate. Substrates afford partial protection and extrapolation to total protection indicates that up to three lysines are protected by MgITP and one lysine by 3-phosphoglycerate. Spectrofluorescence and optical rotatory dispersion measurements show that there is no detectable conformational change for the guanidinated phosphoglycerate kinase and that there are slight changes in the spectra suggesting that there may be slight conformational changes for the nitrotroponylated and the pyridoxal phosphate-modified enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1510598783,"The mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex contains a core, consisting of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, to which pyruvate dehydrogenase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase are joined. This report describes studies on the kinetic mechanism of the transacetylase-catalyzed reaction between [1-14C]acetyl-CoA and dihydrolipoamide. This reaction appears to be a model of the physiological reaction, in which the acetyl group is transferred from the S-acetyldihydrolipoyl moiety, bound covalently to the transacetylase, to CoA. The model reaction is not affected by pyruvate dehydrogenase or dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, their substrates and products, or by removal of the covalently bound lipoyl moiety. These findings, together with the results of initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead-end inhibition studies, indicate that the model reaction and, apparently, the physiological reaction as well, proceeds via the Random Bi Bi (rapid equilibrium) mechanism. It appears that at the catalytic center of the transacetylase there are two adjacent sites, one that binds CoA and acetyl-CoA and another that binds dihydrolipoamide and S-acetyldihydrolipoamide (or the corresponding forms of the covalently bound lipoyl moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1515777161,"A ribosomal protein necessary for thiostrepton binding to Escherichia coli ribosomes has been identified using the following criteria: 1. A loss in the thiostrepton binding ability of the ribosome was correlated with the selective removal of ribosomal protein L11. This was achieved by a comparison of the thiostrepton binding ability of 50 S ribosomal subunits treated with 1 M NH4C1 and 50% ethanol at 37 degrees which still contained protein L11, and subunits treated successively at 0 degrees and 37 degrees in the same medium, from which protein L11 had been removed. 2. The thiostrepton binding ability of a ribosomal core containing only seven proteins, produced by treatment of 50 S subunits with 4 M LiC1, was fully restored by the rebinding of protein L11, obtained by Sephadex G-100 fractionation of the 1 M LiC1 split protein fraction from 50 S subunits. In addition, treatment of the 1 M LiC1 split protein fraction with an IgG specific for protein L11, uniquely inhibited the restoration of activity. 3. Thiostrepton binding to the 4 M LiC1 core, reconstituted with the 1 M LiC1 split protein fraction, was blocked by treatment with a monovalent antibody fragment (Fab) prepared against protein L11, but not by treatment with antibodies specific for the proteins of the 4 M LiC1 core. We conclude, therefore, that protein L11 is required for the ribosomal binding of thiostrepton."
https://openalex.org/W1548941751,"Ethidium-binding isotherms for purified circular lambda DNA, isolated from a superinfected lysogen, and for linear lambda DNA, isolated from the purified phage, were constructed from fluorescence measurements of ethidium-DNA MIXTURES. The measurements were made in 0.01 M Tris-HC1-0.001 M EDTA,pH 7.1, buffer at 20 degrees and in the same buffer containing 0.1, 0.4, or 1.0 M NaC1. When NaC1 was present, differences in the binding affinity for supercoiled and linear DNA could be quantitated. As the ethidium concentration was increased, supercoiled lambda DNA molecules bound the intercalating dye first more and then less avidly than nonsupercoiled ones. The number of potential supercoils in a circular lambda DNA molecular in the absence of dye was calculated from the amount of dye bound when it exhibited the same affinity for dye as its linear counterpart. The point of equivalent affinity shifted from 0.053 mol of dye bound per mol of nucleotide in 0.1 M NaC1 to 0.067 mol in 1.0 M NaC1. This corresponds to the removal of 164 and 206 supercoiling turns per molecule and superhelix densities in the absence of dye equal to 0.036 and 0.045 superhelical turns per 10 base pairs. If this difference in the number of supercoils reflects a salt-dependent change in the average rotation angle between base pairs of the Watson-Crick helix the angle differs by 0.32% in the two ionic environments."
https://openalex.org/W1518859640,"We have evaluated three methods which respond specifically to stable RNA-RNA duplexes and have compared their utility for examining several sorts of nucleic acids. We find that these methods, stepwise chromatography on Whatman CF11-cellulose; digestion with Escherichia coli RNase III; and specific inhibition of globin synthesis in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, are able to distinguish between stable double-stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA in the expected manner. The most sensitive method, inhibition of globin synthesis, responds to double-stranded RNA concentrations below 0.1 ng per ml. We have used the predominantly single-stranded RNA from several RNA bacteriophages of E. coli to test both the sensitivity and selectivity of these methods. The three viral RNAs tested contain low levels of double-stranded RNA which can be readily removed, leaving RNA which is not recognized as double-stranded RNA, despite indications from physical and sequencing studies that secondary structure is present. In particular, a potential hairpir loop of known sequence has been isolated from phage f2 RNA. Its properties were found to depart significantly from those of RNA-RNA duplexes by those two of our three methods capable of testing RNA of this size. Analysis of two eukaryotic mRNA populations by these methods was complicated by the presence of poly(A). Synthetic poly(A) chromatographs like double-stranded RNA on cellulose CF11 columns, and we could distinguish it from reovirus double-stranded RNA only at elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1540573525,"Tyrosine phenol-lyase of Escherichia intermedia is inactivated by treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 6.0 AND 4 degrees. Spectrophotometric studies show that the inactivation is stoichiometric, with a modification of 2 histidyl residues per molecule of the enzyme. Finding that this inactivation is largely reversed by treatment with hydroxylamine indicates that the inactivation is mainly due to modification of the histidyl residues. No changes in the sulfhydryl content or in the aromatic amino acids are observed as a result of this modification. The modified tyrosine phenol-lyase retains most of its ability to form a nearly normal complex with its coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. This has been shown by studies of its absorption, by the determination of pyridoxal phosphate, and by reduction of the holoenzyme with tritiated sodium borohydride. The modified enzyme also appears to form a Schiff base intermediate with L-alanine. The modified holoenzyme fails to catalyze the exchange of the alpha-hydrogen of L-alanine with tritium from tritiated water. This is consistent with a catalytic role for modified histidyl residues at the active site of the enzyme; this role is the removal of the alpha-hydrogen of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1494303892,"The sedimentation of circular lambda DNA suggests that the molecular undergoes significant changes in shape and super-coiling as the NaC1 concentration increases. Closed circular lambda DNA, species I, isolated and purified from superinfected immune bacteria, sediments in sucrose gradients of low ionic strength at a rate 2.0 times faster than linear lambda DNA, species III. The addition of ethidium causes the sedimentation rate of species I DNA to decrease until enough dye is bound to remove 121 supercoils per molecule. At this point, species I co-sediments with nicked and nonsupercoiled species II. Futher additions of ethidium cause the sedimentation rate to increase until the relative rate of species I is again at least twice that of species III. This classical behavior is altered when NaC1 is present in the buffer. In 1.0 M NaC1 the changes in S are complex. Initially, species I sediments 1.55 times faster than species III. Titration with ethidium caused a decrease in S to an early minimum value, than an increase to a first maximum, followed by a decrease to the S of species II. At this point enough dye has intercalated to remove 208 superhelical turns. Further additions of dye introduce supercoils and cause S to increase again. In 0.1 to 0.4 M NaC1 the relative S of species I is 1.69 and 1.59, respectively. If titrated with ethidium, S first increases to a maximum value then decreases to the minimum rate when enough dye is bound to remove 158 and 183 supercoils, respectively. The results indicate an increase in the superhelix density from 0.026 turns per 10 base pairs in buffer alone to 0.045 in the same buffer with 1.0 M NaC1. If this change in superhelix density results from a concomitant change in the average rotation angle between base pairs in the Watson-Crick helix, the addition of 1.0 M NaC1 alters the rotation angle by 0.68 degrees per base pair."

https://openalex.org/W1507176327,"The relationship between the methylation and processing of tRNA in both bacterial and mammalian cell systems was investigated by assessing the methylation of an existing population of precursor-tRNAs in the absence of tRNA synthesis. When the synthesis of tRNA in Escherichia coli B (rifampicin) and human KB cells (actinomycin D) was inhibited with the appropriate antibiotic, the incorporation of [3H[methyl groups into tRNA (via [methyl-3H]methionine labeling) rapidly declined with time and was essentially complete within 30 and 60 min, respectively. Although antibiotic treatment predictably reduced the incorporation of methyl groups into tRNA, it also resulted in significant changes in the distribution of the type of methylated products formed. Thus, for KB cells the marked increases in the per cent of radioactivity incorporated into 2'-0-methylribose derivatives, N2-methylguanine, and 3-methylcytosine of tRNA preparation pre-chased with actinomycin D for progressively longer periods of time prior to labeling with [methyl-3H]methionine led to the interpretation that these methylated constituents were formed predominantly during the late stages of tRNA maturation. Similarly, progessive and marked decreases in 1-, 7-, and N2, N2-methylguanine, and moderate decreases in 1-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and 5-methyluracil revealed that these methylated products were formed primarily during the early and intermediate stages of maturation, respectively. Similar analysis of E. coli B methylation products indicated that the bulk of methyl groups incorporated into the base moieties of tRNA (1- and 7-methylguanine, 2- and N6-methyladenine, and 5-methyluracil) occurred prior to the formation of 2'-0-methylribose derivatives. Additional evidence is presented which negates the possibility that an ancillary action of these antibiotics was the inhibition of specific tRNA-methyl-transferase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1527637087,"The conformational changes in aspartate transcarbamylase upon binding of substrates or regulatory ligands and the effects of alterations in the subunit structure on the allosteric interactions are reviewed. The available information including recent results from studies of the c3r6 complex (c denotes the catalytic polypeptide and r, the regulatory polypeptide) is considered in terms of the existing models for the discrepancies between experimental observations and the present models could be resolved by postulating an important role for r:r interactions in the allosteric mechanism. A new model is presented in which an obligatory conformational change upon binding of substrates results in an alteration in the relative orientation of c versus r. As a consequence of symmetry conservation, the r:r domain is shifted to a position of higher potential energy. By favoring one or the other alternative r:r domains, CTP and ATP can respectively enhance and reduce the sigmoidal character of substrate saturation. The model is shown to be consistent with all of the important known properties of the enzyme. Because the heterotropic effects of CTP or ATP are postulated to operate via a mechanism separate from that for the homotropic effects of the substrates, this model accounts satisfactorily for the observation by Kerbiriou and Herve (Kerbiriou, D., and Herve, G. (1973) J. Mol. Biol. 78, 687-702) that homotropic effects can be abolished whereas heterotropic effects are retained in the altered enzyme from Escherichia coli grown in the presence of 2-thiouracil."
https://openalex.org/W1580133398,"On the basis of previous work the two forms of human secretory component, namely that which is covalently bound as a part of the exocrine immunoglobulin A molecule and the free form, are probably different states of the same protein. From autoradiographs of trypic peptide maps of bound and free secretory components which were radioactively alkylated after partial reduction, it was concluded that the same half-cystines in each are sensitive to reduction. in the present work the easily reduced half-cystines of the bound and free secretory components have been studies in more detail. In each form there are two such half-cystines. In the case of bound secretory component they provide the linkage to the remainder of the exocrine immunoglobulin A molecule. Peptides from the sensitive half-cystines were isolated from tryptic-peptic digests of free secretory component and sequenced. By diagonal electrophoresis these two peptides were shown to be joined in an intrachain disulfide bridge. Therefore, it is proposed that the exocrine immunoglobulin A molecule becomes fully assembled when a single, reactive intrachain disulfide bridge in free secretory component rearranges to yeild two interchain bridges with dimeric serum-type immunoglobulin A. This process is thought to occur within the epithelial lining cells of mucous membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1482645770,"With the use of a precursor to Escherichia coli tRNA-Tyr as a substrate, we have detected and partially purified a novel endoribonuclease from the cytoplasm of human KB tissue culture cells.

In keeping with this observation, we have found that, of a variety of substrates tested, only those which are unstable in vivo are attacked by RNase NU. RNase NU can be purified from the 0.2 M NH4Cl wash of ribosomes followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. RNase NU cleaves RNA to create 3'-phosphate-terminated oligonucleotides. It has a pH optimum near 8.0, requires either a monovalent cation (NH4+ is most efficient) or Ca-2+ for optimal activity, and is inhibited by 0.1 M PO4-3-.

https://openalex.org/W1487324654,"Experiments were performed to evaluate the ability of the enzymes of Escherichia coli involved in glycerol 3-phosphate metabolism to recognize phosphonic acid analogues of the natural substrate. Neither the catabolic membrane-bound glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nor the acyl coenzyme A: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase can use 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphnate or 2,3-dihydroxypropyl-1-phosphonate are inhibitors of the reduction of dihydroxyactone phosphate as substrates. The 4-carbon phosphonic acid analogue does not exhibit inhibitory activity for either of these enzymes. While the 3-carbon phosphonic acid analogue has no inhibitory effect upon the catabolic dehydrogenase, it does appear to have a slight but reproducible inhibitory effect on the acyltransferase. Glycerol 3-phosphate and 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate by glycerol 3-phosphate:NAD (P) oxidoreductase. rac-2,3-Dihydroxypropyl-1-phosphonate does not appear to be recognized by this enzyme. The apparent K-i for snglycerol 3-phosphate is 19 muM and for D-3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate it is 42 muM. In addition the glycerol 3-phosphate:NAD(P) oxidoreductase catalyzes the reduction of 4-hydroxy-3-oxobutyl-1-phosphonate (apparent K-m of 182 muM), a phosphonic acid analogue of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. 3,4-Dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate is both a competitive inhibitor (apparent Ki of 740 muM) and a substrate (apparent K-m of 450 muM) for the CDP-diglyceride: glycerol 3 phosphate phosphatidyltransferase but it has no effect upon CDP-diglyceride:L-serine phosphatidyltransferase. The relationship ofthese in vitro studies to in vivo investigations is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2081702132,"DISSOLVED yellow organic matter (yellow substance) is ubiquitous in aquatic systems, and is thought to influence the state of ecosystems by affecting the transport and fate of minerals, primary production and, perhaps, the behaviour of aquatic organisms1–4. Although much studied, yellow substance remains chemically and physically ill-defined. It is primarily responsible for the yellow colour of particulate-free natural waters which is generally accepted to be the result of the aqueous extract of decaying plant material. One of the primary constituents of plant material, lignin, is the precursor of a class of stable, yellow-brown, intermediate decay products called humins or humic substance5. Divided into two fractions, humic acid (base soluble) and fulvic acid (acid soluble), these compounds are insoluble in water and are typically analysed as extracts from soil or sediment. Yellow substance is the remaining yellow decay product and is often called soluble humin (dissolved humic acid). There are data, particularly differences in elemental composition and visible and ultraviolet light absorption, however, suggesting that yellow substance is a separate compound with cellulose as its source rather than lignin6."
https://openalex.org/W1480920615,"A 5.8 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is found noncovalently bound to the 25 S RNA in the 60 S subunit of yeast ribosomes. Both molecules appear to be derived from the 27 S RNA, a ribosomal precursor species (Uden, S. A., and Warner, J. R. (1972) J. Mol. biol. 65, 227-242). We have detected two other RNA species by pulse labeling which may also be produced during 27 S RNA processing. The first is approximately 5.9 S and appears by kinetics of synthesis to be a direct precursor of 5.8 S rRNA. The second species is about 7 S, is absent from uniformly labeled RNA preparations, and is produced coincidentally with the 5.8 S rRNA. Both the 5.9 S RNA and the 7 S RNA are not produced in mutants defective in ribosome biosynthesis (Hartwell, L. H., McLaughlin, C. S., and Warner, J. R. (1970) Mol. Gen. Genet. 109, 42-56) which are unable to make the 25 S-5.8 S rRNA complex from 27 S RNA. Thus, the maturation of 27 S RNA appears to involve the production of a 7 S RNA, which could be either a precursor or a nonconserved RNA region, and a 5.9 S RNA, most of which is trimmed to give the mature 5.8 S rRNA in the 25 S-5.8 S rRNA complex of 60 S subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1505638318,"Kinetic analysis of the biosynthetic threonine deaminase, EC 4.2.1.16, from Samonella typhimurium yields hyperbolic substrate saturation curves in the absence of, and higher order substrate saturation curves in the presence of, L-isoleucine. L-Valine reverses this effect of L-isoleucine by restoring the hyperbolic substrate saturation curves. The inhibition of enzyme activity and the reversal of valine stimulation is a function of a second order concentration of L-isoleucine, whereas antagonism of inhibition is a function of first order concentration of valine. The antagonistic effects on enzyme activity of L-isoleucine and of L-valine appear as competitive in diagnostic plots. Threonine deaminase possesses two L-isoleucine binding sites (Kd equals 3.6 muM) and one L-valine binding site (Kd equals 26 muM); the binding of these ligands appear competitive. Exclusion of L-valine requires the binding of 2 molecules of L-isoleucine whereas binding of a single L-valine molecule prevents the binding of 2 L-isoleucine molecules. Cooperative binding of L-isoleucine is not observed under any of the conditions tested. Two cases, expressed in terms of modified Adair equations and based upon the assumption that L-threonine also serves as an activator ligand which binds to the L-valine site, are presented. Case I states that liganding of the activator sites must percede substrate-binding at the active site, and Case II states that the activator site liganding is required solely for reactivation of the L-isoleucine-inhibited enzyme. Analysis of kinetic data by a curve-fitting process suggests that Case II described the relationship between the activator site and the L-isoleucine sites. An enzymatically inactive derivative of threonine deaminase, prepared by reduction with borohydride, binds isoleucine and valine in a manner similar to native holoenzyme. Binding of L-threonine and L-valine to the derivatized enzyme is competitive. The Kd for threonine binding is 3 mM, which is in excellent agreement with the Kd determined by the curve fitting process. It is concluded that the modulation of threonine deaminase activity is wrought by interaction between inhibitor sites and an activator site rather than inhibitor and active sites and that induced transitions rather than concerted transitions more adequately describe the underlying regulatory principle."
https://openalex.org/W1970152136,"Binesis is a process whereby the membrane of the insulin secretory vesicle in the beta cell forms a lingula that indents the vesicular membrane of an adjoining secretory vesicle or the plasma membrane. Vesicular binesis in beta cells increases when islets of Langerhans are incubated at a stimulatory glucose concentration (300 milligrams per 100 milliliters). These vesicular membrane alterations may be the morphological concomitants of activation of the insulin secretory vesicle, and indicate an active role for the vesicle and its membrane in the release mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1525870714,"In various nutrient-limited cultures of either Escherichia coli W4597(K) or G34 a 10-fold range of rates of glycogen synthesis is observed while the energy charge values (0.86 plus or minus 0.01) and glucose 6-phosphate levels are essentially the same in each condition. The steady state level of fructose 1,6-diphosphate in these cultures varies from experiment to experiment as a function of the observed rate of glycogen synthesis. These data were fitted to the Hill equation by a nonlinear regression analysis and the statistically most probable values obtained for the Hill coefficient (n), A0.5, and V were, respectively, 2.08, 0.82mM, and 1030 mumol/g of protein per hour. The values of the first two parameters agree well with values available at energy charge 0.85 for the in vitro synthesis of ADPG by the ADPG synthetase of E. coli. When the difference in the glucose 1-phosphate concentration used in the studies in vitro from the apparent glucose 1-phosphate concentration in vivo (estimated from the glucose 6-phosphate levels) is considered, the in vitro value of V (1140 mumol of ADPG synthesized per g of protein per hour) is quite similar to the value of V (1030 mumol of glucose incorporated into glycogen per g of protein per hour) for glycogen synthesis in vivo. The close agreement of the values of the parameters of the Hill equation for glycogen synthesis in vivo to the values obtained for ADPG synthesis in vitro provides the most quantitative evidence yet obtained that allosteric regulation of bacterial glycogen synthesis functions in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1582928115,"The interaction between the catalytic subunit (c3) and the regulatory subunit (r2) of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli was studied by measuring the reversible formation of the c3r6 complex as a function of r2 concentration. Conversion to the native enzyme was prevented by using a very low concentration of c2 (40 ng per ml) in the presence of bovine serum albumin. A simple hyperbolic r2 saturation curve was obtained suggesting the presence of only one kind of c:r domain. From the association constant for the formation of c3r6, the free energy of c:r interaction can be estimated to be about -10 Cal per mole. Neither CTP nor ATP appears to affect the strength of c:r interaction in this complex. Succinate in the presence of carbamyl phosphate promotes tighter binding. At higher concentration of c3 and nonsaturating levels of r2, conversion to the native enzyme (c3r6) takes place. This renaturation process is second order with respect to the concentration of c3 and is virtually irreversible. Renaturation is inhibited by saturating levels of r2 and to some extent by both CTP and ATP. The effect of ligands on c:r interactions reported here may have significance in the allosteric mechanism of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1542911551,"Using RNA polymerase purified from Escherichia coli, DNA isolated from the bacteriophage T4, and a bacterial supernatant fraction containing the necessary processing enzymes, a set of transfer RNAs can be formed in vitro. To characterize the site or sites of initiation of this tRNA transcription, rifampicin-resistant complexes of RNA polymerase, DNA, and either ATP (UTP and CTP) or GTP (UTP and CTP) were formed, and tRNA was transcribed from these stabilized sites. It is concluded that transcription of the entire set is initiated by ATP. To study the transcription of the tRNAs, the time sequence of the appearance of individual species was determined during synchronous transcription of a preformed RNA polymerase-DNA complex. The appearance of three RNA species is found to be consistent with the sequential transcription of a large polycistronic cluster; the order and distances, inferred from the times of transcription, are as required by the existing gene map. It is concluded that the initiation of tRNA transcription can occur, without accessory factors, with the insertion of ATP at a single or a few closely spaced sites, and that the tRNAs encoded by the bacteriophage T4 are present in a single operon."

https://openalex.org/W1584900119,"The interaction of protein synthesis elongation factor 1 (EF-1) from wheat embryos and elongation factor Tu from Escherichia coli with cytidylyl(5'-3')guanosine 5'-triphosphate(pppGpC) has been studied. The dinucleotide 5'-triphosphate interacts strongly with EF-1 as evidenced by its capacity to inhibit the binding of [3H]GTP to the factor. The analogs pGpC and GpC do not interfere with GTP binding to EF-1 but guanosine 5'-triphosphate cyclic 2',3'-monophosphate and ppGpC are also potent inhibitors. The binding of the dinucleotide 5'-triphosphate to EF-1 was also demonstrated directly by the nitrocellulose retention method and by Sephadex G-50 fractionation using a radioactive analog iodinated with 125I in the 5 position of the cytosine of pppGpC. The dinucleotide triphosphate can replace GTP in the formation of a ternary complex EF-1-aminoacyl-tRNA-GTP and in its requirement for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes catalyzed by EF-1. The absolute requirement for GTP in an in vitro polypeptide-synthesizing system can also be met by pppGpC and by guanosine 5'-triphosphate cyclic 5',3'-monophosphate. The bacterial factor EF-Tu differs drastically from eukaryotic EF-1 in its nucleotide specificity since EF-Tu only interacts slightly (if at all) with pppGpC. The low inhibition of [3H]GTP binding to EF-Tu by pppGpC could be due to a slight contamination in the latter compound."
