https://openalex.org/W2005937895,"The use of molecular spin state as a quantum of information for storage, sensing and computing has generated considerable interest in the context of next-generation data storage and communication devices, opening avenues for developing multifunctional molecular spintronics. Such ideas have been researched extensively, using single-molecule magnets and molecules with a metal ion or nitrogen vacancy as localized spin-carrying centres for storage and for realizing logic operations. However, the electronic coupling between the spin centres of these molecules is rather weak, which makes construction of quantum memory registers a challenging task. In this regard, delocalized carbon-based radical species with unpaired spin, such as phenalenyl, have shown promise. These phenalenyl moieties, which can be regarded as graphene fragments, are formed by the fusion of three benzene rings and belong to the class of open-shell systems. The spin structure of these molecules responds to external stimuli (such as light, and electric and magnetic fields), which provides novel schemes for performing spin memory and logic operations. Here we construct a molecular device using such molecules as templates to engineer interfacial spin transfer resulting from hybridization and magnetic exchange interaction with the surface of a ferromagnet; the device shows an unexpected interfacial magnetoresistance of more than 20 per cent near room temperature. Moreover, we successfully demonstrate the formation of a nanoscale magnetic molecule with a well-defined magnetic hysteresis on ferromagnetic surfaces. Owing to strong magnetic coupling with the ferromagnet, such independent switching of an adsorbed magnetic molecule has been unsuccessful with single-molecule magnets. Our findings suggest the use of chemically amenable phenalenyl-based molecules as a viable and scalable platform for building molecular-scale quantum spin memory and processors for technological development."

https://openalex.org/W2013636493,"In diabetes, some of the cellular changes are similar to aging. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like changes in the endothelial cells (ECs) and tissues leading to structural and functional damage. We investigated glucose-induced aging in 3 types of ECs using senescence associated β-gal (SA β-gal) staining and cell morphology. Alterations of sirtuins (SIRTs) and their downstream mediator FOXO and oxidative stress were investigated. Relationship of such alteration with histone acetylase (HAT) p300 was examined. Similar examinations were performed in tissues of diabetic animals. ECs in high glucose (HG) showed evidence of early senescence as demonstrated by increased SA β-gal positivity and reduced replicative capacities. These alterations were pronounced in microvascular ECs. They developed an irregular and hypertrophic phenotype. Such changes were associated with decreased SIRT (1-7) mRNA expressions. We also found that p300 and SIRT1 regulate each other in such process, as silencing one led to increase of the others' expression. Furthermore, HG caused reduction in FOXO1's DNA binding ability and antioxidant target gene expressions. Chemically induced increased SIRT1 activity and p300 knockdown corrected these abnormalities slowing aging-like changes. Diabetic animals showed increased cellular senescence in renal glomerulus and retinal blood vessels along with reduced SIRT1 mRNA expressions in these tissues. Data from this study demonstrated that hyperglycemia accelerates aging-like process in the vascular ECs and such process is mediated via downregulation of SIRT1, causing reduction of mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme in a p300 and FOXO1 mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2130819396,"The diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) at an early stage, as well as better prediction of outcome remains clinically challenging due to the lack of specific and robust non-invasive markers. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), particularly those found in the bloodstream, has opened up new perspectives for tumor diagnosis and prognosis. The aim of our study was to determine whether expression profiles of specific miRNAs in plasma could accurately discriminate between NSCLC patients and controls, and whether they are able to predict the prognosis of resectable NSCLC patients. We therefore evaluated a series of seventeen NSCLC-related miRNAs by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR in plasma from 52 patients with I-IIIA stages NSCLC, 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 20-age, sex and smoking status-matched healthy individuals. We identified an eleven-plasma miRNA panel that could distinguish NSCLC patients from healthy subjects (AUC = 0.879). A six-plasma miRNA panel was able to discriminate between NSCLC patients and COPD patients (AUC = 0.944). Furthermore, we identified a three-miRNA plasma signature (high miR-155-5p, high miR-223-3p, and low miR-126-3p) that significantly associated with a higher risk for progression in adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, a three-miRNA plasma panel (high miR-20a-5p, low miR-152-3p, and low miR-199a-5p) significantly predicted survival of squamous cell carcinoma patients. In conclusion, we identified two plasma miRNA expression profiles that may be useful for predicting the outcome of patients with resectable NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2002197655,"[Ca(2+)]i signaling regulates sperm motility, enabling switching between functionally different behaviors that the sperm must employ as it ascends the female tract and fertilizes the oocyte. We report that different behaviors in human sperm are recruited according to the Ca(2+) signaling pathway used. Activation of CatSper (by raising pHi or stimulating with progesterone) caused sustained [Ca(2+)]i elevation but did not induce hyperactivation, the whiplash-like behavior required for progression along the oviduct and penetration of the zona pellucida. In contrast, penetration into methylcellulose (mimicking penetration into cervical mucus or cumulus matrix) was enhanced by activation of CatSper. NNC55-0396, which abolishes CatSper currents in human sperm, inhibited this effect. Treatment with 5 μm thimerosal to mobilize stored Ca(2+) caused sustained [Ca(2+)]i elevation and induced strong, sustained hyperactivation that was completely insensitive to NNC55-0396. Thimerosal had no effect on penetration into methylcellulose. 4-Aminopyridine, a powerful modulator of sperm motility, both raised pHi and mobilized Ca(2+) stored in sperm (and from microsomal membrane preparations). 4-Aminopyridine-induced hyperactivation even in cells suspended in Ca(2+)-depleted medium and also potentiated penetration into methylcellulose. The latter effect was sensitive to NNC55-039, but induction of hyperactivation was not. We conclude that these two components of the [Ca(2+)]i signaling apparatus have strikingly different effects on sperm motility. Furthermore, since stored Ca(2+) at the sperm neck can be mobilized by Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, we propose that CatSper activation can elicit functionally different behaviors according to the sensitivity of the Ca(2+) store, which may be regulated by capacitation and NO from the cumulus."

https://openalex.org/W2128336298,"The clinic therapeutic effect of resveratrol is limited due to its low oral bioavailability. Piceid, a precursor of resveratrol, is the most abundant form of resveratrol in nature. A number of studies have hypothesized that piceid may have the same bioactivities like those of resveratrol. The aim of this work is to compare piceid with resveratrol in antioxidation and antiproliferation activities in vitro.The antioxidative effects of resveratrol and piceid were evaluated by phenanthroline-Fe²⁺ method and H₂O₂-induced oxidative injury cell model. The antiproliferation effects were determined by MTT method in human liver tumor HepG2 cells, human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells. The effects of resveratrol and piceid on the cell cycle and the apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Additionally, the uptake profiles of resveratrol and piceid in cancer cells were observed using fluorescence microscopy and clarified by LC-MS/MS.Piceid exhibited higher scavenging activity against hydroxyl radicals than resveratrol in vitro. Resveratrol showed a significant protective effect against H₂O₂-induced cell damage. What is more, resveratrol had biphasic effects on tumor cells. Resveratrol and piceid only showed significant cytotoxicity on tumor cells at high concentration (≥50 µmol/L), while low concentration of resveratrol (<30 µmol/L) increased the cell viability. The principal effect of resveratrol and piceid on the viability of tumor cells was caused by the cell cycle arrest, while the effect on apoptosis was relatively minor. The reason that piceid showed lower biological activity than resveratrol at the same concentration was probably because piceid was more difficult in being uptaken by cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972570808,"miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression that are frequently deregulated in cancer, with aberrant DNA methylation being an epigenetic mechanism involved in this process. We previously identified miRNA promoter regions active in normal mammary cell types and here we analyzed which of these promoters are targets of aberrant DNA methylation in human breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor specimens. Using 5-methylcytosine immunoprecipitation coupled to miRNA tiling microarray hybridization, we performed comprehensive evaluation of DNA methylation of miRNA gene promoters in breast cancer. We found almost one third (55/167) of miRNA promoters were targets for aberrant methylation in breast cancer cell lines. Breast tumor specimens displayed DNA methylation of majority of these miRNA promoters, indicating that these changes in DNA methylation might be clinically relevant. Aberrantly methylated miRNA promoters were, similar to protein coding genes, enriched for promoters targeted by polycomb in normal cells. Detailed analysis of selected miRNA promoters revealed decreased expression of miRNA linked to increased promoter methylation for mir-31, mir-130a, let-7a-3/let-7b, mir-155, mir-137 and mir-34b/mir-34c genes. The proportion of miRNA promoters we found aberrantly methylated in breast cancer is several fold larger than that observed for protein coding genes, indicating an important role of DNA methylation in miRNA deregulation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2078295116,"Flexibility in scheduling varies throughout an organism’s annual cycle, reflecting relative temporal constraints and fitness consequences among life-history stages. Time-selection can act at different scales, either by limiting the range of alternative strategies in the population, or by increasing the precision of individual performance. We tracked individual bar-tailed godwits Limosa lapponica baueri for two full years (including direct observation during non-breeding seasons in New Zealand and geolocator tracking of round-trip migrations to Alaska) to present a full annual-cycle view of molt, breeding, and migration schedules. At both population and individual scales, temporal variation was greater in post-breeding than pre-breeding stages, and greater in molts than in movements, but schedules did not tighten across successive stages of migration toward the breeding grounds. In general, individual godwits were quite consistent in timing of events throughout the year, and repeatability of pre-breeding movements was particularly high (r = 0.82–0.92). However, we demonstrate that r values misrepresent absolute consistency by confounding inter- and intra-individual variation; the biological significance of r values can only be understood when these are considered separately. By doing so, we show that some stages have considerable tolerance for alternative strategies within the population, whereas scheduling of northbound migratory movements was similar for all individuals. How time-selection simultaneously shapes both individual and population variation is central to understanding and predicting adaptive phenological responses to environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2087037104,"Background Infertility is a major medical condition that affects many married couples in sub-Saharan African and as such associated with several social meanings. This study therefore explored community's perception of childbearing and childlessness in Northern Ghana using the Upper West Region as a case study. Methods The study was exploratory and qualitative using in-depth and key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Fifteen marriage unions with infertility (childless), forty-five couples with children, and eight key informants were purposively sampled and interviewed using a semi-structured interview guides. Three focus group discussions were also carried out, one for childless women, one for women with children and one with men with children. The data collected were transcribed, coded, arranged, and analyzed for categories and themes and finally triangulated. Results The study revealed that infertility was caused by both social and biological factors. Socially couples could become infertile through supernatural causes such as bewitchment, and disobediences of social norms. Abortion, masturbation and use of contraceptives were also identified as causes of infertility. Most childless couples seek treatment from spiritualist, traditional healers and hospital. These sources of treatment are used simultaneously. Conclusion Childbearing is highly valued in the community and Childlessness is highly engendered, and stigmatised in this community with manifold social consequences. In such a community therefore, the concept of reproductive choice must encompass policies that make it possible for couples to aspire to have the number of children they wish."
https://openalex.org/W2042921786,"The developing testis provides an environment that nurtures germ cell development, ultimately ensuring spermatogenesis and fertility. Impacts on this environment are considered to underlie aberrant germ cell development and formation of germ cell tumour precursors. The signaling events involved in testis formation and male fetal germ cell development remain largely unknown. Analysis of knockout mice lacking single Tgfβ family members has indicated that Tgfβ's are not required for sex determination. However, due to functional redundancy, it is possible that additional functions for these ligands in gonad development remain to be discovered. Using FACS purified gonadal cells, in this study we show that the genes encoding Activin's, TGFβ's, Nodal and their respective receptors, are expressed in sex and cell type specific patterns suggesting particular roles in testis and germ cell development. Inhibition of signaling through the receptors ALK4, ALK5 and ALK7, and ALK5 alone, demonstrated that TGFβ signaling is required for testis cord formation during the critical testis-determining period. We also show that signaling through the Activin/NODAL receptors, ALK4 and ALK7 is required for promoting differentiation of male germ cells and their entry into mitotic arrest. Finally, our data demonstrate that Nodal is specifically expressed in male germ cells and expression of the key pluripotency gene, Nanog was significantly reduced when signaling through ALK4/5/7 was blocked. Our strategy of inhibiting multiple Activin/NODAL/TGFβ receptors reduces the functional redundancy between these signaling pathways, thereby revealing new and essential roles for TGFβ and Activin signaling during testis formation and male germ cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1968776183,"Background Evidence on the prevalence and determinants of burnout among military acute and critical care nursing personnel from developing countries is minimal, precluding the development of effective preventive measures for this high-risk occupational group. In this context, we aimed to examine the association between the dimensions of burnout and selected socio-demographic and occupational factors in military acute/critical care nursing personnel from Lima, Peru. Methods and Findings We conducted a cross-sectional study in 93 nurses/nurse assistants from the acute and critical care departments of a large, national reference, military hospital in Lima, Peru, using a socio-demographic/occupational questionnaire and a validated Spanish translation of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Total scores for each of the burnout dimensions were calculated for each participant. Higher emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation scores, and lower personal achievement scores, implied a higher degree of burnout. We used linear regression to evaluate the association between each of the burnout dimensions and selected socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, after adjusting for potential confounders. The associations of the burnout dimensions were heterogeneous for the different socio-demographic and occupational factors. Higher emotional exhaustion scores were independently associated with having children (p<0.05) and inversely associated with the time working in the current department (p<0.05). Higher depersonalization scores were independently associated with being single compared with being divorced, separated or widowed (p<0.01), working in the emergency room/intensive care unit compared with the recovery room (p<0.01), and inversely associated with age (p<0.05). Finally, higher personal achievement scores were independently associated with having children (p<0.05). Conclusion Among Peruvian military acute and critical care nursing personnel, potential screening and preventive interventions should focus on younger/less experienced nurses/nurse assistants, who are single, have children, or work in the most acute critical care areas (e.g. the emergency room/intensive care unit)."
https://openalex.org/W1980120379,"Pax6 encodes a specific DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the development of multiple organs, including the eye, brain and pancreas. Previous studies have shown that Pax6 regulates the entire process of ocular lens development. In the developing forebrain, Pax6 is expressed in ventricular zone precursor cells and in specific populations of neurons; absence of Pax6 results in disrupted cell proliferation and cell fate specification in telencephalon. In the pancreas, Pax6 is essential for the differentiation of α-, β- and δ-islet cells. To elucidate molecular roles of Pax6, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments combined with high-density oligonucleotide array hybridizations (ChIP-chip) were performed using three distinct sources of chromatin (lens, forebrain and β-cells). ChIP-chip studies, performed as biological triplicates, identified a total of 5,260 promoters occupied by Pax6. 1,001 (133) of these promoter regions were shared between at least two (three) distinct chromatin sources, respectively. In lens chromatin, 2,335 promoters were bound by Pax6. RNA expression profiling from Pax6⁺/⁻ lenses combined with in vivo Pax6-binding data yielded 76 putative Pax6-direct targets, including the Gaa, Isl1, Kif1b, Mtmr2, Pcsk1n, and Snca genes. RNA and ChIP data were validated for all these genes. In lens cells, reporter assays established Kib1b and Snca as Pax6 activated and repressed genes, respectively. In situ hybridization revealed reduced expression of these genes in E14 cerebral cortex. Moreover, we examined differentially expressed transcripts between E9.5 wild type and Pax6⁻/⁻ lens placodes that suggested Efnb2, Fat4, Has2, Nav1, and Trpm3 as novel Pax6-direct targets. Collectively, the present studies, through the identification of Pax6-direct target genes, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pax6 gene control during mouse embryonic development. In addition, the present data demonstrate that Pax6 interacts preferentially with promoter regions in a tissue-specific fashion. Nevertheless, nearly 20% of the regions identified are accessible to Pax6 in multiple tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2046549776,"Background Host and parasitoid interaction is one of the most fascinating relationships of insects, which is currently receiving an increasing interest. Understanding the mechanisms evolved by the parasitoids to evade or suppress the host immune system is important for dissecting this interaction, while it was still poorly known. In order to gain insight into the immune response of Tenebrio molitor to parasitization by Scleroderma guani, the transcriptome of T. molitor pupae was sequenced with focus on immune-related gene, and the non-parasitized and parasitized T. molitor pupae were analyzed by digital gene expression (DGE) analysis with special emphasis on parasitoid-induced immune-related genes using Illumina sequencing. Methodology/Principal Findings In a single run, 264,698 raw reads were obtained. De novo assembly generated 71,514 unigenes with mean length of 424 bp. Of those unigenes, 37,373 (52.26%) showed similarity to the known proteins in the NCBI nr database. Via analysis of the transcriptome data in depth, 430 unigenes related to immunity were identified. DGE analysis revealed that parasitization by S. guani had considerable impacts on the transcriptome profile of T. molitor pupae, as indicated by the significant up- or down-regulation of 3,431 parasitism-responsive transcripts. The expression of a total of 74 unigenes involved in immune response of T. molitor was significantly altered after parasitization. Conclusions/Significance obtained T. molitor transcriptome, in addition to establishing a fundamental resource for further research on functional genomics, has allowed the discovery of a large group of immune genes that might provide a meaningful framework to better understand the immune response in this species and other beetles. The DGE profiling data provides comprehensive T. molitor immune gene expression information at the transcriptional level following parasitization, and sheds valuable light on the molecular understanding of the host-parasitoid interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2082444703,"We explored the relationship between growth in tooth root length and the modern human extended period of childhood. Tooth roots provide support to counter chewing forces and so it is advantageous to grow roots quickly to allow teeth to erupt into function as early as possible. Growth in tooth root length occurs with a characteristic spurt or peak in rate sometime between tooth crown completion and root apex closure. Here we show that in Pan troglodytes the peak in root growth rate coincides with the period of time teeth are erupting into function. However, the timing of peak root velocity in modern humans occurs earlier than expected and coincides better with estimates for tooth eruption times in Homo erectus. With more time to grow longer roots prior to eruption and smaller teeth that now require less support at the time they come into function, the root growth spurt no longer confers any advantage in modern humans. We suggest that a prolonged life history schedule eventually neutralised this adaptation some time after the appearance of Homo erectus. The root spurt persists in modern humans as an intrinsic marker event that shows selection operated, not primarily on tooth tissue growth, but on the process of tooth eruption. This demonstrates the overarching influence of life history evolution on several aspects of dental development. These new insights into tooth root growth now provide an additional line of enquiry that may contribute to future studies of more recent life history and dietary adaptations within the genus Homo."
https://openalex.org/W2084309644,"Because animal studies are labor intensive, predictive equations are used extensively for calculating metabolizable energy (ME) concentrations of dog and cat pet foods. The objective of this retrospective review of digestibility studies, which were conducted over a 7-year period and based upon Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) feeding protocols, was to compare the accuracy and precision of equations developed from these animal feeding studies to commonly used predictive equations. Feeding studies in dogs and cats (331 and 227 studies, respectively) showed that equations using modified Atwater factors accurately predict ME concentrations in dog and cat pet foods (r²= 0.97 and 0.98, respectively). The National Research Council (NRC) equations also accurately predicted ME concentrations in pet foods (r² = 0.97 for dog and cat foods). For dogs, these equations resulted in an average estimate of ME within 0.16% and 2.24% of the actual ME measured (equations using modified Atwater factors and NRC equations, respectively); for cats these equations resulted in an average estimate of ME within 1.57% and 1.80% of the actual ME measured. However, better predictions of dietary ME in dog and cat pet foods were achieved using equations based on analysis of gross energy (GE) and new factors for moisture, protein, fat and fiber. When this was done there was less than 0.01% difference between the measured ME and the average predicted ME (r² = 0.99 and 1.00 in dogs and cats, respectively) whereas the absolute value of the difference between measured and predicted was reduced by approximately 50% in dogs and 60% in cats. Stool quality, which was measured by stool score, was influenced positively when dietary protein digestibility was high and fiber digestibility was low. In conclusion, using GE improves predictive equations for ME content of dog and cat pet foods. Nondigestible protein and fiber content of diets predicts stool quality."
https://openalex.org/W2000196896,"Quality control of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is vital in preventing mutagenesis. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), a repair process predominant in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, rejoins DSBs either accurately or with errors, but the mechanisms controlling its fidelity are poorly understood. Here we show that BRCA1, a tumor suppressor, enhances the fidelity of NHEJ-mediated DSB repair and prevents mutagenic deletional end-joining through interaction with canonical NHEJ machinery during G1. BRCA1 binds and stabilizes Ku80 at DSBs through its N-terminal region, promotes precise DSB rejoining, and increases cellular resistance to radiation-induced DNA damage in a G1 phase-specific manner. These results suggest that BRCA1, as a central player in genome integrity maintenance, ensures high fidelity repair of DSBs by not only promoting homologous recombination repair in G2/M phase but also facilitating fidelity of Ku80-dependent NHEJ repair, thus preventing deletional end-joining of chromosomal DSBs during G1."
https://openalex.org/W2153034884,"In Pichia pastoris, the peroxisomal targeting signal 2 (PTS2)-dependent peroxisomal matrix protein import pathway requires the receptor, Pex7, and its co-receptor Pex20. A conserved lysine (Lys(19)) near the N terminus of Pex20 is required for its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas a conserved cysteine (Cys(8)) is essential for its recycling. In this study, we found that Cys(8) is required for the DTT-sensitive mono- and diubiquitination of Pex20. We also show that the PTS2 cargo receptor, Pex7, is required for Pex20 polyubiquitination. Pex4, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme, is required for monoubiquitination of Pex20. However, it is also necessary for polyubiquitination of Pex20, making its behavior distinct from the ubiquitination described for other PTS receptors. Unlike the roles of specific RING peroxins in Pex5 ubiquitination, we found that all the RING peroxins (Pex2, Pex10, and Pex12) are required as E3 ubiquitin ligases for Pex20 mono- and polyubiquitination. A model for Pex20 ubiquitination is proposed based on these observations. This is the first description of the complete ubiquitination pathway of Pex20, which provides a better understanding of the recycling and degradation of this PTS2 cargo co-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2075176906,"It has been known for a long time that mitochondria isolated from hepatocytes treated with glucagon or Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents such as phenylephrine show an increase in their adenine nucleotide (AdN) content, respiratory activity, and calcium retention capacity (CRC). Here, we have studied the role of SCaMC-3/slc25a23, the mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier present in adult mouse liver, in the control of mitochondrial AdN levels and respiration in response to Ca(2+) signals as a candidate target of glucagon actions. With the use of SCaMC-3 knock-out (KO) mice, we have found that the carrier is responsible for the accumulation of AdNs in liver mitochondria in a strictly Ca(2+)-dependent way with an S0.5 for Ca(2+) activation of 3.3 ± 0.9 μm. Accumulation of matrix AdNs allows a SCaMC-3-dependent increase in CRC. In addition, SCaMC-3-dependent accumulation of AdNs is required to acquire a fully active state 3 respiration in AdN-depleted liver mitochondria, although further accumulation of AdNs is not followed by increases in respiration. Moreover, glucagon addition to isolated hepatocytes increases oligomycin-sensitive oxygen consumption and maximal respiratory rates in cells derived from wild type, but not SCaMC-3-KO mice and glucagon administration in vivo results in an increase in AdN content, state 3 respiration and CRC in liver mitochondria in wild type but not in SCaMC-3-KO mice. These results show that SCaMC-3 is required for the increase in oxidative phosphorylation observed in liver mitochondria in response to glucagon and Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents, possibly by allowing a Ca(2+)-dependent accumulation of mitochondrial AdNs and matrix Ca(2+), events permissive for other glucagon actions."
https://openalex.org/W2004293325,"The identification of novel combinations of effective cancer drugs is required for the successful treatment of cancer patients for a number of reasons. First, many “cancer specific” therapeutics display detrimental patient side-effects and second, there are almost no examples of single agent therapeutics that lead to cures. One strategy to decrease both the effective dose of individual drugs and the potential for therapeutic resistance is to combine drugs that regulate independent pathways that converge on cell death. BCL2-like family members are key proteins that regulate apoptosis. We conducted a screen to identify drugs that could be combined with an inhibitor of anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins, ABT-263, to kill human leukemia cells lines. We found that the combination of D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) hydrochloride, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, potently synergized with ABT-263 in the killing of multiple human leukemia cell lines. Treatment of cells with PDMP and ABT-263 led to dramatic elevation of two pro-apoptotic sphingolipids, namely ceramide and sphingosine. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor, SKi-II, also dramatically synergized with ABT-263 to kill leukemia cells and similarly increased ceramides and sphingosine. Data suggest that synergism with ABT-263 requires accumulation of ceramides and sphingosine, as AMP-deoxynojirimycin, (an inhibitor of the glycosphingolipid pathway) did not elevate ceramides or sphingosine and importantly did not sensitize cells to ABT-263 treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that combining inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL2-like proteins with drugs that alter the balance of bioactive sphingolipids will be a powerful combination for the treatment of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2081575691,"TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) is a membrane-bound proteolytic enzyme with a diverse set of target molecules. Most importantly, TACE is indispensable for the release and activation of pro-TNFα and the ligands for epidermal growth factor receptor in vivo. Previous studies suggested that the overproduction of TACE is causally related to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and cancers. To test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic line in which the transcription of exogenous Tace is driven by a CAG promoter. The Tace-transgenic mice were viable and exhibited no overt defects, and the quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that the transgenically introduced Tace gene was highly expressed in all of the tissues examined. The Tace-transgenic mice were further crossed with Tace−/+ mice to abrogate the endogenous TACE expression, and the Tace-transgenic mice lacking endogenous Tace gene were also viable without any apparent defects. Furthermore, there was no difference in the serum TNFα levels after lipopolysaccharide injection between the transgenic mice and control littermates. These observations indicate that TACE activity is not necessarily dependent on transcriptional regulation and that excess TACE does not necessarily result in aberrant proteolytic activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2109707657,"Scrub typhus is an important endemic disease of the Asia-Pacific region caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. To develop an effective vaccine to prevent scrub typhus infection, a better understanding of the initial host-pathogen interaction is needed. The objective of this study was to investigate early bacterial dissemination in a CD-1 Swiss outbred mouse model after intradermal injection of O. tsutsugamushi. Three human pathogenic strains of O. tsutsugamushi (Karp, Gilliam, and Woods) were chosen to investigate the early infection characteristics associated with bacterial virulence. Tissue biopsies of the intradermal injection site and draining lymph nodes were examined using histology and immunohistochemistry to characterize bacterial dissemination, and correlated with quantitative real-time PCR for O. tsutsugamushi in blood and tissue from major organs. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured to examine cellular activation in response to infection. No eschar formation was seen at the inoculation site and no clinical disease developed within the 7 day period of observation. However, O. tsutsugamushi was localized at the injection site and in the draining lymph nodes by day 7 post inoculation. Evidence of leukocyte and endothelial activation was present by day 7 with significantly raised levels of sL-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. Infection with the Karp strain was associated with earlier and higher bacterial loads and more extensive dissemination in various tissues than the less pathogenic Gilliam and Woods strains. The bacterial loads of O. tsutsugamushi were highest in the lungs and spleens of mice inoculated with Karp and Gilliam, but not Woods strains. Strains of higher virulence resulted in more rapid systemic infection and dissemination in this model. The CD-1 mouse intradermal inoculation model demonstrates features relevant to early scrub typhus infection in humans, including the development of regional lymphadenopathy, leukocyte activation and distant organ dissemination after low-dose intradermal injection with O. tsutsugamushi."
https://openalex.org/W2007093334,"The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. We previously reported that Ca2+/S100 proteins directly associate with the TPR proteins, such as Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), kinesin light chain, Tom70, FKBP52, CyP40, and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), leading to the dissociation of the interactions of the TPR proteins with their target proteins. Therefore, we have hypothesized that Ca2+/S100 proteins can interact with CHIP and regulate its function. GST pulldown assays indicated that Ca2+/S100A2 and S100P bind to the TPR domain and lead to interference with the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that Ca2+/S100A2 and S100P are efficient and specific inhibitors of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. Overexpression of S100A2 and S100P suppressed CHIP-chaperone complex-dependent mutant p53 ubiquitination and degradation in Hep3B cells. The association of the S100 proteins with CHIP provides a Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism for the ubiquitination and degradation of intracellular proteins by the CHIP-proteasome pathway.Background: CHIP is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that facilitates the proteasomal degradation of many client proteins.Results: Ca2+/S100 proteins directly interact with CHIP and suppress the ubiquitination and degradation of the client proteins.Conclusion: We have identified S100 proteins as novel Ca2+-dependent regulators of the CHIP-proteasome pathway.Significance: This is the first indication that S100 proteins form a link between Ca2+ signal transduction and the CHIP-proteasome pathway. The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. We previously reported that Ca2+/S100 proteins directly associate with the TPR proteins, such as Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), kinesin light chain, Tom70, FKBP52, CyP40, and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), leading to the dissociation of the interactions of the TPR proteins with their target proteins. Therefore, we have hypothesized that Ca2+/S100 proteins can interact with CHIP and regulate its function. GST pulldown assays indicated that Ca2+/S100A2 and S100P bind to the TPR domain and lead to interference with the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1.

https://openalex.org/W1974500103,"Mesenchymal progenitors or stromal cells have shown promise as a therapeutic strategy for a range of diseases including heart failure. In this context, we explored the growth and differentiation potential of mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) derived in vitro from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Similar to MPs isolated from bone marrow, hESC derived MPs (hESC-MPs) efficiently differentiated into archetypical mesenchymal derivatives such as chondrocytes and adipocytes. Upon treatment with 5-Azacytidine or TGF-β1, hESC-MPs modified their morphology and up-regulated expression of key cardiac transcription factors such as NKX2-5, MEF2C, HAND2 and MYOCD. Nevertheless, NKX2-5+ hESC-MP derivatives did not form contractile cardiomyocytes, raising questions concerning the suitability of these cells as a platform for cardiomyocyte replacement therapy. Gene profiling experiments revealed that, although hESC-MP derived cells expressed a suite of cardiac related genes, they lacked the complete repertoire of genes associated with bona fide cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that whilst agents such as TGF-β1 and 5-Azacytidine can induce expression of cardiac related genes, but treated cells retain a mesenchymal like phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2010417259,"BMP4 maintains self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in collaboration with LIF. Here, we report the identification of a novel key BMP target gene, cochlin (Coch) in mouse ESCs. Coch can be significantly up-regulated by BMP4 specifically in ESCs but not in somatic differentiated cells, and this up-regulation is dependent on the BMP signaling mediators Smad1/5 and Smad4. Overexpression of Coch can partially substitute BMP4 to promote self-renewal of mouse ESCs together with LIF, whereas knockdown of Coch impairs self-renewal marker gene expression even in the presence of both BMP4 and LIF. Further studies showed that COCH could mimic BMP4 in repressing neural differentiation of mouse ESCs upon LIF withdrawal and the inhibitory effect of BMP4 on neural differentiation is compromised by Coch knockdown. Taken together, our data suggest that COCH is a part of the downstream target network of BMP signaling and serves as another important effector to fine-tune mouse ESC fates.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) 3The abbreviations used are: ESCembryonic stem cellBMPbone morphogenic proteinBREBMP responsive elementChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationCochcochlinGFPgreen fluorescence proteinLIFleukemia inhibitory factorshRNAshort hairpin RNAAPalkaline phosphatase. are pluripotent stem cells that can indefinitely self-renew in vitro while at the same time possess the ability to differentiate into all the adult tissues, including germ cells (1Wobus A.M.

Because of two remarkable properties (self-renewal and differentiation), ESCs are valuable for a wide range of applications, such as an in vitro model to study early embryo development, and most importantly, as a promising cell source for transplantation in regenerative medicine (1Wobus A.M.

It has been recognized that mouse ESC fate determination is delicately regulated by multiple internal transcription factors and external signaling pathways. Internal core transcription factors, such as OCT4/POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2, can form an autoregulatory feedback circuit to maintain pluripotency of ESCs. These factors physically interact with each other and co-occupy the promoters of target genes to establish ESC-specific transcriptome (2Young R.A.

Among them, LIF signaling has long been established to support mouse ESC self-renewal on standard serum- and feeder-dependent culture conditions (16Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells is mediated via activation of STAT3.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). LIF transduces its signal through binding to a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of gp130 and the low-affinity LIF receptor and then activates STAT3 through phosphorylation (15Ying Q.L.

BMP4 is a TGF-β superfamily member, which plays multiple critical roles during embryogenesis as well as in tissue homeostasis by regulating a series of cellular processes including cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (17Massagué J.

BMPs transduce their signal through binding to the transmembrane type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes. The ligand-activated receptors then phosphorylate and activate R-Smads (Smad1, -5, and -8), leading to the formation of a complex consisting of R-Smad and Co-Smad (Smad4). Translocation of the Smad complex from cytoplasm to the nucleus enables direct transcriptional regulation of target gene expression (17Massagué J. Chen Y.G.

Considering the importance of BMP signaling in mouse ESC fate control, it is of great value to learn how BMP signaling exerts its functions. ID family proteins were first described as critical downstream targets of BMP4 to promote self-renewal by inhibiting neural differentiation (15Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. BMP induction of Id proteins suppresses differentiation and sustains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in collaboration with STAT3.Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Our previous work extended the repertoire of potential direct target genes of BMP signaling in mouse ESCs from a genome-wide perspective (23Fei T. Xia K. Li Z. Zhou B. Zhu S. Chen H. Zhang J. Chen Z.

Genome-wide mapping of SMAD target genes reveals the role of BMP signaling in embryonic stem cell fate determination.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and further identified another important direct target gene, Dusp9, which mediates BMP signaling to balance ERK activity (10Li Z. Fei T. Zhang J. Zhu G. Wang L. Lu D. Chi X. Teng Y. Hou N. Yang X. Zhang H. Han J.D. Chen Y.G.

In the present study, we report the identification of cochlin (coagulation factor C homolog) (Coch), as another important direct target gene of BMP signaling, which promotes mouse ESC self-renewal by inhibition of neural differentiation. Feeder-free E14 and R1 mouse ES cells were grown on gelatin-coated dishes and cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) supplemented with 15% Knockout Serum Replacement (KSR) (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 10−4 m nonessential amino acids, 10−4 m β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1,000 units/ml mouse LIF. To examine the effect of Coch on the self-renewal of mouse ESCs, R1 cells were cultured in N2B27 medium containing LIF or LIF plus BMP. For neural differentiation, R1 cells were cultured in N2B27 medium without any cytokines, as described previously (23Fei T. Xia K. Li Z. Zhou B. Zhu S. Chen H. Zhang J. Chen Z. Xiao H. Han J.D. Chen Y.G. Genome-wide mapping of SMAD target genes reveals the role of BMP signaling in embryonic stem cell fate determination.Genome Res. 2010; 20: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). NMuMG, NIH3T3, C2C12, and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). BMP4 was purchased from R&D. The antibodies used in this study are listed as follows: rabbit anti-Smad4 antibody was generated from human Smad4-linker (aa144–316)-His; Smad1 (sc-7965X) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-nestin antibody (MAB353) was purchased from Chemicon International. Mouse Coch (NC_000078) promoter constructs (−2609 bp ∼ +137 bp) were generated by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as a template and amplified fragments were cloned into the pGL3-basic reporter vector through MluI/BglII sites. A series of 5′ deletion constructs were generated using the longest Coch (−2609 bp ∼ +137 bp) fragment as the PCR template, and the PCR primers used are listed below: −2609 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTAGAACCAGCACCTTTCTG-3′ (sense); −2010 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GCTACGCGTGACTCCTCCACCCTCCTT-3′ (sense); −1774 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTGACCATGCTGCCTGAGTT-3′ (sense); −1360 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTGCTGACGCACACTTCAGC-3′ (sense); −640 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTCAACAAATGACCCATCAG-3′ (sense); −481 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTTCTCAGAACCGGGTGGCT-3′ (sense); −320 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTCACCACAGGCGACCTTCA-3′ (sense); −36 bp ∼ +137 bp construct: 5′-GTTACGCGTGGAGGTGCATAGGGTCTG-3′ (sense). All of the above constructs were generated using the same antisense primer: 5′-GACAGATCTAGGCGTGAACGAGGTTCG-3′ (antisense). The −320 bp ∼ −57 bp construct was generated from −320 bp ∼ +137 bp construct by digesting the template with MluI and BamHI enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using −320 bp ∼ −57 bp construct as a template. The wild-type GGCGCC sites were replaced by the mutated GaattC-mutation sequence (Fig. 2D). For overexpression of Coch, the coding sequence (CDS) of full-length mouse Coch with or without HA (hemagglutinin) tag (named COCH-1 and COCH-2, respectively) were cloned into pENTR1A backbone and then using LR clonase reactions (Invitrogen) to replace these CDS into the p2k7neo lentiviral vector under the control of EF1α promoter (24Kee K. Angeles V.T. Flores M. Nguyen H.N. Reijo Pera R.A. Human DAZL, DAZ, and BOULE genes modulate primordial germ-cell and haploid gamete formation.Nature. 2009; 462: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting mouse Coch mRNA (NM_007728) or the control firefly luciferase gene was cloned into the pll3.7 lentiviral vector, which was modified with GFP region replaced by puromycin gene. The sequences of the shRNAs targeting mouse Coch are listed below: shCoch-1: 5′-CAGGGTTAGAACCAATTGT-3′; shCoch-2: 5′-GCCGATTTAATTTGCAGAA-3′.

Lentivirus was produced by transfection of HEK293FT cells with lentiviral vectors, which contain the CDS or shRNA sequences of Coch using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 3 days, the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore). Virus-containing supernatants were added into plates of ES cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, equal volume of complete mouse ESC culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 15% KSR, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, β-mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 units/ml LIF) was added and further incubated overnight. Then the supernatants were discarded, and cells were washed three or four times with PBS. Then the cells can be cultured with the complete ESC medium. In this study, Geneticin (250 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and puromycin (1000 μg/ml) were added into culture medium for 3 to 5 days to select cells with stable viral integration. Cells were seeded in 48-well plate and transfected with the reporter constructs when they reach to 30–50% confluent. pRenilla-TK vector was transfected as an internal control. Transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. One day after transfection, 10 ng/ml BMP4 was added into the medium. Cells were lysed after BMP4 treatment for 24 h and then subjected to luciferase activity measurement. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and all the data are normalized to Renilla activity. The data were represented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Real-time PCR was performed as described previously (23Fei T. Xia K. Li Z. Zhou B. Zhu S. Chen H. Zhang J. Chen Z.

Briefly, the total RNA was isolated from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA synthesis was primed with oligo dT (Takara) by reverse transcriptase (Toyobo). Real-time PCR was carried out using EvaGreen dye (Biotium) on the Mx3000P system. All the primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (SCR004, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instruction.

Briefly, cells were firstly cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde solution for 15 min. Then the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, proteinase inhibitors) and sonicated to get DNA fragments ranging ∼300–500 bp on average. After centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and pre-absorbed by 50 μl of protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After incubation with 10 μg of antibodies (control IgG, anti-Smad1, and anti-Smad4) overnight at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were collected with 50 μl of protein A beads by 3 h co-incubation and then washed sequentially with salt buffers. The bound immunocomplexes were eluted with elution buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) by heating at 65 °C with occasional vortex for 15 min and crosslinking was reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. Immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were then purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation after treatment with RNase A and proteinase K. ChIP primers used in this study are listed in the supplemental Table S1. To identify direct downstream target genes of BMP signaling, we previously carried out Smad ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq combined with RNA expression microarray upon BMP4 stimulation in mouse ESCs (23Fei T.

We confirmed this up-regulation by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and a dramatic up-regulation was observed (Fig. 1A). BMP4 treatment steadily induced Coch mRNA expression in E14 mouse ESCs, and the induction reached more than 12-fold after 24 h (Fig. 1A). Similar up-regulation could also be observed in R1 mouse ESCs (Fig. 1B), indicating Coch is a bona fide BMP target gene in mouse ESCs. To examine the cell type specificity of Coch up-regulation by BMP4, we treated differentiated mouse somatic cells NMuMG, NIH3T3, and C2C12 cells with 10 ng/ml BMP4 for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, Coch did not exhibit any significant change while the classic BMP target gene, Id1, was consistently up-regulated in these cells. Thus, the up-regulation of Coch by BMP4 was specific to mouse ESCs. In addition, we also found that human COCH is up-regulated by BMP4 in H1 human ESCs (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the results from mouse cells, human COCH did not respond to BMP4 in differentiated human somatic cells (Hep3B and HepG2), where ID1 was up-regulated by BMP4 (Fig. 1D). These data collectively indicate that BMP4 can up-regulate Coch expression, specifically in ESCs. BMP/Smad signaling regulates its downstream target genes through Smad1/5/8 and Smad4 (22Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Smad transcription factors.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). To examine whether induction of Coch by BMP4 was dependent on Smad proteins, we knocked down Smad1 as well as Smad4 in wild-type and Smad5−/− TC-1 mouse ESCs. As is shown in Fig. 2A, either Smad1 or Smad4 knockdown attenuated the up-regulation of Coch by BMP4, and the most dramatic attenuation of Coch induction was observed in Smad5 knockout ESCs with Smad4 knockdown, indicating that Smad1, Smad5, and Smad4 are responsible for BMP induction of Coch. The residual induction of Coch after shSmad1 in Smad5 knockout cells might result from incomplete deletion of Smad1. These data indicate that the induction of Coch by BMP4 is dependent on Smad1/5 and Smad4. As Smad1 and Smad4 are transcription factors, they regulate the expression of downstream target genes by binding to specific DNA elements, such as CAGAC, GCCGnCGC, GGCGCC in gene promoters (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

To this end, we cloned putative mouse Coch promoter covering the −2609 base pair (bp) to +137 bp around the transcriptional start site (TSS) and inserted it into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid. Reporter assay showed that it responded to BMP4 stimulation by about 2-fold (Fig. 2B). Then, a series of deletion constructs were generated and tested for BMP4 responsiveness. As shown in Fig. 2B, the −1360 bp ∼ −36 bp region still retained the intact response to BMP. Further deletion within −1360 bp ∼ −36 bp region showed that two subregions (−481 bp ∼ −320 bp and −320 bp ∼ −57 bp) contained the minimal BREs for Coch up-regulation. The fragment of −320 bp ∼ −57 bp still retained partial response to BMP4 (Fig. 2, B and C). By scrutinizing the potential Smad binding elements within the −320 bp ∼ −57 bp region, we found two putative GC-rich BREs (BRE1 and BRE2), and mutation of key nucleotides within BRE1 but not in BRE2 totally abolished the transcription activation by BMP4 (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that BRE1 is necessary for Coch up-regulation by BMP4. Further analysis of −480 bp to −320 bp region by either the region alone or mutation analysis of putative BREs in that region using reporter assay excluded the possibility that there are other functional BREs in that region (data not shown). To examine whether Smad1/5 and Smad4 could physically bind to this region of Coch promoter upon BMP4 treatment, we conducted a ChIP assay using Smad1 and Smad4 antibodies. Five pairs of primers were designed to amplify the putative Smad binding region along the Coch promoter (supplemental Table S1). Only primer pair #4, whose amplicon covers the BRE1 region identified above, showed a binding signal for both Smad1 and Smad4 in response to BMP4 treatment (Fig. 3A). In addition, by comparing the putative Coch promoter region (3000 bp upstream o"

We have obtained experimental evidence that global knock-out of a small, single-span regulatory subunit of Na,K-ATPase, FXYD2, alters glucose control. Adult Fxyd2(-/-) mice showed significantly lower blood glucose levels, no signs of peripheral insulin resistance, and improved glucose tolerance compared with their littermate controls. Strikingly, there was a substantial hyperplasia in pancreatic beta cells from the Fxyd2(-/-) mice compared with the wild type littermates, compatible with an observed increase in the level of circulating insulin. No changes were seen in the exocrine compartment of the pancreas, and the mice had only a mild, well-adapted renal phenotype. Morphometric analysis revealed an increase in beta cell mass in KO compared with WT mice. This appears to explain a phenotype of hyperinsulinemia. By RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry we showed the FXYD2b splice variant in pancreatic beta cells from wild type mice. Phosphorylation of Akt kinase was significantly higher under basal conditions in freshly isolated islets from Fxyd2(-/-) mice compared with their WT littermates. Inducible expression of FXYD2 in INS 832/13 cells produced a reduction in the phosphorylation level of Akt, and phosphorylation was restored in parallel with degradation of FXYD2. Thus we suggest that in pancreatic beta cells FXYD2 plays a role in Akt signaling pathways associated with cell growth and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1979487944,"Missense mutations in the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene cause a wide spectrum of hypomyelinating disorders, from mild spastic paraplegia type 2 to severe Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Mutant PLP1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. However, the link between the clinical severity of PMD and the cellular response induced by mutant PLP1 remains largely unknown. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER generally leads to up-regulation of ER chaperones to alleviate ER stress. Here, we found that expression of the PLP1-A243V mutant, which causes severe disease, depletes some ER chaperones with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif, in HeLa cells, MO3.13 oligodendrocytic cells, and primary oligodendrocytes. The same PLP1 mutant also induces fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (GA). These organelle changes are less prominent in cells with milder disease-associated PLP1 mutants. Similar changes are also observed in cells expressing another disease-causing gene that triggers ER stress, as well as in cells treated with brefeldin A, which induces ER stress and GA fragmentation by inhibiting GA to ER trafficking. We also found that mutant PLP1 disturbs localization of the KDEL receptor, which transports the chaperones with the KDEL motif from the GA to the ER. These data show that PLP1 mutants inhibit GA to ER trafficking, which reduces the supply of ER chaperones and induces GA fragmentation. We propose that depletion of ER chaperones and GA fragmentation induced by mutant misfolded proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of inherited ER stress-related diseases and affect the disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2025102047,"This study investigated a theoretically challenging dissociation between good production and poor perception of tones among neurologically unimpaired native speakers of Cantonese. The dissociation is referred to as the near-merger phenomenon in sociolinguistic studies of sound change. In a passive oddball paradigm, lexical and nonlexical syllables of the T1/T6 and T4/T6 contrasts were presented to elicit the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a from two groups of participants, those who could produce and distinguish all tones in the language (Control) and those who could produce all tones but specifically failed to distinguish between T4 and T6 in perception (Dissociation). The presence of MMN to T1/T6 and null response to T4/T6 of lexical syllables in the dissociation group confirmed the near-merger phenomenon. The observation that the control participants exhibited a statistically reliable MMN to lexical syllables of T1/T6, weaker responses to nonlexical syllables of T1/T6 and lexical syllables of T4/T6, and finally null response to nonlexical syllables of T4/T6, suggests the involvement of top-down processing in speech perception. Furthermore, the stronger P3a response of the control group, compared with the dissociation group in the same experimental conditions, may be taken to indicate higher cognitive capability in attention switching, auditory attention or memory in the control participants. This cognitive difference, together with our speculation that constant top-down predictions without complete bottom-up analysis of acoustic signals in speech recognition may reduce one's sensitivity to small acoustic contrasts, account for the occurrence of dissociation in some individuals but not others."

Significance: Interplay of membrane association and formation of organized membrane-associated cellular structures could provide a mechanism to organize multiprotein systems within the bacterial cell. Bacterial RNA processing and degradation is an essential cellular function whose maintenance requires the coordinated action of a large number of ribonucleases and other proteins. Among these, RNase II, the 644-amino acid product of the Escherichia coli rnb gene, is a processive hydrolytic exoribonuclease that acts on the 3′ end of single-stranded RNA, leading to formation of 5′ mononucleotides and a short 5′ terminal oligonucleotide (1.Nossal N.G. Singer M.F. The processive degradation of individual polyribonucleotide chains. I. Escherichia coli ribonuclease II.J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 913-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, RNase II accounts for about 90% of the total exoribonucleolytic activity of cell extracts (2.Deutscher M.P. Reuven N.B. Enzymatic basis for hydrolytic versus phosphorolytic mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 3277-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The primary role of RNase II appears to be the degradation of mRNA (3.Donovan W.P. Kushner S.R. Polynucleotide phosphorylase and ribonuclease II are required for cell viability and mRNA turnover in Escherichia coli K-12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), although in the absence of other exoribonucleases, RNase II also functions in the processing of tRNA and other stable RNAs (4.Li Z. Pandit S. Deutscher M.P. 3′ exoribonucleolytic trimming is a common feature of the maturation of small, stable RNAs in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although the subcellular location of RNase II is not known, the protein is generally regarded as a soluble protein. Here we show that RNase II is a membrane-associated protein that binds the cytoplasmic membrane via an amino-terminal amphipathic α-helix. Fluorescence localization studies showed that RNase II is organized within the cell as membrane-associated ordered structures. Membrane binding of RNase II is required for assembly of the RNase II organized cellular structures, and membrane binding is also required for the self-interaction of RNase II in cell extracts. Assembly of the RNase II cellular structures is required for the normal growth of cells that lack the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, suggesting an important role of the RNase II higher order cellular organization for the normal function of the cell. The functional implications of the membrane association in the assembly of the organized cellular structures of RNase II and in the associated cell functions of the protein are discussed. E. coli strains were grown in LB medium (6.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Equal amounts of AT67 and AT368 cells grown to the same cell density were combined to obtain protein extract containing both chromosomally expressed RNase II-HA and RNase II-Yfp proteins. The cell pellets were washed twice with cold PBS buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) and then frozen at −70 ºC. Protein extracts were prepared as previously described (12.Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G. Ehretsmann C. Krisch H.M. Copurification of E. coli RNAase E and PNPase.

Under these conditions 60–65% of RNase II present in clarified cell lysates was recovered in the ammonium sulfate precipitates as shown by quantitative immunoblotting analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using protein A/G-agarose beads according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) and polyclonal anti-HA or anti-Gfp antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG (Sigma). Beads were first incubated overnight at 4 ºC in the presence of 1 mg of protein extract in 0.5 ml IP buffer and then washed 3 times with 0.5 ml of IP buffer using spin columns. Retained proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 5 min at room temperature in 50 μl of elution buffer containing primary amine, pH 2.5, (Pierce) and then collected by centrifugation in tubes containing 3 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.5, to neutralize the pH. Boiled samples were electrophoresed in 10% SDS mini-polyacrylamide gels and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane in a Tris-glycine transfer buffer for 70 min with constant voltage of 100 V. Western blots were done using anti-HA and anti-Gfp (which binds Yfp protein) combined primary antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (Sigma). When indicated, cell extracts were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with 5 μg/ml DNase-free bovine pancreatic RNase (Roche Diagnostics) before overnight incubation with the beads (13.Carpousis A.J. Khemici V. Aït-Bara S. Poljak L. Co-immunopurification of multiprotein complexes containing RNA-degrading enzymes.Methods Enzymol. 2008; 447: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Complete degradation of RNA was obtained within 15 min of incubation at room temperature in IP buffer when RNase activity was tested on protein extracts supplemented with 200 μg/ml of yeast RNA (Sigma). Cells were grown as described above for co-immunoprecipitation. Cells were broken in a French pressure cell, and membranes fractions were prepared by two-step sucrose gradient centrifugation as previously described (14.Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S.

The SG0 fraction containing the total cell membranes was washed once with 10 ml of cold HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA) and then resuspended in the same buffer. To quantitatively assess the RNase II membrane association, membrane and cytoplasm cellular fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation of cell extracts as previously described (15.Murashko O.N. Kaberdin V.R. Lin-Chao S. Membrane binding of Escherichia coli RNase E catalytic domain stabilizes protein structure and increases RNA substrate affinity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Isolated membranes and cytoplasm were brought to the initial volume of the total protein extract, and equal volumes from each fraction were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA and anti-Gfp primary antibodies. Band intensities were proportional to the amount of protein applied to the gels and were quantified by densitometry using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). To compare the expression levels of the Yfp-labeled RNase II derivatives, SDS total cell extracts were made using 1 ml of culture from cells that were grown as indicated above for fluorescence microscopy. Cell samples were taken at 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, and 8.5 h after the addition of IPTG. The frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 4% SDS and then boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of total protein extracts relative to the A600 of the cultures were then separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes. Band intensities were proportional to the amounts of protein applied to gels. Anti-Gfp primary antibody (which binds Yfp protein) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were used to detect the Yfp-labeled RNase II derivatives. Evidence that RNase II is organized within the cell and not uniformly distributed within the cytoplasm was shown by Yfp-labeling of plasmid-encoded RNase II and by tagging of the rnb chromosomal gene with FLAG or HA epitopes followed by fluorescence and immunofluorescence localization studies (Fig. 1, A–D). RNase II-Yfp, RNase II-HA, and RNase II-FLAG proteins are functional proteins, as shown by their ability to restore viability to Δpnp Δrnb cells that lack polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II (below). These studies showed that carboxyl-terminal-labeled RNase II-Yfp was localized within cellular structures that appeared to coil around the cell periphery, extending for considerable distances along the long axis of the cell (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence microscopy of cells expressing chromosomally encoded RNase II-FLAG or RNase II-HA using anti-FLAG or anti-HA primary antibodies, respectively, showed similar organized cellular structures (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, amino-terminal-labeled Yfp-RNase II showed a diffuse localization pattern presumably because Yfp obstructed binding of the protein to the membrane (see below) (Fig. 1D). The cellular localization pattern of RNase II was not an artifact of Yfp-labeling (17.Swulius M.T. Jensen G.J. The helical MreB cytoskeleton in Escherichia coli MC1000/pLE7 is an artifact of the N-terminal yellow fluorescent protein tag.J. bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6382-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or cell fixation as similar RNase II structures were observed both by fluorescence microscopy of live RNase II-Yfp cells and immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed cells that expressed RNase II-HA or RNase II-FLAG. The organized cellular structures were not due to RNase II overexpression because similar localization patterns were obtained with cells that expressed higher than normal levels of plasmid-encoded RNase II-Yfp and cells that expressed chromosomally encoded RNase II-HA or RNase II-FLAG under control of the native Prnb promoter (Figs. 1, A–C and 4F2). Taken together the data show that RNase II exists within the cell as organized structures that appear associated with the cell periphery. These RNase II cellular structures resemble previously described long range ordered structures of other E. coli proteins (11.Taghbalout A. Rothfield L.

We noted that the previously reported x-ray structure of RNase II shows an amino-terminal helical domain that extends at roughly right angles from the body of the protein (Fig. 1I). The amino-terminal helix (NTH) is not part of the adjacent oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-fold cold shock domain 1, and its function has not previously been elucidated (19.Frazão C.

A helical wheel projection of the amino acid sequence of the NTH revealed an amphipathic character of the helical surfaces, with hydrophobic residues clustered on one face and polar residues on the other face (Fig. 1J).

Evidence that RNase II is a membrane-associated protein and that the NTH domain is required for its membrane binding came from cell fractionation studies. The strain AT67/pFL4 co-expressed a chromosomally encoded RNase II-HA protein that showed an organized cellular pattern and a plasmid-encoded RNase IIΔ19-Yfp protein that lacked the NTH helix domain and showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution pattern (see below). The total membrane fraction isolated by sucrose gradient sedimentation (14.Ishidate K. Creeger E.S. Zrike J. Deb S. Glauner B. MacAlister T.J. Rothfield L.I. Isolation of differentiated membrane domains from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, including a fraction containing attachment sites between the inner and outer membranes and the murein skeleton of the cell envelope.J.

As shown in Fig. 1K1, the membrane fraction contained the full-length HA-tagged RNase II but not the derivative that lacked the amphipathic helix domain. This shows that RNase II is a membrane-associated protein and that determinants in the NTH domain are required for the binding of the protein to the membrane. To assess the RNase II membrane association, total membrane and cytoplasm fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation (15.Murashko O.N. Kaberdin V.R. Lin-Chao S.

As illustrated in Fig. 1K2, the membrane fraction contained ∼50% of the full-length HA-tagged RNase II but undetectable amounts of the derivative that lacked the amphipathic helix domain. Parallel analyses of membrane and cytoplasmic fractions using antibodies against the known membrane-associated proteins MinD and MreB, which bind the membrane through an amphipathic helix, also showed ∼50% of the proteins in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1K, 5 and 6). The presence of a portion of the protein in the cytoplasmic fraction may reflect partial dissociation of the peripheral membrane proteins during the process of cellular breakage and fractionation or dynamic membrane association of proteins within the cell. Evidence that the NTH domain RNase II(1–19) is able to act as a transplantable membrane anchor that can direct normally cytoplasmic proteins to the membrane was obtained from localization studies of the Yfp-labeled NTH domain (RNase II(1–19)-Yfp) and cell fractionation studies. Expression of the Yfp-labeled NTH domain in Δrnb cells that lack endogenous RNase II showed a peripheral localization pattern characteristic of membrane-associated proteins (Fig. 1E). As expected, expression of free Yfp resulted in diffuse localization of Yfp throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1F). Fractionation of cells that expressed RNase II(1–19)-Yfp showed a similar fractionation pattern as the full-length RNase II protein and the membrane associated proteins MinD and MreB; that is, 51% of RNase II(1–19) was recovered with the membrane fraction (Fig. 1K3). This demonstrates that the NTH domain of RNase II can impart membrane binding activity to the normally cytoplasmic Yfp prot"
https://openalex.org/W1986904006,"Nischarin is a protein known to inhibit breast cancer cell motility by regulating the signaling of the Rho GTPase family. However, little is known about its location and function in the nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regional and cellular expression and functions of Nischarin in the adult rodent brain. As assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunostaining, we found that Nischarin was widely distributed throughout the brain, with a higher expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Double-labeling showed that Nischarin was expressed in neurons and was mainly located in the perinuclear region and F-actin-rich protrusions. The expression pattern of Nischarin in the brain was thought to be closely associated with its function. This was verified by our findings from cell migration assays that Nischarin regulated neuronal migration. These results provide a preliminary survey of the distribution of Nischarin in different regions and cell types in the rat brain. This might help to elucidate its physiological roles, and to evaluate its potential clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W1968356845,"Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is a disease in human with an expansive phenotypic spectrum and diverse genetic mechanisms mainly associated with copy number variations (CNVs) on 22q11.2 or other chromosomes. However, the correlations between CNVs and phenotypes remain ambiguous. This study aims to analyze the types and sizes of CNVs in VCFS patients, to define whether correlations exist between CNVs and clinical manifestations in Chinese VCFS patients. In total, 55 clinically suspected Chinese VCFS patients and 100 normal controls were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The data from MLPA and all the detailed clinical features of the objects were documented and analyzed. A total of 44 patients (80.0%) were diagnosed with CNVs on 22q11.2. Among them, 43 (78.2%) presented with 22q11.2 heterozygous deletions, of whom 40 (93.0%) had typical 3-Mb deletion, and 3 (7.0%) exhibited proximal 1.5-Mb deletion; no patient was found with atypical deletion on 22q11.2. One patient (1.8%) presented with a 3-Mb duplication mapping to the typical 3-Mb region on 22q11.2, while none of the chromosomal abnormalities in the MLPA kit were found in the other 11 patients and 100 normal controls. All the 43 patients with 22q11.2 deletions displayed characteristic face and palatal anomalies; 37 of them (86.0%) had cognitive or behavioral disorders, and 23 (53.5%) suffered from immune deficiencies; 10 patients (23.3%) manifested congenital heart diseases. Interestingly, all patients with the characteristic face had 22q11.2 heterozygous deletions, but no difference in phenotypic spectrum was observed between 3-Mb and 1.5-Mb deletions. Our data suggest that the characteristic face can be used as a key indicator for direct diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletions in Chinese VCFS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2158989840,"The role of the mitochondrial protein frataxin in iron storage and detoxification, iron delivery to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, and aconitase repair has been extensively studied during the last decade. However, still no general consensus exists on the details of the mechanism of frataxin function and oligomerization. Here, using small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray crystallography, we describe the solution structure of the oligomers formed during the iron-dependent assembly of yeast (Yfh1) and Escherichia coli (CyaY) frataxin. At an iron-to-protein ratio of 2, the initially monomeric Yfh1 is converted to a trimeric form in solution. The trimer in turn serves as the assembly unit for higher order oligomers induced at higher iron-to-protein ratios. The x-ray crystallographic structure obtained from iron-soaked crystals demonstrates that iron binds at the trimer-trimer interaction sites, presumably contributing to oligomer stabilization. For the ferroxidation-deficient D79A/D82A variant of Yfh1, iron-dependent oligomerization may still take place, although >50% of the protein is found in the monomeric state at the highest iron-to-protein ratio used. This demonstrates that the ferroxidation reaction controls frataxin assembly and presumably the iron chaperone function of frataxin and its interactions with target proteins. For E. coli CyaY, the assembly unit of higher order oligomers is a tetramer, which could be an effect of the much shorter N-terminal region of this protein. The results show that understanding of the mechanistic features of frataxin function requires detailed knowledge of the interplay between the ferroxidation reaction, iron-induced oligomerization, and the structure of oligomers formed during assembly."

Seventeen participants completed both a temporal bisection task and a control task, in a mixed fMRI design. In keeping with previous research, there was increased activation in a network of regions typically active during time perception including the right supplementary motor area (SMA) and right pre-SMA and basal ganglia (including the putamen and right pallidum). Furthermore, correlations between neural activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and SMA and timing performance corroborate the results of a recent meta-analysis and are further evidence that the SMA forms part of a neural clock that is responsible for the accumulation of temporal information. Specifically, subjective lengthening of the perceived duration were associated with increased activation in both the right SMA (and right pre-SMA) and right inferior frontal gyrus."

Herein, we investigated the effect of GRN rs5848 on the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) by genotyping 573 Taiwanese patients with PD and 490 age-matched control subjects. Compared to subjects with CC genotype, those with TT genotype had a 1.58-fold increased risk of PD (95% CI: 1.77∼2.34, P = 0.021). PD patients demonstrate a higher frequency of T allele (37.2%) than controls (32.2%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04∼1.49, P = 0.017). This susceptibility was particularly observed in female subjects, in which TT genotype had a 2.16-fold increased risk of PD as compared with controls(95% CI: 1.24∼3.78, P = 0.006). The frequency of T allele (39.3%) in female PD patients was higher than in female control subjects (31.1%; OR = 1.43, CI: 1.11∼1.87, P = 0.007). No association was observed between GRN rs5848 and susceptibility in male subjects. These findings show that the GRN rs5848 TT genotype and T allele are risk factors for female Taiwanese patients with PD."
https://openalex.org/W1974015027,"Although the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) is well-characterized as a negative regulator of β-catenin, its effect on osteogenesis of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) is poorly understood. Here, we show that GSK3β positively regulates osteogenic differentiation of murine ADSCs. Gain-of-function studies showed that GSK3β promotes in vitro osteogenesis of ADSCs. Regulation of GSK3β activity in ADSCs, either by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated GSK3β silencing or by pharmacological inhibitors, blunted osteogenesis and the expression of osteogenic markers. Importantly, we demonstrated that transgenic mice, engineered to overexpress the constitutively active GSK3β (GSK3β-S9A) mutant, exhibited a marked increase in osteogenesis, whereas expression of the catalytically inactive GSK3β (GSK3β-K85A) in mice inhibits osteogenic differentiation. Molecular analyses showed that the enhanced osteoblast differentiation induced by GSK3β was mediated by downregulation of β-catenin. Remarkably, β-catenin silencing enhances osteogenesis and osteoblast marker gene expression such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osterix. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a novel role for GSK3β in the regulation of osteogenic differentiation in ADSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2009098634,"Endocytosis is a crucial process in all eukaryotic organisms including plants. We have previously shown that two Arabidopsis proteins, AtEHD1 and AtEHD2, are involved in endocytosis in plant systems. Knock-down of EHD1 was shown to have a delayed recycling phenotype in mammalians. There are many works in mammalian systems detailing the importance of the various domains in EHDs but, to date, the domains of plant EHD1 that are required for its activity have not been characterized. In this work we demonstrate that knock-down of EHD1 causes a delayed recycling phenotype and reduces Brefeldin A sensitivity in Arabidopsis seedlings. The EH domain of EHD1 was found to be crucial for the localization of EHD1 to endosomal structures. Mutant EHD1 lacking the EH domain did not localize to endosomal structures and showed a phenotype similar to that of EHD1 knock-down seedlings. Mutants lacking the coiled-coil domain, however, showed a phenotype similar to wild-type or EHD1 overexpression seedlings. Salinity stress is a major problem in current agriculture. Microarray data demonstrated that salinity stress enhances the expression of EHD1, and this was confirmed by semi quantitative RT-PCR. We demonstrate herein that transgenic plants over expressing EHD1 possess enhanced tolerance to salt stress, a property which also requires an intact EH domain."
https://openalex.org/W2033969274,"Using event-related fMRI in a sample of 42 healthy participants, we compared the cerebral activity maps obtained when classifying spoken sentences based on the mental content of the main character (belief, deception or empathy) or on the emotional tonality of the sentence (happiness, anger or sadness). To control for the effects of different syntactic constructions (such as embedded clauses in belief sentences), we subtracted from each map the BOLD activations obtained during plausibility judgments on structurally matching sentences, devoid of emotions or ToM. The obtained theory of mind (ToM) and emotional speech comprehension networks overlapped in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate cortex, right anterior temporal lobe, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and in the left inferior frontal sulcus. These regions form a ToM network, which contributes to the emotional component of spoken sentence comprehension. Compared with the ToM task, in which the sentences were enounced on a neutral tone, the emotional sentence classification task, in which the sentences were play-acted, was associated with a greater activity in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus, in line with the presence of emotional prosody. Besides, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was more active during emotional than ToM sentence processing. This region may link mental state representations with verbal and prosodic emotional cues. Compared with emotional sentence classification, ToM was associated with greater activity in the caudate nucleus, paracingulate cortex, and superior frontal and parietal regions, in line with behavioral data showing that ToM sentence comprehension was a more demanding task."
https://openalex.org/W1978610962,"The plasma membrane of mammalian cochlear outer hair cells contains prestin, a unique motor protein. Prestin is the fifth member of the solute carrier protein 26A family. Orthologs of prestin are also found in the ear of non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish and chicken. However, these orthologs are electrogenic anion exchangers/transporters with no motor function. Amphibian and reptilian lineages represent phylogenic branches in the evolution of tetrapods and subsequent amniotes. Comparison of the peptide sequences and functional properties of these prestin orthologs offer new insights into prestin evolution. With the recent availability of the lizard and frog genome sequences, we examined amino acid sequence and function of lizard and frog prestins to determine how they are functionally and structurally different from prestins of mammals and other non-mammals. Somatic motility, voltage-dependent nonlinear capacitance (NLC), the two hallmarks of prestin function, and transport capability were measured in transfected human embryonic kidney cells using voltage-clamp and radioisotope techniques. We demonstrated that while the transport capability of lizard and frog prestin was compatible to that of chicken prestin, the NLC of lizard prestin was more robust than that of chicken’s and was close to that of platypus. However, unlike platypus prestin which has acquired motor capability, lizard or frog prestin did not demonstrate motor capability. Lizard and frog prestins do not possess the same 11-amino-acid motif that is likely the structural adaptation for motor function in mammals. Thus, lizard and frog prestins appear to be functionally more advanced than that of chicken prestin, although motor capability is not yet acquired."
https://openalex.org/W2022452275,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of specialized cells can undergo dramatic changes in structural organization, including formation of concentric whorls. We previously reported that depletion of Yip1A, an integral membrane protein conserved between yeast and mammals, caused ER whorl formation reminiscent of that seen in specialized cells. Yip1A and its yeast homologue Yip1p cycle between the ER and early Golgi, have been implicated in a number of distinct trafficking steps, and interact with a conserved set of binding partners including Yif1p/Yif1A and the Ypt1/Ypt31 Rab GTPases. Here, we carried out a mutational analysis of Yip1A to obtain insight into how it regulates ER whorl formation. Most of the Yip1A cytoplasmic domain was dispensable, whereas the transmembrane (TM) domain, especially residues within predicted TM helices 3 and 4, were sensitive to mutagenesis. Comprehensive analysis revealed two discrete functionally required determinants. One was E95 and flanking residues L92 and L96 within the cytoplasmic domain; the other was K146 and nearby residue V152 within the TM domain. Notably, the identified determinants correspond closely to two sites previously found to be essential for yeast viability (E76 and K130 in Yip1p corresponding to E95 and K146 in Yip1A, respectively). In contrast, a third site (E89) also essential for yeast viability (E70 in Yip1p) was dispensable for regulation of whorl formation. Earlier work showed that E76 (E95) was dispensable for binding Yif1p or Ypt1p/Ypt31p, whereas E70 (E89) was required. Collectively, these findings suggest that the ability of Yip1A to bind its established binding partners may be uncoupled from its ability to control ER whorl formation. In support, Yif1A knockdown did not cause ER whorl formation. Thus Yip1A may use the sites identified herein to interact with a novel binding partner to regulate ER membrane organization."
https://openalex.org/W1994559236,"Most targeted anticancer drugs have been identified by screening at the molecular or cellular level in vitro. However, many compounds selected by such costly and time-consuming screening do not prove effective against tumors in vivo. The development of anticancer drugs would thus be facilitated by the availability of an in vivo screening system based on a multicellular organism. We have now established a transgenic line of the freshwater fish medaka in which melanophores (melanocytes) proliferate in a manner dependent on heat shock–induced signaling by a human RAS oncoprotein. The human HRASG12V oncogene was expressed under the control of a melanophore-specific gene promoter in order to allow visualization of tumor growth in live fish maintained in a water tank. The expression of HRASG12V was induced as a result of Cre-mediated recombination by exposure of the fish to a temperature of 37°C for 30 min, given that the Cre gene was placed under the control of a medaka heat shock promoter. One of the stable transgenic lines developed abnormal pigment cell proliferation in the eyes and epidermis with 100% penetrance by 6 months postfertilization. Sorafenib, an inhibitor of RAS signaling, was administered to the transgenic fish and was found both to reduce the extent of melanophore proliferation and to improve survival. The transgenic medaka established here thus represents a promising in vivo system with which to screen potential anticancer drugs that target RAS signaling, and this system can readily be adapted for the screening of agents that target other oncogenes."

In mammals, ZFP36 proteins are encoded by four genes and, although they show similar activities in a cellular RNA destabilization assay, there is still a limited knowledge of their mRNA targets and it is not known whether or not they have redundant functions. In the present work, we have used the Xenopus embryo, a model system allowing gain- and loss-of-function studies, to investigate, whether individual ZFP36 proteins had distinct or redundant functions. We show that overexpression of individual amphibian zfp36 proteins leads to embryos having the same defects, with alteration in somites segmentation and pronephros formation. In these embryos, members of the Notch signalling pathway such as hairy2a or esr5 mRNA are down-regulated, suggesting common targets for the different proteins. We also show that mouse Zfp36 protein overexpression gives the same phenotype, indicating an evolutionary conserved property among ZFP36 vertebrate proteins. Morpholino oligonucleotide-induced loss-of-function leads to defects in pronephros formation, reduction in tubule size and duct coiling alterations for both zfp36 and zfp36l1, indicating no functional redundancy between these two genes. Given the conservation in gene structure and function between the amphibian and mammalian proteins and the conserved mechanisms for pronephros development, our study highlights a potential and hitherto unreported role of ZFP36 gene in kidney morphogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2163858764,"We present solution-state NMR structures for two putative venom peptides from Sicarius dolichocephalus. These peptides were identified from cDNA libraries created from venom gland mRNA and then recombinantly expressed. They are the first structures from any species of Sicarius spiders, and the first peptide structures for any haplogyne spiders. These peptides are homologous to one another, and while they have at most only 20% sequence identity with known venom peptides their structures follow the inhibitor cystine knot motif that has been found in a broad range of venom peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1972240116,"Previous studies have shown that the locus control region (LCR) and the promoter of the growth hormone (GH) gene can control the expression of GH. Therefore, lenti- and retro-viral vectors with these elements might be useful to monitor the activation of the GH gene and the development of newborn somatotrophs. To test this, we first constructed a lentiviral vector, which expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of these elements, and injected them into rat pituitaries in situ and in vivo. The lentiviral vector expressed GFP specifically in the anterior lobe, and nearly all GFP-positive cells were anti-GH immunoreactive. The GFP expression was upregulated by the administration of growth hormone releasing hormone and an IGF-1 receptor blocker. Furthermore, the social isolation stress, which was shown to decrease the GH secretion, decreased the GFP expression. Second, we injected the retroviral vector into neonatal rat pituitaries in vivo. At 30 days postinjection (DPI), almost all GFP-positive cells were anti-GH positive and anti-prolactin negative as the lentiviral expression. However, GFP was transiently expressed by developing lactotrophs at 8 and 16 DPI, suggesting that our vector lacks an element(s) which suppresses the expression. Meanwhile, the retrovirally labeled cells tended to cluster with the cells of same type. An analysis of cell numbers in each cluster revealed some features of cell proliferation. These viral vectors are shown to be useful tools to monitor the activation of the GH gene and the development of somatotrophs."
https://openalex.org/W2093978496,"When tested for their behavioural performance, the mixed genetic background of transgenic mice is a critical, but often ignored, issue. Such issues can arise because of the significant differences in defined behavioural parameters between embryonic stem cell donor and recipient strains. In this context, the commonly used stem cell donor strain ‘129’ shows ‘deficits’ in different paradigms for learning and long-term memory. We investigated the long-term social recognition memory performance and the investigative behaviour in commercially available 129S1/SvImJ and C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice and two F1-hybrids (129S1/SvImJ×C57BL/6JOlaHsd) by using the social discrimination procedure and its modification, the volatile fraction cage (VFC). Our data revealed an unimpaired olfactory long-term recognition memory not only in female and male 129S1/SvImJ and C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice but also in the two hybrid lines (129S1/SvImJxC57BL/6JOlaHsd) when the full ‘olfactory signature’ of the ‘to-be-recognized’ conspecific was presented. Under these conditions we also failed to detect differences in the long-term recognition memory between male and female mice of the tested strains and revealed that the oestrus cycle did not affect the performance in this memory task. The performance in the VFC, based only on the volatile components of the ‘olfactory signature’ of the ‘to-be-recognized’ conspecific, was similar to that observed under direct exposure except that females of one F1 hybrid group failed to show an intact long-term memory. Thus, the social discrimination procedure allowing direct access between the experimental subject and the stimulus animal(s) is highly suitable to investigate the impact of genetic manipulations on long-term memory in male and female mice of the strain 129S1/SvImJ, C57BL/6JOlaHsd and 129S1/SvImJxC57BL/6JOlaHsd hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2074394228,"Gliding motility is critical for normal development of spore-filled fruiting bodies in the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Mutations in mgl block motility and development but one mgl allele can be suppressed by a mutation in masK, the last gene in an operon adjacent to the mgl operon. Deletion of the entire 5.5 kb masABK operon crippled gliding and fruiting body development and decreased sporulation. Expression of pilAGHI, which encodes type IV pili (TFP) components essential for social (S) gliding, several cryptic pil genes, and a LuxR family protein were reduced significantly in the Δmas mutant while expression of the myxalamide operon was increased significantly. Localization and two-hybrid analysis suggest that the three Mas proteins form a membrane complex. MasA-PhoA fusions confirmed that MasA is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with a ≈100 amino acid periplasmic domain. Results from yeast two-hybrid assays showed that MasA interacts with the lipoprotein MasB and MasK, a protein kinase and that MasB and MasK interact with one another. Additionally, yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed a physical interaction between two gene products of the mas operon, MasA and MasB, and PilA. Deletion of mas may be accompanied by compensatory mutations since complementation of the Δmas social gliding and developmental defects required addition of both pilA and masABK."
