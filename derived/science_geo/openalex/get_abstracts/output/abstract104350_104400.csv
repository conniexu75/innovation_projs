https://openalex.org/W2073126970,"Rapid photoinduced electron transfer is demonstrated over a distance of greater than 40 angstroms between metallointercalators that are tethered to the 5' termini of a 15-base pair DNA duplex. An oligomeric assembly was synthesized in which the donor is Ru(phen)2dppz2+ (phen, phenanthroline, and dppz, dipyridophenazine) and the acceptor is Rh(phi)2phen3+ (phi, phenanthrenequinone diimine). These metal complexes are intercalated either one or two base steps in from the helix termini. Although the ruthenium-modified oligonucleotide hybridized to an unmodified complement luminesces intensely, the ruthenium-modified oligomer hybridized to the rhodium-modified oligomer shows no detectable luminescence. Time-resolved studies point to a lower limit of 10(9) per second for the quenching rate. No quenching was observed upon metallation of two complementary octamers by Ru(phen)3(2+) and Rh(phen)3(3+) under conditions where the phen complexes do not intercalate. The stacked aromatic heterocycles of the DNA duplex therefore serve as an efficient medium for coupling electron donors and acceptors over very long distances."
https://openalex.org/W2008044453,"UBIQUITINATION of proteins involves the concerted action of the El ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin–protein 1igases1–3. It has been proposed that E3s function as 'docking proteins', specifically binding substrate proteins and specific E2s, and that ubiquitin is then transferred directly from E2s to substrates1–5. We show here that formation of a ubiquitin thioester on E6–AP, an E3 involved in the human papillomavirus E6-induced ubiquitination of p53 (refs 6–10), is an intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination. The order of ubiquitin transfer is from El to E2, from E2 to E6-AP, and finally from E6-AP to a substrate. This cascade of ubiquitin thioester complexes suggests that E3s have a defined enzymatic activity and do not function simply as docking proteins. The cysteine residue of E6-AP responsible for ubiquitin thioester formation was mapped to a region that is highly conserved among several proteins of unknown function, suggesting that these proteins share the ability to form thioesters with ubiquitin."
https://openalex.org/W2006572311,"HIV integrase is the enzyme responsible for inserting the viral DNA into the host chromosome; it is essential for HIV replication. The crystal structure of the catalytically active core domain (residues 50 to 212) of HIV-1 integrase was determined at 2.5 A resolution. The central feature of the structure is a five-stranded beta sheet flanked by helical regions. The overall topology reveals that this domain of integrase belongs to a superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases that includes ribonuclease H and the Holliday junction resolvase RuvC. The active site region is identified by the position of two of the conserved carboxylate residues essential for catalysis, which are located at similar positions in ribonuclease H. In the crystal, two molecules form a dimer with a extensive solvent-inaccessible interface of 1300 A2 per monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2090699693,"Upon entry into a host cell, retroviruses direct the reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome and the establishment of an integrated proviral DNA. The retroviral integrase protein (IN) is responsible for the insertion of the viral DNA into host chromosomal targets. The two-hybrid system was used to identify a human gene product that binds tightly to the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in vitro and stimulates its DNA-joining activity. The sequence of the gene suggests that the protein is a human homolog of yeast SNF5, a transcriptional activator required for high-level expression of many genes. The gene, termed INI1 (for integrase interactor 1), may encode a nuclear factor that promotes integration and targets incoming viral DNA to active genes."

https://openalex.org/W1528593330,"The crystal structure of manganese peroxidase (MnP) from the lignin-degrading basidiomycetous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been solved using molecular replacement techniques and refined to R = 0.20 at 2.0 A. The overall structure is similar to that of two other fungal peroxidases, lignin peroxidase from P. chrysosporium and Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase. Like the other fungal peroxidases, MnP has two structural calcium ions. MnP also has two N-acetylglucosamine residues N-linked to Asn131 that are readily visible in the electron density map. The active site, consisting of a proximal His ligand H-bonded to an Asp residue and a distal side peroxide binding pocket consisting of a catalytic His and Arg, is the same as in the aforementioned fungal peroxidases as well as yeast cytochrome c peroxidase. MnP differs in having five rather than four disulfide bonds. The additional disulfide bond, Cys341-Cys348, is located near the C terminus of the polypeptide chain. Importantly, a new cation binding site, which we propose is the manganese-binding site of MnP, was located in the crystal structure. The ligands constituting the Mn(2+)-binding site include Asp179, Glu35, Glu39, a heme propionate, and two water molecules. Electron transfer from Mn2+ to the heme edge or iron center is envisioned to occur through a sigma-bonded pathway along a heme propionate."
https://openalex.org/W1742295292,"The translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, PKC-epsilon, and PKC-zeta from soluble to particulate fractions was studied in ventricular cardiomyocytes cultured from neonatal rats. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) caused a rapid ETA receptor-mediated translocation of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon (complete in 0.5-1 min). By 3-5 min, both isoforms were returning to the soluble fraction, but a greater proportion of PKC-epsilon remained associated with the particulate fraction. The EC50 of translocation for PKC-delta was 11-15 nM ET-1 whereas that for PKC-epsilon was 1.4-1.7 nM. Phenylephrine caused a rapid translocation of PKC-epsilon (EC50 = 0.9 microM) but the proportion lost from the soluble fraction was less than with ET-1. Translocation of PKC-delta was barely detectable with phenylephrine. Neither agonist caused any consistent translocation of PKC-alpha or PKC-zeta. Activation of p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by ET-1 or phenylephrine followed more slowly (complete in 3-5 min). Phosphorylation of p42-MAPK occurred simultaneously with its activation. The proportion of the total p42-MAPK pool phosphorylated in response to ET-1 (50%) was greater than with phenylephrine (20%). In addition to activation of MAPK, an unidentified p85 protein kinase was activated by ET-1 in the soluble fraction whereas an unidentified p58 protein kinase was activated in the particulate fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1974717031,"Pattern formation in Drosophila depends initially on the translational activation of maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) whose protein products determine cell fate. Three mRNAs that dictate anterior, dorsoventral, and terminal specification--bicoid, Toll, and torso, respectively--showed increases in polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail length concomitant with translation. In contrast, posteriorly localized nanos mRNA, although also translationally activated, was not regulated by poly(A) status. These results implicate at least two mechanisms of mRNA activation in flies. Studies with bicoid mRNA showed that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is necessary for translation, establishing this pathway as essential for embryogenesis. Combined, these experiments identify a regulatory pathway that can coordinate initiation of maternal pattern formation systems in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2016355476,"The chloroplast outer envelope protein OEP86 functions as a receptor in precursor protein translocation into chloroplasts. Sequence analysis suggests that the precursor of OEP86 is directed to the chloroplast outer envelope by a cleavable, negatively charged, and unusually long amino-terminal peptide. This presequence is unlike other potential targeting signals and suggests the existence of another membrane insertion pathway. Insertion of precursor OEP86 required the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate and the existence of surface exposed chloroplast membrane components, and it was not competed by another precursor protein destined for the internal plastid compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1623683757,"The widely expressed cellular Crk protein has the domain structure SH2-SH3-SH3. We have previously demonstrated that the more N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk (CrkSH3(N)) specifically binds several cytoplasmic proteins. A cDNA encoding one of these proteins was isolated and found to have two different splice forms. The sequence is virtually identical to C3G, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. The center region of the 145-155-kDa protein contains four similar proline-rich sequences which are capable of binding individually to the SH3(N) domains of c-Crk and v-Crk. Comparison of these sequences in C3G to proline-rich sequences in other Crk-binding proteins suggests that positively charged amino acids following the prolines play an important role in the binding to the CrkSH3(N) domain. The endogenous C3G could be coprecipitated with Crk from cell lysates of cells expressing high levels of c-Crk or v-Crk, suggesting high binding affinity and a possible interaction in vivo. Unlike many other SH3-binding proteins which interact with multiple SH3 domains, C3G from cell lysates binds preferentially to the CrkSH3(N) domain. This unique binding specificity supports the idea that C3G plays an important role in Crk signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2067352923,"Hemolysin of Escherichia coli is activated by fatty acylation of the protoxin, directed by the putative acyl transferase HlyC and by acyl carrier protein (ACP). Mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of proteolytic products from mature toxin activated in vitro with tritium-labeled acylACP revealed two fatty-acylated internal lysine residues, lysine 564 and lysine 690. Resistance of the acylation to chemical treatments suggested that fatty acid was amide linked. Substitution of the two lysines confirmed that they were the only sites of acylation and showed that although each was acylated in the absence of the other, both sites were required for in vivo toxin activity."

https://openalex.org/W2089595455,"A synthetic combinatorial library containing 52,128,400 D-amino acid hexapeptides was used to identify a ligand for the mu opioid receptor. The peptide, Ac-rfwink-NH2, bears no resemblance to any known opioid peptide. Simulations using molecular dynamics, however, showed that three amino acid moieties have the same spatial orientation as the corresponding pharmacophoric groups of the opioid peptide PLO17. Ac-rfwink-NH2 was shown to be a potent agonist at the mu receptor and induced long-lasting analgesia in mice. Analgesia produced by intraperitoneally administered Ac-rfwink-NH2 was blocked by intracerebroventricular administration of naloxone, demonstrating that this peptide may cross the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2040621359,"GAL4-VP16-mediated nucleosome reconfiguration and transcriptional activation were observed with preassembled chromatin templates that contained regular and physiological nucleosome spacing. Both processes were dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), although binding of GAL4-VP16 to the chromatin was ATP-independent. Factor-mediated nucleosome reconfiguration was not, however, sufficient for transcriptional activation. These experiments recreate in vitro the active participation of nucleosomal cores in the regulation of transcription that occurs in vivo, and they suggest a multistep pathway for transcriptional activation in which factor- and ATP-dependent nucleosome reconfiguration is followed by facilitation by the DNA-bound activator of transcription from the repressed chromatin template."
https://openalex.org/W1486013008,"We have biochemically purified A beta from brains of two unrelated familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees with the APP717 mutation (Val-->Ile) and from two sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains and characterized them by means of mass spectrometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We observed two types of amyloid beta protein (A beta), the short-tail form (A beta 1-40) and the long-tail form (A beta 1-42/43), in sporadic AD and FAD brains, and found that the ratio of the long-tail form of A beta (A beta 1-42/43) to total A beta was increased in FAD brains. These in vivo results were confirmed in vitro using cultured cells transfected with three kinds of APP cDNAs bearing the APP717 mutations (Val-->Ile, Gly, or Phe). Taken together with the hypothesis that A beta 1-42/43 functions as a seed that increases the kinetics of amyloid fibril formation (Jarrett, J. T., and Lansbury, P. T., Jr. (1993) Cell 73, 1055-1058), we conclude that the APP717 missense mutation does not create new A beta species but promotes the increased accumulation of A beta 1-42/43 in the brain, which results in the enhancement of amyloid fibril formation from soluble A beta. These findings provide a causal relationship between this FAD genotype and the pathological phenotype of A beta deposition and senile plaque formation."
https://openalex.org/W2026015266,"RNA polymerase I and II transcription factors SL1 and TFIID, respectively, are composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a set of TBP-associated factors (TAFs) responsible for promoter recognition. How the universal transcription factor TBP becomes committed to a TFIID or SL1 complex has not been known. Complementary DNAs encoding each of the three TAFIs that are integral components of SL1 have not been isolated. Analysis of subunit interactions indicated that the three TAFIs can bind individually and specifically to TBP. In addition, these TAFIs interact with each other to form a stable TBP-TAF complex. When TBP was bound first by either TAFI110, 63, or 48, subunits of TFIID such as TAFII250 and 150 did not bind TBP. Conversely, if TBP first formed a complex with TAFII250 or 150, the subunits of SL1 did not bind TBP. These results suggest that a mutually exclusive binding specificity for TBP intrinsic to SL1 and TFIID subunits directs the formation of promoter- and RNA polymerase-selective TBP-TAF complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1974177207,"Initiation of ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I requires the promoter selectivity factor SL1, which consists of the TATA-binding protein, TBP, and three associated factors, TAFIS 110, 63, and 48. Here the in vivo and in vitro assembly of functional SL1 complexes from recombinant TAFIS and TBP are reported. Complexes containing TBP and all three TAFIS were as active in supporting transcription from the human ribosomal RNA gene promoter as endogenous SL1, whereas partial complexes without TBP did not efficiently direct transcription in vitro. These results suggest that TAFIS 110, 63, and 48, together with TBP, are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute a transcriptionally active SL1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1553804650,"Escherichia coli strain SM101 harbors a temperature-sensitive allele (lpxA2) of the gene encoding UDP-Glc-NAc acyltransferase (the first enzyme of the lipid A pathway). SM101 is temperature-sensitive for lipid A biosynthesis and growth. To determine whether or not E. coli mutants lacking lipid A can be isolated, we examined temperature-resistant revertants of SM101. All regained the ability to synthesize lipid A. However, some were not true revertants but had acquired mutations in a neighboring gene (orf17), while retaining the original lpxA2 lesion. Cell extracts of such revertants displayed 2-5 fold reductions in the specific activity of (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase. Wild-type cells that overproduced the protein encoded by orf17 overproduced (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydrase activity as much as 170-fold, suggesting that orf17 is the structural gene for the dehydrase. The proposed function of orf17 is further supported by its sequence similarity to fabA, the structural gene for (3R)-hydroxydecanoyl dehydrase of E. coli. We suggest that bypass of the lpxA2 phenotype by mutations in orf17 may be due to an increased (3R)-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP pool. The orf17 gene (which we now designate fabZ) is not regulated by fadR. However, orf17 may be related to sefA, a suppressor of certain lesions in the cell division/lipid A biosynthesis gene, envA."
https://openalex.org/W2159278814,"Cucumisin is a thermostable alkaline serine protease that is found in the juice of melon fruits (Cucumis melo L.). We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a cucumisin cDNA (2,552 nucleotides) and deduced the corresponding amino acid sequence. The open reading frame of the cDNA consists of 731 codons and encodes a large precursor (molecular weight, 78,815) relative to the observed size of mature native cucumisin (67 kDa). Sequence comparisons reveal that cucumisin has several features in common with the microbial proteases of the subtilisin family. The highly conserved sequences to the proximal regions of the catalytic triad amino acids Asp, His, and Ser, together with the substrate binding site in subtilisin, can be found within the deduced amino acid sequence of the protease domain of the cucumisin precursor. Cucumisin is the first known plant protease with such characteristics. Examination of the primary structure of cucumisin revealed that it is synthesized as a precursor, consisting of four functional domains: a possible signal peptide (22 amino acid residues), an NH2-terminal pro-sequence (88 residues), a 54-kDa protease domain (505 residues), which is the active enzyme domain of the 67-kDa native cucumisin, and a 14-kDa COOH-terminal polypeptide (116 residues), which arises by limited autolysis of the 67-kDa native cucumisin. This structure of cucumisin suggests that it is probably synthesized as an inactive precursor."

https://openalex.org/W1557959115,"Incorporation of the gamma 2 subunit into gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors is required for the expression of benzodiazepine pharmacology, but the regions of the subunit responsible for benzodiazepine actions have not been defined. Using mutagenesis, we identified a single amino acid of the gamma 2 subunit of the human GABAA receptor that profoundly alters the nature of this pharmacology. When threonine 142 was mutated to serine, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, and the weak inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, both acted as potent partial agonists. Further, potentiation of GABA responses by diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, or flunitrazepam doubled in receptors containing the Ser-142 gamma 2 subunit. In contrast, responses to the Type I benzodiazepine receptor selective ligands, zolpidem, alpidem, and CL218,872, were roughly halved. This change in pharmacology appears to occur at a stage following ligand binding, i.e. the mutation affects benzodiazepine efficacy. There was no effect on GABA affinity or efficacy or pentobarbital, Ro 5-4864, or alphaxalone modulation of GABA responses. These findings demonstrate that very minor changes in receptor structure can profoundly affect the efficacy of receptor ligands. Thus, agonism is determined not only by the structure of the drug, but also by the structure of the receptor, or protein complex, with which it interacts."
https://openalex.org/W1592146973,"The biological activity of all-trans retinol, in human keratinocytes, was investigated through metabolic and functional analyses that assessed the capacity for retinol uptake and metabolism and the mechanism of retinol-induced activation of gene transcription. Human keratinocytes converted all-trans retinol predominantly to retinyl esters, which accounted for 60 and 90% of cell-associated radiolabel after a 90-min pulse and a 48-h chase, respectively. Human keratinocytes also metabolized all-trans retinol to low levels of all-trans retinoic acid (11.47-131.3 ng/mg of protein) in a dose-dependent manner, between 0.3 and 10 microM added retinol. Small amounts of 13-cis retinoic acid (5.47-8.62 ng/mg of protein) were detected, but 9-cis retinoic acid was detected only when keratinocytes were incubated with radiolabeled retinol. There was no accumulation of the oxidized catabolic metabolites 4-hydroxy- or 4-oxoretinoic acid; however, 5,6-epoxy retinoic acid was detected at pharmacological levels (10 and 30 microM) of added retinol. Biological activity of retinol was assessed through analysis of two known retinoic acid-mediated responses: 1) reduction of type I epidermal transglutaminase and 2) activation of a retinoic acid receptor-dependent reporter gene, beta RARE3-tk-CAT. Both all-trans retinol and all-trans retinoic acid reduced type I epidermal transglutaminase in a dose-dependent manner; however, the ED50 for all-trans retinol (10 nM) was 10 times greater than for all-trans retinoic acid (1 nM). All-trans retinol also stimulated beta RARE3-tk-CAT reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner. Half-maximal induction was observed at 30 nM retinol, which was again 10-fold greater than observed with all-trans retinoic acid. Cotransfection of human keratinocytes with expression vectors for dominant negative mutant retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors reduced retinol-induced beta RARE3-tk-CAT reporter gene activation by 80%. Inhibition of conversion of all-trans retinol or all-trans retinaldehyde to all-trans retinoic acid by citral reduced beta RARE3-tk-CAT activity 98 and 86%, respectively. These data demonstrate that retinol-induced responses in human keratinocytes are mediated by its tightly regulated conversion to retinoic acid, which functions as a ligand to activate nuclear retinoic acid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1565340691,"Vascular permeability factor, or vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) is an important factor in the regulation of vascular growth and vascular permeability. VPF is a secreted, dimeric protein and has 8 cysteine residues conserved with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). To study the role of some of these cysteine residues in maintaining the structure and function of VPF, we replaced the codons for the second, third, fourth, and fifth cysteine by serine codons, and expressed the mutant proteins in a mammalian expression system. Cysteine residues 2 and 4 in VPF were found to be directly involved in anti-parallel interchain disulfide bonds, as in PDGF. VPF mutants lacking one of these cysteins were severely impaired in their S-linked dimerization, while upon coexpression of both mutants the ability to form dimers was restored. The VPF mutants lacking cysteine residue 2 or 4 also competed poorly for receptor binding of labeled VPF and had low biological activity, but these defects were also complemented by coexpressing the two mutants, indicating that for efficient receptor binding and activation VPF needs to be a covalent dimer, unlike PDGF-BB. Furthermore, cysteine residue 5 was found to be essential for VPF dimerization and activity, while the mutant lacking cysteine residue 3 was only mildly affected in its ability to dimerize and had partial biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W1521569676,"VILIP and NCS-1, neural-specific, 22-kDa Ca(2+)-binding proteins possessing four EF-hands, were expressed in Escherichia coli to study their divalent cation properties. Flow dialysis (Ca2+ binding) and equilibrium gel filtration (Mg2+ binding) revealed that both recombinant proteins possess only two active metal-binding sites, which can accommodate either Ca2+ or Mg2+. VILIP binds cations without cooperativity with intrinsic affinity constants K'Ca of 1.0 × 10(6) M-1 and K'Mg of 4.8 × 10(3) M-1.Mg2+ antagonizes Ca2+ binding by shifting the isotherms to higher free Ca2+ concentrations without changing their shape. The competition equation yields a K'Mg, comp value of 180 M-1 for both sites. NCS-1 binds two Mg2+ without cooperativity with K'Mg of 8.3 × 10(4) M-1 and two Ca2+ with very strong positive cooperativity (nH = 1.96). In the absence of Mg2+ the K'Ca1 and K'Ca2 values are 8.9 × 10(4) and 1.4 × 10(8) M-1, respectively, which represent an allosteric increase of 1600-fold. Mg2+ shifts the Ca(2+)-binding isotherms to higher Ca2+ concentrations, yielding a K'Mg, comp value of 800 M-1 for both sites. Thus VILIP and NCS-1 show three remarkable differences in the Ca2+/Mg2+ binding parameters: 1) VILIP binds Ca2+ with much lower affinity than NCS-1; 2) VILIP binds Ca2+ in a noncooperative way, whereas NCS-1 shows maximal positive cooperativity; 3) in VILIP the Mg2+/Ca2+ antagonism is much weaker than in NCS-1. Conformational changes monitored by Trp fluorescence indicate that the metal-free forms already are highly structured. Ca2+ binding promotes a 20-30% increase of fluorescence in both proteins, but whereas the Mg2+ form of VILIP has the same fluorescence properties as the metal-free form, Mg(2+)-saturated NCS-1 has those of the Ca2+ form. Near UV difference spectra confirmed that in VILIP the Mg2+ form is very similar to the metal-free form; in NCS-1 it is different, especially in the Tyr region. NCS-1 possesses one unique Cys-38 in EF-hand site I. Its reactivity (kSH) toward 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) is the same for the Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-loaded protein, but kSH is 4-fold higher in metal-free NCS-1. VILIP possesses two additional thiols, one of which is inaccessible to DTNB in the native protein. The reactivity of the two accessible thiols is identical in the metal-free and Mg2+ forms and 5-fold higher than in the Ca2+ form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2106852901,"Kaliotoxin (KTX) has been originally described as an inhibitor of the intermediate conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel (Crest, M., Jacquet, G., Gola, M., Zerrouk, H., Benslimane, A., Rochat, H., Mansuelle, P., and Martin-Eauclaire, M.-F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 1640-1647). However, the radioiodinated 125I-KTX-(1-37) was also able to bind to the dendrotoxin sensitive voltage-dependent K+ channel (Romi, R., Crest, M., Gola, M., Sampieri, F., Jacquet, G., Zerrouk, H., Mansuelle, P., Sorokine, O., Van Dorsselaer, A., Rochat, H., Martin-Eauclaire, M.-F., and Van Rietschoten, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26302-26309). By following the ability to compete with 125I-KTX-(1-37) for binding to its receptor on rat brain synaptosomes, a new kaliotoxin-like peptide, KTX2, was isolated from Androctonus australis scorpion venom. It is a 37-amino acid residue peptide, and its sequence shares 76% identity with KTX. The differences between the two peptides concern the NH2-terminal region and the residues 31 and 34 located in the region involved in the channel recognition. These differences may explain the 5-fold decrease of the molluscan Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel blockage by KTX2 (kd = 135 nM) as well as of its binding affinity to rat brain synaptosomes (IC50 = 50 pM), compared with KTX. Specific antibodies raised against KTX-(1-37) were not able to recognize KTX2. Using degenerate primers, a 370-base pair cDNA encoding the KTX2 precursor was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA library of A. australis venom glands. It encoded a presumed signal peptide of 22 residues followed by the sequence of the mature peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1585928558,"Besides its critical role in hemostasis, the serine protease thrombin also participates in wound healing, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Thrombin is inhibited by the serpins antithrombin and heparin cofactor II (HCiI) in reactions that are accelerated markedly by specific glycosaminoglycans. Following vascular injury, thrombin must be inhibited at both intravascular and extravascular sites that impose different constraints on the recognition of thrombin by these inhibitors. The present study examines the role of anion-binding exosite II of thrombin in the interaction with glycosaminoglycans and HCII. Acceleration of thrombin inhibition by serpins in the presence of glycosaminoglycans is proposed to occur by a template mechanism, in which inhibitor and protease bind simultaneously to the same glycosaminoglycan chain, facilitating their interaction. According to the template model, disruption of protease binding to glycosaminoglycan should significantly reduce acceleration of the inhibition. Specific mutations in exosite II (R89E, R245E, K248E, and K252E) disrupted thrombin binding to both dermatan sulfate and heparin, indicating that both glycosaminoglycans bind to a common site in exosite II. The same mutations markedly decreased the rate constant for thrombin inhibition by antithrombin-heparin (up to 100-fold) but had little effect on the rate constant for thrombin inhibition by HCII-heparin (7-fold maximal reduction) and no effect on the rate constant for thrombin inhibition by HCII-dermatan sulfate. These results are incompatible with a template model for thrombin inhibition by HCII and dermatan sulfate. In the presence of glycosaminoglycan, HCII and antithrombin interact with opposing thrombin exosites and use distinct mechanisms of glycosaminoglycan catalysis. Antithrombin employs a template mechanism that requires heparin to interact with thrombin exosite II, whereas HCII employs an allosteric mechanism that requires thrombin exosite I but is largely independent of exosite II. These findings have potential implications for glycosaminoglycan therapy and for the respective physiologic roles of HCII and antithrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1527091318,"Rabphilin-3A is a putative target protein for Rab3A small GTP-binding protein, which is implicated in regulated secretion, particularly in neurotransmitter release. Rabphilin-3A is associated with synaptic vesicles, although it has no transmembrane segment. Here we have studied how rabphilin-3A is associated with synaptic vesicles. Treatment of the synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain with 1 M NaCl completely solubilized rabphilin-3A from the vesicles. These vesicles deprived of rabphilin-3A still contained Rab3A and synaptophysin. Exogenous rabphilin-3A bound to the vesicles deprived of endogenous rabphilin-3A in dose-dependent and saturable manners. The concentration of exogenous rabphilin-3A giving a half-maximal binding was about 50 nM and maximally 5 +/- 1 molecules of exogenous rabphilin-3A bound to one vesicle. Addition of exogenous Rab3A bound to one vesicle. Addition of exogenous Rab3A or removal of endogenous Rab3A by the action of Rab GDI did not affect the binding of exogenous rabphilin-3A to the vesicles. However, treatment of the vesicles with trypsin completely abolished the binding of exogenous rabphilin-3A. These results suggest that rabphilin-3A is associated with synaptic vesicles at least through a vesicle protein in a manner independent of Rab3A."
https://openalex.org/W1656195918,"The serine protease (SSP) from a Gram-negative organism, Serratia marcescens, is excreted even from Escherichia coli. The protease is synthesized as a 1045-amino-acid precursor (preproSSP) composed of three functional portions, a typical NH2-terminal signal peptide of 27 amino acids, the mature protease part of 618 amino acids, and a large COOH-terminal part of 400 amino acids. After the mature part (Ala28 to Asp645) has been liberated into the medium, most of the COOH-terminal part (Phe717 to Phe1045) remains stably in the outer membrane. When a mutated gene encoding the prepro-SSP with deletion of the junction region (Ser646 to Gly716) between the mature protease and the processed COOH-terminal protein was expressed in E. coli, the SSP protein was not detected in any fractions of the cells nor in the medium, whereas a processed COOH-terminal protein was found in the outer membrane. However, when the outer membrane fraction prepared from the transformant exhibiting the junction region (Ser646 to Gly716) probably on the cell surface was co-cultured with the transformant, SSP was found in the medium. Furthermore, a significant portion of the SSP protein denatured with guanidine hydrochloride was correctly refolded in vitro into the active protease, only in the presence of the outer membrane preparation from the transformant exhibiting the junction region. These results suggest that the junction region is exposed outside the cells, and it plays a role for guiding the folding of SSP in the correct conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1587550816,"L1 is a developmentally regulated adhesion molecule that may play a role in some aspects of axonal guidance. With Northern blots we find peak expression of L1 RNA at postnatal day 1 (P1) in the developing rat brain. Western blots show a peak of protein on P15. The major form of L1 is 200 kDa, but lower molecular mass forms are found including 140 and 80 kDa, representing, respectively, the extracellular and intracellular regions of L1. All molecular mass forms of L1 change during development. Although expressed at lower levels than during development, L1 is found in all brain regions in the adult rat. Different regions of the brain show differential expression and regulation of L1 and its peptide fragments. For instance, the hypothalamus showed an enhanced L1-80/L1-200 ratio at P10 and P15 relative to that expressed by cerebellum and hippocampus. Cerebellar granule cells in culture showed strong L1-200 and almost no L1-60, -80, or -140, in contrast to the intact cerebellum at the same age, which showed weaker L1-200 and strong L1-60, -80, and -140. Control experiments indicated that the L1 proteolytic cleavage found in different developing brain regions occurred in vivo and was not a result of sample preparation. The amount of L1-200 in cultured granule cells was proportional to the measured length of the growing axon. Neuronal activity (increased with 25 mM K+, 100 microns N-methyl-D-aspartate, and 100 microns 4-aminopyridine) enhanced L1 transcription and translation. Together, these data suggest differential regulation of L1 expression and proteolytic cleavage specific for developmental ages and brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W1916108665,"The three-dimensional solution structure of the growth-related protein-alpha/melanoma growth stimulatory activity (GRO/MGSA) has been solved by two-dimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The GRO/MGSA monomer consists of an NH2-terminal loop, a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, and a COOH-terminal alpha-helix. Dimerization, which is apparent under the experimental conditions used (2 mM, pH 5.10, 30 degrees C), results in a six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and a pair of helices with 2-fold symmetry. While the basic fold is similar to that seen for interleukin-8 (IL-8) (Clore, G. M., Appella, E., Yamada, M., Matsushima, K., and Gronenborn, A. M. (1990) Biochemistry, 29, 1689-1696), there are differences in the ELR motif (residues 6-8), the turn involving residues 31-36, which is linked to the NH2-terminal region through the 9-35 disulfide bond. The most significant differences are in the NH2-terminal loop (residues 12-23). In IL-8, all the corresponding regions have been shown to be required for receptor binding (Clark-Lewis, I., Dewald, B., Loetscher, M., Moser, B., and Baggiolini, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16075-16081). The structural differences thus have been identified between GRO/MGSA and IL-8 could contribute to their different receptor binding specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1525740204,"Measurements of flash-induced absorption changes at 325, 436, and 830 nm and of oxygen evolution were performed in order to analyze in detail the inhibition of photosystem II (PS II) by Cu(II) in PS II membrane fragments from spinach. (a) The kinetics of P680+ reduction become markedly slower in the presence of 100 microM CuSO4. (b) The CuSO4-induced kinetics of P680+ reduction are dominated by a 140-160-microsecond decay. (c) The extent of these 140-160-microsecond kinetics, normalized to the overall decay, remains virtually unaffected by addition of the exogenous PS II donor, NH2OH. (d) In thoroughly dark-adapted samples the CuSO4-induced 140-160-microsecond kinetics are already observed after the first flash and remain unchanged by a train of excitation flashes. (e) The extent of P680+ and QA- formation under repetitive flash excitation is not diminished by addition of 100 microM CuSO4. (f) The induction of microsecond kinetics of P680+ reduction at the expense of ns kinetics and the inhibition of the saturation rate of oxygen evolution exhibit the same dependence on CuSO4 concentration. (g) CuSO4 also transforms the 10-20-microsecond reduction of P680+ by TyrZ in Tris-washed PS II membrane fragments into 140-160-microsecond kinetics without any effect on the extent of flash-induced P680+ formation. These results unambiguously show that Cu(II) does not affect the charge separation (P680+QA-), but instead specifically modifies TyrZ and/or its micro environment so that the electron transfer to P680+ becomes blocked."
https://openalex.org/W1574495339,"The peptide substrate specificities of two matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), and 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9), have been examined. Starting with the parent substrate, Dnp-Pro-Leu-Gly approximately Leu-Trp-Ala-D-Arg-NH2, four separate substrate mixtures were synthesized at subsites P2(Leu) through P2′(Trp). These mixtures contained either naturally occurring L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or either of two distinct sets of miscellaneous amino acids. Combined, these mixtures gave 88 unique substitutions at each position and, over the four subsites, represented 352 potential substrates. Optimal substrates were identified using a combined high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis as previously reported. The results gave an extended profile of the substrate specificities for both MMP-1 and MMP-9 at subsites P2(Leu) through P2′(Trp). Using the data obtained from the mapping, a new peptide substrate, Dnp-Pro-Cha-Abu approximately Smc-His-Ala-D-Arg-NH2 (where Dnp is 2,4-dinitrophenyl, Cha is cyclohexylalanine, Abu is alpha-aminobutyric acid, and Smc is S-methylcysteine) was designed and characterized. This peptide showed a 36-fold improvement in turnover (kcat/Km) versus the parent substrate by interstitial collagenase. In addition, some collagenase subsite specificities described here were found to be different from those previously reported. Experimental data show that the observed selectivity is dependent on the original peptide template employed, which has broader implications for substrate specificity studies."
https://openalex.org/W1577108926,"Interleukin (IL)-1 alpha treatment of a primate bone marrow stromal cell line, PU-34, transiently increased the steady state level of IL-11 mRNA. Nuclear run-on experiments showed that the transcription rate of the IL-11 gene was not affected appreciably by IL-1 alpha induction, but changes in the half-life of the IL-11 mRNA corresponded well with the changes in the steady state level of the IL-11 mRNA during the induction. Although transient transfection of PU-34 cells with IL-11 promoter constructs failed to respond to IL-1 alpha, a 10-base pair promoter region and JunD.AP-1 complex were found to be responsible for the basal level transcription of the IL-11 gene. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein accelerated the degradation of the IL-11 mRNA without affecting the transcription rate of the IL-11 gene in IL-1 alpha stimulated cells. The insertion of DNA sequences corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of the IL-11 gene into a rabbit beta-globin gene resulted in destabilization of the chimeric mRNA which failed to be induced by IL-1 alpha. Exogenous IL-11 expression generated from transient transfection with plasmid pCMV-IL-11, however, can be stabilized by IL-1 alpha. In contrast to the hypothesis that AUUUA motifs in the 3′-untranslated region are sufficient to regulate cytokine mRNA stability, our results suggest that IL-1 alpha induced stabilization of the IL-11 mRNA requires participation of RNA sequences from different regions of the IL-11 message."
https://openalex.org/W1539930914,"Thrombin stimulation induces a dramatic increase in the activity of p72syk in platelets. We have found that activated p72syk, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s), translocates from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction to the Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeleton-rich fraction after thrombin stimulation. In addition, the redistribution of p72syk from the 100,000 x g Triton X-soluble fraction and the membrane skeleton was found to correlate with an increased level of p72syk in the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the early phase of p72syk translocation (within 60 s) was significantly inhibited with cytochalasin D, whereas the late phase of p72syk translocation (after 90 s) was completely inhibited with RGDS tetrapeptide treatment. These results suggest that translocation of the activated p72syk to the cytoskeleton correlates with different phases of the platelet activation process through actin polymerization and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa-fibrinogen-mediated aggregation of platelets and, hence, may have a regulatory role in tyrosine phosphorylation of platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1601442416,"An antibody engineering strategy was employed to build high affinity ligands and antagonists of integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha IIb beta 3. Previously, we inserted the integrin recognition motif, RGD, into the antigen binding site of a human antibody and selected the optimal flanking sequences from a phage-display library (Barbas, C. F., Languino, L. R., and Smith, J. W. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10003-10007). The resulting antibody, Fab-9, blocked the function of integrin alpha v beta 3 but also bound to the ligand binding site of platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3. In this report, the antibody engineering effort has been extended by 1) redesigning Fab-9 to achieve specificity for platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3, 2) building non-RGD-containing antibodies that bind the ligand binding site of both beta 3-integrins, and 3) testing the hypothesis that peptides derived from complementarity determining regions (CDR) can be used to emulate the activity of the parent synthetic antibody. These goals were accomplished by subjecting the original antibody, Fab-9, to a optimization (MTF). A phage library was constructed in which the residues flanking the RGD motif in Fab-9 were maintained, but the RGDX sequence was randomized. This library was panned on purified alpha IIb beta 3 to identify high affinity binders. Four function-blocking antibodies lacking RGD, but with specificity for alpha IIb beta 3, were characterized. The antibody with the highest preference for alpha IIb beta 3, MTF-10, had an adhesion sequence of KGDN. This sequence is similar in primary structure to the active sequence within the disintegrin barbourin, which also antagonizes alpha IIb beta 3 (Scarborough, R. M., Rose, J. W., Hsu, M. A., Phillips, D. R., Fried, V. A., Campbell, A. M., Nannizzi, L., and Charo, I. F. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 9359-9362). MTF-10 had a 70-fold higher affinity for alpha IIb beta 3 than alpha v beta 3. Through our selection strategy, we also identified several antibodies that lack RGD but still blocked ligand binding to both integrins with high affinity. Therefore, the RGD sequence is not necessary for a high affinity interaction with the ligand binding site of beta 3-integrins. Further investigation showed that the activity of inhibitory antibodies could be emulated by synthetic peptides derived from the protein sequences of the antibody's HCDR3. CDR-derived peptides blocked ligand binding to integrins and maintained essentially the same specificity as the parent antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1571215888,"Abstract The transforming gene v-crk found in CT10 and ASV-1 avian sarcoma viruses induces marked phosphorylation of several proteins in cells expressing p47v-crk (v-Crk). In this work, the main tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in ASV-1-infected chicken cells and v-crk-transfected rat cells were characterized biochemically. Both these proteins have a molecular mass of about 130 kDa and are tightly associated with v-Crk in vivo. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that they are both essentially single proteins (p130) with modifications that result in a broad spot in an acidic region. The broad band of semi-purified p130 became sharp at an elevated position in the gel upon treatment with orthovanadate in vivo or with c-Src kinase produced using a baculovirus vector in vitro, whereas it shifted at a lower position upon treatment with alkaline phosphatase in vitro. These results suggest multiple phosphorylation states of p130, which result in a broad band of p130. Two procedures of immunoaffinity purification were used to purify p130 from 3Y1 cells transfected with v-crk. Approximately 30 pmol of purified p130 was obtained in an immobilized form on a filter starting from 3 x 10(10) cells. Peptide mapping of p130 digested in situ by peptidase revealed that the purity and quantity of the final material were enough for peptide sequencing. Several stretches of partial amino acid sequences were determined, and they indicated that p130 is a novel protein."
https://openalex.org/W1585721338,"Subunit 3 of photosystem I (PSI-3), the product of the nuclear psaF gene, is the docking protein for plastocyanin during photosynthetic electron transport in thylakoid membranes and is synthesized in the cytosol with a transit peptide that resembles structurally the bipartite targeting signals of hydrophilic, lumenal components such as plastocyanin. In organello import experiments performed with the authentic PSI-3 precursor and chimeric polypeptides consisting of residue-correct fusions of transit peptides and mature proteins derived from different plastid proteins demonstrate that the PSI-3 transit peptide is indeed capable of translocating proteins into the thylakoid lumen and that, conversely, mature PSI-3 depends on a bipartite transit peptide for its thylakoid transfer. Of the three recently described translocation/integration pathways for nucleus-encoded proteins carrying bipartite transit peptides that are distinct in their physiological requirements and strictly protein-specific, PSI-3, like plastocyanin and the 33-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex, is translocated by a pathway that involves stromal factors but no proton gradient across the membrane. It is not affected by saturating amounts of the precursor for the 23-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex that follows the latter route. Thylakoid translocation of PSI-3 is, however, impaired in the presence of sodium azide, which indicates that a homolog to the bacterial SecA protein might be involved in this process suggesting, thus, a prokaryote-like translocation pathway. The azide-sensitive factor appears to interact predominantly with the transit peptide of a precursor protein, since chimeras consisting of a presequence from an azide-resistant precursor and a mature part of an azide-sensitive polypeptide are still translocated in the presence of the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1591974475,"We isolated the first membrane-bound type 2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase from the ciliated protozoan Paramecium tetraurelia (PtPP2C). Three isozymes of 33, 32, and 31 kDa with a specific activity of 1 mumol.min-1.mg1 were purified from the ciliary membrane. All enzymatic properties including (a) insensitivity toward inhibitors of other protein phosphatase families such as okadaic acid and microcystin, (b) absolute requirement for divalent cations, and (c) substrate specificity tested with synthetic phosphopeptides were identical to mammalian PP2C enzymes and identified the PtPP2C as a canonical PP2C in spite of it being about 25% smaller. The NH2-terminal was blocked. Microsequencing of six tryptic peptides established a relationship to other PP2C enzymes. The PtPP2C gene was obtained using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and the polymerase chain reaction. The gene coded for a 33-kDa protein with 300 amino acids and had an (A+T) content of 62%, typical for this protozoan. Nine of 15 Gln residues are encoded by TAA, a universal stop codon which codes for Gln in Paramecium. A large truncation at the COOH-terminal is responsible for the smaller size of the PtPP2C. Only a single transcript of 1 kilobase was detected with a Northern blot indicating that the 32- and 31-kDa proteins were proteolytic products of the 33-kDa enzyme. Sequence comparisons with PP2C enzymes from rat, rabbit, yeast, Arabidopsis, and Leishmania defined a highly diverged enzyme family which shares three conserved domains, I, II, and III, accounting for about 25% of the primary structure. We demonstrated further that the distances between domains I/II and II/III are very similar in all PP2C enzymes (9-13 and 74-80 amino acids, respectively). However, the amino acid sequences of the spacer regions are unrelated. In addition, the COOH-terminal ends of 100-200 amino acids which comprise 30-50% of the enzyme, display no identity. A dendrogramm shows that PtPP2C surprisingly is most closely related to the mammalian PP2C, and enzymes from Leishmania, Arabidopsis, and yeast are more distant relatives."
https://openalex.org/W1493689654,"The integrity of the T cell receptor complex (CD3-TCR) transduction machinery is central to T cell development and to T cell effector function. Molecular dissection of the multimeric CD3-TCR complex revealed that at least two associated polypeptides, CD3 zeta and CD3 epsilon, autonomously couple antigenic recognition event to early and late events of the intracytoplasmic activation cascade. A 18-amino acid motif based on a tandem YXXL stretch, the activation receptor homology sequence 1 (ARH-1) motif, is necessary and sufficient to the transducing properties of both CD3 zeta and CD3 epsilon. Stimulation of chimeric molecules made of ecto- and transmembrane domains of various cell surface proteins and intracytoplasmic domains of CD3 epsilon or CD3 zeta leads to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in Jurkat cells. We describe here that a similar CD25/zeta chimeric molecule was unable to induce a detectable [Ca2+]i rise upon CD25 cross-linking once expressed in the murine thymoma BW-. A Ca2+ influx could, however, be triggered in BW- cells by thapsigargin, i.e. following depletion of Ca2+ stores. Somatic cell hybrids made from BW- and either thymocytes or mature lymph node T cells reconstituted the coupling of CD3 zeta to the Ca2+ signal via an ARH-1 motif-dependent pathway. However, pervanadate-induced Ca2+ mobilization, a phenomenon attributed to tyrosine phosphorylation, was impaired in BW-cells and reconstituted in hybridomas. In contrast to the Ca2+ response, IL-2 production was induced in both BW- and hybrids cells, which questions the functional relevance of [Ca2+]i augmentation in T cell activation. In conclusion, the properties of the BW- thymoma, which define a novel group of CD3 zeta transduction cell mutants, as well as its complementation by somatic cell fusion demonstrate that this cell line represents a useful model to dissect the signaling pathway that couples CD3 zeta to Ca2+ mobilization by genetic reconstitution."
https://openalex.org/W1598798920,"In rat brain, the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) contains two low molecular weight isoforms, consisting of 467 and 498 amino acids and designated MAP2c and d, respectively. The present study describes the expression of these isoforms in Escherichia coli and their subsequent purification to homogeneity. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant proteins ran with apparent molecular masses of 69 and 74 kDa. A microtubule-assembling assay demonstrated that the recombinant protein was biologically active and that the tubulin polymerization rate for MAP2d was twice as fast as that for MAP2c. After dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase, preparations of low molecular weight MAP2 from fetal rat brain aligned with recombinant MAP2c. Moreover, recombinant MAP2c could be phosphorylated with a brain extract kinase activity, resulting in a reduced electrophoretic mobility similar to that observed in fetal MAP2."
https://openalex.org/W1531575807,"Adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), a virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis, acquires hemolytic and toxic activities after post-translational modification of the cyaA gene product, CyaA. The exact nature of this modification is unknown, but homology to the related repeat toxin alpha-hemolysin of Escherichia coli suggests that fatty acylation of a lysine residue may be involved. In the present study, we used an in vitro chemical approach to acylate unmodified, inactive adenylate cyclase protoxin by using a new water-soluble compound, acylpyrophosphate. We show that undirected transfer of lauric, myristic, or palmitic acid chains to the CyaA protoxin is able to confer both hemolytic and toxic activities to ACT. The chemically modified protoxin shows a specific requirement for Ca2+ ions for toxic activity, as does the wild type toxin. However, the toxic and hemolytic activities of chemically modified ACT are low in comparison to ACT modified in vivo, suggesting that in vitro fatty acylation of the protoxin involves random modification of nucleophilic residues present in the toxin in contrast to the in vivo modification of specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1573250113,"Neutrophil-endothelial interactions, altered clearance properties of the lung toward vasoactive mediators, and damaging effects of histamine that target the lung represent prominent elements of the inflammatory response at the systemic level. The pulmonary vasculature is unusual in that, unlike other tissues and vascular beds, it normally does not metabolize circulating histamine in vivo, although histamine-metabolizing enzyme activities have been detected in disrupted lung tissue. We have therefore explored the capability of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells in culture to express the receptor-mediated histamine degradative uptake system we previously defined in systemic endothelial cells (Haddock, R. C., Mack, P., Leal, S., and Baenziger, N. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14395-14401). Pulmonary endothelial cells display all components of this system: histamine methyltransferase generating the proximal cell-associated metabolite tele-methylhistamine and receptors binding diamine oxidase which generates the distal product methylimidazoleacetic acid that is accumulated by the cells. A diamine oxidase released from human neutrophil granules by activation with Ca2+ ionophore binds pulmonary and systemic endothelial cell and fibroblast diamine oxidase receptors and, thereby, participates in histamine degradative uptake. This enzyme utilizes cell-associated tele-methylhistamine as a substrate, preferentially generating methylimidazoleacetic acid in addition to reactive oxygen species. Thus the enzymatic and interactive cellular machinery for histamine clearance is inherently present as a functional unit in two major human pulmonary cell types. It interacts with products of inflammatory host defense cells, and pulmonary endothelial-neutrophil interactions via this pathway may influence the progression of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1558402384,"GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE represent a small gene family localized on chromosome 4q28-q31 that encodes the major red cell membrane glycophorins, GPA and GPB, and a new but as yet uncharacterized glycoprotein, GPE. There are 3-4 times more copies of GPA as compared with GPB on human erythrocytes (10(6) versus 2 x 10(5) copies/cell), whereas GPE is absent or poorly represented. Whether these quantitative differences reflect a transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation was investigated. We found the functional activities of the glycophorin promoters to be similar, as shown by DNase I footprinting, gel retardation, methylation interference, and deletion analysis. Run-on analysis indicated that the transcription rate of each glycophorin gene in K562 cells was also very similar. However, large differences in mRNA decay were found in actinomycin-treated K562 cells. GPA transcripts were very stable (at least 24 h), whereas GPB transcripts were severely reduced after 17 h. The GPE transcripts were barely detectable and disappeared completely after 1 h. These results suggest that a difference in stability of the GPA, GPB, and GPE transcripts rather than a transcriptional regulation may predominantly account for the different levels of glycophorin expression on erythrocytes."
