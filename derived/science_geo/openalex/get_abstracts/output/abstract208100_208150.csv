Hence syncytiotrophoblast of the monkey appears to originate by differentiation of cytotrophoblast."

The distribution of the effect among the organs is the same as that observed in thyroxine stimulation of oxidative metabolism. Thus, stimulation of protein synthesis seems to be a physiological action of the thyroid hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2002728411,"The time spent by the female rhesus monkey in grooming the male fluctuates rhythmically and reaches a minimum at mid-cycle. At this time the male's grooming activity reaches a maximum. The rhythmic changes in male mounting behavior, together with the males' and females' grooming cycles, are abolished by ovariectomy and have a hormonal basis."

https://openalex.org/W2008546931,"A dialyzable, acetylcholine-like material exists in homogenates of globiferous pedicellariae of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus. Its pharmacological characterization was obtained on the basis of the responses of the guinea pig ileum, the rat uterus, blood pressure in the dog, the amphibian heart, the longitudinal muscle of the holothurian, and the protractor muscle of the sea urchin lantern. Some of the data were statistically treated, and an attempt was made to determine a ratio of potency between the homogenates and acetylcholine."

https://openalex.org/W1972126039,"Cardiac responses to hypothalamic and septal stimulation are polyphasic, the first component being accelerative. As interstimulus intervals are decreased, only accelerative components appear, but prestimulus heart rates (""background levels"") are decreased upon septal and are either increased or unchanged upon hypothalamic stimulation. The suggestion that parasympathetic responses accompany reinforcing brain stimulation was not supported."

These data confirm our previou results with 40 mongoloids whose mean age was 23.7 years, and indicate that elevated uric acid levels are present throughout most of the life of these subjects."

This treatment did not prevent the occurrence of degenerative changes in the germinal epithelium of the tests.

The tolerant state could be extended by an additional intravenous injection of antigen. Repeated injections of the polymer in adjuvant mixture could ""break"" the tolerant state."

https://openalex.org/W2013758233,"POSITIVE chronotropic effects induced by increased concentration of calcium ions have been reported by a number of authors in isolated1,2 and non-isolated3–5 mammalian hearts. Increased levels of calcium seem, therefore, to affect the pacemaker activity of the mammalian heart in a way opposite to that which one would infer from the ‘polarizing’6 and ‘stabilizing’7 influence of this ion on the membrane potential of isolated sino-atrial and Purkinje fibres, respectively. This communication presents some results which are consistent with the hypothesis that the in vitro activation of the atrial pacemaker induced by increased concentrations of calcium ions is adrenergic in nature."

There were 20 potatoes in every one of the treatments, including the controls. The percentages of tubers sprouting in the various lots after 4 months of cold storage are recorded in Table 1. The optimum γ-radiation dose, two weeks after lifting, appears to be 9,000 rads for Up-to-Date and 6,000 rads for Gola. Rubin and Metlitsky1 reported that Berlikhingen variety of potato needs a higher γ-radiation dose than Moscow variety for prevention of sprouting."

https://openalex.org/W2038986132,THE presence of crucifer material in the diet is reported to increase the urinary and fæcal excretion of thiamine with greater storage of the vitamin in viscera of rats1. We have also reported that 2 per cent mustard (Brassica nigra) replacing the same weight of sucrose in the thiamine-free diet enhanced the synthesis of thiamine in rats only when coprophagy was allowed2. The coliform count in the cæca of mustard-fed rats was also found to increase considerably. The question then arises whether the vitamin was absorbed in the gut immediately after synthesis or whether it was excreted in the fæces and was available only after the animal had eaten its fæces.

https://openalex.org/W1982483343,"IN work directed toward the separation of several volatile 2-halogenated carboxylic acids by paper chromatography, it was found desirable to develop these acids, not, as is usually the case, in the form of their salts1, but as the free acids. The so-called ‘swamp acid’ technique2 used for this purpose simply involves the use of a relatively large quantity of some acid as part of the solvent system, usually acetic or formic. This acid is necessary to repress ionization of the unknown acid, which would otherwise give rise to ‘tails’ or ‘ghosts’. However, it soon became clear in working with the 2-halogenated acids that removal of the ‘swamp acid’ preparatory to spraying with the more common acid-base indicators also removed the volatile unknown acids. Therefore, some scheme had to be found for locating the unknowns in the presence of the ‘swamp acid’."
