https://openalex.org/W1538855357,"A cDNA encoding the human lysosomal cysteine proteinase cathepsin S precursor has been expressed in yeast using the pVT100-U expression vector containing the alpha-factor promoter. The procathepsin S gene was expressed either as a fusion protein with the pre-region or with the prepro-region of the yeast alpha-factor precursor gene. Following in vitro processing both constructs gave an identical active mature enzyme with a molecular weight of 24,000. After prolonged cultivation of the cells the recombinant protein is also found as an active proteinase in the culture supernatant. The precursor can be activated in vitro at pH 4.5 and 40 degrees C under reducing conditions. The in vitro activated enzyme has a 6-amino acid NH2-terminal extension when compared with the native bovine enzyme. The purified enzyme displays a bell-shaped pH activity profile with a pH optimum of 6.5 and pK values of 4.5 and 7.8. The isoelectric point of the recombinant human cathepsin S is between 8.3 and 8.6 and about 1.5 pH units higher than for the bovine enzyme. The kinetic data for several synthetic substrates and inhibitors reveal a preference for smaller amino acid residues in the binding subsites S2 and S3 of cathepsin S. Like the bovine enzyme, the recombinant human cathepsin S is characterized by a broader range of pH stability (pH 5-7.5) than cathepsins B and L."
https://openalex.org/W1494207217,"Neutral trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) is a trehalose hydrolyzing enzyme of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (App, H., and Holzer, H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17583-17588). The gene of neutral trehalase was cloned by complementation of a neutral trehalase-deficient yeast mutant which was obtained by ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis. Three mutants without detectable neutral trehalase activity were obtained and characterized by tetrad analysis and found to belong to the same complementation group. The mutants were transformed with a S. cerevisiae genomic library in YEp24. Two overlapping plasmids were isolated, containing the neutral trehalase gene NTH1 with an open reading frame of 2079 base pairs (bp), encoding a protein of 693 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 79,569 Da. Several putative TATA boxes were found in the 5'-nontranslated region of the NTH1 gene. In positions -652 to -641 a possible binding sequence for the MIG1 protein, a multicopy inhibitor of the GAL1 promotor, which also binds to the promotor sequences of the SUC2 and the FBP1 gene, was found. The start codon of the neutral trehalase is located about 2500 bp upstream of the centromere 4 consensus sequence elements I, II, and III (Mann, C., and Davis, R. W. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6, 241-245). Vicinity to a centromere is known to have a depressing influence on the number of plasmid copies per cell. This probably explains why transformation with pNTH does not lead to overexpression of neutral trehalase. The four consensus sequences AATAAA contained in the centromeric elements and reconfirmed by our sequencing data might be polyadenylation signals for NTH1-mRNA transcription termination. Northern blot analysis yielded a single mRNA species of approximately 2.3 kilobase(s). The neutral trehalase protein has a putative cAMP-dependent phosphorylation consensus sequence RRGS from amino acid positions 22-25. Therefore, the previously described activation of neutral trehalase by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation is probably due to phosphorylation of serine 25. Three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) occur in the open reading frame of the neutral trehalase gene. However, no evidence for glycosylation could be detected by Western blotting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1636802518,"Homogeneously sized, heparin-derived oligosaccharides were prepared from heparin following partial depolymerization with nitrous acid, reduction with sodium borohydride, and fractionation by gel permeation chromatography. The resulting pools of di-, tetra-, hexa-, octa-, and decasaccharides were sequentially applied to an affinity column of human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) covalently attached to Sepharose 4B and further fractionated into subpools based on their elution from this column in response to gradients of sodium chloride. In general, pools of smaller heparin-derived oligosaccharides required relatively lower salt concentration for complete elution, and pools of larger oligosaccharides required higher salt concentration. The homogeneously sized pools and affinity-fractionated subpools of heparin-derived oligosaccharides were quantitatively assessed as inhibitors or enhancers of specific bFGF-mediated biological activities in five separate assay systems as follows: assay 1, to compete with human lymphoblastoid cells expressing syndecan (RO-12 UC cells) for binding to bFGF-coated wells (Ishihara, M., Tyrrell, D.J., Kiefer, M.C., Barr, P.J., and Swiedler, S.J. (1992) Anal. Biochem. 202, 310-315); assay 2, to inhibit 125I-bFGF binding to low affinity sites of adrenocortical endothelial (ACE) cells; assay 3, to inhibit bFGF-induced proliferation of ACE cells; assay 4, to support mitogenic activity of bFGF in a growth stimulation assay of chlorate-treated ACE cells; and assay 5, to enhance the in vitro interaction between 125I-bFGF and the recombinant extra-cellular domain of FGF high affinity receptor. The data derived from the five assay systems demonstrated that heparin-derived hexa- and octasaccharides inhibited the interaction between cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan and bFGF (assays 1 and 2) and bFGF-induced proliferation of ACE cells (assay 3) but were unable to enhance the binding of bFGF to its high affinity receptor in vitro (assay 5) or to support bFGF-induced mitogenesis in ACE cells (assay 4). These two activities required at least a decasaccharide with high affinity for bFGF."
https://openalex.org/W1554263934,"Aristolochene is the likely precursor of the sesquiterpenoid toxins produced by a number of filamentous fungi. One of these, PR-toxin, is produced by Penicillium roqueforti. We report here the isolation of a gene (Ari1) coding for the sesquiterpene cyclase, aristolochene synthase (AS), from P. roqueforti. Nucleotide sequence analysis of genomic and cDNA clones revealed that the Ari1 gene contains two introns. A Protein A/AS fusion enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to have sesquiterpene cyclase activity. Analysis of the Protein A/AS fusion enzyme reaction mixtures by TLC and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry identified aristolochene as a major product. The Ari1 gene encodes a polypeptide of molecular weight 39,200. Expression of Ari1 occurs in stationary phase cultures of P. roqueforti and appears to be transcriptionally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1585322583,"We demonstrated previously that heparin-derived hexasaccharides are the smallest fragments of the polysaccharide with comparable basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-modulating activity in vitro (Ishihara, M., Tyrrell, D.J., Stauber, G.B., Brown, S., Cousens, L., and Stack, R.J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4675-4683. In this report, a specific hexasaccharide having high affinity for recombinant human bFGF was isolated and its structure deduced by analysis of its reduced disaccharide products after treatment with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, and by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The hexasaccharide has the structure [IdoA(2-OSO3)alpha 1-4GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)alpha 1-4]2IdoA(2-OSO3)alpha 1-4 AManR(6-OSO3). The hexasaccharide effectively inhibits the binding of syndecan-transfected RO-12 UC cells to bFGF-coated wells (Ishihara, M., Tyrrell, D.J., Kiefer, M.C., Barr, P.J., and Swiedler, S.J. (1992) Anal. Biochem. 202, 310-315), prevents the binding of 125I-bFGF to confluent monolayers of adrenocortical endothelial (ACE) cells, and inhibits the bFGF-dependent proliferation of ACE cells. Unlike the heparin from which it was derived, however, the hexasaccharide cannot promote the binding of 125I-bFGF to a recombinant high affinity bFGF receptor (flg) or restore the bFGF-dependent proliferative response to ACE cells grown in the presence of 5 mM sodium chlorate. Collectively, these data indicate that a hexasaccharide can be as effective as heparin as an antagonist of bFGF-mediated cell mitogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1581148997,"Triggering of the multicomponent T cell antigen receptor (TCR) complex results in several biochemical processes which are critical for the functional activation of T lymphocytes. One common process is the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including the TCR zeta chain. Here we show that in addition to TCR zeta, other subunits (CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, and CD3 epsilon) of the TCR complex can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to antigen receptor stimulation. This rapid phosphorylation was detected in several mature murine T cell subsets, including CD4+ type 1 and 2 helper cells (TH1 and TH2). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple TCR components in addition to TCR zeta may be an important event during the initiation of the signaling cascade leading to T cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W1490514916,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) was purified from the digestive gland of the squid Ommastrephes sloani pacificus. It had high enzymatic activity for the 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene substrate and was composed of a major and a minor polypeptide band, both with molecular masses near 25 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. GST cDNA clones were derived from the digestive gland mRNA. The deduced GSTs of the longest cDNAs (pGST5 and pGST11) containing the entire coding sequence have a molecular mass near 23 kDa. Sequence comparisons showed that the squid GST is 42-44% identical to both squid and octopus S-crystallins (the major proteins of the lens), 32-34% identical to class pi and 29-32% identical to class alpha GSTs of vertebrates, and 19-23% identical to other GSTs of vertebrates and insects. Northern blot hybridization revealed that GST mRNAs were much more abundant in the digestive gland than in the testis, mantle, or lens. Analysis of a squid GST gene indicated that it has an exon-intron structure similar to that of the vertebrate class pi GST gene. An apparently novel repetitive element was identified in the 5'-flanking sequence of the squid GST gene. Our results suggest that multiple duplications of an ancestral GST gene gave rise to a family of enzymatically inactive crystallins specialized for lens refraction and one (or two) active GST enzyme expressed preferentially, but not exclusively, in the digestive gland in squids. This differs from the innovation of refractive function from a metabolic enzyme by increased expression in the lens with minimal or no gene duplication, as occurred among the enzyme-crystallins of vertebrates."

The technique can allow parallel analysis of several large genomic segments of varying complexities and can be applied to the isolation of expressed sequences from various tissue sources."
https://openalex.org/W1541728163,"Three discrete tetrasaccharide structures which are resistant to Flavobacterium heparinase and heparitinases I and II were isolated from porcine intestinal heparin after exhaustive digestion with a mixture of all the above enzymes, and the tri-, tetra-, and penta-sulfated structures were determined by negative ion mode fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and 500-MHz 1H NMR analysis as delta 4,5GlcA beta 1-4GlcNAc (6-sulfate)alpha 1-4GlcA beta 1-4GlcN(N,3-disulfate), delta 4,5 GlcA beta 1-4GlcNAc(6-sulfate)alpha 1-4GlcA beta 1-4GlcN (N,3,6-trisulfate), and delta 4,5GlcA beta 1-4GlcN (N,6-disulfate)alpha 1-4GlcA beta 1-4GlcN(N,3,6-trisulfate). The three components share the 3-O-sulfated reducing GlcN and the 6-O-sulfated internal GlcN, indicating that they are structural variants derived from the nonreducing portion of the minimal pentasaccharide sequence required for binding to antithrombin III. Isolation of the pentasulfated component has never been reported. Their unexpected resistance to heparitinases I and II indicates that 3-O-sulfation of the reducing GlcN contributes to the resistant nature of these tetrasaccharides to the enzymes. The present study demonstrates that the nonreducing trisaccharide portion of the structural variants of the antithrombin III-binding pentasaccharide sequence can be isolated in tetrasaccharides resistant to heparinase/heparitinases I and II, while the rest of the repeating region is degraded into disaccharide units. The lyase treatment is applicable to evaluation of heparin/heparan sulfate preparations in terms of the presence or absence of the specific structure containing the 3-O-sulfated GlcN representing biosynthetic precursors, intermediates or final products of the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1504738268,"Abstract Eukaryotic metallothioneins (MTs) have been extensively studied, but the precise functions of most of these molecules are not yet fully understood. Prokaryotes are often more tractable for the analysis of gene function and we report here the generation of mutants of Synechococcus PCC 7942 (strain R2-PIM8) deficient in the MT locus, smt. Viability of these mutants, designated R2-PIM8 (smt), reveals that prokaryotic MT performs no vital role (such as donation of metals to metallo-proteins) in Synechococcus. R2-PIM8 (smt) has reduced (approximately 5-fold) tolerance to elevated Zn2+, with detectable hypersensitivity to Cd2+. Restoration of Zn2+ tolerance was used as a selectable marker to isolate recombinants derived from R2-PIM8(smt) after reintroduction of a linear DNA fragment containing an uninterrupted smt locus. These smt-complemented cells also exhibited restored Cd2+ tolerance. Hypersensitivity to Cu2+ was not detected in R2-PIM8(smt) indicating independence of Cu2+ resistance from smt mediated metal (Zn2+/Cd2+) tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1484012215,"We have observed that a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) greatly potentiates pro-uPA-mediated plasminogen activation. This effect was dependent on the interaction between the immunoglobulin and the kringle domain of pro-uPA and could be competed efficiently by kringle-containing proteolytic fragments of uPA. In addition, the potentiation could also be competed by the lysine analog 6-aminohexanoic acid, an antagonist of plasminogen binding. This unexpected plasminogen binding dependence was found to be due to a carboxyl-terminal lysine residue on the immunoglobulin gamma chain, which by analogy with other proteins represents a potential binding site for plasminogen. Removal of this residue with carboxypeptidase B resulted in a complete abolition of the potentiation. It appears therefore that the potentiatory effect involves a novel mechanism with the antibody acting to provide a specific template for the assembly of a ternary complex involving pro-uPA/uPA and plasminogen, enabling them to interact in a catalytically favorable manner. This interpretation was confirmed by studying the kinetics of plasminogen activation by the complex between active, two-chain uPA and the antibody, which resulted in an overall 50-fold increase in reaction efficiency (kcat/Km), primarily due to a reduction in Km from 20 to 0.1 microM. Pro-uPA activation by plasmin was also accelerated, although to a lesser extent. The potentiation due to complex formation also provides a mechanism for the initiation of this system, dependent only on the low intrinsic proteolytic activity of the zymogen forms. The effects observed here, mediated by ternary complex formation, simulate the effects we have previously observed on assembly of the uPA receptor-mediated cellular plasminogen activation system and may therefore represent a mechanistic model for both its activity and initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1501650250,"All of the phosphorylation sites in 40 S ribosomal protein S6 derived from serum-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells are found within a small cyanogen bromide (CNBr) peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus, Lys218-Lys249. Further cleavage of the CNBr peptide or the intact protein with endoproteinase Lys-C (endo Lys-C) generated a single phosphorylated peptide, implying that all the sites of phosphorylation resided either between Arg231 and Lys243 or between Arg231 and Lys249 if cleavage at Lys243 was blocked by phosphorylation at a nearby residue. To discern between these possibilities and to identify the phosphorylation sites, the protein was purified from serum-stimulated cells and cleaved with endo Lys-C, and the single endo Lys-C phosphorylated peptide was isolated and sequenced following conversion of all the phosphorylated serines to S-ethylcysteine. The results show that the phosphorylated peptide extends from Arg231 to Lys249 and that the sites of phosphorylation in vivo are Ser235, Ser240, Ser244, and Ser247."
https://openalex.org/W1534606074,"Abstract Six site-directed mutants of cytochrome P450 2B1 were constructed, and function was evaluated in COS cell microsomes by monitoring testosterone and androstenedione hydroxylation and inactivation by chloramphenicol. Mutants Ile-114-->Val and Ile-114-->Ala exhibited marked decreases in androgen 16 beta-OH:16 alpha-OH ratios and increases in 15 alpha-OH:16-OH ratios. Since substitution of Gly-478 with Ala or Ser reduces 16 beta-hydroxylation in favor of 15 alpha-hydroxylation, four double mutants containing Val or Ala at position 114 and Ala or Ser at position 478 were examined. For any given residue at position 114 (Ile, Val, or Ala), the 15 alpha-OH:16-OH ratio increased as residue 478 was changed from Gly to Ala to Ser, and for any residue at position 478, this ratio increased as residue 114 was changed from Ile to Val to Ala. As a consequence, the Ile-114-->Ala, Gly-478-->Ser mutant displayed an approximately 1000-fold higher androgen 15 alpha-OH:16-OH ratio compared with the parental enzyme and functionally resembles mouse P450 2A4 much more closely than P450 2B1. All three mutants with Val at position 114 retained susceptibility to inactivation by chloramphenicol, whereas inactivation was suppressed by Ala at this position. The results suggest the feasibility of an empirical approach to P450 engineering involving the appropriate combination of residues at a few critical sites to confer new regio- and stereoselectivity with retention of overall monooxygenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1529873738,"Abstract Selective deamidation of proteins and peptides is a reaction of great interest, whether it has physiological significance as in protein aging, or occurs as a disturbing event in the preparation of natural or recombinant proteins. Deamidation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A, RNase A, a classical model protein, has been reported to occur only after denaturation of the protein, or under harsh conditions. In this paper convenient procedures are described for selective deamidation of Asn67 in native RNase A under mild conditions. Furthermore, for the first time, both products of deamidation were isolated: the aspartyl and the isoaspartyl containing protein derivatives. Replacement of Asn67 with either residue lowers the catalytic activity of the enzyme, on RNA and on model substrates, except when a dinucleotide with a purine on the 5' side is the substrate. In the latter case an intriguing increase in the specificity constant is observed. The Asp67 derivative was found to refold, after full denaturation and reduction, at the same rate as the fully amidated protein, whereas the iso-Asp67 derivative refolded at half that rate. It is hypothesized that this effect is due to a delayed formation of disulfide 65-72 for the presence of the abnormal isopeptide bond between residues 67 and 68."
https://openalex.org/W1489622248,"We have examined the gene- and strand-specific DNA repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in fibroblasts from normal individuals and from patients with the DNA repair-deficient disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Cells were studied from XP complementation groups A, C, D, and F. DNA repair was assessed in the essential, active gene, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in the active c-myc protooncogene, and in the transcriptionally inactive delta-globin gene. In addition, repair was studied in the individual strands of the DHFR gene in normal and group C cells. In the two strains of group C cells, we find preferential DNA repair of the DHFR gene and a strand bias of the repair with more repair in the transcribed strand. This is in general accordance with previously published reports (Venema, J., van Hoffen, A., Natarajan, A.T., van Zeeland, A.A., and Mullenders, L.H.F. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 443-448; Venema, J., van Hoffen, A., and Mullenders, L.H.F. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 4128-4134), but we now find that there is more repair in the nontranscribed strand and less in the transcribed strand than what has been observed previously. In XP group A and D strains, we find little or no gene-specific DNA repair. In cells from an individual in XP complementation group F, we find less repair of dimers in the active gene than what has been observed for the overall genome. We have also measured the colony-forming ability of the strains after treatment with UV and find that this measure of survival does not correlate with the level of gene-specific repair of dimers. Thus, XP group F represents a novel repair phenotype with little or no gene-specific repair of dimers, but with relatively high UV resistance. We also evaluate the XP patients' clinical features in relation to gene-specific repair of dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1512900448,"The differing signal transductions elicited by three isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were studied in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), which show different mitogenic responses to the three PDGF isoforms. PDGF-BB elicited a variety of cellular signals, including the phosphorylation on tyrosine of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) and the PDGF receptor, formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, degradation of phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). However, PDGF-AB failed to show some of these signals, although it stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation to almost the same extent as PDGF-BB. Importantly, phosphorylation on tyrosine of the PLC-gamma 1 was far less (< 6.25%) in the case of PDGF-AB than that of PDGF-BB when assessed by immunoblotting. On the other hand, calcium ion entry from the extracellular medium was comparable in PDGF-AB- and PDGF-BB- stimulated VSMC. PDGF-AA, which did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation, failed to show any of these effects with the exception of diacylglycerol formation. These observations suggest that the three PDGF isoforms stimulate different signal transduction pathways and that calcium ion entry, but not tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1, is essential for PDGF-induced mitogenesis in VSMC."
https://openalex.org/W1567164927,"It is known that the initiation of bacteriophage lambda replication requires the orderly assembly of the lambda O.lambda P.DnaB helicase protein preprimosomal complex at the ori lambda DNA site. The DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE heat shock proteins act together to destabilize the lambda P.DnaB complex, thus freeing DnaB and allowing it to unwind lambda DNA near the ori lambda site. The first step of this disassembly reaction is the binding of DnaK to the lambda P protein. In this report, we examined the influence of the DnaJ and GrpE proteins on the stability of the lambda P.DnaK complex. We present evidence for the existence of the following protein-protein complexes: lambda P.DnaK, lambda P.DnaJ, DnaJ.DnaK, DnaK.GrpE, and lambda P.DnaK.GrpE. Our results suggest that the presence of GrpE alone destabilizes the lambda P.DnaK complex, whereas the presence of DnaJ alone stabilizes the lambda P.DnaK complex. Using immunoprecipitation, we show that in the presence of GrpE, DnaK exhibits a higher affinity for the lambda P.DnaJ complex than it does alone. Using cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, we show that oligomeric forms of DnaK exhibit a higher affinity for lambda P than monomeric DnaK. However, in the presence of GrpE, monomeric DnaK can efficiently bind lambda P protein. These findings help explain our previous results, namely that in the GrpE-dependent lambda DNA replication system, the DnaK protein requirement can be reduced up to 10-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1504005082,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase-stimulating protein, also known as pterin-4 alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PHS/PCD), was purified from rat and, for the first time, from human liver. We obtained their complete protein primary sequence using a combination of liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry/tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and Edman microsequence analysis. The amino acid sequences of human and rat PHS/PCD were found to be identical. Surprisingly, the primary structure of PHS/PCD is also essentially identical to a protein of the cell nucleus, named dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, recently reported to be involved in transcription (Mendel, D.

https://openalex.org/W1481093768,"The genome of the baculovirus Autographa californica encodes a 19-kDa protein (BVP) containing an active site sequence motif ((I/V)HCXAGXXR(S/T)G) that characterizes a large family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The baculoviral protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified so that its enzymatic properties could be examined. We have demonstrated that recombinant BVP has intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Like VH1, a PTP encoded by vaccinia virus, BVP also dephosphorylates seryl or threonyl residues. However, the similarity of BVP to VH1 or the catalytic domains from PTPs of eukaryotic origin is restricted to a small region surrounding the active site motif. In contrast, the similarity of BVP to two putative PTPs encoded by the CDC14 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a gene of unknown function from Caenorhabditis elegans extends throughout its sequence. We postulate that BVP and its two homologs constitute a unique subfamily that may differ from other PTPs in having a specialized function, mode of regulation, or substrate preference."
https://openalex.org/W2132828385,"On the basis of the crystal structure of the NAD-dependent cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and its alignment with NADP-dependent counterparts, the loop region between beta-strand B and alpha-helix C in the dinucleotide-binding fold was predicted as a principal determinant for the coenzyme specificity. Two mutants, EX7 and EX3, of NAD-dependent MDH from Thermus flavus were constructed. In the EX7 mutant, the seven loop amino acids in positions 41-47, Glu-Ile-Pro-Gln-Ala-Met-Lys, were replaced by the corresponding loop residues in the NADP-dependent MDH from chloroplasts, Gly-Ser-Glu-Arg-Ser-Phe-Gln. In the EX3 mutant, Glu-41, Ile-42, and Ala-45 were substituted with the corresponding 3 amino acids in the NADP-dependent chloroplast MDH. In both mutations the coenzyme specificity was altered from NAD to NADP. Especially, the EX7 mutation resulted in a more than 1000-fold improvement in overall catalytic efficiency with NADPH and a 600-fold decrease in the efficiency with NADH as cofactors. Consequently, EX7 mutant was 132 times more efficient with NADPH than NADH without a large decrease in turnover number."
https://openalex.org/W1502860897,"There are two PDGF receptor proteins (PDGFR alpha and PDGFR beta) which are proposed to function as subunits to form a high-affinity dimeric PDGF receptor. One aspect of this model about which there is still disagreement is whether PDGF-AB can bind to cells that express only PDGFR beta and, if so, whether PDGF-AB can act as an agonist or an antagonist. To address this question, we derived 3T3 cell lines from Patch mutant mouse embryos in which the PDGFR alpha gene is deleted but which express normal levels of PDGFR beta. Comparison between the binding and response properties of mutant and wild type 3T3 cell lines allowed us to define the contribution that PDGFR alpha makes to the ability of a cell to bind, and respond to, PDGF-AB. We found that PDGF-AB binds to PDGFR alpha-negative 3T3 cells and can induce DNA synthesis, PDGFR beta dimerization, and phosphorylation on tyrosine. In addition we found that PDGF-AB binding and stimulation of these activities is strongly temperature-dependent, whereas PDGF-AB binding and activation of PDGFR beta in the presence of PDGFR alpha is not. However, 3T3 cells that do not express PDGFR alpha require for activation PDGF-AB concentrations that were nearly 100-fold greater than for cells that do express PDGFR alpha. These results suggest that neither PDGF-AA nor PDGF-AB are likely to be physiologically significant activators of cells unless the cells express PDGFR alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1484932403,"The D-R cell subline, an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells, shows a growth advantage at low osmolality due to its high putrescine content. We tested the ability of spermidine to fulfill the role of putrescine under hyposmotic conditions. Although spermidine (1-30 microM) had no effect on growth under normosmotic conditions (325 mosm/kg), it was strongly inhibitory to D-R cell proliferation at 150 mosm/kg in a concentration-dependent manner. Hypotonic shock greatly increased the rate of spermidine uptake in D-R cells. The increased spermidine content enhanced total putrescine synthesis through a large induction of cytosolic spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity but also promoted the excretion of most of the putrescine synthesized by the cells. Delaying the addition of spermidine until 24 h after hypotonic shock resulted in a much sharper decrease in D-R cell viability and strongly depressed polyamine contents. These lethal effects occurred between 8 and 24 h after spermidine addition and followed a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of spermidine accumulation which overrode the metabolic capacity of the N1-acetyltransferase/polyamine oxidase (PAO) pathway. Inhibition of PAO partly reversed the effect of spermidine on growth when the polyamine was added at the time of hypotonic shock, but not 24 h later. Similar experiments performed with alpha-methylspermidine, a metabolically resistant analog, which can completely fulfill cellular requirements for spermidine in normosmotic media, suggested that the lethal effect of a delayed spermidine addition is caused predominantly by excessive accumulation with a minor contribution resulting from stress due to polyamine oxidase activity. In contrast, in hypotonically shocked L1210 cells, spermidine stimulated cell proliferation (albeit less effectively than putrescine), there was no lethal effect of a delayed addition of alpha-methylspermidine, and there was no time-dependent increase in the rate of alpha-methylspermidine uptake. Thus, the spermidine transport system is strongly enhanced by hyposmotic shock in D-R cells, which can result in extensive cell death from overaccumulation of the polyamine and, to a lesser extent, from stress related to the PAO-catalyzed degradation of N1-acetylspermidine. The absence of these effects in parental L1210 cells indicates that the acquisition of an ornithine decarboxylase-overproducing phenotype also involves major modifications in the expression and/or regulation of polyamine transport."
https://openalex.org/W1485550032,"The region of transcriptional activity in the rat luteinizing hormone receptor gene was localized to the 5'-flanking 173-base pair (bp) sequence in transfected mouse Leydig tumor cells and non-expressing Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) and HeLa cells. Repression of activity in all cell types was induced by at least two domains located between -174 and -990 bp. An additional inhibitory region between -1237 and -2056 bp observed only in CHO and HeLa cells may contribute to the absence of receptor expression in these cells. Analysis of the 173-bp region revealed a promoter domain between -1 and -137 bp containing no TATA or CAAT boxes, but with three SP1 sites and three initiator elements located at transcriptional start sites -14, -19, and -33. Gel retardation studies showed a protein-binding DNA domain about 30 bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites and an adjacent domain containing an SP1 element that are required for maximal activity in all cell types and may play a role in basal transcription. A second promoter domain (-120 to -173 bp) with a protein-binding SP1 element had minor activity in Leydig cells but was prominent in CHO and HeLa cells. Leydig cell-specific DNA-binding protein(s) for each of the promoter domains were detected and may be of importance in transcriptional regulation. The control of gene transcription by differential activation of these promoter domains could be involved in hormone-induced regulation of luteinizing hormone receptor expression in the gonads."
https://openalex.org/W1536139652,"The SecA protein is a major component of the cellular machinery that mediates the translocation of proteins across the Escherichia coli plasma membrane. The secA gene from Bacillus subtilis was cloned and expressed in E. coli under the control of the lac or trc promoter. The temperature-sensitive growth and secretion defects of various E. coli secA mutants were complemented by the B. subtilis SecA protein, provided the protein was expressed at moderate levels. Under overproduction conditions, no complementation was observed. One of the main features of the SecA protein is the translocation ATPase activity which, together with the protonmotive force, drives the movement of proteins across the plasma membrane. A putative ATP-binding motif can be identified in the SecA protein resembling the consensus Walker A type motif. Replacement of a lysine residue at position 106, which corresponds to an invariable amino acid residue, in the consensus motif by asparagine (K106N) resulted in the loss of the ability of the B. subtilis SecA protein to complement the growth and secretion defects of E. coli secA mutants. In addition, the presence of the K106N SecA protein interfered with protein translocation, most likely at an ATP-requiring step. We conclude that lysine 106 is part of the catalytic ATP-binding site of the B. subtilis SecA protein, which is required for protein translocation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1649595076,"Abstract A novel type of ATP-diphosphohydrolase (ATPDase) is demonstrated in bovine lung. The enzyme has an optimum pH of 7.5 and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the beta- and gamma-phosphate residues from diphospho- and triphosphonucleosides. It requires Ca2+ or Mg2+ and is insensitive to ouabain, an inhibitor of Na+/K(+)-ATPase, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5')-pentaphosphate, an inhibitor of adenylate kinase, and tetramisole, an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase. In contrast, sodium azide (10 mM), a known inhibitor of ATPDases and mitochondrial ATPases, as well as mercuric chloride (10 microM) and gossypol (2,2'-bis[8-formyl-1,6,7-trihydroxy-5-isopropyl-3-methylnaphthalene]) (35 microM) are powerful inhibitors of this enzyme. The same inhibition profile is obtained with ATP or ADP as substrate, thereby supporting the concept of a common catalytic site for these substrates. This is further confirmed by enzyme localization after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and by kinetic properties, namely pH dependence profiles, heat inactivation, and 60Co irradiation-inactivation curves. The native molecular mass of the enzyme calculated from 60Co gamma-irradiation-inactivation curves is estimated at 70 +/- 3 kDa, whereas Km,app and Vmax,app of the ATPDase are evaluated at 7 +/- 2 microM and 1.1 +/- 0.3 mumol of Pi/min/mg protein, respectively. A comparison of the kinetic properties of this ATPDase with those of pig pancreas (Type I) and bovine aorta (Type II) lead us to believe that this enzyme is an hitherto undescribed type of ATPDase. By reference to the previously described ATPDase, we propose to identify this enzyme as ATPDase Type III (EC 3.6.1.5)."
https://openalex.org/W1524291039,"The environment of the retinylidene Schiff base in bovine rhodopsin has been studied by movement of its carboxylic acid counterion from position 113 to position 117 by site-specific mutagenesis. Replacement of the counterion at position 113 by a neutral amino acid residue has been shown to produce a lowering of the Schiff base acidity constant (pKa) from > 8.5 to about 6. The aim of the present work was to change the position of the counterion without causing a significant effect on the Schiff base pKa. A triple replacement mutant (Glu113-->Ala/Ala117-->Glu/Glu122-->Gln) was designed to move the position of the counterion by one helix turn in the third putative transmembrane helix (helix C). The mutant bound 11-cis-retinal to form a chromophore with a visible absorbance maximum (lambda max) of 490 nm which was independent of pH in the range of about 5-8.5. Upon illumination under conditions in which rhodopsin was converted to the active metarhodopsin II (MII) photoproduct, the mutant was converted to a metarhodopsin I (MI)-like species (lambda max = 475 nm). Furthermore, the effect of pH on the photobleaching behavior of the mutant was the reverse of that reported for rhodopsin. In the mutant, acidic pH favored the formation of the MI-like photoproduct, and basic pH favored the formation of an MII-like photoproduct (lambda max = 380 nm). The MII-like photoproduct of the mutant pigment was able to activate the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, transducin. We conclude that the Schiff base counterion in rhodopsin can be repositioned to form a pigment with an apparently unperturbed Schiff base pKa. Furthermore, a specific amino acid residue that acts as a Schiff base proton acceptor is not strictly required for photoconversion of rhodopsin to its active MII form."
https://openalex.org/W1518604423,"Recombinant human fibroblast pro-MMP-3 (prostromelysin-1) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and the zymogen from cultured human dermal fibroblasts have been purified by monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity chromatography, and the role of Ca2+ in proenzyme activation and thermostability of the low mass catalytic domain of MMP-3 has been investigated. In the presence of high Ca2+ (5.0 mM), the organomercurial aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) initiated the stepwise removal of both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains from both recombinant and dermal fibroblast proenzymes, resulting in the generation of a heterogeneous family of nonglycosylated low mass truncated active enzyme species beginning at Phe83. However, in the presence of low Ca2+ (0.1 mM), incubation of recombinant pro-MMP-3 with or without APMA did not result in formation of either the high or low mass forms of active MMP-3 but resulted in complete autolysis of both enzyme species. The concentration of Ca2+ required for optimal pro-MMP-3 activation and stability of the low mass catalytic domain was 2.0 mM. The low mass truncated enzyme species containing the catalytic domain were remarkably heat-stable (90 min at 60 degrees C) in high Ca2+ (5.0 mM) but rapidly autolyzed when heated at 60 degrees C in low Ca2+ (0.1 mM). The thermostability properties of MMP-3 appeared to be specific for Ca2+, since no other divalent metal ions tested were able to confer thermostability to the low mass catalytic domain of MMP-3. From homology to the thermostable bacterial metalloprotease, thermolysin, two putative Ca2+ binding sites were found in the catalytic domain of MMP-3 and several other members of the MMP gene family. These putative Ca2+ binding sites are postulated to play an important role in stabilizing active MMP-3 and other members of the matrix metalloprotease gene family by protecting them against autolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1551654387,"Previous studies have shown that the presence of potentially charged amino acid residues within the transmembrane domains of type I integral membrane proteins can result in protein retention and, in some cases, degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An apparent exception to this observation is the CD3-epsilon chain of the T-cell antigen receptor complex, which is relatively stable in spite of having a transmembrane aspartic acid residue. A chimeric protein (T epsilon T) made by replacing the transmembrane domain of the Tac antigen with that of CD3-epsilon was normally transported to the cell surface, indicating that the transmembrane domain of CD3-epsilon was essentially unable to confer the phenotype of ER retention and degradation to another protein. Progressive shortening of the T epsilon T transmembrane domain, however, resulted in increasing retention and degradation of the mutant proteins in the ER. Conversely, a mutant Tac protein containing a single aspartic acid residue in its transmembrane domain was found to be retained and degraded in the ER, but when the transmembrane domain was lengthened, ER retention and degradation of the protein were abrogated. The aspartic acid residue in the transmembrane domain of all of these mutant proteins could mediate assembly with another protein having an arginine residue in its transmembrane domain, independent of the length of the transmembrane sequence. These findings demonstrate that the length of the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence has a critical influence on the ability of potentially charged transmembrane residues to cause protein retention and degradation in the ER."

Defined particles were isolated from ultracentrifugally prepared HDL by immunoaffinity and gel-filtration chromatography. The isolated 88-A LpAI, 106-A LpAI, 96-A LpAI/AII particles (LpAI, particles contain only apoA-I; LpAI/AII, particles contain apoA-I and apoA-II), together with a 93-A reconstituted HDL were analyzed for purity, composition, and content of apolipoprotein molecules per particle, and were examined by far and near circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopic methods, as well as by reaction kinetics with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. The spectroscopic analyses indicated that the secondary structures and three-dimensional arrangements of apoA-I in all these particles are remarkably similar: their tryptophan residues are located in similar nonpolar environments and become exposed to increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride in comparable denaturation steps; the 60-65% alpha-helical structures in apoA-I are denatured in similar patterns with 0-5 M denaturant concentrations. However, increasing surface lipid contents and the presence of apoA-II stabilize apoA-I on the HDL particles. The reaction kinetics with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase are similar and slow for the isolated HDL particles, reflecting product inhibition, and/or an apoA-I conformation that is unfavorable for the activation of the lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1480833604,"Prothymosin alpha is a widely distributed polypeptide whose function, though unknown, seems to be related to cell proliferation. In vitro, it is a substrate for casein kinase-2. In this work, extracts of mitogenically stimulated murine splenic lymphocytes labeled with [32P] orthophosphate were found to contain [32P]prothymosin alpha. Phosphorylation activity was highly dependent on mitogenic activation with concanavalin A plus interleukin-2. While cells remained viable, phosphorylation increased with stimulation time in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. Structural analysis showed that prothymosin alpha was phosphorylated at Thr residues located among its first 14 amino acids, whereas its in vitro phosphorylation by casein kinase-2 affects both Ser and Thr residues in this fragment, apparently in similar proportions. Thus, casein kinase-2 seems not to be responsible for the phosphorylation of prothymosin alpha in vivo. Prothymosin alpha was also found to be phosphorylated in proliferating murine thymocytes and HeLa cells; the phosphorylation sites were the same as in splenic lymphocytes, but the rate of phosphorylation was about 5 times lower. In thymocytes and subconfluent HeLa cells, the [32P]prothymosin alpha concentrations of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were similar; in splenic lymphocytes, [32P]prothymosin alpha was found mostly in cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1492958342,"We describe the characterization of an antitumor drug resistance following multiple step selection of hamster cells to the 2,4-diaminopyrimidines (DAP) metoprine, pyrimethamine (Pyr), and trimethoprim (Tmp). Pyr and Tmp are DAP lipophilic antifolates currently used as antiparasitic and antibacterial antibiotics, respectively. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from hamster cells bore a low or poor affinity to these DAP as compared to the hydrophilic folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX). Metoprine-resistant cells over-expressed DHFR enzyme and consequently displayed a high level of resistance to both hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates including DAP but maintained wild type sensitivity to pleiotropic drugs involved in multi-drug resistance (MDR). In contrast, although Pyr- and Tmp-resistant cells expressed parental levels of wild type DHFR, they displayed a high degree of resistance to DAP and, surprisingly, to the lipophilic MTX analogs piritrexim (PTX) and trimetrexate (TMTX), while maintaining sensitivity to MTX. These drug-resistant cells maintained wild type mRNA levels of the MDR gene product P-glycoprotein and showed collateral hypersensitivity to pleiotropic drugs. To study the underlying mechanism of this apparently new resistance phenotype, we have employed fluorescein-methotrexate (F-MTX) labeling of cells and its displacement by different antifolates. Parental AA8 and Pyr-resistant cells showed a similar level of F-MTX labeling, however, while DAP, TMTX, and PTX showed an efficient competitive displacement of F-MTX from AA8 cells, Pyr-resistant cells displayed a persistent retention of F-MTX labeling in the presence of high concentrations of these lipophilic antifolates. Pyr-resistant cells showed a wild type displacement of F-MTX with MTX. This DAP resistance phenotype was unstable as it was rapidly lost upon growth under nonselective conditions. Furthermore, when the antifolate resistance levels of Pyr-resistant cells were plotted versus the ratios of the 50% F-MTX displacement values obtained with resistant and parental AA8 cells, a good correlation (r2 > 0.98) was obtained. We conclude that Pyr-resistant cells possess a novel phenotype that derives its resistance to lipophilic antifolates solely from a predominant decrease in the accumulation of DAP and lipid-soluble analogs of MTX."
https://openalex.org/W1607867599,"We investigated whether apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins could bind to the insoluble complexes of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) induced by Ca2+. Lp(a), but not low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), or high density lipoprotein3 (HDL3) formed insoluble complexes at physiologic Ca2+ concentrations. Desialylation of Lp(a) dramatically decreased the ability of Lp(a) to aggregate, suggesting that sialic acids on Lp(a) were responsible for forming Ca2+ cross-bridges. Since a reduction of only 30% of the sialic acids on Lp(a) inhibited Ca(2+)-induced complex formation, it appears that only a small percentage of sialic acids on Lp(a) is involved in Ca(2+)-induced cross-bridging of Lp(a) particles. To determine whether other lipoproteins would complex to Lp(a) in the insoluble complexes, we mixed Lp(a) with LDL, VLDL, or HDL3 in the presence of Ca2+. Although both LDL and VLDL bound to the Lp(a) in the insoluble complexes, HDL3 not only did not bind, but it also prevented Lp(a) from forming insoluble complexes. LDL bound to Lp(a) in the insoluble complexes in a concentration-dependent manner, eventually reaching saturation at a molar ratio of 5:4 (LDL to Lp(a)). The interaction between LDL and Lp(a) appeared to be ionic, since increases in the positive charge on LDL by desialylation increased this interaction, whereas decreases in positive charge on LDL reduced this interaction. At higher Ca2+ concentrations, the binding of acetyl LDL to Lp(a) in the insoluble complexes was greater than that of LDL. Since more Ca2+ was required for concentration-dependent saturation of acetyl LDL binding, it is likely that Ca2+ cross-bridging was responsible for this binding. Thus, LDL, especially its modified forms, could contribute to the formation of insoluble complex of Lp(a) with Ca2+ in atherosclerotic lesions and help explain its preferential accumulation there."
https://openalex.org/W1515725861,"Abstract Carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) purified from rat liver microsomes has K0.5 values between 1.0 and 4.0 microM for saturated 6-carbon to 16-carbon length acyl-CoAs, with little differences in Vmax values. The reaction rate is linear with time in the forward direction (acyl-CoA-->acylcarnitine), but it increases with time when assayed in the reverse direction (acylcarnitine-->acyl-CoA). The K0.5 for decanoylcarnitine and CoASH are 0.3 mM for CoASH and between 1.0 and 4.0 mM for decanoylcarnitine. The kinetic data indicate that the enzyme functions in the direction of acyl-carnitine formation. It is moderately inhibited by aminocarnitine, and D-carnitine and etomoxiryl-CoA are weak inhibitors; malonyl-CoA does not inhibit the enzyme. The enzyme has little, if any, capacity to use valproylcarnitine, 3-methylglutarylcarnitine, or pivaloylcarnitine as a substrate. Polyclonal antibodies prepared against COT give a positive Western blot against the purified enzyme and against a protein in microsomes having the molecular mass of COT (53 kDA). Antimitochondrial CPT and antiperoxisomal CAT did not show appreciable cross-reactivity with purified microsomal COT. The inhibitor data, the kinetic data, the molecular masses, and the Western blotting profiles all show that the enzyme purified from rat liver microsomes is a different carnitine acyltransferase than those previously purified from other organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1543715223,"Abstract Mutational and structural analysis of the 28 viable bacteriophage M13 mutants obtained by randomized mutagenesis of the effective transmembrane (TM) segment of the 50-residue major coat (gene VIII) protein (residues 21-39) demonstrated that M13 coat protein functionality, as reflected by phage viability, is incompatible with an increase in Gly + beta-branched residue content in its TM core. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism spectroscopy performed in membrane environments on purified mutant coat proteins revealed that these proteins exist in a range of state(s), identified as helical monomers and dimers and polymeric (alpha-helical and/or beta-sheet) species, of which relative populations, and thermally induced conformational transitions, were dependent uniquely upon mutation type and locus. Mutations to relatively polar residues (e.g. G23D, Y24D, Y24H, A27E, I32T, and T36S) stabilized principally monomeric species, while mutants with decreased beta-branched content in the protein TM hydrophobic core (e.g. V29A, V30A, V31A, V31L, and V33A) displayed mainly dimeric species. Mutation of Ile37-->Thr within a Sternberg-Gullick consensus sequence of the coat protein TM segment led to a highly oligomerized/polymerized protein. The overall results suggest that TM residues in M13 coat protein are not universal components of a hydrophobic anchor segment per se, but are further selected (i) to impart conformational flexibility to the TM segment through helix destabilization and (ii) to retain the capacity to regulate protein-protein association and packing motifs within membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1608119170,"A yeast protein was purified from wild type Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) to near homogeneity using an ethanolamine affinity chromatography procedure.

(1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 3174-3184) The first methionine residue encoded by the translation starting codon was not present in the mature protein which is designated as DDRP 48. DDRP 48 was found to be a negatively charged and highly hydrophilic glycoprotein. The glycosidase cleavage analyses suggested that DDRP 48 was mainly N-link-glycosylated. The apparent molecular mass of DDRP 48 was estimated to be approximately 65 kilodaltons. DDRP 48 was found able to hydrolyze ATP and GTP yielding PPi. The Km values for ATP and GTP are 0.29 mM and 0.58 mM, respectively. The Western blot analysis demonstrated that DDRP 48 was expressed to various concentrations in different S. cerevisiae strains. Increased DDRP 48 abundance was observed after yeast cells carrying the wild type RAD 52 gene were exposed to either ethylmethane sulfonate or heat shock treatments. After similar DNA-damaging treatments, however, no significant inductions of DDRP 48 were found in a rad 52 mutant strain. These observations are consistent with the predictions resulting from previous studies on transcriptional regulation of the DDR 48 gene (Maga, J.A., McClanahan, T.A., and McEntee, K.

(Colombo, M.F., Rau, D.C., and Parsegian, V.A. (1992) Science 256, 655-659) to a stabilization of the deoxy-T quaternary state of hemoglobin A, via a reduction of the activity coefficient of water. This was correlated to crystallographic results which showed that a significant surface area at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface, which is exposed to the solvent in the oxy-R state, is buried in the deoxy-T state. We show that sucrose has no effect on the oxygen affinity of trout hemoglobin I, which is cooperative in oxygen binding but lacks heterotropic effects, and that in spite of the large buried surface exposed to solvent upon dissociation of human hemoglobin into alpha beta dimers, sucrose leads either to an increased dissociation of hemoglobin A-CO into dimers or to no effect at all (in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate).

The mutant was too unstable to purify; however, we were able to stabilize and store it at 4 degrees C in cell lysates containing 1-4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of this mutant in the lysate was determined by titration with the tight-binding inhibitor ethoxzolamide. The stability in this preparation was sufficient to determine that this mutant of carbonic anhydrase II has kcat/Km and apparent pKa for the hydration of CO2 equivalent to that of wild-type HCA II. The maximum velocity of CO2 hydration, which is dependent on the rate of proton transfer between enzyme and solution, was 3-fold smaller than for HCA II suggesting that the proton transfer pathway in the mutant is slightly less efficient than in wild type. Preliminary conformational energy calculations show that the replacement of His107 with the larger residue Tyr results in considerable distortion of the cavity surrounding site 107 and in the loss of at least two hydrogen bonds."

Using a combination of sequence analysis and mass spectrometry it could be demonstrated that His-28 in protein L3 and the N-terminal amino acids Met-1, His-2, and His-3 in protein L19 are involved in forming the cross-link L3-L19. Within the pair L23-L29 Met-1 in protein L23 and Lys-4 in protein L29 were identified as cross-linking sites employing a similar approach. Comparison of our data with results derived from other cross-linking experiments showed that in general the structural organization of the ribosomes in eubacteria (the Gram-positive B. stearothermophilus and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli) has been conserved to quite an extent during evolution but that the fine structures differ slightly. By mass spectrometry the specificity of diepoxybutane and its cleaving mechanism using sodium periodate could be examined.

DNA hybridization experiments using the cloned S. cerevisiae AMP deaminase gene failed to hybridize to the genomic DNA from S. pombe strain 972h-s. Protein extracts from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae were analyzed in parallel and exhibited comparable AMP deaminase activities. Analysis of reaction intermediates in cell extracts of S. pombe established that IMP is formed directly from AMP without intervening steps. The AMP deaminase of S. pombe was purified 1,100-fold to a specific catalytic activity of 67 mumol/min/mg of protein. Purified protein interacted weakly with polyclonal antibodies prepared against S. cerevisiae AMP deaminase. AMP deaminases from both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe were activated by ATP with micromolar activation constants, are inhibited by coformycin, and are specific for AMP when compared to other purine nucleosides and nucleotides. The results establish that S. pombe contains an AMP deaminase with catalytic properties similar to that from S. cerevisiae, even though the DNA sequences of the genes and the immunoreactivity of the protein from S. pombe differs considerably from the AMP deaminase of S. cerevisiae. Genetic analysis of the pathways of purine metabolism in S. pombe (Pourquie, J., and Heslot, H. (1971) Genet. Res. 18, 33-44) had indicated the absence of AMP deaminase.
