https://openalex.org/W2774883395,"The excision of introns from pre-mRNA is an essential step in mRNA processing. We developed LeafCutter to study sample and population variation in intron splicing. LeafCutter identifies variable splicing events from short-read RNA-seq data and finds events of high complexity. Our approach obviates the need for transcript annotations and circumvents the challenges in estimating relative isoform or exon usage in complex splicing events. LeafCutter can be used both to detect differential splicing between sample groups and to map splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs). Compared with contemporary methods, our approach identified 1.4–2.1 times more sQTLs, many of which helped us ascribe molecular effects to disease-associated variants. Transcriptome-wide associations between LeafCutter intron quantifications and 40 complex traits increased the number of associated disease genes at a 5% false discovery rate by an average of 2.1-fold compared with that detected through the use of gene expression levels alone. LeafCutter is fast, scalable, easy to use, and available online. LeafCutter is a new tool that identifies variable intron splicing events from RNA-seq data for analysis of complex alternative splicing. The method does not require transcript annotation and can be used to map splicing quantitative trait loci."

However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity of these responses across the full range of cortical cell types, and how these changes contribute to neuronal plasticity and disease, is lacking. To investigate the breadth of transcriptional changes that occur across cell types in the mouse visual cortex after exposure to light, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified significant and divergent transcriptional responses to stimulation in each of the 30 cell types characterized, thus revealing 611 stimulus-responsive genes. Excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibited inter- and intralaminar heterogeneity in the induction of stimulus-responsive genes. Non-neuronal cells showed clear transcriptional responses that may regulate experience-dependent changes in neurovascular coupling and myelination. Together, these results reveal the dynamic landscape of the stimulus-dependent transcriptional changes occurring across cell types in the visual cortex; these changes are probably critical for cortical function and may be sites of deregulation in developmental brain disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2949644565,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and cells derived from them, have become key tools for modeling biological processes, particularly in cell types that are difficult to obtain from living donors. Here we present a map of regulatory variants in iPSC-derived neurons, based on 123 differentiations of iPSCs to a sensory neuronal fate. Gene expression was more variable across cultures than in primary dorsal root ganglion, particularly for genes related to nervous system development. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that the number of neuronal versus contaminating cells was influenced by iPSC culture conditions before differentiation. Despite high differentiation-induced variability, our allele-specific method detected thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influenced gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and RNA splicing. On the basis of these detected QTLs, we estimate that recall-by-genotype studies that use iPSC-derived cells will require cells from at least 20–80 individuals to detect the effects of regulatory variants with moderately large effect sizes. This study identifies regulatory variants in sensory neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite differentiation-induced variability, an allele-specific method allowed detection of loci influencing gene expression, chromatin accessibility and RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2773210706,"During myelination, individual oligodendrocytes initially over-produce short myelin sheaths, which are either retracted or stabilized. By live-imaging oligodendrocyte Ca2+ activity in vivo, we find that high-amplitude, long-duration Ca2+ transients in sheaths prefigure retractions, mediated by calpain. Following stabilization, myelin sheaths grow along axons, and we find that higher-frequency Ca2+ transient activity in sheaths precedes faster elongation. Our data implicate local Ca2+ signaling in regulating distinct stages of myelination. The authors live-image zebrafish myelin sheath Ca2+ activity in vivo and find that high-amplitude long-duration Ca2+ transients precede calpain-dependent sheath retractions while frequent low-amplitude short-duration transients drive sheath growth."
https://openalex.org/W2771532739,"How action potentials regulate myelination by oligodendrocytes is uncertain. We show that neuronal activity raises [Ca2+]i in developing oligodendrocytes in vivo and that myelin sheath elongation is promoted by a high frequency of [Ca2+]i transients and prevented by [Ca2+]i buffering. Sheath elongation occurs ~1 h after [Ca2+]i elevation. Sheath shortening is associated with a low frequency of [Ca2+]i transients but with longer duration [Ca2+]i bursts. Thus, [Ca2+]i controls myelin sheath development."
https://openalex.org/W2774010248,"Ribosomes are abundant cellular machines 1,2 that are regulated by assembly, supernumerary subunit turnover and nascent chain quality control mechanisms 1-5 . Moreover, nitrogen starvation in yeast has been reported to promote selective ribosome delivery to the vacuole in an autophagy conjugation system dependent manner, a process called 'ribophagy' 6,7 . However, whether ribophagy in mammals is selective or regulated is unclear. Using Ribo-Keima flux reporters, we find that starvation or mTOR inhibition promotes VPS34-dependent ribophagic flux, which, unlike yeast, is largely independent of ATG8 conjugation and occurs concomitantly with other cytosolic protein autophagic flux reporters 8,9 . Ribophagic flux was not induced upon inhibition of translational elongation or nascent chain uncoupling, but was induced in a comparatively selective manner under proteotoxic stress induced by arsenite 10 or chromosome mis-segregation 11 , dependent upon VPS34 and ATG8 conjugation. Unexpectedly, agents typically used to induce selective autophagy also promoted increased ribosome and cytosolic protein reporter flux, suggesting significant bulk or 'bystander' autophagy during what is often considered selective autophagy 12,13 . These results emphasize the importance of monitoring non-specific cargo flux when assessing selective autophagy pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2775089136,"The synaptic vesicle (SV) protein synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) is the Ca2+ sensor for fast synchronous release. Biochemical and structural data suggest that Syt1 interacts with phospholipids and SNARE complex, but the manner in which these interactions translate into SV fusion remains poorly understood. Using flash-and-freeze electron microscopy, which triggers action potentials with light and coordinately arrests synaptic structures with rapid freezing, we found that synchronous-release-impairing mutations in the Syt1 C2B domain (K325, 327; R398, 399) also disrupt SV-active-zone plasma-membrane attachment. Single action potential induction rescued membrane attachment in these mutants within less than 10 ms through activation of the Syt1 Ca2+-binding site. The rapid SV membrane translocation temporarily correlates with resynchronization of release and paired pulse facilitation. On the basis of these findings, we redefine the role of Syt1 as part of the Ca2+-dependent vesicle translocation machinery and propose that Syt1 enables fast neurotransmitter release by means of its dynamic membrane attachment activities."
https://openalex.org/W2774672285,"Path integration (PI) is a highly conserved, self-motion-based navigation strategy. Since the discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, neurophysiological data and computational models have suggested that these neurons serve PI. However, more direct empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis has been missing due to a lack of selective manipulations of grid cell activity and suitable behavioral assessments. Here we report that selective disruption of grid cell activity in mice can be achieved by removing NMDA glutamate receptors from the retro-hippocampal region and that disrupted grid cell firing accounts for impaired PI performance. Notably, the genetic manipulation did not affect the activity of other spatially selective cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. By directly linking grid cell activity to PI, these results contribute to a better understanding of how grid cells support navigation and spatial memory."

https://openalex.org/W2775715128,"Accumulating evidence support a causal link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during gestation and congenital microcephaly. However, the mechanism of ZIKV-associated microcephaly remains unclear. We combined analyses of ZIKV-infected human fetuses, cultured human neural stem cells and mouse embryos to understand how ZIKV induces microcephaly. We show that ZIKV triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response in the cerebral cortex of infected postmortem human fetuses as well as in cultured human neural stem cells. After intracerebral and intraplacental inoculation of ZIKV in mouse embryos, we show that it triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress in embryonic brains in vivo. This perturbs a physiological unfolded protein response within cortical progenitors that controls neurogenesis. Thus, ZIKV-infected progenitors generate fewer projection neurons that eventually settle in the cerebral cortex, whereupon sustained endoplasmic reticulum stress leads to apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that administration of pharmacological inhibitors of unfolded protein response counteracts these pathophysiological mechanisms and prevents microcephaly in ZIKV-infected mouse embryos. Such defects are specific to ZIKV, as they are not observed upon intraplacental injection of other related flaviviruses in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2774694784,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) at glutamatergic synapses are intensively investigated processes for understanding the synaptic basis for learning and memory, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We have made three mouse lines where the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of endogenous AMPA receptors (AMPARs), the principal mediators of fast excitatory synaptic transmission, are specifically exchanged. These mice display profound deficits in synaptic plasticity without any effects on basal synaptic transmission. Our study reveals that the CTDs of GluA1 and GluA2, the key subunits of AMPARs, are necessary and sufficient to drive NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and LTD, respectively. In addition, these domains exert differential effects on spatial and contextual learning and memory. These results establish dominant roles of AMPARs in governing bidirectional synaptic and behavioral plasticity in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2773767974,"Delay discounting (DD), the tendency to discount the value of delayed versus current rewards, is elevated in a constellation of diseases and behavioral conditions. We performed a genome-wide association study of DD using 23,127 research participants of European ancestry. The most significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs6528024 (P = 2.40 × 10−8), which is located in an intron of the gene GPM6B. We also showed that 12% of the variance in DD was accounted for by genotype and that the genetic signature of DD overlapped with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, smoking, personality, cognition and body weight. A genome-wide association study of delay discounting (DD) on 23,127 subjects found that genotype accounted for 12% of variance in DD; the DD genetic signature overlapped with ADHD, schizophrenia, depression, smoking, personality, cognition and weight."
https://openalex.org/W2773188027,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a stress-activated signalling pathway that regulates cell proliferation, metabolism and survival. The circadian clock coordinates metabolism and signal transduction with light/dark cycles. We explore how UPR signalling interfaces with the circadian clock. UPR activation induces a 10 h phase shift in circadian oscillations through induction of miR-211, a PERK-inducible microRNA that transiently suppresses both Bmal1 and Clock, core circadian regulators. Molecular investigation reveals that miR-211 directly regulates Bmal1 and Clock via distinct mechanisms. Suppression of Bmal1 and Clock has the anticipated impact on expression of select circadian genes, but we also find that repression of Bmal1 is essential for UPR-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis and cell adaptation to stresses that disrupt endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Our data demonstrate that c-Myc-dependent activation of the UPR inhibits Bmal1 in Burkitt's lymphoma, thereby suppressing both circadian oscillation and ongoing protein synthesis to facilitate tumour progression."

https://openalex.org/W2771305340,"Acute pancreatitis is a complex disorder involving both premature intracellular protease activation and inflammatory cell invasion. An initiating event is the intracellular activation of trypsinogen by cathepsin B (CTSB), which can be induced directly via G protein–coupled receptors on acinar cells or through inflammatory cells. Here, we studied CTSB regulation by another lysosomal hydrolase, cathepsin D (CTSD), using mice with a complete (CTSD−/−) or pancreas-specific conditional CTSD knockout (KO) (CTSDf/f/p48Cre/+). We induced acute pancreatitis by repeated caerulein injections and isolated acinar and bone marrow cells for ex vivo studies. Supramaximal caerulein stimulation induced subcellular redistribution of CTSD from the lysosomal to the zymogen-containing subcellular compartment of acinar cells and activation of CTSD, CTSB, and trypsinogen. Of note, the CTSD KO greatly reduced CTSB and trypsinogen activation in acinar cells, and CTSD directly activated CTSB but not trypsinogen in vitro. During pancreatitis in pancreas-specific CTSDf/f/p48Cre/+ animals, markers of severity were reduced only at 1 h, whereas in the complete KO, this effect also included the late disease phase (8 h), indicating an important effect of extra-acinar CTSD on course of the disease. CTSD−/− leukocytes exhibited reduced cytokine release after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and CTSD KO also reduced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in acinar cells stimulated with the intestinal hormone cholecystokinin. In summary, CTSD is expressed in pancreatic acinar and inflammatory cells, undergoes subcellular redistribution and activation during experimental pancreatitis, and regulates disease severity by potently activating CTSB. Its impact is only minimal and transient in the early, acinar cell–dependent phase of pancreatitis and much greater in the later, inflammatory cell–dependent phase of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2771795903,"Exercise training reduces renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, decreases plasma and tissue oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertension. However, the temporal nature of these phenomena in response to exercise is unknown. We sought to determine in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched WKY controls the weekly effects of training on blood pressure (BP), plasma and left ventricle (LV) Ang II and Ang-(1–7) content (HPLC), LV oxidative stress (DHE staining), gene and protein expression (qPCR and WB) of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antioxidant enzymes and their consequence on hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. SHR and WKY were submitted to aerobic training (T) or maintained sedentary (S) for 8 weeks; measurements were made at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8. Hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy was accompanied by acute plasma Ang II increase with amplified responses during the late phase of LV hypertrophy. Similar pattern was observed for oxidative stress markers, TNF alpha and interleukin-1β, associated with cardiomyocytes’ diameter enlargement and collagen deposition. SHR-T exhibited prompt and marked decrease in LV Ang II content (T1 vs T4 in WKY-T), normalized oxidative stress (T2), augmented antioxidant defense (T4) and reduced both collagen deposition and inflammatory profile (T8), without changing cardiomyocytes’ diameter and LV hypertrophy. These changes were accompanied by decreased plasma Ang II content (T2-T4) and reduced BP (T8). SHR-T and WKY-T showed parallel increases in LV and plasma Ang-(1–7) content. Our data indicate that early training-induced downregulation of LV ACE-AngII-AT1 receptor axis is a crucial mechanism to reduce oxidative/pro-inflammatory profile and improve antioxidant defense in SHR-T, showing in addition this effect precedes plasma RAS deactivation."

However, BamE, but not BamD, was cell-surface–displayed under native conditions; however, in the absence of BamE, BamD indeed becomes surface-exposed.

The solved structures of Neisseria BamD and BamE share overall folds with Escherichia coli proteins but contain differences that may be important for function.

https://openalex.org/W2773801708,"The bacterial flagellar motor is a self-assembling supramolecular nanodevice. Its spontaneous biosynthesis is initiated by the insertion of the MS ring protein FliF into the inner membrane, followed by attachment of the switch protein FliG. Assembly of this multiprotein complex is tightly regulated to avoid nonspecific aggregation, but the molecular mechanisms governing flagellar assembly are unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of FliF complexed with the N-terminal domain of FliG (FliFC–FliGN) from the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Within this complex, FliFC interacted with FliGN through extensive hydrophobic contacts similar to those observed in the FliFC–FliGN structure from the thermophile Thermotoga maritima, indicating conservation of the FliFC–FliGN interaction across bacterial species. Analysis of the crystal lattice revealed that the heterodimeric complex packs as a linear superhelix via stacking of the armadillo repeat–like motifs (ARM) of FliGN. Notably, this linear helix was similar to that observed for the assembly of the FliG middle domain. We validated the in vivo relevance of the FliGN stacking by complementation studies in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, structural comparison with apo FliG from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus indicated that FliF regulates the conformational transition of FliG and exposes the complementary ARM-like motifs of FliGN, containing conserved hydrophobic residues. FliF apparently both provides a template for FliG polymerization and spatiotemporally controls subunit interactions within FliG. Our findings reveal that a small protein fold can serve as a versatile building block to assemble into a multiprotein machinery of distinct shapes for specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W2775345774,"The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgeries is known to induce pathological changes in vital organs such as lungs. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a protective strategy that has shown to be able to reduce tissue damage related to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The current study seeks to evaluate the beneficial effects of limb RIPC on lung tissues and function in a rat CPB model. RIPC, which consisted of three cycles of 5-min ischemia and subsequently 5-min reperfusion, was induced in the hind limbs of the animals via a tourniquet. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analysis and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that limb RIPC could significantly attenuate CPB-induced pulmonary injury, as evidenced by a combination of lower total BAL protein content, less severe alveolar wall thickening and reduced intra-alveolar neutrophil infiltration. Consistently, RIPC was also found to improve the proliferation capacity of the bronchioalveolar stem cells isolated from the lung tissues in rats subjected to surgical procedure with CPB. These beneficial effects translated into significantly improved lung function. Further investigation suggested that RIPC could up-regulate the serum levels of several anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 and 10, which might play a role in its pulmonoprotective effects. Taken together, the current study provided convincing evidence that limb RIPC could be a useful strategy for minimizing CPB-induced organ injuries in patients undergoing CPB surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2775801202,"Objectives Nalbuphine is as effective as morphine as a perioperative analgesic but has not been compared directly with sufentanil in clinical trials. The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy and safety of nalbuphine with that of sufentanil in patients undergoing colonoscopy and to determine the optimal doses of nalbuphine in this indication. Methods Two hundred and forty consecutive eligible patients aged 18–65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification of I–II and scheduled for colonoscopy were randomly allocated to receive sufentanil 0.1 μg/kg (group S), nalbuphine 0.1 mg/kg (group N1), nalbuphine 0.15 mg/kg (group N2), or nalbuphine 0.2 mg/kg (group N3). Baseline vital signs were recorded before the procedure. The four groups were monitored for propofol sedation using the bispectral index, and pain relief was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale and the modified Behavioral Pain Scale for non-intubated patients. The incidences of respiratory depression during endoscopy, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and abdominal distention were recorded in the post anesthesia care unit and in the first and second 24-hour periods after colonoscopy. Results There was no significant difference in analgesia between the sufentanil group and the nalbuphine groups (p>0.05). Respiratory depression was significantly more common in group S than in groups N1 and N2 (p<0.05). The incidence of nausea was significantly higher in the nalbuphine groups than in the sufentanil group in the first 24 hours after colonoscopy (p<0.05). Conclusions Nalbuphine can be considered as a reasonable alternative to sufentanil in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Doses in the range of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg are recommended. The decreased risks of respiratory depression and apnea make nalbuphine suitable for patients with respiratory problems."

In this paper, based on experimental tests and numerical simulation (PFC2D), the macro-mechanical behavior and energy mechanism of jointed rock-like specimens with cross non-persistent joints under uniaxial loading were investigated. The focus was to study the effect of joint dip angle α and intersection angle γ on the characteristic stress, the coalescence modes and the energy release of jointed rock-like specimens. For specimens with γ = 30° and 45°, the UCS (uniaxial compression strength), CIS (crack initiation stress) and CDiS (critical dilatancy stress) increase as α increases from 0° to 75°. When γ = 60° and 75°, the UCS, CIS and CDiS increase as α increases from 0° to 60° and decrease when α is over 60°. Both the inclination angle α and intersection angle γ have great influence on the failure pattern of pre-cracked specimens. With different α and γ, specimens exhibit 4 kinds of failure patterns. Both the experimental and numerical results show that the energy of a specimen has similar trends with characteristic stress as α increases."

The second aim was to test WBC diagnostic indices with respect to the presence of MIAC and/or IAI.Four hundred and seventy-nine women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM, between February 2012 and June 2017, were included in this study. Maternal blood and amniotic fluid samples were collected at the time of admission. Maternal WBC count was assessed. Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration was measured using a point-of-care test, and IAI was characterized by an IL-6 concentration of ≥ 745 pg/mL. MIAC was diagnosed based on a positive polymerase chain reaction result for the Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma hominis, and/or Chlamydia trachomatis and/or for the 16S rRNA gene.Women with MIAC or IAI had higher WBC counts than those without (with MIAC: median, 12.8 × 109/L vs. without MIAC: median, 11.9 × 109/L; p = 0.0006; with IAI: median, 13.7 × 109/L vs. without IAI: median, 11.9 × 109/L; p < 0.0001). When the women were divided into four subgroups based on the presence of MIAC and/or IAI, the women with both MIAC and IAI had a higher WBC count than those with either IAI or MIAC alone, and those without MIAC and IAI [both MIAC and IAI: median, 14.0 × 109/L; IAI alone: 12.1 × 109/L (p = 0.03); MIAC alone: 12.1 × 109/L (p = 0.0001); and without MIAC and IAI: median, 11.8 × 109/L (p < 0.0001)]. No differences in the WBC counts were found among the women with IAI alone, MIAC alone, and without MIAC and IAI.The women with both MIAC and IAI had a higher maternal WBC count at the time of hospital admission than the remaining women with PPROM. The maternal WBC count at the time of admission showed poor diagnostic indices for the identification of the presence of both MIAC and IAI. Maternal WBC count at the time of admission cannot serve as a non-invasive screening tool for identifying these complications in women with PPROM."
https://openalex.org/W2774553873,"Most affinity-maturation campaigns for antibodies and T-cell receptors (TCRs) operate on the residues at the binding site, located within the loops known as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Accordingly, mutations in contact residues, or so-called “second shell” residues, that increase affinity are typically identified by directed evolution involving combinatorial libraries. To determine the impact of residues located at a distance from the binding site, here we used single-codon libraries of both CDR and non-CDR residues to generate a deep mutational scan of a human TCR against the cancer antigen MART-1·HLA-A2. Non-CDR residues included those at the interface of the TCR variable domains (Vα and Vβ) and surface-exposed framework residues. Mutational analyses showed that both Vα/Vβ interface and CDR residues were important in maintaining binding to MART-1·HLA-A2, probably due to either structural requirements for proper Vα/Vβ association or direct contact with the ligand. More surprisingly, many Vα/Vβ interface substitutions yielded improved binding to MART-1·HLA-A2. To further explore this finding, we constructed interface libraries and selected them for improved stability or affinity. Among the variants identified, one conservative substitution (F45βY) was most prevalent. Further analysis of F45βY showed that it enhanced thermostability and increased affinity by 60-fold. Thus, introducing a single hydroxyl group at the Vα/Vβ interface, at a significant distance from the TCR·peptide·MHC-binding site, remarkably affected ligand binding.

https://openalex.org/W2775236901,"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a well-established marker for diagnosis and follow up of patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NEN). Recently, it has been shown that plasma levels of CgA correlate with tumor load and predict survival of patients with NEN of the small bowel. It is assumed that this is as well valid for NEN of the colon and rectum, however, this is not supported by data. To evaluate this assumption, we analyzed 62 patients with NEN of the colon and rectum listed in the Marburg GEP-NEN registry for clinicopathological characteristics, expression and plasma levels of CgA. The present study demonstrates that immunohistochemical CgA and synaptophysin are good markers for histological diagnosis in patients with NEN of the colon and rectum. However, plasma CgA is a poor marker to follow-up these patients because only a minority exhibited increased levels which did not increase significantly during tumor progression. In contrast to NEN of the small bowel, there is no correlation of CgA plasma levels with tumor burden or survival. Patients with NEN of the colon and rectum displayed a relatively good prognosis resulting in a median survival of 8.5 years. However, a subset of patients affected by G3 neoplasms, exhibited a poorer prognosis with a median survival of 2.5 years. Taken together, CgA is a valuable marker for immunohistochemical diagnosis, but CgA plasma concentration is not suitable to mirror tumor burden or prognosis in patients with NEN of the colon and rectum."
https://openalex.org/W2773988456,"Hardwater lakes are common in human-dominated regions of the world and often experience pollution due to agricultural and urban effluent inputs of inorganic and organic nitrogen (N). Although these lakes are landscape hotspots for CO2 exchange and food web carbon (C) cycling, the effect of N enrichment on hardwater lake food web functioning and C cycling patterns remains unclear. Specifically, it is unknown if different eutrophication scenarios (e.g., modest non point vs. extreme point sources) yield consistent effects on auto- and heterotrophic C cycling, or how biotic responses interact with the inorganic C system to shape responses of air-water CO2 exchange. To address this uncertainty, we induced large metabolic gradients in the plankton community of a hypereutrophic hardwater Canadian prairie lake by adding N as urea (the most widely applied agricultural fertilizer) at loading rates of 0, 1, 3, 8 or 18 mg N L-1 week-1 to 3240-L, in-situ mesocosms. Over three separate 21-day experiments, all treatments of N dramatically increased phytoplankton biomass and gross primary production (GPP) two- to six-fold, but the effects of N on autotrophs plateaued at ~3 mg N L-1. Conversely, heterotrophic metabolism increased linearly with N fertilization over the full treatment range. In nearly all cases, N enhanced net planktonic uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and increased the rate of CO2 influx, while planktonic heterotrophy and CO2 production only occurred in the highest N treatments late in each experiment, and even in these cases, enclosures continued to in-gas CO2. Chemical effects on CO2 through calcite precipitation were also observed, but similarly did not change the direction of net CO2 flux. Taken together, these results demonstrate that atmospheric exchange of CO2 in eutrophic hardwater lakes remains sensitive to increasing N loading and eutrophication, and that even modest levels of N pollution are capable of enhancing autotrophy and CO2 in-gassing in P-rich lake ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2952205942,Betweenness has been used in a number of marine studies to identify portions of sea that sustain the connectivity of whole marine networks. Herein we highlight the need of methodological exactness in the calculation of betweenness when graph theory is applied to marine connectivity studies based on transfer probabilities. We show the inconsistency in calculating betweeness directly from transfer probabilities and propose a new metric for the node-to-node distance that solves it. Our argumentation is illustrated by both simple theoretical examples and the analysis of a literature data set.
https://openalex.org/W2772735550,"Culture-based detection is still considered as the standard way for detection of Salmonella in foods, although molecular methods, such as viability PCR (vPCR), have been introduced to overcome some disadvantages of traditional culture methods. Despite the success of the vPCR methodology, the problem of false-positive results is a major drawback, especially when applied to environmental samples, hindering the interpretation of the results. To improve the efficiency of vPCR, many approaches have been introduced by several authors during the last years. In the present work, the combination of PEMAX dye, double tube change, and double photo-activation step was established as a strategy to improve vPCR protocol. By combining these approaches, we developed an improved sample treatment protocol able to neutralize DNA signals of up to 5.0×107 dead cells/sample from both pure culture and artificially contaminated food samples. Our results indicate that vPCR can work reliable and has a potential for high throughput detection of live Salmonella cells in food samples, minimizing false-positive signals."
https://openalex.org/W2772681266,"Efforts to taxonomically delineate species are often confounded with conflicting information and subjective interpretation. Advances in genomic methods have resulted in a new approach to taxonomic identification that stands to greatly reduce much of this conflict. This approach is ideal for species complexes, where divergence times are recent (evolutionarily) and lineages less well defined. The California Roach/Hitch fish species complex is an excellent example, experiencing a convoluted geologic history, diverse habitats, conflicting species designations and potential admixture between species. Here we use this fish complex to illustrate how genomics can be used to better clarify and assign taxonomic categories. We performed restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing on 255 Roach and Hitch samples collected throughout California to discover and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Data were then used in hierarchical principal component, admixture, and FST analyses to provide results that consistently resolved a number of ambiguities and provided novel insights across a range of taxonomic levels. At the highest level, our results show that the CA Roach/Hitch complex should be considered five species split into two genera (4 + 1) as opposed to two species from distinct genera (1 +1). Subsequent levels revealed multiple subspecies and distinct population segments within identified species. At the lowest level, our results indicate Roach from a large coastal river are not native but instead introduced from a nearby river. Overall, this study provides a clear demonstration of the power of genomic methods for informing taxonomy and serves as a model for future studies wishing to decipher difficult species questions. By allowing for systematic identification across multiple scales, taxonomic structure can then be tied to historical and contemporary ecological, geographic or anthropogenic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2774190553,"Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have been introduced throughout Europe, mostly unintentionally, and little attention has been given to their potential for natural reproduction. We investigated the presence of young-of-the-year bighead carp in an irrigation canal network of Northern Italy and the environmental conditions associated with spawning in 2011–2015. The adult bighead carp population of the canal network was composed by large, likely mature, individuals with an average density of 45.2 kg/ha (over 10 fold more than in the main river). The 29 juvenile bighead carp found were 7.4–13.1 cm long (TL) and weighed 9.5–12.7 g. Using otolith-derived spawning dates we estimated that these juveniles were 94–100 days old, placing their fertilization and hatch dates in mid-to-end-June. Using this information in combination with thermal and hydraulic data, we examined the validity of existing models predicting the onset of spawning conditions and the viability of egg pathways to elucidate spawning location of the species. While evidence of reproduction was not found every year, we determined that potentially viable spawning conditions (annual degree-days and temperature thresholds) and pathways of egg drift suitable for hatching are present in short, slow-flowing canals."
https://openalex.org/W2774379062,"The EGFR-specific mAb cetuximab is one of the most effective treatments for oropharyngeal carcinoma, while patient responses to EGFR inhibitors given alone are modest. Combination treatment with radiation can improve the efficacy of treatment through increasing radiosensitivity, while resistance to radiation after administration of cetuximab limits its efficiency. Radiation and drugs can damage the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostatic state and result in ER stress (ERS), subsequently causing resistance to radiation and drugs. Whether the ERS pathway is involved in radioresistance after administration of cetuximab has not been reported. Herein, we show that cetuximab could increase the radiosensitivity of FaDu cells but not Detroit562 cells. In addition, cetuximab inhibited the radiation-induced activation of the ERS signalling pathway IRE1α/ATF6-GRP78 in FaDu cells, while this effect was absent in Detroit562 cells. Silencing GRP78 increased the radiosensitivity of oropharyngeal carcinoma cells and inhibited radiation-induced DNA double-strand-break (DSB) repair and autophagy. More interestingly, silencing GRP78 abrogated resistance to cetuximab and radiation in Detroit562 cells and had a synergistic effect with cetuximab in increasing the radiosensitivity of FaDu cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that overexpression of both GRP78 and EGFR was associated with a poor prognosis in oropharyngeal carcinoma patients (P<0.05). Overall, the results of this study show that radioresistance after EGFR inhibition by cetuximab is mediated by the ERS signalling pathway IRE1α/ATF6-GRP78. This suppression was consequently unable to inhibit radiation-induced DSB repair and autophagy in oropharyngeal carcinoma cells, which conferred resistance to radiotherapy and cetuximab. These results suggest that the cooperative effects of radiotherapy and cetuximab could be further improved by inhibiting GRP78 in non-responsive oropharyngeal carcinoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2774063894,"Chagas disease is a complex vector borne parasitic disease involving blood feeding Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) insects, also known as kissing bugs, and the vertebrates they feed on. This disease has tremendous impacts on millions of people and is a global health problem. The etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), is deposited on the mammalian host in the insect’s feces during a blood meal, and enters the host’s blood stream through mucous membranes or a break in the skin. Identifying the blood meal sources of triatomine vectors is critical in understanding Chagas disease transmission dynamics, can lead to identification of other vertebrates important in the transmission cycle, and aids management decisions. The latter is particularly important as there is little in the way of effective therapeutics for Chagas disease. Several techniques, mostly DNA-based, are available for blood meal identification. However, further methods are needed, particularly when sample conditions lead to low-quality DNA or to assess the risk of human cross-contamination. We demonstrate a proteomics-based approach, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify host-specific hemoglobin peptides for blood meal identification in mouse blood control samples and apply LC-MS/MS for the first time to Triatoma dimidiata insect vectors, tracing blood sources to species. In contrast to most proteins, hemoglobin, stabilized by iron, is incredibly stable even being preserved through geologic time. We compared blood stored with and without an anticoagulant and examined field-collected insect specimens stored in suboptimal conditions such as at room temperature for long periods of time. To our knowledge, this is the first study using LC-MS/MS on field-collected arthropod disease vectors to identify blood meal composition, and where blood meal identification was confirmed with more traditional DNA-based methods. We also demonstrate the potential of synthetic peptide standards to estimate relative amounts of hemoglobin acquired when insects feed on multiple blood sources. These LC-MS/MS methods can contribute to developing Ecohealth control strategies for Chagas disease transmission and can be applied to other arthropod disease vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2774409303,"Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services (BES) has been viewed as an appropriate approach to identifying conservation priorities. Taking Xishuangbanna tropical region in Southwest China, different BESs (habitat quality [used as a proxy for biodiversity], carbon storage, and water yield) were quantified using the InVEST model and conservation hotspots from 1976, 1990, and 2010 were identified by overlapping and ranking the service layers. Results showed that BESs areas were unevenly distributed. High habitat quality and carbon storage areas located in the eastern part of the region were mainly occupied by broad-leaved forest, while high water yield areas were covered by grassland and tropical forests. Recognized hotspots were primarily composed of the broad-leaved forest and shrub grassland. However, these habitat types declined by nearly 50% from 1.25×105 ha to 0.63×105 ha and became more fragmented during the study period. We also found that the sub-watersheds which decreased in BES had fewer hotspots distributed and suffered greater landscape fragmentation. Our study further explored the impacts of land-use conversion on BES, and illustrated the necessity and feasibility of BESs in identifying potential conservation areas."
https://openalex.org/W2772488217,"Purpose Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated renal angiomyolipoma (AML) have a high lifetime risk of acute bleeding. MTOR-inhibitors are a promising novel treatment for TSC-AML, however adequate response to therapy can be difficult to assess. Early changes in MRI signal may serve as a novel early indicator for a satisfactory response to mTOR-inhibitor therapy of AML. Materials and methods Thirty-eight patients with the definite diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis receiving everolimus therapy and n = 19 patients without specific therapy were included. 1.5 Tesla MRI was performed including sequences with a selective fat suppression. Patients were investigated prior to the initiation of therapy (baseline) and after <3 months (n = 21 patients), 3 to 6 months (n = 32) and 18 to 24 months (n = 28). Signal and size changes of renal AMLs were assessed at all different timepoints. Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) and size of angiomyolipomas were evaluated. Results Signal changes in 273 AMLs were evaluated. A significant and strong decrease of the CNR of AMLs following the initiation of therapy was measured in the fat-suppressed MR sequence at all time points, compared to the baseline: From 7.41±6.98 to 3.84±6.25 (p ≤ 0.05p = 0.002), 3.36±6.93 (p<0.0001), and 2.50±6.68 (p<0.0001) after less than 3 months, 3–6 months or 18–24 months of everolimus treatment, respectively. Also, a significant, however less pronounced, reduction of angiomyolipoma size in the different groups was measured (from baseline 2022.2±2657.7 mm2 to 1854.4±1670.9 mm2 (p = 0.009), 1875.5±3190.1 mm2 (p<0.001), and 1365.8 ± 1628.8 mm2 (p<0.0001) after less than 3 months, 3–6 months or 18–24 months of everolimus treatment, respectively). No significant changes in CNR (p>0.05) and size (p>0.05) were measured in the control group. Conclusion mTOR inhibitor therapy in TSC patients results in an early and pronounced fatty transformation of AMLs on MRI. Fatty transformation could represent a novel early indicator of response to therapy in this patient collective."
https://openalex.org/W2774170926,"A cross-sectional epidemiological study in the extreme-west of the state of Paraná was carried out to access the prevalence, distribution, and risk variables of canine Visceral Leishmaniases (cVL). This study was conducted in three areas, two cities of far west of Parana state: Foz do Iguaçu (FI) and Santa Terezinha de Itaipu (STI), and along two transects between these two municipalities. To sample the entire urban area, the cities (FI and STI) were divided into a grid of squares of 400 m2 (patch). Among the 526 patches, 123 in FI, 40 in the transects and 33 in STI were selected according to the ‘worst scenario’ criterion. In the transect areas, in each 0.86 km five dogs from houses were surveyed to leishmaniasis. In each patch, blood of five dogs from houses (and from neighborhood when necessary) in the areas that seemed to be the most appropriate for the proliferation of vector were surveyed. The infection of the dogs by cVL were assessed using two serological tests were used (cELISA and TR-DPP®), and, for those seropositive for both methods, the PCR method were used. Moreover, dogs presenting clinical signs or cutaneous lesions were sampled to PCR. The identification of Leishmania species was confirmed using PCR-RFLP followed by DNA sequencing. Micro, meso and macro scale environmental variables were also surveyed and statistically analyzed. The prevalence rate Leishmania infantum was 23.8% in FI, 4.7% in STI and 9.1% in the transects areas. Among the extrinsic variables analysed, the number of vectors and the presence of infected dogs in neighbouring were positively correlated with the occurrence of infected dogs. Dog size was positively correlated with cVL infection, while the quality of the dog’s nutrition affected cVL negatively. As for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), the first registry of dogs infected with L. braziliensis in the region shows that there is potential for transmission in peri-urban areas, since environmental conditions allow the proliferation of vectors capable of transmitting this species of parasite. cVL is widely spread in FI, with high prevalence. This supports the hypothesis that the parasite has been present in the region for longer than previously believed, despite the fact that the presence of leishmaniais in the region has only been recognized recently. It is important to control the population of dogs infected with L. infantum (parasite and non-antibodies) to prevent the spread of the disease to other dogs and also to people in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2772100474,"Charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) is a well-accepted method to model effects of sex hormones in cell cultures. We have recently shown that human endothelial cells (ECs) fail to growth and to undergo in vitro angiogenesis when cultured in CSS. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the CSS-induced impairment of in vitro EC properties are still unknown. In addition, whether there is any sexual dimorphism in the CSS-induced EC phenotype remains to be determined. Here, by independently studying human male and female ECs, we found that CSS inhibited both male and female EC growth and in vitro angiogenesis, with a more pronounced effect on male EC sprouting. Reconstitution of CSS with 17-β estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, or the lipophilic thyroid hormone did not restore EC functions in both sexes. On the contrary, supplementation with palmitic acid or the acetyl-CoA precursor acetate significantly rescued the CSS-induced inhibition of growth and sprouting in both male and female ECs. We can conclude that the loss of metabolic precursors (e.g., fatty acids) rather than of hormones is involved in the impairment of in vitro proliferative and angiogenic properties of male and female ECs cultured with CSS."
https://openalex.org/W2774456709,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine, metabolic and heterogeneous disorder in women of reproductive age, the exact etiology of which remains unknown. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the hyperandrogenic phenotype of PCOS, prenatally androgenized (PNA) mice were used to mimic this phenotype in women with PCOS. Using microarray analysis, 1188 differentially expressed genes, including 671 upregulated and 517 downregulated genes, were identified in ovaries from PNA mice. Five differentially expressed genes (Aldh1a7, Bhmt, Mtr, Nrcam, Ptprg) were validated, and decreased MTR expression was shown in ovaries of PNA mice. In addition, results from qRT-PCR showed decreased MTR expression in granulosa cells (GCs) from women with the hyperandrogenic phenotype of PCOS. Serum levels of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), the downstream product of MTR, were also decreased in PNA mice and women with the hyperandrogenic phenotype of PCOS. Our study provides evidence that the hyperandrogenic phenotype of PCOS is linked to abnormal folate one-carbon metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2771639763,"During deep space missions, astronauts will be exposed to low doses of charged particle irradiation. The long-term health effects of these exposures are largely unknown. We previously showed that low doses of oxygen ion (16O) irradiation induced acute damage to the hematopoietic system, including hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells in a mouse model. However, the chronic effects of low dose 16O irradiation remain undefined. In the current study, we investigated the long-term effects of low dose 16O irradiation on the mouse hematopoietic system. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0.05 Gy, 0.1 Gy, 0.25 Gy and 1.0 Gy whole body 16O (600 MeV/n) irradiation. The effects of 16O irradiation on bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were examined three months after the exposure. The results showed that the frequencies and numbers of BM HPCs and HSCs were significantly reduced in 0.1 Gy, 0.25 Gy and 1.0 Gy irradiated mice compared to 0.05 Gy irradiated and non-irradiated mice. Exposure of mice to low dose 16O irradiation also significantly reduced the clongenic function of BM HPCs determined by the colony-forming unit assay. The functional defect of irradiated HSCs was detected by cobblestone area-forming cell assay after exposure of mice to 0.1 Gy, 0.25 Gy and 1.0 Gy of 16O irradiation, while it was not seen at three months after 0.5 Gy and 1.0 Gy of γ-ray irradiation. These adverse effects of 16O irradiation on HSCs coincided with an increased intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, there were comparable levels of cellular apoptosis and DNA damage between irradiated and non-irradiated HPCs and HSCs. These data suggest that exposure to low doses of 16O irradiation induces long-term hematopoietic injury, primarily via increased ROS production in HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2775315461,"Oxidative stress has been associated with diverse diseases, including obesity, cancer and neurodegeneration. In fact, Valeriana jatamansi Jones (valerian) and its extracts possess strong antioxidant activities that extend their application in clinical practice to the treatment of these illnesses, even though the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Iridoid valepotriate, a characteristic iridoid ester in valerian with poor chemical stability, possesses considerable antioxidant components. The original compounds and their degradation products have been found to exhibit strong antioxidant activities. However, the relationship between their structure and antioxidant effects and the mechanism underlying their oxidation resistance remain unclear. A forced degradation study using three iridoid valepotriates (valtrate, acevaltrate and 1-β acevaltrate) was performed in this work, and the structures of their degradation products were estimated by TLC-MS and LC-MS. Comparison of the antioxidant activities of the iridoid valepotriates before and after forced degradation revealed that degradation reduced the activities of the iridoid valepotriates in free radical scavenging and cytotoxic and cell apoptosis tests. The results suggested that the oxirane nucleus is important for defining the antioxidant profile of iridoid valepotriate. We uncovered possible mechanisms that could explain the antioxidant activities, including the generation of two hydroxyl groups through intramolecular transfer of an H• from an oxirane ring and a reduction in ROS levels through interactions with GABAergic signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2773002348,"Numerous groups have documented that Ascorbic Acid (AA) promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation from both mouse and human ESCs and iPSCs. AA is now considered indispensable for the routine production of hPSC-cardiomyocytes (CMs) using defined media; however, the mechanisms involved with the inductive process are poorly understood. Using a genetically modified mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line containing a dsRED transgene driven by the cardiac-restricted portion of the ncx1 promoter, we show that AA promoted differentiation of mESCs to CMs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treatment of mPSCs with AA did not modulate total SMAD content; however, the phosphorylated/active forms of SMAD2 and SMAD1/5/8 were significantly elevated. Co-administration of the SMAD2/3 activator Activin A with AA had no significant effect, but the addition of the nodal co-receptor TDGF1 (Cripto) antagonized AA’s cardiomyogenic-promoting ability. AA could also reverse some of the inhibitory effects on cardiomyogenesis of ALK/SMAD2 inhibition by SB431542, a TGFβ pathway inhibitor. Treatment with BMP2 and AA strongly amplified the positive cardiomyogenic effects of SMAD1/5/8 in a dose-dependent manner. AA could not, however, rescue dorsomorphin-mediated inhibition of ALK/SMAD1 activity. Using an inducible model system, we found that SMAD1, but not SMAD2, was essential for AA to promote the formation of TNNT2+-CMs. These data firmly demonstrate that BMP receptor-activated SMADs, preferential to TGFβ receptor-activated SMADs, are necessary to promote AA stimulated cardiomyogenesis. AA-enhanced cardiomyogenesis thus relies on the ability of AA to modulate the ratio of SMAD signaling among the TGFβ-superfamily receptor signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2773120214,"Cardiac hypertrophy is recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiac failure. Efficient management of hypertensive heart disease requires identification of factors that can possibly mediate the transition from hypertrophy to failure. Resident cardiac stem cells have a prominent role in the maintenance of cardiac tissue homeostasis. Decline in the proportion of healthy cardiac stem cells (CSCs) can affect tissue regeneration. In pathological conditions, apart from natural aging, an adverse microenvironment can lead to decrease in efficiency of CSCs. A systematic analysis of cardiac stem cell characteristics in pathological conditions has not been reported so far. Therefore, this study was designed with the objective of examining the age associated variation in stem cell attributes of Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) in comparison with normotensive Wistar rat. Spontaneously hypertensive rat was used as the experimental model since the cardiac remodeling resembles the clinical course of hypertensive heart disease. CSCs were isolated from atrial explants. Stem cell attributes were assessed in 1-week, 6, 12 and 18-month-old male SHR, in comparison with age matched Wistar rats. In 1-week-old pups, stem cell attributes of SHR and Wistar were comparable. Migration potential, proliferative capacity, TERT expression, telomerase activity and the proportion of c-kit+ cells decreased with age, both in SHR and Wistar. DNA damage and the proportion of senescent CSCs increased with age both in SHR and Wistar rats. Age associated increase was observed in the oxidative stress of stem cells, possibly mediated by the enhanced oxidative stress in the microenvironment. The changes were more pronounced in SHR, and as early as six months of age, there was significant decrease in efficiency of CSCs of SHR compared to Wistar. The density of healthy CSCs determined as a fraction of the differentiated cells was remarkably low in 18-month-old SHR. Age associated decrease in functionally efficient CSCs was therefore accelerated in SHR. Considering the vital role of CSCs in the maintenance of a healthy myocardium, decrease in functionally efficient CSCs can be a precipitating factor in pathological cardiac remodeling. Elevated ROS levels in CSCs of SHR lends scope for speculation that decrease in efficiency of CSCs is mediated by oxidative stress; and that modulation of the microenvironment by therapeutic interventions can restore a healthy stem cell population and facilitate maintenance of cardiac homeostasis and prevent cardiac decompensation."
https://openalex.org/W2771541207,"Background A recent comprehensive report on healthcare quality in Italy published by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommended that regular monitoring of quality of primary care by means of compliance with standards of care for chronic diseases is performed. A previous ecological study demonstrated that compliance with standards of care could be reliably estimated on regional level using administrative databases. This study compares estimates based on administrative data with estimates based on GP records for the same persons, to understand whether ecological fallacy played a role in the results of the previous study. Methods We compared estimates of compliance with diagnostic and therapeutic standards of care for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) from administrative data (IAD) with estimates from medical records (MR) for the same persons registered with 24 GP’s in 2012. Data were linked at an individual level. Results 32,688 persons entered the study, 12,673 having at least one of the three diseases according to at least one data source. Patients not detected by IAD were many, for all three conditions: adding MR increased the number of cases of T2DM, hypertension, and IHD by +40%, +42%, and +104%, respectively. IAD had imperfect sensitivity in detecting population compliance with therapies (adding MR increased the estimate, from +11.5% for statins to +14.7% for antithrombotics), and, more substantially, with diagnostic recommendations (adding MR increased the estimate, from +23.7% in glycated hemoglobin tests, to +50.5% in electrocardiogram). Patients not detected by IAD were less compliant with respect to those that IAD correctly identified (from -4.8 percentage points in proportion of IHD patients compliant with a yearly glycated hemoglobin test, to -40.1 points in the proportion of T2DM patients compliant with the same recommendation). IAD overestimated indicators of compliance with therapeutic standards (significant differences ranged from 3.3. to 3.6 percentage points) and underestimated indicators of compliance with diagnostic standards (significant differences ranged from -2.3 to -14.1 percentage points). Conclusion IAD overestimated the percentage of patients compliant with therapeutic standards by less than 6 percentage points, and underestimated the percentage of patients compliant with diagnostic standards by a maximum of 14 percentage points. Therefore, both discussions at local level between GP's and local health unit managers and discussions at central level between national and regional policy makers can be informed by indicators of compliance estimated by IAD, which, based on those results, have the ability of signalling critical or excellent clusters. However, this study found that estimates are partly flawed, because a high number of patients with chronic diseases are not detected by IAD, patients detected are not representative of the whole population of patients, and some categories of diagnostic tests are markedly underrecorded in IAD (up to 50% in the case of electrocardiograms). Those results call to caution when interpreting IAD estimates. Audits based on medical records, on the local level, and an interpretation taking into account information external to IAD, on the central level, are needed to assess a more comprehensive compliance with standards."

Recalculating the published structures of protein-carbohydrate complexes and glycosylated proteins demonstrates that the results are comparable to the published structures which employed more complex procedures for structure calculation. Integrating the new carbohydrate parameters into the standard structure calculation protocol will facilitate three-dimensional structural study of carbohydrates and glycosylated proteins by NMR spectroscopy."

We previously reported four new interacting partners of human ADA3 identified by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library using yeast two hybrid technology. One of these partners was Apoptosis-Antagonizing Transcription Factor (AATF), also known as Che-1, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein with a number of roles in different cellular processes including regulation of transcription, cell proliferation, cell cycle control, DNA damage responses and apoptosis. Che-1/AATF is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatments. In this study, we aimed to identify whether besides ADA3, other components of the HAT modules of SAGA and ATAC complexes, human ADA2 and GCN5 also interact with Che-1/AATF. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments were used to demonstrate association of AATF both with two ADA2 isoforms, ADA2A and ADA2B and with GCN5 proteins in human cells and yeast two-hybrid assays to delineate domains in the ADA2 and GCN5 proteins required for these interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2773300655,"To evaluate the overall robustness of a novel cellular irradiator we performed a series of well-characterized, dose-responsive assays to assess the consequences of DNA damage. We used a previously described novel irradiation system and a traditional 137Cs source to irradiate a cell line. The generation of reactive oxygen species was assessed using chloromethyl-H2DCFDA dye, the induction of DNA DSBs was observed using the comet assay, and the initiation of DNA break repair was assessed through γH2AX image cytometry. A high correlation between physical absorbed dose and biologic dose was seen for the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, physical DNA double strand breaks, and modulation of the cellular double stand break pathway. The results compared favorably to irradiation with a traditional 137Cs source. The rapid, straightforward tests described form a reasonable approach for biologic characterization of novel irradiators. These additional testing metrics go beyond standard physics testing such as Monte Carlo simulation and thermo-luminescent dosimeter evaluation to confirm that a novel irradiator can produce the desired dose effects in vitro. Further, assessment of these biological metrics confirms that the physical handling of the cells during the irradiation process results in biologic effects that scale appropriately with dose."

The anti-fibrotic effect of ZYC-1 was also confirmed by Sirius Red staining. Finally, we identified 42 differentially expressed proteins by using proteomics analysis after ZYC-1 treatment, of which 17 were up-regulated and 25 were down-regulated. These Most of the 42 proteins are involved in the oxidative stress pathway, the mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway and the amino acid metabolism pathway.

Chipmunks host zoonotic pathogens including Yersinia pestis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, relapsing fever (RF) Borrelia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia species. Chipmunk species are often not differentiated by public health workers, yet different species utilize different ecological niches and may have intrinsically different capacities for maintaining vector-borne pathogens and infecting vectors. We surveyed over 700 individuals from nine species of chipmunks throughout California for exposure to and infection by Y. pestis, A. phagocytophilum, RF Borrelia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and SFG Rickettsia species. DNA of all five pathogens was found and all chipmunks except Merriam's chipmunk (T. merriami) were PCR-positive for at least one of the pathogens. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was most common (40.0%, 2/5) in Sonoma chipmunks (T. sonomae) from Marin county and B. burgdorferi most common (37.5%, 27/72) in redwood chipmunks (T. ochrogenys) from Mendocino county. RF Borrelia spp. was detected in 2% (6/297) of redwood chipmunks in Mendocino county and 10% (1/10) of both least (T. minimus) and lodgepole (T. speciosus) chipmunks in the western Sierra. Exposure to SFG Rickettsia spp. was found in the Northern Coastal region (Del Norte, Humboldt and Mendocino counties) and in the northern and western Sierra in several species of chipmunks. Y. pestis infection was found only in the western Sierra-in a yellow-pine (T. amoenus) and a long-eared (T. quadrimaculatus) chipmunk. Though more data are needed to thoroughly understand the roles that different chipmunk species play in disease transmission, our findings suggest that some chipmunk species may be more important to the maintenance of vector-borne diseases than others within each geographic area."
https://openalex.org/W2774444485,"The Rajah Brooke's Birdwing, Trogonoptera brookiana, is a large, iconic butterfly that is facing heavy commercial exploitation and habitat loss. Males of some subspecies exhibit puddling behavior. A method of conservation monitoring was developed for subspecies albescens in Ulu Geroh, Peninsular Malaysia, where the males consistently puddle in single-species aggregations at stable geothermal springs, reaching well over 300 individuals when the population is at its highest. Digital photography was used to conduct counts of numbers of males puddling. The numbers of birdwings puddling were significantly correlated with counts of birdwings in flight, but were much higher. The numbers puddling during the peak hour were correlated with numbers puddling throughout the day and could be predicted using the numbers puddling at an alternative hour, enabling flexibility in the time of counts. Average counts for three images taken at each puddle at three peak hours between 1400-1600 hours over 2-3 days were used as a monthly population index. The numbers puddling were positively associated with higher relative humidity and brightness during monitoring hours. Monthly counts of birdwings from monitoring of puddles over a period of two years are presented. The minimum effort required for a monitoring program using counts of puddling males is discussed, as well as the potential of using the method to monitor other species of puddling butterflies."
https://openalex.org/W2773588297,"Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Increased syndecan-4 levels were previously detected after acute myocardial infarction and in subjects with heart failure. However, the levels of syndecan-4 in subjects with Chagas disease have not so far been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of serum sydencan-4 as a novel biomarker for myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in subjects with Chagas disease.This study comprised subjects with Chagas disease (n = 56), being 14 (25%) with the indeterminate form, 16 (29%) with the cardiac form without ventricular dysfunction, and 26 (46%) with the cardiac form with ventricular dysfunction.Syndecan-4 serum concentrations did not correlate with presence or absence of myocardial fibrosis (P = 0.386) nor disease severity in subjects with Chagas disease (P = 0.918). Additionally, no correlation was found either between the degree of myocardial fibrosis and serum syndecan-4 [r = 0.08; P = 0.567] or between left ventricular ejection fraction and syndecan-4 [r = 0.02; P = 0.864]. In contrast, NT-proBNP levels correlated with ejection fraction and myocardial fibrosis.Our results demonstrate the lack of correlations between serum syndecan-4, myocardial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in subjects with Chagas disease. Further studies are required to show if syndecan-4 concentrations can be marker for prognosis assessment or disease progression."
