https://openalex.org/W2155445544,"We demonstrate the successful application of exome sequencing to discover a gene for an autosomal dominant disorder, Kabuki syndrome (OMIM%147920). We subjected the exomes of ten unrelated probands to massively parallel sequencing. After filtering against existing SNP databases, there was no compelling candidate gene containing previously unknown variants in all affected individuals. Less stringent filtering criteria allowed for the presence of modest genetic heterogeneity or missing data but also identified multiple candidate genes. However, genotypic and phenotypic stratification highlighted MLL2, which encodes a Trithorax-group histone methyltransferase: seven probands had newly identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in this gene. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in two of the three remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome (cases) and in 26 of 43 additional cases. In families where parental DNA was available, the mutation was confirmed to be de novo (n = 12) or transmitted (n = 2) in concordance with phenotype. Our results strongly suggest that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2115583652,"One of the main shortcomings of cell therapy is the poor persistence and loss of functionality of donor cells after transfer. Using adjuvant drug–loaded nanoparticles conjugated directly to the surface of therapeutic donor cells, an approach designed to minimize the systemic side effects of adjuvant drugs, Matthias Stephan and his colleagues show enhanced functionality in a model of adoptive T cell therapy for cancer and of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. A major limitation of cell therapies is the rapid decline in viability and function of the transplanted cells. Here we describe a strategy to enhance cell therapy via the conjugation of adjuvant drug–loaded nanoparticles to the surfaces of therapeutic cells. With this method of providing sustained pseudoautocrine stimulation to donor cells, we elicited marked enhancements in tumor elimination in a model of adoptive T cell therapy for cancer. We also increased the in vivo repopulation rate of hematopoietic stem cell grafts with very low doses of adjuvant drugs that were ineffective when given systemically. This approach is a simple and generalizable strategy to augment cytoreagents while minimizing the systemic side effects of adjuvant drugs. In addition, these results suggest therapeutic cells are promising vectors for actively targeted drug delivery."

https://openalex.org/W2000670569,"The X-linked transcriptional repressor methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), known for its role in the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, is emerging as an important regulator of neuroplasticity in postmitotic neurons. Cocaine addiction is commonly viewed as a disorder of neuroplasticity, but the potential involvement of MeCP2 has not been explored. Here we identify a key role for MeCP2 in the dorsal striatum in the escalating cocaine intake seen in rats with extended access to the drug, a process that mimics the increasingly uncontrolled cocaine use seen in addicted humans. MeCP2 regulates cocaine intake through homeostatic interactions with microRNA-212 (miR-212) to control the effects of cocaine on striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. These data suggest that homeostatic interactions between MeCP2 and miR-212 in dorsal striatum may be important in regulating vulnerability to cocaine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2114610097,"An RNAi screen of protein phosphatases identifies PP2A–B55α as the main mitotic exit phosphatase in human cells. After mitosis, PP2A–B55α depletion delays the reassembly of the nuclear envelope and Golgi and the decondensation of chromatin. When vertebrate cells exit mitosis various cellular structures are re-organized to build functional interphase cells1. This depends on Cdk1 (cyclin dependent kinase 1) inactivation and subsequent dephosphorylation of its substrates2,3,4. Members of the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) families can dephosphorylate Cdk1 substrates in biochemical extracts during mitotic exit5,6, but how this relates to postmitotic reassembly of interphase structures in intact cells is not known. Here, we use a live-cell imaging assay and RNAi knockdown to screen a genome-wide library of protein phosphatases for mitotic exit functions in human cells. We identify a trimeric PP2A–B55α complex as a key factor in mitotic spindle breakdown and postmitotic reassembly of the nuclear envelope, Golgi apparatus and decondensed chromatin. Using a chemically induced mitotic exit assay, we find that PP2A–B55α functions downstream of Cdk1 inactivation. PP2A–B55α isolated from mitotic cells had reduced phosphatase activity towards the Cdk1 substrate, histone H1, and was hyper-phosphorylated on all subunits. Mitotic PP2A complexes co-purified with the nuclear transport factor importin-β1, and RNAi depletion of importin-β1 delayed mitotic exit synergistically with PP2A–B55α. This demonstrates that PP2A–B55α and importin-β1 cooperate in the regulation of postmitotic assembly mechanisms in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013428424,"Label-free biosensor technology based on dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) of cellular constituents promises to translate GPCR signaling into complex optical 'fingerprints' in real time in living cells. Here we present a strategy to map cellular mechanisms that define label-free responses, and we compare DMR technology with traditional second-messenger assays that are currently the state of the art in GPCR drug discovery. The holistic nature of DMR measurements enabled us to (i) probe GPCR functionality along all four G-protein signaling pathways, something presently beyond reach of most other assay platforms; (ii) dissect complex GPCR signaling patterns even in primary human cells with unprecedented accuracy; (iii) define heterotrimeric G proteins as triggers for the complex optical fingerprints; and (iv) disclose previously undetected features of GPCR behavior. Our results suggest that DMR technology will have a substantial impact on systems biology and systems pharmacology as well as for the discovery of drugs with novel mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2029130073,"Background Community structure is one of the key properties of complex networks and plays a crucial role in their topology and function. While an impressive amount of work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real networks. Methodology/Principal Findings We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical properties of communities in large information, communication, technological, biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as “fingerprints” of specific network categories. While community size distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size, but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category. Conclusions/Significance Our findings, verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection methods, allow for a classification of real networks and pave the way to a realistic modelling of networks' evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2104809074,"In mammals, synchronization of the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus is achieved through direct input from the eyes conveyed by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Circadian photoentrainment can be maintained by rod and cone photoreceptors, but their functional contributions and their retinal circuits that impinge on ipRGCs are not well understood. Using mice that lack functional rods or in which rods are the only functional photoreceptors, we found that rods were solely responsible for photoentrainment at scotopic light intensities. Rods were also capable of driving circadian photoentrainment at photopic intensities at which they were incapable of supporting a visually guided behavior. Using mice in which cone photoreceptors were ablated, we found that rods signal through cones at high light intensities, but not at low light intensities. Thus, rods use two distinct retinal circuits to drive ipRGC function to support circadian photoentrainment across a wide range of light intensities."
https://openalex.org/W1963989925,"Visual cortex shows smooth retinotopic organization on the macroscopic scale, but it is unknown how receptive fields are organized at the level of neighboring neurons. This information is crucial for discriminating among models of visual cortex. We used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to independently map ON and OFF receptive field subregions of local populations of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse visual cortex. Receptive field subregions were often precisely shared among neighboring neurons. Furthermore, large subregions seem to be assembled from multiple smaller, non-overlapping subregions of other neurons in the same local population. These experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first characterization of the diversity of receptive fields in a dense local network of visual cortex and reveal elementary units of receptive field organization. Our results suggest that a limited pool of afferent receptive fields is available to a local population of neurons and reveal new organizational principles for the neural circuitry of the mouse visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2167717539,"The authors report that MeCP2, a methyl DNA–binding transcriptional regulator, modulates the response to amphetamine in the nucleus accumbens. Using both acute viral manipulation of MeCP2 in mice and hypomorphic Mecp2 mutant mice, they find that MeCp2 both affects mesolimbocortical circuit development and regulates the responses to psychostimulants. MeCP2 is a methyl DNA–binding transcriptional regulator that contributes to the development and function of CNS synapses; however, the requirement for MeCP2 in stimulus-regulated behavioral plasticity is not fully understood. Here we show that acute viral manipulation of MeCP2 expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) bidirectionally modulates amphetamine (AMPH)-induced conditioned place preference. Mecp2 hypomorphic mutant mice have more NAc GABAergic synapses and show deficient AMPH-induced structural plasticity of NAc dendritic spines. Furthermore, these mice show deficient plasticity of striatal immediate early gene inducibility after repeated AMPH administration. Notably, psychostimulants induce phosphorylation of MeCP2 at Ser421, a site that regulates MeCP2's function as a repressor. Phosphorylation is selectively induced in GABAergic interneurons of the NAc, and its extent strongly predicts the degree of behavioral sensitization. These data reveal new roles for MeCP2 both in mesolimbocortical circuit development and in the regulation of psychostimulant-induced behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2062540888,"A major concern of cancer chemotherapy is the side effects caused by the non-specific targeting of both normal and cancerous cells by therapeutic drugs. Much emphasis has been placed on discovering new compounds that target tumour cells more efficiently and selectively with minimal toxic effects on normal cells.The cytotoxic effect of thymoquinone, a component derived from the plant Nigella sativa, was tested on human glioblastoma and normal cells. Our findings demonstrated that glioblastoma cells were more sensitive to thymoquinone-induced antiproliferative effects. Thymoquinone induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the glioblastoma cells. It was also observed that thymoquinone facilitated telomere attrition by inhibiting the activity of telomerase. In addition to these, we investigated the role of DNA-PKcs on thymoquinone mediated changes in telomere length. Telomeres in glioblastoma cells with DNA-PKcs were more sensitive to thymoquinone mediated effects as compared to those cells deficient in DNA-PKcs.Our results indicate that thymoquinone induces DNA damage, telomere attrition by inhibiting telomerase and cell death in glioblastoma cells. Telomere shortening was found to be dependent on the status of DNA-PKcs. Collectively, these data suggest that thymoquinone could be useful as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in the management for brain tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2027204881,"Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) and are highly efficacious in the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease and tumor-induced osteolysis. In addition, the potential for direct antitumor effects has been postulated on the basis of in vitro and in vivo studies and has recently been demonstrated clinically in early breast cancer patients treated with the potent bisphosphonate zoledronic acid. However, the high affinity of bisphosphonates for bone mineral seems suboptimal for the direct treatment of soft-tissue tumors. Here we report the discovery of the first potent non-bisphosphonate FPPS inhibitors. These new inhibitors bind to a previously unknown allosteric site on FPPS, which was identified by fragment-based approaches using NMR and X-ray crystallography. This allosteric and druggable pocket allows the development of a new generation of FPPS inhibitors that are optimized for direct antitumor effects in soft tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1992344689,"The SWR1 complex replaces the canonical histone H2A with the variant H2A.Z (Htz1 in yeast) at specific chromatin regions. This dynamic alteration in nucleosome structure provides a molecular mechanism to regulate transcription, gene silencing, chromosome segregation and DNA repair. Here we show that genetic instability, sensitivity to drugs impairing different cellular processes and genome-wide transcriptional misregulation in htz1Delta can be partially or totally suppressed if SWR1 is not formed (swr1Delta), if it forms but cannot bind to chromatin (swc2Delta) or if it binds to chromatin but lacks histone replacement activity (swc5Delta and the ATPase-dead swr1-K727G). These results suggest that in htz1Delta the nucleosome remodelling activity of SWR1 affects chromatin integrity because of an attempt to replace H2A with Htz1 in the absence of the latter. This would impair transcription and, either directly or indirectly, other cellular processes. Specifically, we show that in htz1Delta, the SWR1 complex causes an accumulation of recombinogenic DNA damage by a mechanism dependent on phosphorylation of H2A at Ser129, a modification that occurs in response to DNA damage, suggesting that the SWR1 complex impairs the repair of spontaneous DNA damage in htz1Delta. In addition, SWR1 causes DSBs sensitivity in htz1Delta; consistently, in the absence of Htz1 the SWR1 complex bound near an endonuclease HO-induced DSB at the mating-type (MAT) locus impairs DSB-induced checkpoint activation. Our results support a stepwise mechanism for the replacement of H2A with Htz1 and demonstrate that a tight control of this mechanism is essential to regulate chromatin dynamics but also to prevent the deleterious consequences of an incomplete nucleosome remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W1987127207,"The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly ErbB2, has an important role in the genesis of breast cancer. ErbB2 kinase activity promotes Ras-mediated stimulation of downstream protein kinase cascades, including the Ras/Raf-1/MAPK/ERK kinase (Mek)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway, leading to tumor cell growth and migration. Signaling through the Ras–Erk pathway can be influenced by p21-activated kinase-1 (Pak1), an effector of the Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42. In this study, we asked if ErbB2 expression correlates with Pak1 and Erk activity in human breast cancer specimens, and if Pak1 signaling is required for ErbB2 transformation in a three-dimensional (3D) in vitro setting and in xenografts. We found a correlation between ErbB2 expression and activation of Pak in estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumor samples and observed that in 3D cultures, activation of Rac–Pak1 pathway by ErbB2 homodimers induced growth factor-independent proliferation and promoted disruption of 3D mammary acinar-like structures through activation of the Erk and Akt pathways. Further, we found that inhibition of Pak1 by small molecules compromised activation of Erk and Akt, resulting in reversion of the malignant phenotype and restoration of normal acinar architecture. Finally, ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells expressing a specific Pak inhibitor showed delayed tumor formation and downregulation of Erk and Akt signaling in vivo. These data imply that the Rac–Pak pathway is vital to ErbB2-mediated transformation and that Pak inhibitors represent plausible drug targets in breast cancers in which ErbB2 signaling is activated."
https://openalex.org/W2073700577,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that prevent its proper folding and trafficking to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Absence of cAMP-mediated Cl(-) secretion in CF airways causes poorly hydrated airway surfaces in CF patients, and this condition is exacerbated by excessive Na(+) absorption. The mechanistic link between missing CFTR and increased Na(+) absorption in airway epithelia has remained elusive, although substantial evidence implicates hyperactivity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC). ENaC is known to be activated by selective endoproteolysis of the extracellular domains of its α- and γ-subunits, and it was recently reported that ENaC and CFTR physically associate in mammalian cells. We confirmed this interaction in oocytes by co-immunoprecipitation and found that ENaC associated with wild-type CFTR was protected from proteolytic cleavage and stimulation of open probability. In contrast, ΔF508 CFTR, the most common mutant protein in CF patients, failed to protect ENaC from proteolytic cleavage and stimulation. In normal airway epithelial cells, ENaC was contained in the anti-CFTR immunoprecipitate. In CF airway epithelial cultures, the proportion of full-length to total α-ENaC protein signal was consistently reduced compared with normal cultures. Our results identify limiting proteolytic cleavage of ENaC as a mechanism by which CFTR down-regulates Na(+) absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2171958984,"Kidney damage due to injury rarely resolves completely, and there are currently no therapies capable of promoting repair. In addition to understanding mechanisms by which tissues are damaged, illuminating mechanisms of repair and regeneration is also of great importance. Here we show that the melanoma-associated, transmembrane glycoprotein, Gpnmb, is up-regulated 15-fold following ischemic damage in kidney tissue and by more than 10-fold in macrophages and 3-fold in surviving epithelial cells. Gpnmb-expressing macrophages and epithelial cells were found to contain apoptotic bodies at 3 times the rate of nonexpressing cells. Either mutation of Gpnmb or ablation of inflammatory macrophages prevents normal repair of the kidney. Significantly, the kidneys from postischemic Gpnmb mutant mice exhibited a 5-fold increase in apoptotic cellular debris compared to wild-type mice. These mice also experienced an 85% increase in mortality following bilateral ischemic kidney. Finally, we demonstrate that Gpnmb is a phagocytic protein that is necessary for recruitment of the autophagy protein LC3 to the phagosome where these proteins are colocalized and for lysosomal fusion with the phagosome and hence bulk degradation of their content. Therefore, Gpnmb is a novel prorepair gene that is necessary for crosstalk between the macroautophagic degradation pathway and phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2086323590,"Background Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e.g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980–2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark–recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed. Conclusions/Significance Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program."

This model utilizes optically transparent zebrafish larvae, fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD), to monitor processes of vascular inflammation in live animals. Because lipoprotein oxidation is an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis, in this study, we characterized the oxidized lipid milieu in HCD-fed zebrafish larvae. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we show that feeding an HCD for only 2 weeks resulted in up to 70-fold increases in specific oxidized cholesteryl esters, identical to those present in human minimally oxidized LDL and in murine atherosclerotic lesions. The levels of oxidized phospholipids, such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oxovaleroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and of various lysophosphatidylcholines were also significantly elevated. Moreover, lipoproteins isolated from homogenates of HCD-fed larvae induced cell spreading as well as ERK1/2, Akt, and JNK phosphorylation in murine macrophages. Removal of apoB-containing lipoproteins from the zebrafish homogenates with an anti-human LDL antibody, as well as reducing lipid hydroperoxides with ebselen, resulted in inhibition of macrophage activation. The TLR4 deficiency in murine macrophages prevented their activation with zebrafish lipoproteins. Using biotinylated homogenates of HCD-fed larvae, we demonstrated that their components bound to murine macrophages, and this binding was effectively competed by minimally oxidized LDL but not by native LDL. These data provide evidence that molecular lipid determinants of proatherogenic macrophage phenotypes are present in large quantities in hypercholesterolemic zebrafish larvae and support the use of the HCD-fed zebrafish as a valuable model to study early events of atherogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2055439930,"Mosasaurs (family Mosasauridae) are a diverse group of secondarily aquatic lizards that radiated into marine environments during the Late Cretaceous (98-65 million years ago). For the most part, they have been considered to be simple anguilliform swimmers--i.e., their propulsive force was generated by means of lateral undulations incorporating the greater part of the body--with unremarkable, dorsoventrally narrow tails and long, lizard-like bodies. Convergence with the specialized fusiform body shape and inferred carangiform locomotory style (in which only a portion of the posterior body participates in the thrust-producing flexure) of ichthyosaurs and metriorhynchid crocodyliform reptiles, along with cetaceans, has so far only been recognized in Plotosaurus, the most highly derived member of the Mosasauridae. Here we report on an exceptionally complete specimen (LACM 128319) of the moderately derived genus Platecarpus that preserves soft tissues and anatomical details (e.g., large portions of integument, a partial body outline, putative skin color markings, a downturned tail, branching bronchial tubes, and probable visceral traces) to an extent that has never been seen previously in any mosasaur. Our study demonstrates that a streamlined body plan and crescent-shaped caudal fin were already well established in Platecarpus, a taxon that preceded Plotosaurus by 20 million years. These new data expand our understanding of convergent evolution among marine reptiles, and provide insights into their evolution's tempo and mode."
https://openalex.org/W2090712756,"Stem cell-derived hepatocytes may be an alternative cell source to treat liver diseases or to be used for pharmacological purposes. We developed a protocol that mimics mammalian liver development, to differentiate cells with pluripotent characteristics to hepatocyte-like cells. The protocol supports the stepwise differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) to cells with characteristics of primitive streak (PS)/mesendoderm (ME)/definitive endoderm (DE), hepatoblasts, and finally cells with phenotypic and functional characteristics of hepatocytes. Remarkably, the same protocol can also differentiate rat multipotent adult progenitor cells (rMAPCs) to hepatocyte-like cells, even though rMAPC are isolated clonally from cultured rat bone marrow (BM) and have characteristics of primitive endoderm cells. A fraction of rMAPCs can be fated to cells expressing genes consistent with a PS/ME/DE phenotype, preceding the acquisition of phenotypic and functional characteristics of hepatocytes. Although the hepatocyte-like progeny derived from both cell types is mixed, between 10-20% of cells are developmentally consistent with late fetal hepatocytes that have attained synthetic, storage and detoxifying functions near those of adult hepatocytes. This differentiation protocol will be useful for generating hepatocyte-like cells from rodent and human stem cells, and to gain insight into the early stages of liver development."
https://openalex.org/W2056902846,"Background Syndromic surveillance systems have been developed in recent years and are now increasingly used by stakeholders to quickly answer questions and make important decisions. It is therefore essential to evaluate the quality and utility of such systems. This study was designed to assess a syndromic surveillance system based on emergency departments' (ED) morbidity rates related to the health effects of heat waves. This study uses data collected during the 2006 heat wave in France. Methods Data recorded from 15 EDs in the Ile-de-France (Paris and surrounding area) from June to August, 2006, were transmitted daily via the Internet to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance. Items collected included diagnosis (ICD10), outcome, and age. Several aspects of the system have been evaluated (data quality, cost, flexibility, stability, and performance). Periods of heat wave are considered the most suitable time to evaluate the system. Results Data quality did not vary significantly during the period. Age, gender and outcome were completed in a comprehensive manner. Diagnoses were missing or uninformative for 37.5% of patients. Stability was recorded as being 99.49% for the period overall. The average cost per day over the study period was estimated to be €287. Diagnoses of hyperthermia, malaise, dehydration, hyponatremia were correlated with increased temperatures. Malaise was most sensitive in younger and elderly adults but also the less specific. However, overall syndrome groups were more sensitive with comparable specificity than individual diagnoses. Conclusion This system satisfactorily detected the health impact of hot days (observed values were higher than expected on more than 90% of days on which a heat alert was issued). Our findings should reassure stakeholders about the reliability of health impact assessments during or following such an event. These evaluations are essential to establish the validity of the results of syndromic surveillance systems."
https://openalex.org/W2041799604,"Endocrine therapies targeting the proliferative effect of 17β-estradiol through estrogen receptor α (ERα) are the most effective systemic treatment of ERα-positive breast cancer. However, most breast tumors initially responsive to these therapies develop resistance through molecular mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. The long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) MCF7 cell model has been proposed to recapitulate acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women. To elucidate this resistance, genomic, transcriptomic and molecular data were integrated into the time course of MCF7–LTED adaptation. Dynamic and widespread genomic changes were observed, including amplification of the ESR1 locus consequently linked to an increase in ERα. Dynamic transcriptomic profiles were also observed that correlated significantly with genomic changes and were predicted to be influenced by transcription factors known to be involved in acquired resistance or cell proliferation (for example, interferon regulatory transcription factor 1 and E2F1, respectively) but, notably, not by canonical ERα transcriptional function. Consistently, at the molecular level, activation of growth factor signaling pathways by EGFR/ERBB/AKT and a switch from phospho-Ser118 (pS118)- to pS167-ERα were observed during MCF7–LTED adaptation. Evaluation of relevant clinical settings identified significant associations between MCF7–LTED and breast tumor transcriptome profiles that characterize ERα-negative status, early response to letrozole and tamoxifen, and recurrence after tamoxifen treatment. In accordance with these profiles, MCF7–LTED cells showed increased sensitivity to inhibition of FGFR-mediated signaling with PD173074. This study provides mechanistic insight into acquired resistance to endocrine therapies of breast cancer and highlights a potential therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2078891848,"The interaction between flowers and insect pollinators is an important aspect of the reproductive mechanisms of many plant species. Several laboratory and field studies indicate that raising flower temperature above ambient can be an advantage in attracting pollinators. Here we demonstrate that this preference for warmer flowers is, in fact, context-dependent. Using an Australian native bee as a model, we demonstrate for the first time a significant shift in behaviour when the ambient temperature reaches 34°C, at which point bees prefer ambient temperature nectar over warmer nectar. We then use thermal imaging techniques to show warmer nectar maintains the flight temperature of bees during the period of rest on flowers at lower ambient temperatures but the behavioural switch is associated with the body temperature rising above that maintained during flight. These findings suggest that flower-pollinator interactions are dependent upon ambient temperature and may therefore alter in different thermal environments."
https://openalex.org/W2062959544,"Utilizing the Citrobacter rodentium-induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) model, we measured hyperplasia and NF-κB activation during progression (days 6 and 12 post-infection) and regression (days 20–34 post-infection) phases of TMCH. NF-κB activity increased at progression in conjunction with bacterial attachment and translocation to the colonic crypts and decreased 40% by day 20. NF-κB activity at days 27 and 34, however, remained 2–3-fold higher than uninfected control. Expression of the downstream target gene CXCL-1/KC in the crypts correlated with NF-κB activation kinetics. Phosphorylation of cellular IκBα kinase (IKK)α/β (Ser176/180) was elevated during progression and regression of TMCH. Phosphorylation (Ser32/36) and degradation of IκBα, however, contributed to NF-κB activation only from days 6 to 20 but not at later time points. Phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) paralleled IKKα/β kinetics at days 6 and 12 without declining with regressing hyperplasia. siRNAs to MEK, ERK, and p38 significantly blocked NF-κB activity in vitro, whereas MEK1/2-inhibitor (PD98059) also blocked increases in MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and IKKα/β thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity in vivo. Cellular and nuclear levels of Ser536-phosphorylated (p65536) and Lys310-acetylated p65 subunit accompanied functional NF-κB activation during TMCH. RSK-1 phosphorylation at Thr359/Ser363 in cellular/nuclear extracts and co-immunoprecipitation with cellular p65-NF-κB overlapped with p65536 kinetics. Dietary pectin (6%) blocked NF-κB activity by blocking increases in p65 abundance and nuclear translocation thereby down-regulating CXCL-1/KC expression in the crypts. Thus, NF-κB activation persisted despite the lack of bacterial attachment to colonic mucosa beyond peak hyperplasia. The MEK/ERK/p38 pathway therefore seems to modulate sustained activation of NF-κB in colonic crypts in response to C. rodentium infection. Utilizing the Citrobacter rodentium-induced transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH) model, we measured hyperplasia and NF-κB activation during progression (days 6 and 12 post-infection) and regression (days 20–34 post-infection) phases of TMCH. NF-κB activity increased at progression in conjunction with bacterial attachment and translocation to the colonic crypts and decreased 40% by day 20. NF-κB activity at days 27 and 34, however, remained 2–3-fold higher than uninfected control. Expression of the downstream target gene CXCL-1/KC in the crypts correlated with NF-κB activation kinetics. Phosphorylation of cellular IκBα kinase (IKK)α/β (Ser176/180) was elevated during progression and regression of TMCH. Phosphorylation (Ser32/36) and degradation of IκBα, however, contributed to NF-κB activation only from days 6 to 20 but not at later time points. Phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), and p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) paralleled IKKα/β kinetics at days 6 and 12 without declining with regressing hyperplasia. siRNAs to MEK, ERK, and p38 significantly blocked NF-κB activity in vitro, whereas MEK1/2-inhibitor (PD98059) also blocked increases in MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and IKKα/β thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity in vivo. Cellular and nuclear levels of Ser536-phosphorylated (p65536) and Lys310-acetylated p65 subunit accompanied functional NF-κB activation during TMCH. RSK-1 phosphorylation at Thr359/Ser363 in cellular/nuclear extracts and co-immunoprecipitation with cellular p65-NF-κB overlapped with p65536 kinetics. Dietary pectin (6%) blocked NF-κB activity by blocking increases in p65 abundance and nuclear translocation thereby down-regulating CXCL-1/KC expression in the crypts. Thus, NF-κB activation persisted despite the lack of bacterial attachment to colonic mucosa beyond peak hyperplasia. The MEK/ERK/p38 pathway therefore seems to modulate sustained activation of NF-κB in colonic crypts in response to C. rodentium infection. The intestinal epithelium is a self-renewing tissue that represents a unique model for studying interconnected cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell migration, and carcinogenesis. Increased rates of proliferation have been described both as a precursor to cancer and as an integral part of the malignant transformation of the epithelium (1Risio M. Lipkin M. Candelaresi G.

The proliferative zone of the normal colorectal mucosa is confined to the lower two-thirds of the colonic crypts, whereas in conditions of high risk of cancer, proliferating cells are observed throughout the whole length of the gland. Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, including enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and a closely related mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium are classified as attaching and effacing pathogens based on their ability to adhere to intestinal epithelium, destroy microvilli, and induce actin-filled membranous protrusions called “pedestals” at the site of attachment. In the mouse colon, pedestal formation is associated with the formation of attaching and effacing lesions, breach of the epithelial barrier by the bacteria, and development of disease (6McDaniel T.K.

C. rodentium colonizes preferentially the murine colon with over 109 bacteria present during the peak of infection. However, by day 21 post-oral challenge, C. rodentium is cleared from the gastrointestinal tracts of normal adult mice (11Mundy R. MacDonald T.T. Dougan G. Frankel G. Wiles S. Cell. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that both innate and adaptive immune responses are required for immunity (11Mundy R. MacDonald T.T.

MacDonald T.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3031-3039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), very similar to mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. Immune and inflammatory responses in the gut and other immunocompetent tissues often involve the transcription factor NF-κB (17Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Multiple stimuli, including cytokines, mitogens, environmental particles, toxic metals, and viral or bacterial products, activate NF-κB, mostly through IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its inhibitor(s), the IκB family of proteins (17Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus, binds to its sequence recognition motif on promoters of target genes, and activates their transcription. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB is also controlled by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (18Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 19Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and acetylation of the p65 subunit (20Chen Lf. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 21Chen L.F. Mu Y. Greene W.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6539-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Utilizing the TMCH model, we showed previously that it was associated with a robust activation of β-catenin and NF-κB in the colonic crypts. NF-κB activation in TMCH followed the canonical pathway, including IKKα/β phosphorylation and IκBα degradation (22Wang Y. Xiang G.S. Kourouma F. Umar S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 148: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it was also characterized by atypical mechanism that enhances NF-κB activity, including phosphorylation and acetylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The epithelial hyperplasia induced by C. rodentium infection in TMCH is resolved within 4–6 weeks after infection, but the transient hyperplastic axis induced by C. rodentium infection promotes the development of carcinogen-induced colorectal tumors. Because inflammation in the gut and activation of NF-κB are often associated with an increased susceptibility to colon cancer, we hypothesized that some signals that contribute to NF-κB activation in TMCH remain elevated/altered in the mucosa even after bacterial clearance. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the mechanistic basis of NF-κB activity during progression and regression of TMCH. We report that NF-κB activation was highest at peak hyperplasia, which coincided with maximal colonization of the colon by C. rodentium. However its activation, although reduced at later time points, remained elevated over that of normal mucosa after bacterial clearance and even when the hyperplasia was completely resolved. Activation of NF-κB at time points that coincided with bacterial colonization (TMCH progression) was regulated primarily through the canonical mechanism (IκBα phosphorylation and degradation). In contrast, sustained activity after bacterial clearance (TMCH regression) was regulated by persistent phosphorylation events of the MEK/MAPK,ERK/RSK-1 pathway. We conclude that C. rodentium infection caused irreversible changes in colonic epithelium that could contribute to increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis. TMCH was induced in Helicobacter-free Swiss-Webster mice (15–20 g; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) by oral inoculation with a 16-h culture of C. rodentium, as described previously (9Sellin J.H. Wang Y.

For dietary intervention, mice were randomized to receive either a control AIN-93 diet (30Reeves P.G. Nielsen F.H. Fahey Jr., G.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (6640) Google Scholar) or 6% pectin (catalog no. TD97202) and 1% calcium diet (catalog no. TD97200) synthesized by Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI). All dietary interventions began 3-days post-C. rodentium infection as described previously (23Umar S. Morris A.P. Kourouma F. Sellin J.H. Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Animals were euthanized at 0, 6, 12, 20, 27, and 34 days post-infection, and distal colons were removed. Animals on various dietary regimens were killed at 12 days post-infection, and their colons were harvested. To isolate crypts, distal colons were attached to a paddle and immersed in Ca2+-free standard Krebs-buffered saline (in mmol/liter: 107 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 0.2 NaH2PO4, 1.8 Na2HPO4, 10 glucose, and 10 EDTA) at 37 °C for 10–20 min, gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Individual crypt units were then separated from the submucosa/musculature by intermittent (30 s) vibration into ice-cold potassium gluconate HEPES saline (in mmol/liter: 100 potassium gluconate, 20 NaCl, 1.25 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, and 5 sodium pyruvate), and 0.1% BSA. The isolated crypts were processed for biochemical and molecular assays as described previously (9Sellin J.H. Wang Y. Singh P. Umar S. Exp.

Young adult mouse colon (YAMC) cells were derived from colonic crypts from the Immortomouse®, such that they were conditionally immortalized with an SV40 large T-antigen with a temperature-sensitive IFNγ (interferon-γ)-inducible promoter (31Whitehead R.H. VanEeden P.E. Noble M.D. Ataliotis P. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The YAMC cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 units/ml IFNγ in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 33 °C. For experiments, cells were incubated at 33 °C in IFNγ-containing medium for 24 h and then transferred to 37 °C in IFNγ-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. To delineate the role(s) of MAPK signaling in NF-κB activation in response to C. rodentium infection, YAMC cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 35-mm dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h followed by growth in serum- and antibiotic-free medium for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with either 100 nmol/liter of scrambled siRNA or siRNAs specific for MEK1/2 (sc-35904 and sc-75906), ERK1/2 (sc-39308 and sc-35336), and p38α/β (sc-29434 and sc-39117) using 2–8 μl of transfection reagent (sc-29528) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. C. rodentium strain DBS 100 (ATCC catalog no. 51459TM) was grown under aerophilic conditions on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates for 24 h at 37 °C and cultured in LB broth overnight at 37 °C. RPMI, containing 0.45% glucose, was inoculated with a 1:20 dilution of a standard LB overnight culture and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Monolayers of 5 × 105 YAMC cells at ∼50% confluence or cells transfected with various siRNAs after 36 h were infected with C. rodentium at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 90 or the medium alone (as a control) for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 3 h, medium was changed and replaced with fresh medium plus antibiotics to ensure complete absence of live bacteria. Medium was tested negative for colony formation after 24 h (data not shown). At 24, 48, and 72 h, cellular/nuclear proteins were extracted and processed for either Western blotting or DNA binding assay as described elsewhere. To directly assess the role of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 in NF-κB activation in response to C. rodentium infection, we utilized a stably co-transfected HEK 293 cell line (IML-104, Imgenex Corp., San Diego) that expresses full-length TLR4 and the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene under the transcriptional control of an NF-κB response element (hereby designated as HEK 293-reporter cell line). The functionality of this cell line has been validated by measuring SEAP levels after LPS (lipopolysaccharide; a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria) stimulation. The HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 4.5g/liter glucose, 10% FBS, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and 500 μg/ml G418 (geneticin). Cells were infected with C. rodentium at an m.o.i. of 90 for 3 h, washed, and incubated in fresh medium. The SEPorter activity was measured with the Imgenex SEPorter assay kit (catalog no. 10055K) as described by the manufacturer. An increase in SEAP levels indicates activation of NF-κB. For measuring expression levels of CXCL-1/KC in the colonic crypts, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by using superscript II and random primers. Specific gene products were identified by performing semiquantitative PCR. Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. The PCR products were separated by PAGE and visualized by ethidium bromide staining of the gels under UV light. Gel data were recorded with the Bio-Rad FluorS Imaging System, and relative densities of the bands were determined with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was normalized against actin. Crypt nuclear extracts were prepared from normal or Citrobacter-infected mouse distal colon essentially as described previously (22Wang Y. Xiang G.S. Kourouma F. Umar S. Br. J.

After a 15-min incubation on ice, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled and double-stranded NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (TGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC) was added to each reaction and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min. The reaction products were separated on a 4% native polyacrylamide 0.5%× Tris borate/EDTA gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Supershift antibodies (1 μl) were included in the binding reaction as indicated (all supershift antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (26Umar S. Wang Y. Morris A.P. Sellin J.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G599-G607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For DNA binding assays, relative levels of activated p65 NF-κB in nuclear extracts of normal or Citrobacter-infected mouse distal colonic crypts were measured using the TransAM p65 NF-κB Chemi Transcription Factor Assay kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA) (27Umar S. Sarkar S. Cowey S. Singh P. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5599-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, crypt cytosolic extracts were normalized for protein concentration and pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A-coated Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C by incubating the fractions overnight with antibody recognizing p90RSK-1. Immune complexes were captured by incubation with 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Control experiments were performed by carrying out immunoprecipitations in the presence of the immunizing peptides or with control IgG antisera. The immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by boiling the Sepharose beads in 2× SDS sample buffer. Total crypt cellular extracts, subcellular fractions (30–100 μg protein/lane), or immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The efficiency of electrotransfer was checked by back staining gels with Coomassie Blue and/or by reversible staining of the electrotransferred protein directly on the nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S solution. No variability in transfer was noted. De-stained membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl and 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature (21 °C) and then overnight at 4 °C. Immunoantigenicity was detected by incubating the membranes for 1–2 h with the appropriate primary antibodies (0.5–1.0 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween); Sigma). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. IMF or immunohistochemistry studies for anti-LPS as a surrogate to detect the presence of C. rodentium in the colonic mucosa was performed on 5-μm-thick paraffin sections from distal colons of normal and TMCH mice (days 6–34) utilizing the HRP-labeled polymer conjugated to secondary antibody using Envision+ System-HRP (3,3′-diaminobenzidine; DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) with microwave accentuation as described previously (9Sellin J.H. Wang Y. Singh P. Umar S. Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. Xiang G.S. Kourouma F. Umar S. Br. J.

Slides were washed and incubated with 4–6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min at room temperature to stain the nuclei. The visualization was carried out either via fluorescent or light microscopies, respectively. Controls included either omission of primary antibody or detection of endogenous IgG staining pattern with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem). To determine the effect of C. rodentium infection on colonic crypt hyperplasia, we stained the distal colonic sections from Swiss-Webster outbred mice for Ki-67 as a marker of proliferation by immunohistochemistry. In normally proliferating crypts, only cells at the base exhibited nuclear staining (Fig. 1). At day 6 and particularly at day 12 TMCH, intense nuclear immunoreactivity extended throughout the longitudinal crypt axis (Fig. 1). Intense Ki-67 nuclear immunoreactivity persisted until day 27 before returning to base line by day 34 (Fig. 1). We define in this study days 6 and 12 post-infection as “TMCH progression” and days 20–34 post-infection as “TMCH regression.” When NF-κB activity in the distal colonic crypt nuclear extracts were measured via DNA binding assay, the activity increased reproducibly during TMCH progression, declined 40% at day 20, and then plateaued off at days 27 and 34. However, the residual activity, even at day 34, however, was 2-fold higher than uninfected control (Fig. 2A). It needs to be emphasized that even though we have previously reported the mechanism of NF-κB activation during progression of TMCH (22Wang Y. Xiang G.S. Kourouma F. Umar S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 148: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we considered it extremely critical to include these time points to understand how progression and regression phases of hyperplasia associated with TMCH affect NF-κB activity in colonic crypts in vivo. To further investigate the effect of NF-κB activation on downstream signaling, we focused on chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 (CXCL-1/KC), one of the targets of NF-κB signaling and a cognate ligand for CXC chemokine receptor CXCR-2. Time course studies paralleled NF-κB activation kinetics to a certain extent, wherein expression of CXCL-1 increased significantly at days 6 and 12 post-infection, declined at day 20, but was still detectable at days 27 and 34 albeit at lower levels (Fig. 2B). As proof-of-principle, we used YAMC cells to study sustained activation of NF-κB in response to C. rodentium infection. YAMC cells were infected with C. rodentium at 90:1 m.o.i. for 3 h at 37 °C, washed to remove bacteria, and incubated in fresh medium with antibiotics for 24, 48, and 120 h. Expression analysis revealed significant increase in CXCL-1 levels at 24 and 48 h compared with uninfected control with sustained overexpression even at 120 h (Fig. 2C). Data from three separate experiments are presented as a bar graph in Fig 2C, panel ii, as a ratio of GAPDH in the samples. Because CXCL-1 is a downstream target of NF-κB signaling, these findings clearly indicate that sustained NF-κB activation may indeed be regulating expression of CXCL-1 over an extended period both in vivo and in vitro.FIGURE 2A, NF-κB activity measured via DNA binding assay. Crypt nuclear extracts were prepared from normal (N) and days (D) 6–34 post-infected mice, and the presence of activated NF-κB p65 in the nuclear extracts was examined by utilizing Trans AM NF-κB p65 Chemi Transcription Factor Assay kit from Active Motif. Significant increases in NF-κB activity was recorded at days 6 and 12 with sustained activation at days 20, 27, and 34 of TMCH (n = 3; p < 0.05). B, expression of downstream target for NF-κB, CXCL-1/KC, during TMCH. Total RNA was extracted from colonic crypts isolated from normal or days 6–34 post-infected mice.

GABAergic inhibition in the molecular layer has mainly been investigated at the interneuron to Purkinje cell synapse. In this study, we used complementary subtractive strategies to quantitatively assess the ratio of GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cell dendrites versus those on interneurons. We generated a mouse model in which the GABAA receptor α1 subunit (GABAARα1) was selectively removed from Purkinje cells using the Cre/loxP system. Deletion of the α1 subunit resulted in a complete loss of GABAAR aggregates from Purkinje cells, allowing us to determine the density of GABAAR clusters in interneurons. In a complementary approach, we determined the density of GABA synapses impinging on Purkinje cells using α-dystroglycan as a specific marker of inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Combining these inverse approaches, we found that synapses received by interneurons represent approximately 40% of all GABAergic synapses in the molecular layer. Notably, this proportion was stable during postnatal development, indicating synchronized synaptogenesis. Based on the pure quantity of GABAergic synapses onto interneurons, we propose that mutual inhibition must play an important, yet largely neglected, computational role in the cerebellar cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1993086611,"The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase composed of a large catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and a heterodimeric DNA-targeting subunit Ku. DNA-PK is a major component of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway of DNA double-strand breaks repair. Although DNA-PK has been biochemically characterized in vitro, relatively little is known about its functions in the context of DNA repair and how its kinase activity is precisely regulated in vivo. Here, we report that cellular depletion of the individual catalytic subunits of protein kinase CK2 by RNA interference leads to significant cell death in M059K human glioblastoma cells expressing DNA-PKcs, but not in their isogenic counterpart, that is M059J cells, devoid of DNA-PKcs. The lack of CK2 results in enhanced DNA-PKcs activity and strongly inhibits DNA damage-induced autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at S2056 as well as repair of DNA double-strand breaks. By the application of the in situ proximity ligation assay, we show that CK2 interacts with DNA-PKcs in normal growing cells and that the association increases upon DNA damage. These results indicate that CK2 has an important role in the modulation of DNA-PKcs activity and its phosphorylation status providing important insights into the mechanisms by which DNA-PKcs is regulated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1978714960,"Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway occurs in almost all colorectal cancers and contributes to their growth, invasion and survival. Phopholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in progression of colorectal carcinoma However, an understanding of the targets and regulation of this important pathway remains incomplete and besides, relationship between Wnt signaling and PLD is not known.Here, we demonstrate that PLD isozymes, PLD1 and PLD2 are direct targets and positive feedback regulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Wnt3a and Wnt mimetics significantly enhanced the expression of PLDs at a transcriptional level in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, whereas silencing of beta-catenin gene expression or utilization of a dominant negative form of T cell factor-4 (TCF-4) inhibited expression of PLDs. Moreover, both PLD1 and PLD2 were highly induced in colon, liver and stomach tissues of mice after injection of LiCl, a Wnt mimetic. Wnt3a stimulated formation of the beta-catenin/TCF complexes to two functional TCF-4-binding elements within the PLD2 promoter as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Suppressing PLD using gene silencing or selective inhibitor blocked the ability of beta-catenin to transcriptionally activate PLD and other Wnt target genes by preventing formation of the beta-catenin/TCF-4 complex, whereas tactics to elevate intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity, enhanced these effects. Here we show that PLD is necessary for Wnt3a-driven invasion and anchorage-independent growth of colon cancer cells.PLD isozyme acts as a novel transcriptional target and positive feedback regulator of Wnt signaling, and then promotes Wnt-driven anchorage-independent growth of colorectal cancer cells. We propose that therapeutic interventions targeting PLD may confer a clinical benefit in Wnt/beta-catenin-driven malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2142223407,"Thyroid hormone regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process involved in key functions, such as learning, memory, and mood regulation. We addressed the role of thyroid hormone receptor TRα1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, using mice harboring a TRα1 null allele (TRα1(-/-)), overexpressing TRα1 6-fold (TRα2(-/-)), and a mutant TRα1 (TRα1(+/m)) with a 10-fold lower affinity to the ligand. While hippocampal progenitor proliferation was unaltered, TRα1(-/-) mice exhibited a significant increase in doublecortin-positive immature neurons and increased survival of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU(+)) progenitors as compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, the TRα1(+/m) and the TRα2(-/-) mice, where the overexpressed TRα1 acts as an aporeceptor, showed a significant decline in surviving BrdU(+) progenitors. TRα1(-/-) and TRα2(-/-) mice showed opposing effects on neurogenic markers like polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule and stathmin. The decreased progenitor survival in the TRα2(-/-) and TRα1(+/m) mice could be rescued by thyroid hormone treatment, as was the decline in neuronal differentiation seen in the TRα1(+/m) mice. These mice also exhibited a decrease in NeuroD(+) cell numbers in the dentate gyrus, suggesting an effect on early postmitotic progenitors. Our results provide the first evidence of a role for unliganded TRα1 in modulating the deleterious effects of hypothyroidism on adult hippocampal neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982422930,"The GE81112 tetrapeptides (1-3) represent a structurally unique class of antibiotics, acting as specific inhibitors of prokaryotic protein synthesis. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of the GE81112 biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. L-49973 and the development of a genetic manipulation system for Streptomyces sp. L-49973. The biosynthetic gene cluster for the tetrapeptide antibiotic GE81112 (getA-N) was identified within a 61.7-kb region comprising 29 open reading frames (open reading frames), 14 of which were assigned to the biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis revealed the GE81112 cluster to consist of six nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes encoding incomplete di-domain NRPS modules and a single free standing NRPS domain as well as genes encoding other biosynthetic and modifying proteins. The involvement of the cloned gene cluster in GE81112 biosynthesis was confirmed by inactivating the NRPS gene getE resulting in a GE81112 production abolished mutant. In addition, we characterized the NRPS A-domains from the pathway by expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro enzymatic assays. The previously unknown stereochemistry of most chiral centers in GE81112 was established from a combined chemical and biosynthetic approach. Taken together, these findings have allowed us to propose a rational model for GE81112 biosynthesis. The results further open the door to developing new derivatives of these promising antibiotic compounds by genetic engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2129211452,"Background In promiscuous species, male fitness is expected to increase with repeated matings in an open-ended fashion (thereby increasing number of partners or probability of paternity) whereas female fitness should level out at some optimal number of copulations when direct and indirect benefits still outweigh the costs of courtship and copulation. After this fitness peak, additional copulations would incur female fitness costs and be under opposing selection. Hence, a sexual conflict over mating frequency may evolve in species where females are forced to engage in costly matings. Under such circumstance, if females could avoid male detection, significant fitness benefits from such avoidance strategies would be predicted. Methodology/Principal Findings Among four Littorina species, one lives at very much higher densities and has a longer mating season than the other three species. Using video records of snail behaviour in a laboratory arena we show that males of the low-density species discriminate among male and female mucous trails, trailing females for copulations. In the high-density species, however, males fail to discriminate between male and female trails, not because males are unable to identify female trails (which we show using heterospecific females), but because females do not, as the other species, add a gender-specific cue to their trail. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that there is likely a sexual conflict over mating frequency in the high-density species (L. saxatilis) owing to females most likely being less sperm-limited in this species. This has favoured the evolution of females that permanently or optionally do not release a cue in the mucus to decrease excessive and costly matings resulting in unusually high frequencies of male-male copulating attempts in the wild. This is one of few examples of masking gender identity to obtain fewer matings."
https://openalex.org/W2139934531,"Genomic translocations have been implicated in cancer. In this study, we performed a screen for genetic translocations in gliomas based on exon-level expression profiles. We identified a translocation in the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) gene, encoding a cell adhesion molecule. CASPR2 mRNA was fused to an expressed sequence tag that likely is part of the nuclear receptor coactivator 1 gene. Despite high mRNA expression levels, no CASPR2 fusion protein was detected. In a set of 25 glioblastomas and 22 oligodendrogliomas, mutation analysis identified two additional samples with genetic alterations in the CASPR2 gene and all three identified genetic alterations are likely to reduce CASPR2 protein expression levels. Methylation of the CASPR2 gene was also observed in gliomas and glioma cell lines. CASPR2-overexpressing cells showed decreased proliferation rates, likely because of an increase in apoptosis. Moreover, high CASPR2 mRNA expression level is positively correlated with survival and is an independent prognostic factor. These results indicate that CASPR2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in glioma."
https://openalex.org/W1983605926,"Transcriptional repression by the C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) is proposed to require nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NAD(H). Previous studies have implicated CtBP in transcriptional repression of the p21waf1/cip1 gene. Similarly, the NAD-dependent poly(adenosine diphosphate)ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) may affect p21 expression via its NAD-dependent enzymatic activity; we therefore asked if PARP1 and CtBP were functionally linked in regulating p21 transcription. We found that restraint of basal p21 transcription requires both CtBP and PARP1. PARP inhibition attenuated activation of p21 transcription by both p53-independent and p53-dependent processes, in a CtBP-dependent manner. CtBP1+2 or PARP1+2 knockdown partially activated p21 gene expression, suggesting relief of a corepressor function dependent on both proteins. We localized CtBP-responsive repression elements to the proximal promoter region, and found ZBRK1 overexpression could also overcome DNA damage-dependent, but not p53-dependent activation through this region. By chromatin immunoprecipitation we find dismissal of CtBP from the proximal promoter following DNA-damage, and that PARP1 associates with a CtBP corepressor complex in nuclear extracts. We propose a model in which both CtBP and PARP functionally interact in a corepressor complex as components of a molecular switch necessary for p21 repression, and following DNA damage signals activation of p21 transcription by corepressor dismissal and co-activator recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2155242987,"Gene silencing of Lyc e 1 leads to reduced allergenicity of tomato fruits but impaired growth of transgenic tomato plants. The aim of the study was to restore growth of Lyc e 1-deficient tomato plants while retaining reduced allergenicity by simultaneous complementation of profilin deficiency by expression of nonallergenic yeast profilin. Transgenic plants were generated and tested by RT-PCR and immunoblotting; allergenicity of yeast profilin and transgenic fruits was investigated by IgE binding, basophil activation, and skin-prick tests. Lyc e 1 content of transgenic tomato fruits was <5% of that of wild-type plants, causing significantly reduced IgE antibody binding. Simultaneous coexpression of yeast profilin restored growth and biomass production almost to wild-type levels. Yeast profilin, sharing 32.6% amino acid sequence identity with Lyc e 1, displayed low IgE-binding capacity and allergenic potency. Among 16 tomato-allergic patients preselected for sensitization to Lyc e 1, none showed significant reactivity to yeast profilin. Yeast profilin did not induce mediator release, and coexpression of yeast profilin did not enhance the allergenicity of Lyc e 1-reduced fruits. Simultanous coexpression of yeast profilin allows silencing of tomato profilin and generation of viable plants with Lyc e 1-deficient tomato fruits. Therefore, a novel approach to allergen avoidance, genetically modified foods with reduced allergen accumulation, can be generated even if the allergen fulfills an essential cellular function in the plant. In summary, our findings of efficiently complementing profilin-deficient tomato plants by coexpression of low allergenic yeast profilin demonstrate the feasibility of creating low-allergenic food even if the allergen fulfills essential cellular functions."

A feature of HIV and FIV infection is the continually increasing divergence among viral isolates between different individuals, as well as within the same individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings The goal of this study was to determine the phylogenetic patterns of viral isolates obtained within the United States (U.S.) by focusing on the variable, V3-V4, region of the FIV envelope gene. Conclusions/Significance Data indicate that FIV, from within the U.S., localize to four viral clades, A, B, C, and F. Also shown is the geographic isolation of strains where clade A and clade B are found predominately on the west coast; however, clade B is also found throughout the U.S. and represents the predominant clade. This study presents a complete and conclusive analysis of FIV isolates from within the U.S. and may be used as the essential basis for the development of an effective multi-clade vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W2029685026,"The Saccharopolyspora erythraea genome sequence was released in 2007. In order to look at the gene regulations at whole transcriptome level, an expression microarray was specifically designed on the S. erythraea strain NRRL 2338 genome sequence. Based on these data, we set out to investigate the potential transcriptional regulatory networks and their organization.In view of the hierarchical structure of bacterial transcriptional regulation, we constructed a hierarchical coexpression network at whole transcriptome level. A total of 27 modules were identified from 1255 differentially expressed transcript units (TUs) across time course, which were further classified in to four groups. Functional enrichment analysis indicated the biological significance of our hierarchical network. It was indicated that primary metabolism is activated in the first rapid growth phase (phase A), and secondary metabolism is induced when the growth is slowed down (phase B). Among the 27 modules, two are highly correlated to erythromycin production. One contains all genes in the erythromycin-biosynthetic (ery) gene cluster and the other seems to be associated with erythromycin production by sharing common intermediate metabolites. Non-concomitant correlation between production and expression regulation was observed. Especially, by calculating the partial correlation coefficients and building the network based on Gaussian graphical model, intrinsic associations between modules were found, and the association between those two erythromycin production-correlated modules was included as expected.This work created a hierarchical model clustering transcriptome data into coordinated modules, and modules into groups across the time course, giving insight into the concerted transcriptional regulations especially the regulation corresponding to erythromycin production of S. erythraea. This strategy may be extendable to studies on other prokaryotic microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2096791157,"Background Root lifespan is an important trait that determines plants' ability to acquire and conserve soil resources. There have been several studies investigating characteristics of root lifespan of both woody and herbaceous species. However, most of the studies have focused on non-clonal plants, and there have been little data on root lifespan for clonal plants that occur widely in temperate grasslands. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the effects of rhizome severing on overall root lifespan of Leymus chinensis, a clonal, dominant grass species in the temperate steppe in northern China, in a 2-year field study using modified rhizotron technique. More specifically, we investigated the effects of rhizome severing on root lifespan of roots born in different seasons and distributed at different soil depths. Rhizome severing led to an increase in the overall root lifespan from 81 to 103 days. The increase in root lifespan exhibited spatial and temporal characteristics such that it increased lifespan for roots distributed in the top two soil layers and for roots born in summer and spring, but it had no effect on lifespan of roots in the deep soil layer and born in autumn. We also examined the effect of rhizome severing on carbohydrate and N contents in roots, and found that root carbohydrate and N contents were not affected by rhizome severing. Further, we found that root lifespan of Stipa krylovii and Artemisia frigida, two dominant, non-clonal species in the temperate steppe, was significantly longer (118 d) than that of L. chinensis (81 d), and this value became comparable to that of L. chinensis under rhizome severing (103 d). Conclusions/Significance We found that root lifespan in dominant, clonal L. chinensis was shorter than for the dominant, non-clonal species of S. krylovii and A. frigida. There was a substantial increase in the root lifespan of L. chinensis in response to severing their rhizomes, and this increase in root lifespan exhibited temporal and spatial characteristics. These findings suggest that the presence of rhizomes is likely to account for the observed short lifespan of clonal plant species in the temperate steppe."
https://openalex.org/W2091319789,"Background Many aquatic animals enclose embryos in gelatinous masses, and these embryos rely on diffusion to supply oxygen. Mass structure plays an important role in limiting or facilitating O2 supply, but external factors such as temperature and photosynthesis can play important roles as well. Other external factors are less well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We first explored the effects of water flow on O2 levels inside nudibranch embryo masses and compared the effects of flow on masses from temperate and polar regions. Water flow (still vs. vigorously bubbled) had a strong effect on central O2 levels in all masses; in still water, masses were considerably more hypoxic than in bubbled water. This effect was stronger in temperate than in polar masses, likely due to the increased metabolic demand and O2 consumption of temperate masses. Second, we made what are to our knowledge the first measurements of O2 in invertebrate masses in the field. Consistent with laboratory experiments, O2 in Antarctic masses was high in masses in situ, suggesting that boundary-layer effects do not substantially limit O2 supply to polar embryos in the field. Conclusions/Significance All else being equal, boundary layers are more likely to depress O2 in masses in temperate or tropical regions; thus, selection on parents to choose high-flow sites for mass deposition is likely greater in warm water. Because of the large number of variables affecting diffusive O2 supply to embryos in their natural environment, field observations are necessary to test hypotheses generated from laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling."
https://openalex.org/W1976154498,"Cancer progression is often driven by an accumulation of genetic changes but also accompanied by increasing genomic instability. These processes lead to a complicated landscape of copy number alterations (CNAs) within individual tumors and great diversity across tumor samples. High resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is being used to profile CNAs of ever larger tumor collections, and better computational methods for processing these data sets and identifying potential driver CNAs are needed. Typical studies of aCGH data sets take a pipeline approach, starting with segmentation of profiles, calls of gains and losses, and finally determination of frequent CNAs across samples. A drawback of pipelines is that choices at each step may produce different results, and biases are propagated forward. We present a mathematically robust new method that exploits probe-level correlations in aCGH data to discover subsets of samples that display common CNAs. Our algorithm is related to recent work on maximum-margin clustering. It does not require pre-segmentation of the data and also provides grouping of recurrent CNAs into clusters. We tested our approach on a large cohort of glioblastoma aCGH samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and recovered almost all CNAs reported in the initial study. We also found additional significant CNAs missed by the original analysis but supported by earlier studies, and we identified significant correlations between CNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2086569930,"Genome instability, associated with chromosome breakage syndromes and most human cancers, is still poorly understood. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, numerous genes with roles in the preservation of genome integrity have been identified. DNA-damage-checkpoint-deficient yeast cells that lack Sgs1, a RecQ-like DNA helicase related to the human Bloom's-syndrome-associated helicase BLM, show an increased rate of genome instability, and we have previously shown that they accumulate recurring chromosomal translocations between three similar genes, CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1. Here, the chromosomal location, copy number and sequence similarity of the translocation targets ALP1 and LYP1 were altered to gain insight into the formation of complex translocations. Among 844 clones with chromosomal rearrangements, 93 with various types of simple and complex translocations involving CAN1, LYP1 and ALP1 were identified. Breakpoint sequencing and mapping showed that the formation of complex translocation types is strictly dependent on the location of the initiating DNA break and revealed that complex translocations arise via a combination of interchromosomal translocation and template-switching, as well as from unstable dicentric intermediates. Template-switching occurred between sequences on the same chromosome, but was inhibited if the genes were transferred to different chromosomes. Unstable dicentric translocations continuously gave rise to clones with multiple translocations in various combinations, reminiscent of intratumor heterogeneity in human cancers. Base substitutions and evidence of DNA slippage near rearrangement breakpoints revealed that translocation formation can be accompanied by point mutations, and their presence in different translocation types within the same clone provides evidence that some of the different translocation types are derived from each other rather than being formed de novo. These findings provide insight into eukaryotic genome instability, especially the formation of translocations and the sources of intraclonal heterogeneity, both of which are often associated with human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2043955428,"Exactly how human tumors grow is uncertain because serial observations are impractical. One approach to reconstruct the histories of individual human cancers is to analyze the current genomic variation between its cells. The greater the variations, on average, the greater the time since the last clonal evolution cycle (""a molecular clock hypothesis""). Here we analyze passenger DNA methylation patterns from opposite sides of 12 primary human colorectal cancers (CRCs) to evaluate whether the variation (pairwise distances between epialleles) is consistent with a single clonal expansion after transformation.Data from 12 primary CRCs are compared to epigenomic data simulated under a single clonal expansion for a variety of possible growth scenarios. We find that for many different growth rates, a single clonal expansion can explain the population variation in 11 out of 12 CRCs. In eight CRCs, the cells from different glands are all equally distantly related, and cells sampled from the same tumor half appear no more closely related than cells sampled from opposite tumor halves. In these tumors, growth appears consistent with a single ""symmetric"" clonal expansion. In three CRCs, the variation in epigenetic distances was different between sides, but this asymmetry could be explained by a single clonal expansion with one region of a tumor having undergone more cell division than the other. The variation in one CRC was complex and inconsistent with a simple single clonal expansion.Rather than a series of clonal expansion after transformation, these results suggest that the epigenetic variation of present-day cancer cells in primary CRCs can almost always be explained by a single clonal expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2128906383,"Insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can independently affect plant fitness, and may have interactive effects. However, few studies have experimentally quantified the joint effects of insects and fungal pathogens on seed production in non-agricultural populations. We examined the factorial effects of insect herbivore exclusion (via insecticide) and fungal pathogen exclusion (via fungicide) on the population-level seed production of four common graminoid species (Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis, and Carex siccata) over two growing seasons in Minnesota, USA. We detected no interactive effects of herbivores and pathogens on seed production. However, the seed production of all four species was affected by either insecticide or fungicide in at least one year of the study. Insecticide consistently doubled the seed production of the historically most common species in the North American tallgrass prairie, A. gerardii (big bluestem). This is the first report of insect removal increasing seed production in this species. Insecticide increased A. gerardii number of seeds per seed head in one year, and mass per seed in both years, suggesting that consumption of flowers and seed embryos contributed to the effect on seed production. One of the primary insect species consuming A. gerardii flowers and seed embryos was likely the Cecidomyiid midge, Contarinia wattsi. Effects on all other plant species varied among years. Herbivores and pathogens likely reduce the dispersal and colonization ability of plants when they reduce seed output. Therefore, impacts on seed production of competitive dominant species may help to explain their relatively poor colonization abilities. Reduced seed output by dominant graminoids may thereby promote coexistence with subdominant species through competition-colonization tradeoffs."

Smear-positive TB disease was used as a proxy gold standard for latent TB infection. Methods and Findings We compared the sensitivity of QFT-IT and TST in 98 sputum smear and chest x-ray positive TB cases and investigated risk factors for negative and discordant results in both tests. Both tests showed high sensitivity; (QFT-IT; 88.7%: TST; 94.9%), not significantly different from each other (p value 0.11). Very high sensitivity was seen when tests were combined (98.9%). There were no variables significantly associated with discordant results or with a negative TST. For QFT-IT which particular staff member collected blood was significantly associated with test positivity (p value 0.01). Study limitations include small sample size and lack of culture confirmation or HIV test results. Conclusions The QFT-IT has similar sensitivity in Indonesian TB cases as in other locations. However, QFT-IT, like the TST cannot distinguish active TB disease from LTBI. In countries such as Indonesia, with high background rates of LTBI, test specificity for TB disease will likely be low. While our study was not designed to evaluate the QFT-IT in the diagnosis of active TB disease in TB suspects, the data suggest that a combination of TST and QFT-IT may prove useful for ruling out TB disease. Further research is required to explore the clinical role of QFT-IT in combination with other TB diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W2054025083,"Extra-pair paternity (EPP) in birds is related to a number of ecological and social factors. For example, it has been found to be positively related with breeding density, negatively with the amount of paternal care and especially high rates have been observed in group-living species. Siberian jays (Perisoreous infaustus) breed at low densities and have extended parental care, which leads to the expectation of low rates of EPP. On the other hand, Siberian jays live in groups which can include also unrelated individuals, and provide opportunities for extra-pair matings. To assess the potential occurrence of EPP in Siberian jays, we analysed a large data pool (n = 1029 offspring) covering ca. 30 years of samples from a Finnish Siberian jay population. Paternities were assigned based on up to 21 polymorphic microsatellite markers with the additional information from field observations. We were unable to find any evidence for occurrence of EPP in this species. Our findings are in line with earlier studies and confirm the generally low rates of EPP in related Corvid species. These results suggest that ecological factors may be more important than social factors (group living) in determining costs and benefits of extra-pair paternity."
https://openalex.org/W2040407156,"The cerebellum in transgenic mice expressing pseudorabies virus immediate-early protein IE180 (TgIE96) was substantially diminished in size, and its histoarchitecture was severely disorganized, resulting in severe ataxia. TgIE96 mice can therefore be used as an experimental model to study the involvement of cerebellar circuits in different learning tasks. The performance of three-month-old TgIE96 mice was studied in various behavioral tests, including associative learning (classical eyeblink conditioning), object recognition, spatial orientation (water maze), startle response and prepulse inhibition, and passive avoidance, and compared with that of wild-type mice. Wild-type and TgIE96 mice presented similar reflexively evoked eyeblinks, and acquired classical conditioned eyelid responses with similar learning curves for both trace and delay conditioning paradigms. The two groups of mice also had similar performances during the object recognition test. However, they showed significant differences for the other three tests included in this study. Although both groups of animals were capable of swimming, TgIE96 mice failed to learn the water maze task during the allowed time. The startle response to a severe tone was similar in both control and TgIE96 mice, but the latter were unable to produce a significant prepulse inhibition. TgIE96 mice also presented evident deficits for the proper accomplishment of a passive avoidance test. These results suggest that the cerebellum is not indispensable for the performance of classical eyeblink conditioning and for object recognition tasks, but seems to be necessary for the proper performance of water maze, prepulse inhibition, and passive avoidance tests."
