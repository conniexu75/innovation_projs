https://openalex.org/W2980933435,"The Karnaphuli River estuary, located in southeast coast of Bangladesh, is largely exposed to heavy metal contamination as it receives a huge amount of untreated industrial effluents from the Chottagram City. This study aimed to assess the concentrations of five heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu) and their bioaccumulation status in six commercially important fishes, and also to evaluate the potential human health risk for local consumers. The hierarchy of the measured concentration level (mg/kg) of the metals was as follows: Pb (13.88) > Cu (12.10) > As (4.89) > Cr (3.36) > Cd (0.39). The Fulton's condition factor denoted that fishes were in better 'condition' and most of the species were in positive allometric growth. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of the contaminants observed in the species were in the following orders: Cu (1971.42) > As (1042.93) > Pb (913.66) > Cr (864.99) > Cd (252.03), and among the specimens, demersal fish, Apocryptes bato appeared to be the most bioaccumulative organism. Estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) assessed for potential human health risk implications suggest that the values were within the acceptable threshold for both adults and children. However, calculated CR values indicated that both age groups were not far from the risk, and HI values demonstrated that children were nearly 6 times more susceptible to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects than adults."
https://openalex.org/W2981311729,"Opioid overdose deaths have increased exponentially in the United States. Bystander response to opioid overdose ideally involves administering naloxone, providing rescue breathing, and calling 911 to summon emergency medical assistance. Recently in the US, public health and public safety agencies have begun seeking to use 911 calls as a method to identify and deliver post-overdose interventions to opioid overdose patients. Little is known about the opinions of PWUDs about the barriers, benefits, or potential harms of post-overdose interventions linked to the 911 system. We sought to understand the perspectives of PWUDs about a method for using 911 data to identify opioid overdose cases and trigger a post-overdose intervention.We conducted three focus groups with 11 PWUDs in 2018. Results are organized into 4 categories: willingness to call 911 (benefits and risks of calling), thoughts about a technique to identify opioid overdoses in 911 data (benefits and concerns), thoughts about the proposed post-overdose intervention (benefits and concerns), and recommendations for developing an ideal post-overdose intervention. For most participants, calling 911 was synonymous with ""calling the police"" and law enforcement-related fears were pervasive, limiting willingness to engage with the 911 system. The technique to identify opioid overdoses and the proposed post-overdose intervention were identified as potentially lifesaving, but the benefits were balanced by concerns related to law enforcement involvement, intervention timing, and risks to privacy/reputation. Nearly universally, participants wished for a way to summon emergency medical assistance without triggering a law enforcement response.The fact that the 911 system in the US inextricably links emergency medical assistance with law enforcement response inherently problematizes calling 911 for PWUDs, and has implications for surveillance and intervention. It is imperative to center the perspectives of PWUDs when designing and implementing interventions that rely on the 911 system for activation."
https://openalex.org/W2980860335,"Background Nearly 70% of all cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and many of these cancer deaths are preventable. In high-income countries (HICs), patient navigation strategies have been successfully implemented to facilitate the patient’s journey at multiple points along the cancer care continuum. The purpose of this scoping review is to understand and describe the scope of patient navigation interventions and services employed in LMICs. Methods A systematic search of published articles was conducted including Medline, Biosis, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science. Articles were examined for evidence of patient navigation interventions used in cancer care in LMICs. Evidence was synthesized by navigation service provided and by type of outcome. Results Fourteen studies reported on patient navigation interventions in cancer care in low-income and middle-income countries in Asia, South America, and Africa. Most studies reported on women’s cancers and included navigation interventions at most points along the cancer care continuum i.e. awareness, education, screening participation, adherence to treatment and surveillance protocols. Conclusion Few studies report on cancer patient navigation in LMICs. With the use of an implementation science framework, patient navigation research can explore a broader range of outcomes to better evaluate its potential role in improving cancer control in LMICs."
https://openalex.org/W2980529810,"Algorithmic differentiation (AD) is an alternative to finite differences (FD) for evaluating function derivatives. The primary aim of this study was to demonstrate the computational benefits of using AD instead of FD in OpenSim-based trajectory optimization of human movement. The secondary aim was to evaluate computational choices including different AD tools, different linear solvers, and the use of first- or second-order derivatives. First, we enabled the use of AD in OpenSim through a custom source code transformation tool and through the operator overloading tool ADOL-C. Second, we developed an interface between OpenSim and CasADi to solve trajectory optimization problems. Third, we evaluated computational choices through simulations of perturbed balance, two-dimensional predictive simulations of walking, and three-dimensional tracking simulations of walking. We performed all simulations using direct collocation and implicit differential equations. Using AD through our custom tool was between 1.8 ± 0.1 and 17.8 ± 4.9 times faster than using FD, and between 3.6 ± 0.3 and 12.3 ± 1.3 times faster than using AD through ADOL-C. The linear solver efficiency was problem-dependent and no solver was consistently more efficient. Using second-order derivatives was more efficient for balance simulations but less efficient for walking simulations. The walking simulations were physiologically realistic. These results highlight how the use of AD drastically decreases computational time of trajectory optimization problems as compared to more common FD. Overall, combining AD with direct collocation and implicit differential equations decreases the computational burden of trajectory optimization of human movement, which will facilitate their use for biomechanical applications requiring the use of detailed models of the musculoskeletal system."
https://openalex.org/W2980793079,"In order to investigate how high school students and researchers perceive science-related (STEM) subjects, we introduce forma mentis networks. This framework models how people conceptually structure their stance, mindset or forma mentis toward a given topic. In this study, we build forma mentis networks revolving around STEM and based on psycholinguistic data, namely free associations of STEM concepts (i.e., which words are elicited first and associated by students/researchers reading “science”?) and their valence ratings concepts (i.e., is “science” perceived as positive, negative or neutral by students/researchers?). We construct separate networks for (Ns = 159) Italian high school students and (Nr = 59) interdisciplinary professionals and researchers in order to investigate how these groups differ in their conceptual knowledge and emotional perception of STEM. Our analysis of forma mentis networks at various scales indicate that, like researchers, students perceived “science” as a strongly positive entity. However, differently from researchers, students identified STEM subjects like “physics” and “mathematics” as negative and associated them with other negative STEM-related concepts. We call this surrounding of negative associations a negative emotional aura. Cross-validation with external datasets indicated that the negative emotional auras of physics, maths and statistics in the students’ forma mentis network related to science anxiety. Furthermore, considering the semantic associates of “mathematics” and “physics” revealed that negative auras may originate from a bleak, dry perception of the technical methodology and mnemonic tools taught in these subjects (e.g., calculus rules). Overall, our results underline the crucial importance of emphasizing nontechnical and applied aspects of STEM disciplines, beyond purely methodological teaching. The quantitative insights achieved through forma mentis networks highlight the necessity of establishing novel pedagogic and interdisciplinary links between science, its real-world complexity, and creativity in science learning in order to enhance the impact of STEM education, learning and outreach activities."
https://openalex.org/W2980392422,"Introduction People with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have a distinctive behavioral phenotype that includes intellectual disability, compulsivity, inattention, inflexibility and insistence on sameness. Inflexibility and inattention are at odds with the cognitive flexibility and attention to social cues needed to accurately perceive the social world, and implicate problems in social cognition. This study assessed two social cognition domains in people with PWS; emotion recognition and social perception. We identified changes in social cognition over an approximate two-year time period (M = 2.23 years), relative strengths and weakness in social cognition, and correlates and predictors of social cognition. Methods Emotion recognition and social perception were examined at two time points in 94 individuals with PWS aged 5 to 62 years (M = 13.81, SD = 10.69). Tasks administered included: standardized IQ testing; parent-completed measures of inattention and inflexibility; standard emotion recognition photos (fear, sadness, anger, happy); and videotaped social perception vignettes depicting negative events with either sincere/benign or insincere/hostile interactions between peers. Results An atypical trajectory of negative emotion recognition emerged, marked by similar levels of poor performances across age, and confusion between sad and anger that is typically resolved in early childhood. Recognition of sad and fear were positively correlated with IQ. Participants made gains over time detecting social cues, but not in forming correct conclusions about the intentions of others. Accurately judging sincere intentions remained a significant weakness over time. Relative to sincere intentions, participant's performed significantly better in detecting negative social cues, and correctly judging trickery, deceit and lying. Age, IQ, inattention, and recognition of happy and sad accounted for 29% of variance in social perception. Conclusion Many people with PWS have deficits in recognizing sad, anger and fear, and accurately perceiving the sincere intentions of other people. The impact of these deficits on social behavior and relationships need to be better understood."
https://openalex.org/W2980626487,"In the 60 years since Skoog and Miller first reported the chemical redirection of plant growth the underlying biochemical mechanisms are still poorly understood, with one challenge being the capacity for applied growth regulators to act indirectly or be metabolized to active phytohormones. We hypothesized that tryptophan is metabolized to auxin, melatonin or serotonin inducing organogenesis in St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.). Root explants from two germplasm lines of St. John’s wort with altered melatonin metabolism and wildtype were incubated with auxin or tryptophan for 24, 48 or 72 h to induce regeneration. In wildtype, tryptophan had little effect on the indoleamine pathway, and was found to promote primary growth, suggesting excess tryptophan moved quickly through various secondary metabolite pathways and protein synthesis. In lines 4 and 112 tryptophan was associated with modified morphogenesis, indoleamine and auxin levels. Incubation with tryptophan increased shoot organogenesis while incubation with auxin led to root regeneration. The established paradigm of thought views tryptophan primarily as a precursor for auxin and indoleamines, among other metabolites, and mediation of auxin action by the indoleamines as a one-way interaction. We propose that these processes run in both directions with auxin modifying indoleamine biosynthesis and the melatonin:serotonin balance contributing to its effects on plant morphogenesis, and that tryptophan also functions as an inductive signal to mediate diverse phytochemical and morphogenetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2980974803,"Excessive competition for biomedical faculty positions has ratcheted up the need to accumulate some mix of high-quality publications and prestigious grants to move from a training position to university faculty. How universities value each of these attributes when considering faculty candidates is critical for understanding what is needed to succeed as academic faculty. In this study, I analyzed publicly available NIH grant information to determine the grants first-time R01 (FTR01) awardees held during their training period. Increases in the percentage of the FTR01 population that held a training award demonstrate these awards are becoming a more common component of a faculty candidate’s resume. The increase was largely due to an expansion of NIH K-series career development awards between 2000 and 2017. FTR01 awardees with a K01, K08, K23, or K99 award were overrepresented in a subset of institutions, whereas FTR01 awardees with F32 fellowships and those with no training award were evenly distributed across institutions. Finally, training awardees from the largest institutions were overrepresented in the faculty of the majority of institutions, echoing data from other fields where a select few institutions supply an overwhelming majority of the faculty for the rest of the field. These data give important insight into how trainees compete for NIH funding and faculty positions and how institutions prefer those with or without training awards."
https://openalex.org/W2981046483,"This study focuses on social pedestrian groups in public spaces and makes an effort to identify the type of social relation between the group members. As a first step for this identification problem, we focus on dyads (i.e. 2 people groups). Moreover, as a mutually exclusive categorization of social relations, we consider the domain-based approach of Bugental, which precisely corresponds to social relations of colleagues, couples, friends and families, and identify each dyad with one of those relations. For this purpose, we use anonymized trajectory data and derive a set of observables thereof, namely, inter-personal distance, group velocity, velocity difference and height difference. Subsequently, we use the probability density functions (pdf) of these observables as a tool to understand the nature of the relation between pedestrians. To that end, we propose different ways of using the pdfs. Namely, we introduce a probabilistic Bayesian approach and contrast it to a functional metric one and evaluate the performance of both methods with appropriate assessment measures. This study stands out as the first attempt to automatically recognize social relation between pedestrian groups. Additionally, in doing that it uses completely anonymous data and proves that social relation is still possible to recognize with a good accuracy without invading privacy. In particular, our findings indicate that significant recognition rates can be attained for certain categories and with certain methods. Specifically, we show that a very good recognition rate is achieved in distinguishing colleagues from leisure-oriented dyads (families, couples and friends), whereas the distinction between the leisure-oriented dyads results to be inherently harder, but still possible at reasonable rates, in particular if families are restricted to parent-child groups. In general, we establish that the Bayesian method outperforms the functional metric one due, probably, to the difficulty of the latter to learn observable pdfs from individual trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W2981284551,"BackgroundThere are limited data on the treatment outcomes of adolescents living with HIV. Our objective was to compare mortality and loss to follow up (LTFU) rates between adolescent and younger age groups at enrollment in care.MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study carried out in eight health facilities in two regions of Ethiopia. Adolescents (age 10–14 and 15–19 year) and children (age 0–9 year) enrolled in chronic HIV care between 2005 and 2013 constituted the study population. We reviewed the individual patient charts between March and June 2014 and updated the data on the status of each patient through December 2015. We used death and loss-to-follow up as primary endpoints and used the Cox-regression analysis where age, categorized as adolescent versus child, was the main predictor variable.ResultsOf 2058 participants studied, 52.1% were adolescents. The cohort contributed 2422 person-years of observation (PYO) during the pre-ART follow-up, whereas 1531 patients put on ART contributed 5984 PYO. Of those put on ART, 209 (13.7%) LTFU and 92 (6%) deaths were reported. Adolescents in age group 15–19 yr had the highest risk of LTFU [adjusted hazard ratio, aHR (95% CI) = 3.1 2.1, 5.0 ] followed by those in age group 10–14 yr (aHR = 1.5 [0.9, 2.3]) compared with children aged 0–9 yr. Mortality hazard was significantly higher among younger adolescents (aHR = 2.8 [1.4, 5.4]) and older adolescents (aHR = 2.3 [1.1, 4.9]) compared with children.ConclusionsAdolescents are at higher risk of mortality and LTFU as compared to children ages 0–9. Younger adolescents and children had similar LTFU rates. Narrow age band disaggregated analysis can serve as useful guide for tailoring interventions to the specific needs of different age groups.

https://openalex.org/W2980646354,"The effects of photo-degradation on the utilization of pesticides in agricultural production has been investigated. Various influencing factors were compared, with results showing that the initial pesticide concentration, light source, water quality and pH possessed different effects on neonicotinoids photo-degradation. The initial concentration and pH were found to be most critical effects. The photo-degradation rate decreased by a factor of 2-4 when the initial concentration increased from 5 mg L-1 to 20 mg L-1, particularly for acetamiprid and imidacloprid. The photo-degradation pathways and products of the five neonicotinoids were also investigated, with similar pathways found for each pesticide, except for acetamiprid. Degradation pathways mainly involved photo-oxidation processes, with products identified using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS) found to be consistent with literature reported results. Bamboo vinegar exerted a photo-quenching effect on the neonicotinoids, with an improved efficiency at higher vinegar concentrations. The photo-quenching rates of thiamethoxam and dinotefuran were 381.58% and 310.62%, respectively, when a 30-fold dilution of vinegar was employed. The photo-degradation products in bamboo vinegar were identical to those observed in methanol, with acetic acid being the main factor influencing the observed quenching effects."
https://openalex.org/W2980847063,"Olive (Olea europaea L.) is a major fruit crop in the Mediterranean Basin. Ex-situ olive management is essential to ensure optimal use of genetic resources in breeding programs. The Worldwide Olive Germplasm Bank of Córdoba (WOGBC), Spain, and Marrakech (WOGBM), Morocco, are currently the largest existing olive germplasm collections. Characterization, identification, comparison and authentication of all accessions in both collections could thus provide useful information for managing olive germplasm for its preservation, exchange within the scientific community and use in breeding programs. Here we applied 20 microsatellite markers (SSR) and 11 endocarp morphological traits to discriminate and authenticate 1091 olive accessions belonging to WOGBM and WOGBC (554 and 537, respectively). Of all the analyzed accessions, 672 distinct SSR profiles considered as unique genotypes were identified, but only 130 were present in both collections. Combining SSR markers and endocarp traits led to the identification of 535 cultivars (126 in common) and 120 authenticated cultivars. No significant differences were observed between collections regarding the allelic richness and diversity index. We concluded that the genetic diversity level was stable despite marked contrasts in varietal composition between collections, which could be explained by their different collection establishment conditions. This highlights the extent of cultivar variability within WOGBs. Moreover, we detected 192 mislabeling errors, 72 of which were found in WOGBM. A total of 228 genotypes as molecular variants of 74 cultivars, 79 synonyms and 39 homonyms as new cases were identified. Both collections were combined to define the nested core collections of 55, 121 and 150 sample sizes proposed for further studies. This study was a preliminary step towards managing and mining the genetic diversity in both collections while developing collaborations between olive research teams to conduct association mapping studies by exchanging and phenotyping accessions in contrasted environmental sites."
https://openalex.org/W2980896748,"Ticks are vectors of infectious diseases of major importance in human and veterinary medicine. For epidemiological studies, accurate identification of ticks is crucial to define their potential role as vectors and to develop control and prevention strategies. Although morphological and molecular methods are widely used to identify ticks, an innovative approach using MALDI-TOF MS technology recently emerged as an alternative tool. Previous works showed that MALDI-TOF MS was highly effective in identifying ticks, but these works mainly tested tick specimens of different genera. To confirm the accuracy of this new tool for tick identification, nine closely related tick species belonging to the Ixodes genus were analysed, specimens of the Dermacentor reticulatus species were also included in the analysis as an outer group. Three of the species used for the present study belonged to the I. ricinus species complex, which are known to transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. A total of 246 tick specimens were submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and two body parts (half-idiosoma and four legs) were individually investigated. For each body part, intraspecies reproducibility and interspecies specificity of the MS profiles were determined. The profile analysis revealed that the main determinant for spectra clustering was the tick species for both legs and half-idiosoma. For each body part, a reference database of spectra was set up including 2 to 5 specimens per species randomly selected, and genotyped using 16s rDNA and COI genes to confirm their morphological identification. Both created spectral databases were individually blind tested with their respective body part using the remaining specimens, which were correctly identified in 98.5% of the cases. MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable tool for tick identification, including specimens belonging to closely related species and hardly distinguishable using morphology. The 4-legs as well as the half-idiosoma of ticks can now be applied for specimen identification using two different databases. The combined use of these two body parts improves the rate of tick identification and their confidence level."
https://openalex.org/W2980375471,"Aedes albopictus is a viable vector for several infectious diseases such as Zika, West Nile, Dengue viruses and others. Originating from Asia, this invasive species is rapidly expanding into North American temperate areas and urbanized places causing major concerns for public health. Previous analyses show that warm temperatures and high humidity during the mosquito season are ideal conditions for A. albopictus development, while its distribution is correlated with population density. To better understand A. albopictus expansion into urban places it is important to consider the role of both environmental and neighborhood factors. The present study aims to assess the relative importance of both environmental variables and neighborhood factors in the prediction of A. albopictus’ presence in Southeast Pennsylvania using MaxEnt (version 3.4.1) machine-learning algorithm. Three models are developed that include: (1) exclusively environmental variables, (2) exclusively neighborhood factors, and (3) a combination of environmental variables and neighborhood factors. Outcomes from the three models are compared in terms of variable importance, accuracy, and the spatial distribution of predicted A. albopictus’ presence. All three models predicted the presence of A. albopictus in urban centers, however, each to a different spatial extent. The combined model resulted in the highest accuracy (74.7%) compared to the model with only environmental variables (73.5%) and to the model with only neighborhood factors (72.1%) separately. Although the combined model does not essentially increase the accuracy in the prediction, the spatial patterns of mosquito distribution are different when compared to environmental or neighborhood factors alone. Environmental variables help to explain conditions associated with mosquitoes in suburban/rural areas, while neighborhood factors summarize the local conditions that can also impact mosquito habitats in predominantly urban places. Overall, the present study shows that MaxEnt is suitable for integrating neighborhood factors associated with mosquito presence that can complement and improve species distribution modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2980513311,"Introduction Thrombocytopenia is well recognized as a poor prognosis sign associated with increased mortality and prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, particularly in septic patients. Mean platelet volume (MPV) could represent a relevant predictive marker of mortality. Here we investigated whether MPV kinetics during the first 15 days after hospital admission has a potential prognostic value for clinical outcome in septic shock. Methods We performed a retrospectively analysis of a cohort of 301 septic patients admitted in ICU. Three-month mortality was the primary endpoint. The prognostic value of the covariates of interest was ascertained by multidimensional analysis. We proposed a classification and regression trees analysis to predict survival probability. Results MPV kinetics was significantly different between 90-day survivors and non-survivors when followed during 15 days (except on day 3). 10-day MPV >11.6fL was an independent predictive factor of 90-day mortality (Hazard Ratio (HR) 3.796, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.96–7.35], p = 0.0001) in multivariate analysis. Base excess on day 4 <1.9mmol/L was also a predictive factor of mortality (HR 2.972, 95%CI [1.38–6.40], p = 0.0054. Conclusion MPV increase during the first 15 days after ICU admission in non-survivors was observed during septic shock and 10-day MPV >11.6fL was an independent predictive factor of 90-day mortality. This could be explained by the emergent response to acute platelet loss during septic shock, leading to megakaryocyte rupture to produce new but potentially immature platelets in the circulation. Therefore, continuous monitoring of MPV may be a useful parameter to stratify mortality risk in septic shock."

https://openalex.org/W2980811667,"Background While various initiatives have been taken to improve advance care planning in nursing homes, it is difficult to find enough details about interventions to allow comparison, replication and translation into practice. Objectives We report on the development and description of the ACP+ program, a multi-component theory-based program that aims to implement advance care planning into routine nursing home care. We aimed to 1) specify how intervention components can be delivered; 2) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the program; 3) describe the final program in a standardized manner. Design To develop and model the intervention, we applied multiple study methods including a literature review, expert discussions and individual and group interviews with nursing home staff and management. We recruited participants through convenience sampling. Setting and participants Management and staff (n = 17) from five nursing homes in Flanders (Belgium), a multidisciplinary expert group and a palliative care nurse-trainer. Methods The work was carried out by means of 1) operationalization of key intervention components–identified as part of a previously developed theory on how advance care planning is expected to lead to its desired outcomes in nursing homes–into specific activities and materials, through expert discussions and review of existing advance care planning programs; 2) evaluation of feasibility and acceptability of the program through interviews with nursing home management and staff and expert revisions; and 3) standardized description of the final program according to the TIDieR checklist. During step 2, we used thematic analysis. Results The original program with nine key components was expanded to include ten intervention components, 22 activities and 17 materials to support delivery into routine nursing home care. The final ACP+ program includes ongoing training and coaching, management engagement, different roles and responsibilities in organizing advance care planning, conversations, documentation and information transfer, integration of advance care planning into multidisciplinary meetings, auditing, and tailoring to the specific setting. These components are to be implemented stepwise throughout an intervention period. The program involves the entire nursing home workforce. The support of an external trainer decreases as nursing home staff become more autonomous in organizing advance care planning. Conclusions The multicomponent ACP+ program involves residents, family, and the different groups of people working in the nursing home. It is deemed feasible and acceptable by nursing home staff and management. The findings presented in this paper, alongside results of the subsequent randomized controlled cluster trial, can facilitate comparison, replicability and translation of the intervention into practice."
https://openalex.org/W2980466869,"This study presents data from the first observation of labor, childbirth and immediate newborn care in a clinical setting in Sindh, the second most populous province of Pakistan. Trained midwives observed 310 births at 126 district level referral facilities and primary health care facilities in 10 districts of Sindh where the USAID-funded Maternal Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) was implemented. The facility participation rate was 78%. The findings show that monitoring vital signs during the initial examination was conducted for less than one-in-ten women. Infection prevention practices were only observed for one-in-four women. Modesty was preserved for less than half of women. In spite of an absence of monitoring during the first and second stages of labor, providers augmented labor with oxytocin in two-thirds of births. To prevent post-partum hemorrhage, oxytocin was administered within a minute of birth in 51% of cases. Immediate drying of the baby was nearly universal and eight out of ten babies were wrapped in a dry towel. Newborn vital signs and the baby's weight were taken in one-in-ten cases. Breastfeeding was initiated during the first hour of birth in 18% of cases. A support-person was present during labor and birth for 90% of women. While quality of care is poor across all facilities, the provision of care at district-level referral facilities was even lower quality than at primary health care facilities. This is because dais or assistants without formal training provided labor, birth, and newborn care for 40% of deliveries during night shifts at referral facilities. This study found many examples of suboptimal practice by skilled birth attendants across all levels of health facilities. There remains an urgent need to improve quality of service provision among skilled birth attendants in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W2980971688,"Public transit, especially urban rail systems, plays a vital role in shaping commuting patterns. Compared with census data and survey data, large-scale and real-time big data can track the impacts of urban policy implementations at finer spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, this study proposed a multi-level analytical framework using transit smartcard data to examine urban commuting dynamics in response to rail transit upgrades. The study area was Shenzhen, one of the most highly urbanized and densely populated cities in China, which provides the opportunity to examine the effects of rail transit upgrades on commuting patterns in a rapidly developing urban context. Changes in commuting patterns were examined at three levels: city, region, and individual. At the city level, we considered the average commuting time, commuting speed, and commuting distance across the whole city. At the region level, we analyzed changes in the job accessibility of residential zones. Finally, this study evaluated the potential effects of rail transit upgrades on the jobs-housing relationship at the individual level. Difference-in-difference models were used for causal inference between rail transit upgrades and commuting patterns. In the very short term, the opening of new rail transit lines resulted in no significant changes in overall commuting patterns across the whole city; however, two effects of rail transit upgrades on commuting patterns were identified. First, rail transit upgrades enhanced regional connectivity between residential zones and employment centers, thus improving job accessibility. Second, rail transit improvement increased the commuting distances of individuals and contributed to the separation of workplaces and residences. This study provides meaningful insights into the effects of rail transit upgrades on commuting patterns."

A widely used analytical method is indirect determination using HPLC with UV detection of both types of melanin by their most abundant oxidation products: pyrrole-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (PDCA), pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA), thiazole-4,5-dicarboxylic acid (TDCA), and thiazole-2,4,5-tricarboxylic acid (TTCA). An increasing interest in pigmentation in biological research led us to develop a highly sensitive and selective method to identify and quantify these melanin markers in diverse biological samples with complex matrices. By introducing solid-phase extraction (SPE, reversed-phase) following alkaline oxidation we could significantly decrease background signals while maintaining recoveries greater than 70%. Our HPLC-UV-MS method allows for confident peak identification via exact mass information in corresponding UV signals used for quantitation. In addition to synthetic melanin and Sepia officinalis ink as reference compounds eumelanin markers were detected in brown human hair and a brown bivalve shell (Mytilus edulis). Brown feathers from the common chicken (Gallus g. domesticus) yielded all four eumelanin and pheomelanin markers. The present method can be easily adapted for a wide range of future studies on biological samples with unknown melanin content."
https://openalex.org/W2981264595,"The rambling and trembling analysis separates the center of pressure (COP) fluctuations into two components: rambling (supraspinal contribution) and trembling (muscle stiffness / reflexive properties contribution). We examined whether the trembling component is correlated to the contractile properties (muscle stiffness and contraction time) of lower limb superficial skeletal muscles to experimentally test the rambling and trembling hypothesis. We hypothesized that muscle stiffness and contraction time, would be: (a) more correlated with; and (b) have a greater impact on the trembling component compared to the rambling component. Thirty-two healthy young adults were recruited for the study and tensiomyography was used to assess mechanical muscle responses to a single electrical stimulus to calculate muscle stiffness and contraction time based on radial muscle belly displacement measurements of lower limb muscles unilaterally. Moreover, upright postural control was assessed using a force plate to record ground reaction forces and moments and calculate the COP fluctuations during two 30 seconds trials. From the COP fluctuations, rambling and trembling time series were extracted, and all fluctuation time series were described using a number of different time-domain and frequency-domain parameters in both the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Our results demonstrated that both muscle stiffness and contraction time were moderately correlated with time-domain and frequency-domain parameters of the trembling component, as compared with those of the rambling component which was not as well correlated. Moreover, they also predicted the trembling component better. Overall, these results imply that postural control during quiet stance is, in part, related to intrinsic muscle stiffness in the lower extremities. Moreover, we showed that the rambling and trembling hypothesis is effective in separating postural sway fluctuations during upright posture to extract the contributions of muscle stiffness / reflexive properties (trembling), and likely the supraspinal contribution (rambling)."
https://openalex.org/W2980490344,"Regular plasma HIV-RNA testing for persons living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is now the global standard, but as many as 60% of persons in Africa today on ART do not have access to standard laboratory HIV-RNA assays. As a result, patients in Zambia often receive treatment without any means of determining true virologic failure, which poses a risk of premature switch of ART regimens and widespread HIV drug resistance. Dry blood spots (DBS) on the other hand require unskilled personnel and less complex storage supply chain so are ideal to capture viral-load results from HIV patients outside clinic settings. We assess collection of DBS in the community using non-medically trained personnel (NMP) and documented challenges. We trained 23 NMP to collect DBS from lost to follow-up (LTFU) patients in 4 rural and urban Zambian districts. We developed a phlebotomy box to transport DBS without contamination at ambient temperature and concomitant training and standard operating procedures. We evaluated this through field observations, bi-weekly meetings, reports, and staff meetings. The laboratory assessed DBS quality for testing validity. We attempted to collect DBS from 357 participants in the community. Though individual reasons for refusal from the remaining 37% were not collected, NMPs reported privacy concerns, awkward box-size which drew attention in the community and fears of undisclosed uses of samples related to witchcraft and circulating narratives about past research. Successful DBS collection was not associated with patient gender, age, time on ART, enrolment CD4, facility. DBS viral-load collection by NMP is feasible in Zambia. Our training approach and assessments of NMP not part of the health system can be extended to patients by giving them more responsibility to manage their own differentiated care groups. Concerted efforts that compare collection of DBS by NMP to those collected by skilled-medical personnel are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2980542575,"Preclinical and clinical data have shown that D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex, augments the retention of fear extinction in animals and the therapeutic learning from exposure therapy in humans. However, studies with non-clinical human samples in de novo fear conditioning paradigms have demonstrated minimal to no benefit of DCS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of DCS on the retention of extinction learning following de novo fear conditioning in a clinical sample. Eighty-one patients with social anxiety disorder were recruited and underwent a previously validated de novo fear conditioning and extinction paradigm over the course of three days. Of those, only 43 (53%) provided analyzable data. During conditioning on Day 1, participants viewed images of differently colored lamps, two of which were followed by with electric shock (CS+) and a third which was not (CS-). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg DCS or placebo, administered in a double-blind manner 1 hour prior to extinction training with a single CS+ in a distinct context. Day 3 consisted of tests of extinction recall and renewal. The primary outcome was skin conductance response to conditioned stimuli, and shock expectancy ratings were examined as a secondary outcome. Results showed greater skin conductance and expectancy ratings in response to the CS+ compared to CS- at the end of conditioning. As expected, this difference was no longer present at the end of extinction training, but returned at early recall and renewal phases on Day 3, showing evidence of return of fear. In contrast to hypotheses, DCS had no moderating influence on skin conductance response or expectancy of shock during recall or renewal phases. We did not find evidence of an effect of DCS on the retention of extinction learning in humans in this fear conditioning and extinction paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2980357143,"We propose a new model of the read-out of spike trains that exploits the multivariate structure of responses of neural ensembles. Assuming the point of view of a read-out neuron that receives synaptic inputs from a population of projecting neurons, synaptic inputs are weighted with a heterogeneous set of weights. We propose that synaptic weights reflect the role of each neuron within the population for the computational task that the network has to solve. In our case, the computational task is discrimination of binary classes of stimuli, and weights are such as to maximize the discrimination capacity of the network. We compute synaptic weights as the feature weights of an optimal linear classifier. Once weights have been learned, they weight spike trains and allow to compute the post-synaptic current that modulates the spiking probability of the read-out unit in real time. We apply the model on parallel spike trains from V1 and V4 areas in the behaving monkey macaca mulatta, while the animal is engaged in a visual discrimination task with binary classes of stimuli. The read-out of spike trains with our model allows to discriminate the two classes of stimuli, while population PSTH entirely fails to do so. Splitting neurons in two subpopulations according to the sign of the weight, we show that population signals of the two functional subnetworks are negatively correlated. Disentangling the superficial, the middle and the deep layer of the cortex, we show that in both V1 and V4, superficial layers are the most important in discriminating binary classes of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2980549389,"Animal exchanges are considered the major pathway for between-farm transmission of many livestock infectious diseases. Yet, vehicles and operators visiting several farms during routine activities can also contribute to disease spread. Indeed, if contaminated, they can act as mechanical vectors of fomites, generating indirect contacts between visited farms. While data on animal exchanges is often available in national databases, information about the daily itineraries of trucks and operators is rare because difficult to obtain. Thus, some unavoidable approximations have been frequently introduced in the description of indirect contacts in epidemic models. Here, we showed that the level of detail in such description can significantly affect the predictions on disease dynamics. Our analyses focused on the potential spread of a disease in a dairy farm system subject of a comprehensive data collection campaign on calf transportations. We developed two temporal multilayer networks to model between-farm contacts generated by either animal exchanges (direct contacts) and connections operated by trucks moving calves (indirect contacts). The complete model used the full knowledge of the daily trucks’ itineraries, while the partial informed one used only a subset of such available information. To account for various conditions of pathogen survival ability and effectiveness of cleaning operations, we performed a sensitivity analysis on trucks’ contamination period. An accurate description of indirect contacts was crucial both to correctly predict the final size of epidemics and to identify the seed farms responsible for generating the most severe outbreaks. The importance of detailed information emerged even more clearly in the case of short contamination periods. Our conclusions could be extended to between-farm contacts generated by other vehicles and operators. Overcoming these information gaps would be decisive for a deeper understanding of epidemic spread in livestock and to develop effective control plans."
https://openalex.org/W2980647155,"The present study evaluates the effect of flaxseed oil (FXO) supplementation on adipose tissue macrophages (ATM’s), E and D series resolvin (Rv) levels and adipose tissue inflammation. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups (n = 5): lean group (given standard chow diet), HFD group given high fat diet (approx. 18 weeks) till they developed insulin resistance and 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg group (HFD group later orally supplemented with 4, 8 or 16 mg/kg body weight flaxseed oil) for 4 weeks.The present study showed that FXO supplementation led to enhanced DHA, EPA, RvE1-E2, RvD2, RvD5- D6, IL-4, IL-10 and arginase 1 levels in ATMs together with altered immune cell infiltration and reduced NF-κB expression. The FXO supplementation suppresses immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue and alters adipose tissue macrophage phenotype towards the anti-inflammatory state via enhancement of E and D series resolvins, arginase 1 expression and anti-inflammatory cytokines level (IL-4 and IL-10.) leading to amelioration of insulin resistance in flaxseed oil supplemented HFD mice."
https://openalex.org/W2980651593,"A short questionnaire which can be applied for assessing patient satisfaction in different contexts and different countries is to be developed.Six items addressing tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and communication were analysed. The first five items stem from SERVQUAL (SERVice QUALity), the last stems from the discussion about SERVQUAL. The analyses were performed with data from 12 surveys conducted in six different countries (England, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Spain) covering two different conditions (type 2 diabetes, stroke). Sample sizes for included participants are 247 in England, 160 in Finland, 231 in Germany, 152 in Greece, 316 in the Netherlands and 96 in Spain for the diabetes surveys; and 101 in England, 139 in Finland, 107 in Germany, 58 in Greece, 185 in the Netherlands, and 92 in Spain for the stroke surveys. The items were tested by (1) bivariate correlations between the items and an item addressing 'general satisfaction', (2) multivariate regression analyses with 'general satisfaction' as criterion and the items as predictors, and (3) bivariate correlations between sum scores and 'general satisfaction'.The correlations with 'general satisfaction' are 0.48 for tangibles, 0.56 for reliability, 0.58 for responsiveness, 0.47 for assurance, 0.53 for empathy, and 0.56 for communication. In the multivariate regression analysis, the regression coefficient for assurance is significantly negative while all other regression coefficients are significantly positive. In a multivariate regression analysis without the item 'assurance' all regression coefficients are positive. The correlation between the sum score and 'general satisfaction' is 0.608 for all six items and 0.618 for the finally remaining five items. The country specific results are similar.The five items which remain after removing 'assurance', i.e. the SERVQUAL-MOD-5, constitute a short patient satisfaction index which can usefully be applied for different medical conditions and in different countries."

There are several psychosocial factors associated with quality of life during CVD. Our main objectives were to analyze the roles of conscientiousness, subjective wellbeing and self-efficacy beliefs. The sample comprised 514 patients (mean age 63.57 years) who were assessed twice over a nine-month interval. At Time 1, participants answered a questionnaire assessing conscientiousness, perceived subjective wellbeing (positive and negative affect, life satisfaction), cardiac self-efficacy and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The same variables (except for conscientiousness) were re-assessed at Time 2. Results showed that conscientiousness had a positive relation with subjective wellbeing, cardiac self-efficacy, and HRQoL at Time 1. Moreover, cardiac self-efficacy at Time 1 had a positive longitudinal effect on HRQoL at Time 2, while controlling for autoregressive effects. Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between conscientiousness and HRQoL was mediated by positive affect and cardiac self-efficacy. These results suggest the usefulness of psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting positive affect and self-efficacy beliefs among CVD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2981013138,"Longitudinal-zonation hypotheses generally predict gradual changes in fish composition from upstream to downstream due to changes in habitat conditions, but largely disregard downstream effects on upstream segments. Floodplains of large rivers represent areas of high connectivity during flood periods and can act as stable refuges in dry seasons, which may attenuate deterministic constraints imposed by local conditions on fish assemblages in surrounding habitats. In this study, we investigated the effects of proximity to large rivers on taxonomic- and functional-diversity patterns of stream-fish assemblages in an extensive region of Central Amazonia. We sampled 31 headwater-stream reaches in nine catchments in the Purus and Madeira Rivers interfluve between December 2014 and March 2015. Ninety seven fish species from seven orders and 19 families were captured. The results indicate that distance to large rivers is more important than distance among sites and local conditions in explaining functional and taxonomic diversity of stream-fish assemblages at large spatial scales. We also found a decrease in taxonomic and functional richness towards headwaters, mainly related to the loss of benthic and sedentary species along the distance gradient. These species may be favored by the proximity to refuge areas and high resource availability near the floodplain. In contrast, upstream assemblages were mainly occupied by small-sized, nektonic species with higher dispersal capacity, highly dependent of allochthonous resources. Downstream effects could be detected for many kilometers upstream in hydrographic catchments and this reinforces the crucial role of connectivity between fluvial habitats in maintenance of stream-fish diversity patterns in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2981102893,"Rumen is an organ for supplying nutrients for the growth and production of bovine, which might function differently under grass-fed and grain-fed regimens considering the association of gene expression, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression. The objective of this study was to explore the potential mechanism influencing rumen function of grass-fed and grain-fed animals. Methylated DNA binding domain sequencing (MBD-Seq) and microRNA-Seq were respectively utilized to detect the DNA methylation and microRNA expression in rumen tissue of grass-fed and grain-fed Angus cattle. Combined analysis revealed that the expression of the differentially expressed genes ADAMTS3 and ENPP3 was correlated with the methylation abundance of the corresponding differentially methylated regions (DMRs) inside these two genes, and these two genes were reported to be respectively involved in biosynthesis and regulation of glycosyltransferase activity; the differentially expressed microRNA bta-mir-122 was predicted to possibly target the differentially expressed genes OCLN and RBM47, potentially affecting the rumen function; the microRNA bta-mir-655 was exclusively detected in grain-fed group; its targets were significantly enriched in insulin and TGF-beta signaling pathways, which might worked together to regulate the function of rumen, resulting in different characteristics between grass-fed and grain-fed cattle. Collectively, our results provided insights into understanding the mechanisms determining rumen function and unraveled the biological basis underlying the economic traits to improve the productivity of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2980774216,"Cranial cruciate ligament disease (CCLD) is a complex trait. Ten measurements were made on orthogonal distal pelvic limb radiographs of 161 pure and mixed breed dogs with, and 55 without, cranial cruciate partial or complete ligament rupture. Dogs with CCLD had significantly smaller infrapatellar fat pad width, higher average tibial plateau angle, and were heavier than control dogs. The first PC weightings captured the overall size of the dog’s stifle and PC2 weightings reflected an increasing tibial plateau angle coupled with a smaller fat pad width. Of these dogs, 175 were genotyped, and 144,509 polymorphisms were used in a genome-wide association study with both a mixed linear and a multi-locus model. For both models, significant (pgenome <3.46×10−7 for the mixed and< 6.9x10-8 for the multilocus model) associations were found for PC1, tibial diaphyseal length and width, fat pad base length, and femoral and tibial condyle width at LCORL, a known body size-regulating locus. Other body size loci with significant associations were growth hormone 1 (GH1), which was associated with the length of the fat pad base and the width of the tibial diaphysis, and a region on CFAX near IRS4 and ACSL4 in the multilocus model. The tibial plateau angle was associated significantly with a locus on CFA10 in the linear mixed model with nearest candidate genes BET1 and MYH9 and on CFA08 near candidate genes WDHD1 and GCH1. MYH9 has a major role in osteoclastogenesis. Our study indicated that tibial plateau slope is associated with CCLD and a compressed infrapatellar fat pad, a surrogate for stifle osteoarthritis. Because of the association between tibial plateau slope and CCLD, and pending independent validation, these candidate genes for tibial plateau slope may be tested in breeds susceptible to CCLD before they develop disease or are bred."
https://openalex.org/W2981043695,"Purpose Endovascular embolization nowadays is a well-established treatment option for direct carotid cavernous fistulas (dCCF, Barrow Type A). There are many publications on the complication and success rates of this method. However, little is known on the patients´ opinion on the treatment result after several years. We report on this issue also including the “pioneer patients” treated almost two decades ago. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patient (n = 25) with a more than 24 months follow-up interval after endovascular treatment of a dCCF at our institution from 01/1999 to 08/2018. We determined primary therapy success, complication rate, state of the fistula in the last imaging follow-up and quoted the patient’s subjective perception of the long-term treatment success using a standardized interview form. Results Occlusion rate in the last imaging follow up was 96% (24/25) with a complication rate of 8% (2/25). The response rate on our interview request was 96% (24/25) with a rate of considered feedback of 84% (21/25 patients). Duration of our observation interval for the patient reported outcome was 143 months / 11 years (median, range: 35–226 m / 2–18 y). Most of them (21/25, 84%) felt they benefited from the treatment. Conclusions Endovascular supply of dCCF is a highly effective treatment method leading to a sustainable therapy success with long-lasting stable subjective benefit even to our “pioneer patients” treated almost two decades ago."
https://openalex.org/W2981317639,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notoriously difficult to treat due to its aggressive, ever resilient nature. A major drawback lies in its tumor grade; a phenomenon observed across various carcinomas, where highly differentiated and undifferentiated tumor grades, termed as low and high grade respectively, are found in the same tumor. One eminent problem due to such heterogeneity is drug resistance in PDAC. This has been implicated to ABC transporter family of proteins that are upregulated in PDAC patients. However, the regulation of these transporters with respect to tumor grade in PDAC is not well understood. To combat these issues, a study was designed to identify novel genes that might regulate drug resistance phenotype and be used as targets. By integrating epigenome with transcriptome data, several genes were identified based around high grade PDAC. Further analysis indicated oncogenic PAX2 transcription factor as a novel regulator of drug resistance in high grade PDAC cell lines. It was observed that silencing of PAX2 resulted in increased susceptibility of high grade PDAC cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, the study showed that PAX2 protein can bind and alter transcriptionally; expression of many ABC transporter genes in high grade PDAC cell lines. Overall, the study indicated that PAX2 significantly upregulated ABC family of genes resulting in drug resistance and poor survival in PDAC."

In the current study we aimed to evaluate the relationship of dietary acid load and cardio-metabolic risk factors with ten year survival among patients underwent CABG.The current prospective cohort study comprises 454 patients underwent CABG. Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical measurements were performed. Dietary acid load was calculated as either potential renal acid load (PRAL) or net endogenous acid production (NEPA) using the data obtained from a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method followed by log-rank test. The association between all-cause mortality and study parameters was performed with Cox-proportional hazard model.Patients in the higher PRAL and NEAP quartiles had lower BMI and lower ejection fraction rate (P <0.05). Moreover, lower hematocrit values were observed in patients of higher PRAL quartiles. Higher PRAL scores were associated with higher mortality rate and reduced survival days (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.023 (1.00-1.04; P-value = 0.01). However, there was no relationship between NEAP and survival.We revealed that high PRAL scores are positive predictors of 10-year mortality in patients underwent CABG. The results of our study suggest that maintaining an adequate acid-base balance can contribute to longevity by reducing the risk of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2980948452,"Diel variability of soil respiration is influenced by several factors including temperature and carbon allocation as the most significant ones, co-varying on multiple time scales. In an attempt to disentangle their effects we analyzed the dynamics of soil respiration components using data from a three-year soil respiration study. We measured CO2 efflux in intact, root-excluded and root- and mycorrhizal fungi excluded plots and analyzed the diel variability in different phenological stages. We used sine wave models to describe the diel pattern of soil respiration and to disentangle the effects of temperature from belowground carbon allocation based on the differences between component dynamics inferred from the fitted models. Rhizospheric respiration peaked 8–12 hours after GPP peak, while mycorrhizal fungi respiration had a longer time lag of 13–20 hours. Results of δ13CO2 isotopic signals from the respiration components showed similar patterns. It was found that drought affected the component respiration rates differently. Also, the speed and the amount of carbon allocation to the roots as well as to the mycorrhizal fungi was reduced under drought. We conclude that the diel variability of soil respiration is the result of the integrated patterns of temperature- and carbon allocation-driven components in dry grasslands and their share depends on their phenological stages and stress state."
https://openalex.org/W2981235717,"In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of a motor system that affects skills and strategies of expert dart throwers. Eight experts participated in our experiment and each subject performed 42 throws. Kinematics of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and dart were recorded by six high-speed cameras (200 Hz). The vertical error curve over time was calculated based on both hand and dart trajectories to clarify their relationship and interaction, which could attribute to their skills. Moreover, the kinematics of the dart (speed and direction) and angular kinematics of the elbow and wrist at the time of release were investigated to elucidate which parameters constitute the throwing strategies of experts. Experimental results showed that expert's throwing can be classified into two strategies, i.e., reducing timing sensitivity and reducing timing error. These strategies were derived from the spatial and temporal controls of the hand trajectory. Moreover, we confirmed that the speed of the dart and angular acceleration of the wrist joint at the time of release were highly correlated with the time-window for successful release. These results imply that the two strategies are characterized not only by a spatiotemporal relationship between the hand and dart trajectories, but also by relationships with release kinematic parameters of the proximal joint and the dart. Understanding characteristics which lead to strategies of skilled throwers would provide effective training methodology for beginners."

The 14α-Demethylase Inhibitors (DMIs) are important disease control fungicides, but they lose sensitivity in a rather gradual fashion, suggesting an underlying polygenic genetic mechanism. In spite of this, evidence found thus far suggests that P. fijiensis cyp51 gene mutations are the main responsible factor for sensitivity loss in the field. To better understand the mechanisms involved in DMI resistance, in this study we constructed a genetic map using DArTseq markers on two F1 populations generated by crossing two different DMI resistant strains with a sensitive strain. Analysis of the inheritance of DMI resistance in the F1 populations revealed two major and discrete DMI-sensitivity groups. This is an indicative of a single major responsible gene. Using the DMI-sensitivity scorings of both F1 populations and the generation of genetic linkage maps, the sensitivity causal factor was located in a single genetic region. Full agreement was found for genetic markers in either population, underlining the robustness of the approach. The two maps indicated a similar genetic region where the Pfcyp51 gene is found. Sequence analyses of the Pfcyp51 gene of the F1 populations also revealed a matching bimodal distribution with the DMI resistant. Amino acid substitutions in P. fijiensis CYP51 enzyme of the resistant progeny were previously correlated with the loss of DMI sensitivity. In addition, the resistant progeny inherited a Pfcyp51 gene promoter insertion, composed of a repeat element with a palindromic core, also previously correlated with increased gene expression. This genetic approach confirms that Pfcyp51 is the single explanatory gene for reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicides in the analysed P. fijiensis strains. Our study is the first genetic analysis to map the underlying genetic factors for reduced DMI efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2980629729,"Background Increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important component of the innate immune response, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing CRP expression and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP in a number of American Indian populations. Methods The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and association analyses. Results CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 ± 0.05, p<1.3 X 10−20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10−7), however, we found nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, 5, 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10−4. Conclusion In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other chromosomes that warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2980642974,"The eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is an important foundation species that is currently declining throughout eastern U.S. forests due to the exotic pests hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa). Hemlock is often replaced by deciduous tree species, such as black birch (Betula lenta), and has been shown to have large consequences for carbon dynamics due to a substantial loss of soil organic layer carbon storage in hemlock forests when replaced by birch and higher decomposition found in black birch stands. Soil carbon is one of the most important components of the global carbon cycle and has high potential to feedback to climate change when large portions of stored carbon are lost to the atmosphere. There is a general consensus that soil respiration increases with temperature, but there has yet to be a consensus on how temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is affected by various biotic and abiotic factors, such as soil moisture and substrate quality. In this study, the effects of soil temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration (Rs), the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10), and soil basal respiration (R10) were investigated for hemlock, young birch, and mature birch forest types annually for three years. The Rs values of the three forest types were primarily driven by soil temperature rather than by soil moisture across all years. Soil respiration data collected from hemlock, young birch, and mature birch stands were used to determine annual Q10 and R10 values. The Q10 and R10 values were not significantly different between forest stands, but they were significantly different over the three years. Determinants of Q10 and R10 differed between forest type, with soil moisture primarily influencing Q10 in hemlock and mature birch stands and soil temperature primarily influencing R10 in mature birch stands. The results suggest a complex interaction of soil moisture and soil temperature, and potentially substrate quality and quantity, as determinants of temperature sensitivities in eastern U.S. forests that have transitioned from hemlock-dominated to black birch-dominated forests."

https://openalex.org/W2980579572,"Implementation is a crucial component for the success of interventions in health service systems, as failure to implement well can have detrimental impacts on the effectiveness of evidence-based practices. Therefore, evaluations conducted in real-world contexts should consider how interventions are implemented and sustained. However, the complexity of healthcare environments poses considerable challenges to the evaluation of interventions and the impact of implementation efforts on the effectiveness of evidence-based practices. In consequence, implementation and intervention effectiveness are often assessed separately in health services research, which prevents the direct investigation of the relationships of implementation components and effectiveness of the intervention. This article describes multilevel decision juncture models based on advances in implementation research and causal inference to study implementation in health service systems. The multilevel decision juncture model is a theory-driven systems approach that integrates structural causal models with frameworks for implementation. This integration enables investigation of interventions and their implementation within a single model that considers the causal links between levels of the system. Using a hypothetical youth mental health intervention inspired by published studies from the health service research and implementation literature, we demonstrate that such theory-based systems models enable investigations of the causal pathways between the implementation outcomes as well as their links to patient outcomes. Results from Monte Carlo simulations also highlight the benefits of structural causal models for covariate selection as consistent estimation requires only the inclusion of a minimal set of covariates. Such models are applicable to real-world context using different study designs, including longitudinal analyses which facilitates the investigation of sustainment of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2980827265,"BACKGROUND The standard practice in treating uncomplicated malaria is to prescribe artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for only patients with positive test results. However, health workers (HWs) sometimes prescribe ACTs for patients with negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) results. Available evidence on HWs perception of mRDT and their level of compliance with test results in Nigeria lacks adequate stratification by state and context. We assessed HWs perception of mRDT and factors influencing ACTs prescription to patients with negative mRDT results in Ebonyi state, Nigeria. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 303 HWs who treat suspected malaria patients in 40 randomly selected public and private health facilities in Ebonyi state. Health workers' perception of mRDT was assessed with 18 equally weighted five-point likert scale questions with maximum obtainable total score of 90. Scores ≥72 were graded as good and less, as poor perception. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression model at 5% significance level. RESULTS Mean age of respondents was 34.6±9.4 years, 229 (75.6%) were females, 180 (59.4%) community health workers and 67 (22.1%) medical doctors. Overall, 114 (37.6%) respondents across healthcare facility strata had poor perception of mRDT. Respondents who prescribed ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results within six months preceding the survey were 154 (50.8%) [PHCs: 50 (42.4%), General hospitals: 18 (47.4%), tertiary facility: 51 (79.7%) and missionary hospitals: 35 (42.2%)]. Poor HWs' perception of mRDT promoted prescription of ACT to patients with negative mRDT results (AOR = 5.6, 95% C.I = 3.2-9.9). The likelihood of prescribing ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results was higher among HWs in public health facilities (AOR = 2.8, 95% C.I = 1.4-5.5) than those in the private. CONCLUSIONS The poor perception of mRDT and especially common prescribing of ACTs to patients with negative mRDT results among HWs in Ebonyi state calls for context specific interventions to improve their perception and compliance with mRDT test results."
https://openalex.org/W2980940375,"Late life depression is widely associated with lower quality of life and greater disability, making it an important target for prevention. Earlier randomized controlled trials [RCTs] demonstrated that speed of processing training [SOPT] led to reductions in depressive symptoms and clinical depression in community-dwelling adults. Our purpose was to evaluate depression outcomes related to SOPT among older adults who live in supported senior living settings. This two-arm, parallel RCT included 351 participants aged 55-102 years who resided in assisted and independent settings in 31 senior living communities. Participants were randomized within sites to computerized SOPT vs. computerized crossword puzzles with a targeted dose of 10 hours of playtime at baseline plus 4 hours of booster training at five and eleven months. Depression outcomes included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] scores, categorical levels, and dichotomous indicators. Random effects linear mixed effect models estimated SOPT effects in intention-to-treat complete case and multiple imputation analyses. Mean age of the sample was 81.0 years, 72.2% were women, and 41.0% resided in assisted living. At baseline 65.7% had no depression [PHQ-9 scores 3 [p = 0.016] and major depressive syndrome [p = 0.045] among the assisted living SOPT group. No significant change in depression was observed in the independent living SOPT or attention control groups. In summary, the SOPT known as Road Tour/Double Decision significantly increased, rather than decreased, the burden of depressive symptoms among participants residing in assisted living. Given these risks, this SOPT program should be avoided among older people in assisted living settings, and other SOPT interventions should be combined with systematic depression monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2981023182,"Background Tobacco smoking remains a public health problem among adolescents in the United States. While Web-based interventions for smoking prevention have been successful at the individual level, there is still an urgent need to understand their engagement capabilities and their effects at the social level. In the current study, we aimed to (1) learn about adolescents’ subjective experience with a Web-based program called a smoking prevention interactive experience (ASPIRE), (2) obtain suggestions for improvement in ASPIRE content, (3) identify psychological outcomes of ASPIRE, and (4) explore outcomes of social interaction. Materials and methods After a randomized controlled trial with 110 adolescents, 20 adolescent users of ASPIRE, aged 11–18, were randomly selected to participate in one-on-one interviews at four after-school programs in Houston, Texas. Interviews involved questions concerning adolescents’ experience with the intervention. Qualitative data were coded and analyzed using a constant comparison approach for the generation of themes. Results Describing their experience with ASPIRE, participants expressed comfort in material that is tailored to their demographic and preferred interactive activities over entertaining videos. Presenting suggestions for improvement, participants mainly reported the need to include gaming features into ASPIRE. Presenting psychological outcomes, they expressed emotional engagement in the program, shifts in attitudes and beliefs, and unwillingness to smoke. Finally, as outcomes of social interaction, participants reported engagement with others in discussions about tobacco and their need to hold smokers accountable for their actions. Conclusions Adolescents’ reports moved from their individual experience with ASPIRE to their active interactions with family members and friends and their attempt to persuade others to quit smoking. Future Web-based programs for adolescents may be designed with tailoring and game play in mind, in order to provide mobilization skills and foster social interactions against smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2980826481,"Transposable elements (TEs) have the main role in shaping the evolution of genomes and host species, contributing to the creation of new genes and promoting rearrangements frequently associated with new regulatory networks. Support for these hypotheses frequently results from studies with model species, and Drosophila provides a great model organism to the study of TEs. Micropia belongs to the Ty3/Gypsy group of long terminal repeats (LTR) retroelements and comprises one of the least studied Drosophila transposable elements. In this study, we assessed the evolutionary history of Micropia within Drosophilidae, while trying to assist in the classification of this TE. At first, we performed searches of Micropia presence in the genome of natural populations from several species. Then, based on searches within online genomic databases, we retrieved Micropia-like sequences from the genomes of distinct Drosophilidae species. We expanded the knowledge of Micropia distribution within Drosophila species. The Micropia retroelements we detected consist of an array of divergent sequences, which we subdivided into 20 subfamilies. Even so, a patchy distribution of Micropia sequences within the Drosophilidae phylogeny could be identified, with incongruences between the species phylogeny and the Micropia phylogeny. Comparing the pairwise synonymous distance (dS) values between Micropia and three host nuclear sequences, we found several cases of unexpectedly high levels of similarity between Micropia sequences in divergent species. All these findings provide a hypothesis to the evolution of Micropia within Drosophilidae, which include several events of vertical and horizontal transposon transmission, associated with ancestral polymorphisms and recurrent Micropia sequences diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2981201871,"Background Interatrial blocks are considered a new important risk factor for atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular events. Their prevalence and clinical implications have been reported in general population and several subgroups of patients but no data from HIV-infected populations, with a non-negligible prevalence of atrial fibrillation, has been previously reported. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in a previously enrolled cohort of randomly selected middle-aged HIV-infected patients who attended our hospital and were clinically stable. Patients underwent both a 12-lead rest electrocardiogram and clinical questionnaires while epidemiological, clinical and HIV-related variables were obtained from electronic medical records and interviews with the patients. Electrocardiograms were then analyzed and codified using a standardized form by two trained members of the research team who were blinded to clinical variables. Results We obtained electrocardiograms from 204 patients with a mean age of 55.22 years, 39 patients (19.12%) presented an interatrial block, 9 (4.41%) advanced and 30 (14.71%) partial. Patients with interatrial block had a lower nadir lymphocyte CD4 count (124 vs 198 cells, p = 0.02) while advanced interatrial blocks were associated to older age (62.16 vs. 54.95 years, p = 0.046) and hypertension (77.8% vs. 32.3%, p = 0.009). We did not find differences regarding baseline CD4 lymphocyte count or CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratio. Clinical variables and functional capacity among patients with or without interatrial block were similar. Conclusions In a cohort of clinically stable HIV infected patients the prevalence of interatrial blocks, specially advanced, is high and associated to previously known factors (age, hypertension) and novel ones (nadir CD4 lymphocyte count)."
https://openalex.org/W2980460191,"The purpose of the present research was to identify and examine materials demonstrating a previously undiscovered property of coherent poly propagation (CPP). The materials were amorphous silicates as natural precious opals. CPP enabled three-dimensional photonic control over mono and polychromatic visible light wavelengths. CPP caused coherent diffraction of incident poly and monochromatic light. Apart from the iconic play-of-color of precious opal, CPP specimens demonstrated diffractive photonic demultiplexing and/or upconversion and/or downconversion of incident light with strong photonic coherence such that the shape of the incident light source was propagated over three dimensions over multiple visible frequencies. CPP events manifested as each specimen was rocked under the incident light. Additionally, the specimens demonstrated atypical control over internally reflected and transmitted light. The specimens applied axial rotational symmetry over the incident light. Amorphous materials would be expected to exert no symmetry control. CPP and rotational properties occurred in isolation from exogenous thermal, photonic and electrical influences. Furthermore, several non-destructive analytical instruments were employed, such as: spectrophotometer, polariscope and refractometer. The analytical methods revealed unusual behaviors of these specimens. The application of materials demonstrating three-dimensional photonic control will have far-reaching implications for many industries, including: photonic wavelength demultiplexing, fiber optics, imaging, microscopy, projections, security, cryptography, computers and communications."
https://openalex.org/W2980692381,"The background advertisement exposure parameters (BAEP) forms a premise for sponsorship negotiation and the basis for estimating the sponsorship value of background advertising. Prediction of the BAEP has a great contribution to the sporting events organizers and sponsors in terms of negotiating, decision-making for bidding, and income-generating.Virtual Reality (VR), technology was utilized to construct a virtual three-dimensional model of the sports venue and simulate the telecast of the event. Based on VR technology and computer graphics theory, a pre-event prediction method for estimating the background advertisement exposure parameters of sporting events was put forward. The pre and post measures of the thirty BAEP of televised football games were compared to verify the effectiveness of the prediction method.There was no significant difference between the pre- and post-measurement results for the same football game. The pre- and post-measurement results of the thirty BAEP of televised football games were tightly matched.Using the prediction method can predict the BAEP of televised football games effectively and overcomes the shortcomings of current prediction methods that inhibits the effectiveness of the prediction of exposure parameters due to changes such as the type of the sporting events, the size of the sports venue, the layout of the background advertisements, and the placement of the television cameras, etc."
