This study focused on determining whether these novel growth-promoting effects are accompanied by the p38-mediated inhibition of apoptosis, and if so, what signaling pathways might be responsible. Primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were driven into apoptosis by treatments known to induce apoptosis in other cell types,e.g. incubation with anisomycin or overexpression constitutively active MEKK-1 (MEKK-1COOH), a protein that strongly activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase and N-terminal c-Jun kinase, but not p38. Overexpression of constitutively active MKK6, MKK6 (Glu), which selectively activates p38 in cardiac myocytes, protected cells from either anisomycin- or MEKK-1COOH-induced apoptosis. This protection was blocked by SB 203580, a selective p38 inhibitor. MKK6 (Glu) also activated transcription mediated by NF-κB, a factor which protects other cell types from apoptosis. The activation of NF-κB and the protection from apoptosis mediated by MKK6 (Glu) were both blocked by SB 203580. Interestingly, overexpression of a mutant form of I-κBα, which inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB, completely blocked MKK6 (Glu)-activated NF-κB but had little effect on MKK6s anti-apoptotic effects. These findings suggest that, in part, the overexpression of MKK6 (Glu) may foster growth and survival of cardiac myocytes by protecting them from apoptosis in a p38-dependent manner. Additionally, while NF-κB is activated in myocardial cells by p38, this does not appear to be the major mechanism by which MKK6 (Glu) exerts its anti-apoptotic effects in this cell type, suggesting a novel pathway for p38-mediated protection from apoptosis.

The proper growth, development, and function of most tissues requires the appropriate balance between cell growth and death (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about the molecular aspects of cell growth, the nuances of the mechanisms used by cells to regulate death have only recently begun to be appreciated. Among the most widely studied forms of cell death is apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, or cell “suicide” that is believed to be responsible for the deletion of unwanted cells during organ and tissue development, as well as pathologically induced tissue damage. Apoptosis is an energy-requiring molecular suicide program characterized by cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation into 200-base pair fragments (2Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H.

Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another form of cell death, necrosis, is usually the result of massive cell injury characterized by decreased mitochondrial function and ATP depletion, cytoplasmic swelling, membrane permeabilization, and DNA fragmentation into random sizes. In addition to being activated during development-related cell reduction, apoptosis can be triggered in many cell types by various stresses, including ionizing radiation, osmotic stress, expression of viral proteins such as E1A, and exposure to certain cytokines (7Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Myocardial cell apoptosis is believed to contribute to cardiac dysfunction, including ischemia/reperfusion injury, vascular wall remodeling, heart failure, and myocardial infarction (8Olivetti G. Abbi R. Quaini F. Kajstura J. Cheng W. Nitahara J.A. Quanin E. Loreto C.D. Beltrami C.A. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Anversa P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). For example, in humans the cardiomyopathy resulting from intractable congestive heart failure has been attributed in part to the loss of myocytes through apoptosis (9Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 1: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mimicking cardiac overload by stretching cultured myocardial cells initially activates myocyte growth (10Sadoshima J. Izumo S Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 11Cheng W. Li B. Kajstrua J. Li P. Wolin M.S. Sonnenblick E.H. Hintze T.H. Olivetti G. Anversa P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2247-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) but later induces myocyte apoptosis (12Kajstura J. Mansukhani M. Cheng W. Reiss K. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Quaini F. Sonnenblick E.H. Anversa P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is believed that although the initial response of the myocardium to overload may be cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, prolonged overload results in a remodeling of the myocardium that includes increases in fibroblast growth and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased numbers of cardiac myocytes, a result of apoptosis (13Teiger E. Dam T.-V. Richard L. Wisnewsky C. Tea B.-S. Gaboury L. Tremblay J. Schwartz K. Hamet P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2891-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Myocardial cell apoptosis may also serve important developmental roles (14MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 137-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the postnatal heart there is a decrease in right ventricular muscle mass that takes place as an adaptation to the decreased load in that chamber just after birth; this selective decrease in tissue mass, which takes place while the left ventricle continues to grow, is the result of chamber-specific apoptosis of cardiac myocytes (12Kajstura J. Mansukhani M. Cheng W. Reiss K. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Quaini F. Sonnenblick E.H. Anversa P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15James T.N.M.D. Circulation. 1994; 90: 556-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Apoptosis has also been shown to account for cell death in the conotruncal cushions; this programmed cell death mediates remodeling of the bulbus cordis during early development (16Krstic R. Pesieder T. Z. Anat. Entwicklungsgesch. 1973; 140: 337-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,17Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Nishikawa T. Tanaka M. Hosoda S. Ferrans V.J. Kasajima T. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 209-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Also, a cardiac-specific growth factor, cardiotrophin 1, which is believed to play important roles during cardiac development, is believed to protect cardiac myocytes from apoptosis (18Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a better understanding of apoptosis in the myocardium is required to establish a clearer picture of cardiac pathology as well as normal growth and development of the heart. Studies of signaling mechanisms have revealed that the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPKAP, MAP kinase-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, N-terminal c-Jun kinase; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated nick end labeling; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MEF, muscle cell-enriched transcription factor. kinases) may play important roles in the pathways that regulate both growth and apoptosis. For example, the MAP kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), has been implicated as a growth promoter, displaying an apoptosis-protective effect in some cell types, while N-terminal c-Jun kinase (JNK) and/or p38 MAP kinases have been observed to foster apoptosis in certain cells. In NIH 3T3 and REF52 fibroblasts, overexpression of MEKK1COOH, a constitutively active form of MEKK1 and a well characterized upstream activator of JNK, leads to apoptosis, which can be attenuated by ERK activation (19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar, 20Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In PC-12 cells and sympathetic neurons, nerve growth factor-mediated ERK activation is crucial for cell survival and neurite outgrowth. The removal of nerve growth factor from PC-12 cells leads to apoptosis (21Batistatou A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,22Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the activation of JNK and p38 and the inhibition of ERK (19Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar, 23Park D.S. Stefanis L. Yan C.Y.I. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21898-21905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In PC-12 cells the activation of JNK and p38 and the inhibition of ERK are critical for induction of apoptosis. Thus, PC-12 cell survival, neurite extension, and differentiation require the proper balance between the activities of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases. Like differentiated neurons, cardiac myocytes are post-mitotic, electrically excitable cells that respond to growth factor treatment with an augmentation of the differentiated phenotype. In response to growth factors, primary cardiac myocytes undergo a hypertrophic growth program typified by an increase in cell size, enhanced sarcomeric organization, activation of spontaneous contractile activity, and the up-regulation of a group of cardiac genes that are generally expressed during early embryonic development (e.g. ANF, brain natriuretic peptide, α-skeletal actin), or at very low levels in the adult myocardium (e.g. β-myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2) (e.g. Ref. 24Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Brunwald E. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1996: 1626-1649Google Scholar). This growth program not only recapitulates cardiac development, but probably also represents some of the cellular processes that contribute to the maintenance of a properly functioning myocardium in the adult. Given this background it seems possible that myocardial cell ERK activation might promote cell growth, while the activation of JNK and p38 might result in apoptosis. However, recent observations suggest that in cultured myocardial cells, p38 activation leads to hypertrophic growth (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and might, therefore, protect against apoptosis, while ERK activation, although required for growth, is not in itself sufficient to support the hypertrophic phenotype (26Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to address the hypothesis that p38 activation can protect primary myocardial cells from apoptosis. Primary ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1–4 day-old neonatal rats as described previously (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Following the enzymatic dissociation of ventricular tissue the cells were plated onto uncoated plastic dishes in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, during which time most of the fibroblasts adhered to the dish. The recovered cells were then either transfected (see below) and then plated or, in some cases, plated directly without transfection. Cultures were plated onto fibronectin-coated glass slides for TUNEL analyses, 100-mm fibronectin-coated plastic culture dishes for DNA fragmentation analyses, or onto fibronectin-coated 16- or 24-mm plastic dishes for reporter enzyme analyses. After 18 h in DMEM/F-12 (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum, the cultures were washed briefly with DMEM/F-12 (1:1) and then refed with serum-free DMEM/F-12 (1:1), which contained phenylephrine (10 μm), 1 μmpropranolol, transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (1 μg/ml), selenium (0.1 ng/ml), and triiodothyronine (0.5 ng/ml), unless otherwise stated. After 24 h, various test agents (e.g. anisomycin or sphingosine) were then added, and the cultures were maintained for an additional 48 to 96 h in the test agents followed by TUNEL analysis or DNA extraction. For reporter enzyme assays cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) for 48 h after transfection (see below). After preplating (see above), myocardial cells were usually resuspended at a density of 30 million cells/ml of minimal medium (DMEM/F-12 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and transfections were carried out as described previously (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection, 300 μl, between 5 and 9 million cells, were mixed with 1.5–45 μg of test construct (see below) and 9 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency or to serve as a transfection marker in the TUNEL analyses (see below). The levels of plasmid used in each culture within an experiment were equalized using empty vector DNA, such as pCEP. Each 300-μl aliquot was then electroporated in a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 500 V, 25 microfarads, 100Ω in a 0.2-cm gap cuvette, a protocol that allows for the selective transfection of only cardiac myocytes (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Under these conditions only cardiac myocytes are transfected, and the resultant viability is approximately 30% (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); accordingly, the 1–3 million viable cells were plated into four-chamber Lab Tek chamber slides at 0.15–0.9 × 106 cells/2-cm2well. In two experiments (DNA ladder, Fig. 1 B; ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase assays, Fig. 1 C) cultures were plated into 100-mm fibronectin-coated culture dishes, and in one experiment, cultures were also transfected with NF-κB/Luc (29Liu Z.-G. Hzu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) and plated onto 35-mm fibronectin-coated plastic culture dishes (Fig. 5A). To assess the effects of various signaling proteins, the following constructs were used: RSV-Raf-1 BXB (codes for activated Raf-1 kinase; from U. Rapp and U. Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany), pCMV5 MEKKCOOH (codes for activated MEKK-1; from G. Johnson, University of Colorado, Denver, CO), pcDNA3 MKK6 (Glu) (codes for activated MKK6 or p38/MAPKK; from R. Davis, University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), pcDNA3 MKK6 K82A (codes for a kinase-dead form of MKK6; from R. Davis, University of Massachusetts), pcDNA3 MKK6b (Glu) (codes for activated MKK6b; from J. Han, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), pcDNA3 MKK3b (Glu) (codes for activated MKK3b; from J. Han, The Scripps Research Institute), SRa3 JNKK K116R (codes for dominant-negative JNK kinase; from G. Johnson, University of Colorado), p2xNF-κB-Luc (codes for a luciferase reporter driven by 2 NF-κB consensus sites; from M. Karin, University of California, San Diego, CA), pCMX-IKκBαM (codes for IkBaS32/A36; from I Verma, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), pSRα-IkBα(A32/36) (codes for IkBaA32A36; from M. Karin, University of California, San Diego CA). TUNEL of fragmented DNA was performed on transfected myocardial cells plated on fibronectin-coated glass slides essentially as described previously (30Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J.E. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim), with the exception that either an ANF or a β-galactosidase monoclonal antibody was added to the TUNEL incubation mixture. This allowed for the co-staining of cells for ANF, which allowed the positive identification of cardiac myocytes, and/or β-galactosidase, which allowed the identification of transfected cells, and DNA strand breaks. In previous studies we have carried out double staining experiments on cultures transfected with luciferase and β-galactosidase-expressing reporters and shown that the co-transfections efficiency is 85% (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This provided positive confirmation that the observed TUNEL-positive cells were cardiac myocytes (ANF-positive) and were transfected with the appropriate test constructs (β-galactosidase-positive). In each experiment 100 β-galactosidase or ANF-positive cells were assessed for nuclear staining using the TUNEL assay. To assess the effects of anisomycin or sphingosine on the structural integrity of DNA, myocardial cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/100-mm plastic culture dish, treated as described under the “Cell Culture” section of “Materials and Methods,” above, and then lysed by suspending the cells in 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml DNase-free proteinase K and incubated for 5 h at 55 °C. Following two phenol extractions and one chloroform extraction, the DNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and incubated with RNase (10 units of DNase-free RNase) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following a final ethanol precipitation, 5 μg of DNA derived from each treatment were fractionated on a 2% agarose gel, and the DNA was viewed following staining of the gel with ethidium bromide. The effects of anisomycin or sphingosine on ERK, JNK, and p38 were assessed using myocardial cell cultures (1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm well). Cultures that had been maintained for 24 h in serum-free medium, as described above, were treated for 30 min with anisomycin (0.20 μm) or sphingosine (10 μm). For ERK and JNK assays cultures were extracted in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 0.05 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium o-vanadate, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. After brief centrifugation, extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-ERK (raised against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of ERK-1; Santa Cruz SC-093) or anti-JNK (raised against the C-terminal 17 amino acids of JNK-1; Santa Cruz SC-474) bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immune complex kinase assays were carried out using the appropriate substrates, as described previously (26Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of myelin basic protein for ERK, GST-c-Jun for JNK, and 6 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP). After 30 min at 25 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the phosphorylation level of substrate proteins was evaluated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and phosphorimage analyses. p38 assays were carried out as described previously (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocardial cells (1.5 × 106cells/35-mm culture well) were extracted in 80 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 μm sodium o-vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sixty-μl aliquots of each extract were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting using a p38 antibody specific for the phosphorylated/activated form of the kinase (specific for phosphothreonine 180/phosphotyrosine 182; New England Biolabs, Inc., catalog number: NE 92115). In each experiment three identically treated cultures (1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish) were used for each treatment, and following densitometric analyses of the exposed phosphorimage plates, values for each treatment were averaged. To test the effects of various test constructs on NF-κB activation, each culture of approximately 3 × 106 myocardial cells was transfected with 10 μg of NF-κB/Luc and 9 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase and 10 μg of the appropriate test construct and then plated into a 35-mm fibronectin-coated plastic culture dish. Following a 48-h incubation in serum-free DMEM/F-12 (1:1), the cultures were extracted and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured for 30 s on a Bio Orbit 1251 Luminometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Data are expressed as “relative luciferase (Rel Luc)” = arbitrary integrated luciferase units/β-galactosidase units, representative of at least three independent experiments performed with two different plasmid preparations, and represent the mean and S.E. of triplicate 35-mm wells. All of the results shown are representative of at least three different experiments identical, or similar to, the one shown. Each value represents the mean (n = 3) ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis of variance. To establish a model for studying the role of the p38 pathway on myocardial cell apoptosis, experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of several known apoptotic agents on primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Cultures were treated with either anisomycin or sphingosine and following fixation they were stained for ANF expression using an ANF monoclonal antibody (32Glembotski C.C. Oronzi M.E. Li X. Shields P.P. Johnston J.F. Kallen R.G. Gibson T.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and for DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL assay (30Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J.E. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 33Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar, 34Charriaut-Marlangue C. Ben-Ari Y. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Only the cells that stained positively for ANF were evaluated for DNA fragmentation, thus ensuring the evaluation of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes only. Both anisomycin and sphingosine displayed dose-dependent abilities to induce myocardial cell apoptosis (Fig.1 A). Within 48 h of treatment with 0.2 μm anisomycin, approximately 20% of the transfected cells scored positive for apoptosis compared with about 1% of the untreated cells, representing a 20-fold induction of apoptosis. In other experiments levels of anisomycin greater than 0.2 μm did not significantly increase the percentage of cells driven into apoptosis (not shown). As expected (30Krown K.A. Page M.T. Nguyen C. Zechner D. Gutierrez V. Comstock K.L. Glembotski C.C. Quintana P.J.E. Sabbadini R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2854-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), sphingosine also strongly induced apoptosis within the same time frame, with greater than 80% of the cells exposed to 10 μm sphingosine scoring positive for apoptosis compared with about 1% of the untreated cells. Although anisomycin was a less powerful apoptotic agent of these two compounds, we found that it produced more consistent results than sphingosine. In contrast, the effects of sphingosine were more variable, resulting sometimes in such severe cell death, that by the end of 48–72 h, most of the cells had detached from the dish. This detachment made it impossible to score them for ANF expression, transfection, or TUNEL staining. Accordingly, in most of the experiments shown in later figures, the soluble apoptotic agent of choice was anisomycin. As further characterization of the apoptotic response, DNA was isolated from cells treated with 0.20 μm anisomycin or 10 μm sphingosine and analyzed on an agarose gel. The 200-base pair fragments characteristic of apoptotic cells (35Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were evident in the anisomycin- and sphingosine-treated cells, but not in the control cells (Fig. 1 B). Also, consistent with the relative potencies of the compounds in the TUNEL analysis, the fragmentation pattern was much stronger in the sphingosine-treated cultures than in those treated with anisomycin. To begin addressing how MAP kinases might be involved in apoptosis in cardiac myocytes in response to anisomycin or sphingosine, the activity levels of ERK, JNK, and p38 were assessed. Anisomycin activated myocardial cell JNK by 10-fold and p38 by 11-fold; however, it had no effect on ERK, while sphingosine activated all three MAP kinases by about 5–10-fold (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, it did not seem likely that ERK could be involved in apoptosis mediated by both of these compounds; however, either JNK or p38 might be involved. To assess the effects of each of the MAPK pathways on myocardial cell apoptosis, cultures were transfected with plasmids encoding constitutively active forms of Raf-1 kinase, MEKK1 or MKK6, which preferentially activate ERK, JNK, or p38, respectively (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Only the myocytes that overexpressed constitutively active MEKK1 (MEKK1COOH) displayed significant increases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2,A–D), which amounted to approximately 30-fold over cells transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 2 E). Moreover, the TUNEL-positive nuclei in the MEKK1COOH-transfected cells were pyknotic (Fig. 2 D), consistent with the double strand DNA breaks characteristic of apoptosis (34Charriaut-Marlangue C. Ben-Ari Y. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Since MEKK1COOH serves as such a strong activator of JNK in myocardial cells, while BXB and MKK6 activate mainly ERK and p38 (25Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

The role of calcium and phosphorylation of cPLA2 in regulating arachidonic acid release was investigated. Zymosan induced a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i. This in itself is not sufficient to induce arachidonic acid release since ATP and platelet activating factor (PAF), agonists that induce transient calcium mobilization in macrophages, induced little arachidonic acid release. Unlike zymosan, which is a strong activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ATP and PAF were weak MAPK activators and induced only a partial and transient increase in cPLA2 phosphorylation (gel shift). However, ATP or PAF together with colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) synergistically stimulated arachidonic acid release. CSF-1 is a strong MAPK activator that induces a rapid and complete cPLA2 gel shift but not calcium mobilization or arachidonic acid release. Arachidonic acid release was more rapid in response to CSF-1 plus ATP or PAF than zymosan and correlated with the time course of the cPLA2gel shift. Although low concentrations of ionomycin induced a lower magnitude of calcium mobilization than ATP, the response was more sustained resulting in arachidonic acid release. A23187 and ionomycin induced weak MAPK activation, and a partial and transient cPLA2 gel shift. The MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059 suppressed A23187-induced MAPK activation and cPLA2 gel shift but had little effect on arachidonic acid release. These results indicate that in macrophages a transient increase in [Ca2+]i and sustained phosphorylation of cPLA2 can act together to promote arachidonic acid release but neither alone is sufficient. A sustained increase in calcium is sufficient for inducing arachidonic acid release. However, PMA and okadaic acid induce arachidonic acid release without increasing [Ca2+]i, although resting levels of calcium are required, suggesting alternative mechanisms of regulation."

PAKs have been implicated in cytoskeletal regulation, stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, and in control of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Membrane targeting of PAK1 induced increased kinase activity in a GTPase-independent manner, suggesting that other mechanisms for PAK regulation exist. We observed concentration- and time-dependent activation of PAK1 by sphingosine and several related long chain sphingoid bases but not by ceramides or a variety of other lipids. Although phospholipids were generally ineffective, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol also had stimulatory effects on PAK1. Lipid stimulation induced a similar level of PAK1 activity as did stimulation by GTPases, and the patterns of PAK1 autophosphorylation determined after partial tryptic digestion and two-dimensional peptide analysis were similar with each class of activator. Lipid stimulation of PAK1 activity was dependent upon intact PAK kinase activity, as indicated by studies with a kinase-dead PAK1 mutant. Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing wild type PAK1 with sphingosine, fumonisin B, or sphingomyelinase, all of which are able to elevate the levels of free sphingosine, induced increased activity of PAK1 as determined using a p47phox peptide substrate.

PAKs have also been shown to modulate the activity of the actinomyosin system in lower organisms and in mammalian cells. ATPase activity of the heavy chain of Acanthamoeba myosin is enhanced when phosphorylated by PAK (8Brzeska H. Knaus U.G. Wang Z. Bokoch G.M. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In response to some of these stimuli, PAK translocates into a membrane fraction where it can interact with membrane-bound receptors and activators (11Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S.

Activity of PAK is dramatically stimulated in vivo and in vitro by the binding of GTP-Rac or GTP-Cdc42 (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). These GTPases interact with a region at the PAK N terminus which contains the highly conserved CRIB motif described in a number of Cdc42/Rac-interacting proteins (17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 18Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Binding of the active GTPase stimulates PAK autophosphorylation at several sites, presumably changing the protein's conformation and activity toward exogenous substrates (13Manser E. Huang H. Lou T.

An additional consequence of activation is increased binding of SH3-containing proteins to the PAK N terminus (12Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Ambrose D. Bagrodia S. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar,14Galisteo M. Chernoff J. Su Y. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25746-25749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The potential for other mechanisms of PAK activation in cells was established by the demonstration of PAK2 activation resulting from proteolytic removal of the regulatory N terminus by caspases during apoptosis (20Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). A recent study has also described enhanced activity of intact PAK as a result of membrane association initiated by introduction of a membrane-targeting sequence, although the mechanism through which membrane targeting causes activation has not been investigated (16Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the ability of specific lipids, particularly sphingolipids, to stimulate PAK activity both in vitro and in vivo. Lipids regulate PAK by a direct interaction that is independent of the action of Rac or Cdc42. Both PAK autophosphorylation and activity toward exogenous substrates are enhanced by active lipids. These results suggest that PAKs may be cellular targets of sphingolipids and may account for some of their biological activities. The lipids utilized in these studies and their sources are listed in Table I. Lipids were routinely prepared as CHCl3, ethanol, or Me2SO stocks, as appropriate for each type of lipid. Prior to use the lipids were dried under N2 and resuspended by sonication in a bath sonicator in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, plus 1 mm EDTA or in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, until a translucent suspension was obtained. In some instances (e.g. with Me2SO stocks), the lipids were diluted into the same buffer or added as a complex with 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Mixed lipid vesicles were generated by mixing the lipid stocks in molar ratios varying from 1:10 to 1:3 prior to sonication in buffer. Fumonisin B was obtained from Sigma (F-1147).Table IStimulatory effects of lipids on PAK1 kinase activityLipid (400 μm)Autophosphorylationp47 peptide phosphorylationSource/productSphingoid base-related lipids Sphingosine++++++Sigma S-6879 and S-6136, Matreya 1304 d-erythro-Sphingosine++++++Matreya 1802 l-erythro-Sphingosine++++++Matreya 1826 d-threo-Sphingosine++++++Matreya 1827 l-threo-Sphingosine++++++Matreya 1806 Phytosphingosine++++Sigma P-2795 N-Acetyl-d-sphingosine−ND1-2001ND, not determined.Sigma A-7191 dl-dihydro-sphingosine (sphinganine)++++Sigma D-6783 dl-erythro-Dihydrosphingosine++++Sigma D-6908 dl-threo-Dihydrosphingosine++++Sigma D-7033 C2-Ceramide−−Sigma D-7033 C2-Dihydroceramide−NDBiomol SL-101 C8-Ceramide−−Biomol SL-112 Sphingomyelin−−Sigma S-7006, LS-10 N,N-Dimethylsphingosine+−Sigma D-1047 Monosialoganglioside (GM3)++++++Matreya 1515 Psychosine−NDMatreya 1305 Sphingosylphosphorylcholine−NDSigma S-4257 Sphingosine 1-phosphate−NDSigma S-9666Non-sphingosine-related lipids Arachidonic acid−−LC Labs A-4879 Phosphatidylcholine−−Sigma P-3841 Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine−−Sigma P-0888 Phosphatidylethanolamine−−Sigma P-0888 Phosphatidylserine−−Avanti 840021, Sigma P-6641 and P-8518 Phosphatidylinositol++++++Avanti 830042 PIP−NDCalbiochem 524647 PIP2−NDCalbiochem 524644 Lysophosphatidylinositol++++Avanti 850091 Phosphatidic acid++++++Sigma P-9511 and P-1293 Dimyristoylphosphatidic acid++++Avanti 830845 Dilaurylphosphatidic acid−−Avanti 840653 Lysophosphatidic acid−−Avanti 857120 Lysophosphatidylcholine−−Sigma L-52541-2001 ND, not determined.

The wild type PAK1 tagged with the C-terminal 17 amino acid farnesylation sequence of K-Ras 4B (KDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) in the pCMV6M vector was a gift of Jon Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). All other CAAX-tagged PAK1 constructs were generated by subcloning into the BamHI and NheI sites of this vector. Mutation of the terminal cysteine in the CAAX motif to alanine was by polymerase chain reaction amplification using a 3′ oligonucleotide containing the mutated base pairs (5′ CCGGAATTCTCACATAATTACAGCCTTTGTCTT 3′). The PAK1 ED mutant was generated by mutating all aspartic acid residues to asparagine and all glutamic acid residues to glutamine between amino acids 175 and 183 of PAK1 wild type. This was achieved by using internally derived oligonucleotides containing the mutated sequence in both the 5′–3′ (5′ CAAAATCAGAATAACAATAACAACAATGCTACCCCACCACCAGTGATT 3′)and 3′–5′ (5′ ATTGTTGTTATTGTTATTCTGATTTTGTGAAACTGGTGGCACTGCA 3′) direction. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out with vector-derived oligonucleotides to generate two overlapping strands containing the mutated sequences. These were then used as polymerase chain reaction templates to allow synthesis of full-length PAK1 containing the ED domain mutation. Expression in COS-7 cells was performed by seeding the cells at 1 × 106 per 100-mm dish and then transfecting with 5 μg of the plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 30 h, the cells were either utilized for in vivoexperiments, or lysates were prepared for use in in vitrosolid phase kinase assays (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M.

Cells (100-mm dish/stimulus) were then lysed in 250 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and used for in-gel analysis or were lysed in cell lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation, as described below. Solid phase PAK1 kinase assays and in-gel kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M.

COS-7 cells (1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transiently transfected with pCMV6 plasmids containing various N-terminally Myc-tagged PAK1 constructs, including WT-CAAX and HL-CAAX PAK1. As an added control, constructs were used in which the terminal cysteine residue in the CAAX sequence was replaced with an alanine to ensure that there was no effect of adding the additional C-terminal residues in the absence of membrane targeting. We verified the predominant membrane localization of the CAAX-tagged constructs by homogenizing the transfected cells in lysis buffer without detergent (see below) and, following a low speed spin to remove the unbroken cells, the homogenate was fractionated into a high speed (100,000 × g) membrane pellet and the cytosol-enriched supernatant. The relative localization of each construct was then determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting for Myc-tagged protein in each fraction. To evaluate kinase activity, cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h post-transfection and were then lysed into 500 μl/dish lysis buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40. Portions of each lysate were run on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose prior to blotting for the expression of myc-tagged protein. The lysates (normalized for expression levels) were then immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody. In vitrokinase assays using 1 μg of MBP/assay as a substrate were carried out in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μm ATP in each 100-μl reaction (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate PAK1 from COS-7 cell lysates, 9E10 Myc antibody was prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation overnight and then washed extensively in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). In activation experiments, 250 μl of lysate from cells (100-mm dish) activated with the indicated stimulus was incubated with 30 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Myc antibody-coated beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and then the beads were pelleted by centrifugation. The bead pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice without Nonidet P-40, suspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, and then analyzed by in-gel kinase assay. Sphingosine levels were determined by an enzymatic method as described previously (22Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 233: 306-312Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or by HPLC analysis (23Wilson E. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Uhlinger D.J. Liotta D.C. Lambeth J.D. Merril Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:200:1 v/v), and the phases were separated as described (22Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 233: 306-312Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For HPLC analysis, aliquots of the organic layer (approximately 50–100 nmol of total cellular phospholipid) were saponified by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1n KOH/methanol and incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. The reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of concentrated HCl, and samples were extracted with 1 ml of chloroform, 1 m KCl (1:1, v/v). The organic phases were dried under N2, resuspended in 50 μl of methanol, and derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde for subsequent HPLC analysis (23Wilson E. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Uhlinger D.J.

Sphingosine was separated isocratically on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) using a model 600E pump (Waters) with methanol, 5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0 (60:40, v/v), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A model 420-AC fluorescence detector (Waters) was used to detect fluorescent derivatives with an excitation filter transmitting at a maximum of 340 nm and a cut-off emission filter at 400 nm. Sphingosine levels were quantified using the Rainin Dynamax HPLC software package (Woburn, MA). Total phospholipids present in cellular lipid extracts used for sphingolipid analysis were quantified as described previously (24Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, to dried aliquots of cellular lipid extracts, 40 μl of a mixture of 10 n H2SO4/70% perchloric acid (3:1, v/v) was added, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 210 °C. After cooling, 75 μl of water and 400 μl of 4.2% ammonium molybdate in 4 n HCl, 0.045% (w/v) malachite green (1:3 v/v) was added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and absorbance was measured at 660 nm. Immunoprecipitated PAK1 was incubated with 1 μg of GTPγS-Cdc42 or 200 μmsphingosine and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, as described above. Autophosphorylated PAK1 bands were separated on 6.5% polyacrylamide gels, dried on HiDry hydrophobic drying sheets (Diversified Biotech, Newton Center, MA), and detected by autoradiography. Each band was separately excised from the gel and resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 (50 mm), containing trypsin (1.0 μg) for 14 h at 37 °C. The resulting tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with Kontes disposable pestles (Fisher) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a table top microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was lyophilized. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the tryptic peptides was performed according to the procedure of Boyle et al. (25Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The lyophilized samples were resuspended in 2 μl of pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer (2.2% formic acid, 8% acetic acid), spotted onto 100-μm coated cellulose plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) in 0.5-μl aliquots, and electrophoresed for 40 min at 1300 V in a Multiphor II horizontal electrophoresis unit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer. Plates were air-dried and chromatographed in buffer containing 62.5% isobutyric acid, 1.9% n-butanol, 4.8% pyridine, and 2.9% glacial acetic acid. 32P-Labeled tryptic peptides were detected by autoradiography on Kodak X-AR film for up to 12 h. The association of wild type PAK1 with the plasma membrane induced by the addition of a membrane targeting sequence caused increased activity of PAK1 toward an exogenous substrate (Fig.1), as also reported (16Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Activation did not occur in the absence of membrane association, as determined with a PAK1 construct in which the cysteine residue in the CAAXmotif was mutated to alanine. Of particular interest, we observed that membrane association also stimulated the activity of PAK1(H83L, H86L), a form of PAK1 which is unable to bind Rac or Cdc42 (12Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Ambrose D. Bagrodia S. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In contrast, a fully active PAK1 (T423E) construct was not further activated significantly by membrane targeting (Fig. 1). These data strongly indicate that PAK activation resulting from membrane association is at least partially GTPase-independent and may occur through a distinct mechanism. We therefore investigated the possibility that certain membrane lipids may have the ability to directly stimulate PAK. We observed that sphingolipids were able to dramatically stimulate the Ser/Thr kinase activity of PAK1. As shown in Fig. 2, sphingosine and several related long chain sphingoid bases were able to increase autophosphorylation of PAK1 in an in vitro kinase assay to levels similar to that achieved in the presence of GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 or Rac1. A concentration-response curve for PAK1 activation by sphingosine is shown in Fig.3 A. Stimulation of PAK1 was observed at sphingosine concentrations as low as 10 μmand peaked at ∼200 μm lipid. PAK activation was observed with sphingosine obtained from several commercial sources and with the lipid prepared in several different buffers, in Me2SO, or when suspended with bovine serum albumin. Sphingosine was also effective in stimulating PAK1 when presented in the form of a mixed phospholipid micelle, either with phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 2 C). Stimulation by sphingosine was not stereospecific, as each of thedl-erythro ordl-threo forms produced similar levels of activation. Even dihydrosphingosine, which lacks the 4,5-trans double bond, or phytosphingosine, which contains an additional hydroxyl group, stimulates PAK1 in vitro. In contrast to sphingosine, the sphingosine precursorN-acetylsphingosine or ceramide was inactive, as were a variety of other structurally related and unrelated lipids (Fig. 2 and Table I). In particular, the inability of sphingosylphosphorylcholine and octylamine (not shown) to activate PAK1 suggests this was not a general effect resulting from the presence of a highly positively charged group associated with the lipid backbone.Figure 3Characterization of sphingosine effects on PAK1 activity. A, PAK1 activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of the indicated concentration of sphingosine. The data plotted represent the average ± S.D. for at least three separate determinations using PAK1 autophosphorylation as the end point; similar results were obtained using p47phox peptide as exogenous substrate.B, the time course for PAK1 activation as assessed by autophosphorylation was determined in the presence of 1 μg of Cdc42-GTPγS (closed circles) or 200 μmsphingosine (open circles), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inset shows the autoradiogram from a representative time course.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of PAK1 with either Cdc42- or Rac1-GTPγS resulted in the formation of three distinct species of PAK1 with slightly varying migration on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These represent variably phosphorylated forms of PAK1 4C. C. King and G. M. Bokoch, unpublished observations. whose formation correlates with increased activity of PAK toward exogenous substrates. Interestingly, activation of PAK1 with sphingosine only resulted in the formation of the two faster migrating phosphorylated PAK species (Fig. 2 A). This modification is sufficient for sphingosine to effectively stimulate phosphorylation of a p47phox-derived peptide substrate by PAK (Fig.2 B), as well as intact p47phox protein and Nck (15Bokoch G.M.

However, when PAK1 was activated by sphingosine we were unable to detect effective phosphorylation of myelin basic protein, which serves as an excellent substrate for PAK1 when it is activated by Cdc42 or Rac (7Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). We are uncertain at this time whether this represents a real difference in the ability of lipid-activated PAK1 to utilize certain specific substrates or whether this is a competitive effect of the lipid with the MBP substrate. This could also be due to differences in substrate utilization by the differentially phosphorylated PAK1 species since, in contrast to sphingosine and related compounds, stimulation of PAK1 by phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, and/or monosialoganglioside GM3 induced the formation of all three autophosphorylated PAK1 species, and these lipids also stimulated the phosphorylation of both p47phox peptide and MBP by PAK1. For reasons which are not clear, the action of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol upon PAK1, while highly reproducible, was only observed with very fresh lipid preparations, and their ability to activate PAK1 was lost upon storage even under N2 at −20 °C.

Glucose induced dose- and time-dependent increases of PAI-1 mRNA expression in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells in vitro. Using a series of luciferase reporter gene constructs containing PAI-1 5′-flanking sequence (from −6.4 kilobase to −42 base pairs (bp)) transfected into RASM, we found that glucose (25 mm) consistently induced a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity, with the response localized to sequence between −85 and −42 bp. Mutagenesis of two putative Sp1-binding sites located in the region of interest essentially obliterated the glucose-response. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the two putative Sp1-binding sites from PAI-1 promoter and nuclear extracts from RASM cells revealed that glucose treatment markedly changed the mobility pattern of the major protein-DNA complexes. Supershift assay showed that transcription factor Sp1 was present in the complexes under control and hyperglycemic conditions. These results suggest that glucose regulates PAI-1 gene expression in RASM cells through an effect on two adjacent Sp1 sites located between −85 and −42 bp of the PAI-1 5′-flanking region and that the release of a transcriptional repressor from the Sp1 complexes may explain the activation of the PAI-1 gene under high glucose conditions in RASM cells.

A number of different factors contribute to the development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus (1Schwartz C.J. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Kelley J.L. Cayatte A.J. Rozek M.M. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 1156-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia has direct toxic effects on vascular tissue through the glycosylation of structural proteins (2Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 647-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia also appears to facilitate free radical formation and oxidative damage to the vascular wall (3Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Conversely, the aggressive control of plasma glucose levels appears to delay the development of the common complications of diabetes in insulin-dependent diabetic patients (4Anonymous N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (23062) Google Scholar). Many common risk factors also contribute to the atherogenic tendency in diabetes. These factors include abnormal lipoprotein metabolism, hypertension, and endothelial dysfunction. Recent studies have identified elevated levels of the fibrinolytic inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), 1The abbreviations used are: PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; RASM, rat aortic smooth muscle; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; bp, base pair(s); DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. in diabetic patients (5Juhan-Vague I.

There is a developing appreciation for the role of PAI-1 plays in the pathogenesis in atherothrombotic disorders (7Schneiderman J. Sawdey M.S. Keeton M.R. Bordin G.M. Bernstein E.F. Dilley R.B. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that increased PAI-1 production may be an important contributor to the development of vascular disease in diabetics (8Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C. Vague P. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The increased production of PAI-1 seen in diabetic patients has been attributed directly to glucose, which increases PAI-1 production in cultured endothelium (9Nordt T.K. Klassen K.J. Schneider D.J. Sobel B.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1822-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Maiello M. Boeri D. Podesta F. Cagliero E. Vichi M. Odetti P. Adezati L. Lorenzi M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by insulin and pro-insulin peptides (11Nordt T.K. Schneider D.J. Sobel B.E. Circulation. 1994; 89: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which induce PAI-1 production in cultured hepatocytes. Recent studies have identified a cis-acting carbohydrate responsive element in the promoter region of the rat S14 gene (12Shih H.M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbohydrate responsive element consensus sequence has been deduced as 5′-CACGTGNNNGCC-3′ (13Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3987-9380Google Scholar). This DNA motif has been shown to mediate glucose responsiveness when placed 5′ of genes that do not normally respond to glucose. Similar or identical DNA motifs have also been identified in other carbohydrate-responsive genes, including the genes for pyruvate kinase and the fatty acid synthase gene (13Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3987-9380Google Scholar). Although it is clear that glucose can directly induce gene expression through a motif CACGTG that is related to the consensus binding site for the c-myc family of transcription factors, other glucose responsive elements have recently been identified, including Sp1 sites in the promoter II of the gene for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This study was designed to characterize the mechanism through which glucose regulates PAI-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our findings indicate that glucose induces PAI-1 gene expression through two Sp1 sites located within 100 bases upstream of the transcription start site of PAI-1 gene. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Hyclone Laboratory (Logan, UT). Tissue culture medium, transferrin, and ascorbic acid were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Glucose, lactate, and insulin were from Sigma. Poly(dI-dC) was from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Restriction enzymes and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from Promega (Madison, WI). T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA kinase, and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA) and monoclonal antibody against Rb protein was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000mCi/mmol), [α-32P]dUTP, and [α-33P]dATP were from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells were isolated as described previously (15Naftilan A.J. Pratt R.E. Eldridge C.S. Lin H.L. Dzau V.J. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm HEPES. For these studies, RASM cells subcultured 10–16 times. The cells were identified as smooth muscle cells by both appearance and positive fibrillar staining with a smooth muscle specific α-actin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). PAI-1-luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning various portions of the PAI-1 promoter into the pGL2-Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Progressive deletions from the 5′ end of the human PAI-1 gene promoter fragments were constructed by using restriction endonuclease cleavage sites present in the PAI-1 promoter or using polymerase chain reaction methods to create fragments of PAI-1 promoter. All fragments had identical 3′ ends (i.e. the EcoRI site at position +71) and different 5′ ends. The following sites were used: for pGLuc 3.4k, the XbaI site at position −3.4 kilobase pairs, for pGLuc 1.5k, the KpnI site at −1.5 kilobase pairs, and for pGLuc 884, the HindIII site at −884 bp. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used to synthesize smaller fragments using the polymerase chain reaction. The DNA fragments −107 bp, −85 bp, −54 bp, and −42 bp were treated with Klenow fragment to generate blunt ends, ligated to the pGL2 Basic luciferase reporter gene vector, and designated as follows: pGLuc 107, pGLuc 85, pGLuc 54, and pGLuc 42. The luciferase reporter gene vector (−6.4 kilobase pairs) of the PAI-1 promoter was kindly provided by Dr. David J. Loskutoff (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Base substitutions were made by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis in three different regions identified as Sp1A, Sp1B, P-box I, and P-box II, corresponding to nucleotides −85 to −63, −53 to −30, and −71 to −47, respectively. The mutant oligonucleotides used as primers are listed in Table I together with the corresponding wild-type PAI-1 sequences. The mutations were either made with the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis kit (Promega) or carried out by the polymerase chain reaction method as described previously (16Gatlin J. Campbell L.H. Schmidt M.G. Arrigo S.J. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 559-564PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab For transient transfection experiments, RASM cells were cultured in 35-mm 6-well plates at density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After cells reached 70–80% confluence, they were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (17Chen Y.Q. Gilliam D.M. Rydzewski B. Naftilan A.J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), with 1 μg of the PAI-1 pGL-2 construct and 0.8 μg of the plasmid pMVS-β-Gal, which contains the Lac Z gene under control of the Molony sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. The control plasmid has been examined on several occasions and has never demonstrated any response to glucose (data not shown). After overnight incubation, the media was replaced with serum starvation media (5.5 mm glucose, DMEM containing 5 × 10−7m insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 0.2 mm ascorbic acid) for 24 h. This media has been demonstrated to maintain to smooth muscle cells in a quiescent, noncatabolic state for at least 72 h (18Libby P. O'Brien K.V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 115: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The following morning, the cells were then kept in the glucose-deficient DMEM supplemented with either lactate (10 mm, final concentration) or glucose (25 mm, final concentration). After 48 h, the cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer. The luciferase assays were performed according to the protocol of Promega. A 50-μl sample of the extract was used for determination of β-galactosidase activity by a colorimetric assay (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase activity and is presented as corrected light units. To calculate relative induction, the corrected light unit of glucose-treated cells was divided from the corrected light unit of lactate-treated cells. For the Northern blot analysis, cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. When the cells reached 80% confluence, the cells were then kept in the DMEM supplemented with different concentrations of glucose and glucosamine. Total cellular RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were carried out as described (20Kerins D.M. Hao Q. Vaughan D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from RASM cells prepared as described previously (17Chen Y.Q. Gilliam D.M. Rydzewski B. Naftilan A.J. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed on 4% acrylamide gels with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 0.38 m glycine, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 3–6 μg of nuclear extract. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (0.1–0.6 ng). Following an additional incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed at 200 V at 4 °C for 2 h. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR film. For competition experiments, 0.2–0.6 μg of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the initial incubation mixture. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C prior to adding the labeled probes. The following oligonucleotides covering sequences of 5′-flanking region of the PAI-1 gene were synthesized in the Molecular Biology Core facility of Vanderbilt University: −85/−63 sense, CAGTGAGTGGGT GGGGCTGGAAC; −85/−63 antisense, GTTCCAGCCCCACCCACTCACTG; −85/−63 mutated Sp1A sense, CAGTGAGTGAATTCGGCTGGAAC; −85/−63 mutated Sp1A antisense, GTTCCAGCCGAATTCACTCACTG; −53/−30 sense, CATCTATTTCCTGC CCACATCTGGTA; −53/−30 antisense, TACCAGATGTGGGCAGGAAATAGATG; −53/−30 mutated Sp1Bsense, CATCTATTTCTAGATCACATCTGG; −53/−30 mutated Sp1Bantisense, CCAGATGTGATCTAGAAATAGATG. Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides were purchased from Promega, and were comprised of the following nucleotide sequence: sense, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG; antisense, CTCGCCCCGCCCCGATCGAAT. To determine whether glucose regulates PAI-1 gene expression, the relative expression of PAI-1 mRNA in RASM cells was measured by Northern blotting. In these experiments, confluent cultures of RASM cells were exposed to glucose over the concentration range of 2.5–25 mm in serum-free DMEM (Fig.1 A) or DMEM with 10% serum (Fig. 1 B) for 48 h. Glucose resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the expression of PAI-1 gene in RASM cells. No PAI-1 mRNA was detected in RASM cells treated with 2.5 mm glucose in the serum-free DMEM. On average, there was a 4.2 ± 2.2-fold increase in PAI-1 message induced by glucose (25 mm) compared with 5 mm glucose (p = 0.0013, n = 6). A time-dependent effect of glucose on PAI-1 gene expression in RASM cells was also demonstrated. The induction of PAI-1 mRNA expression produced by glucose is maximal at 72 h in RASM cells (Fig. 2). The specificity of this effect of glucose was studied by performing comparable studies using glucosamine, the hexosamine pathway metabolite of glucose. In the presence of 5 mm glucose, incremental concentrations of glucosamine failed to induce PAI-1 mRNA expression under serum-free conditions (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, in serum-replete DMEM, increasing concentrations of glucosamine failed to induce PAI-1 mRNA expression in RASM cells (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Time-dependent effect of glucose on PAI-1 expression in cultured RASM cells.

A schematic diagram of the PAI-1–1 5′-flanking region and the described regulatory elements is shown in Fig.3. Two putative sequences (CACGTG) identical to glucose response elements in the rat S14 gene (13Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3987-9380Google Scholar) were found at sites −683 bp and −562 bp in the PAI-1 promoter. To localize the regulatory elements required for transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene by glucose, progressive 5′ promoter deletion constructs containing different portions of the PAI-1 promoter and 72 nucleotides of the PAI-1 5′-untranslated region were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. The constructs, schematically depicted in Fig.4 A, were transiently transfected into RASM cells and the luciferase activity was measured 48 h after lactate or glucose treatment of serum-starved RASM cells. To normalize for transfection efficiency, each construct was co-transfected with a constitutively expressed Molony sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase reporter construct. All experiments were repeated a minimum five times, and results are reported as mean ± S.E. In the presence of 25 mm glucose, there was a 3.7-fold increase in luciferase activity in RASM cells transfected with pGLuc884 construct, which includes both copies of the putative glucose response elements. To determine if the presence of the sequence motif CACGTG confers glucose responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, multiple copies of regions between −571 and −548 and between −698 and −664 of PAI-1 promoter were fused to the SV40 promoter-luciferase reporter gene vector as described above. These constructs were transfected into RASM cells and were not inducible by glucose (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 4 B, constructs comprising 6.4k, 3.0k, 1.5k, 107, and 85 nucleotides of upstream sequences from the PAI-1 promoter all exhibited glucose responsiveness that averaged between 3.2–4.5-fold compared with controls. However, a substantial reduction in glucose responsiveness was observed in further truncated constructs, with pGLuc 54 exhibiting a nearly 50% reduction in glucose responsiveness. A further truncated construct, pGLuc 42, containing only PAI-1 TATA box, was not induced by glucose in comparison with the luciferase reporter construct pGL-2 Basic. These results indicate that the major sequence determinants of glucose responsiveness in the PAI-1 promoter reside between 85 and 42 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site.Figure 4A schematic diagram of PAI-1 promoter deletion constructs used in transient transfection assays.

There are four recognized regulatory elements in the region, including two Sp1 sites, a P-box, and a D-box (Fig. 3). The Sp1 site is the binding site of the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1. The P box is similar in sequence to phorbol ester response elements and cAMP response elements. The D-box, a phorbol ester response elements-like sequence, has a weak affinity for transcription factor AP-1 (21Knudsen H. Olesen T. Riccio A. Ungaro P. Christensen L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Descheemaeker K.A. Wyns S. Nelles L. Auwerx J. Ny T. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15086-15091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, four single mutants and different double mutants were constructed as shown in Fig.5 A. Mutations in P-box I or P-box II had no effect on the glucose responsiveness. Mutations in either Sp1A or Sp1B resulted in an approximately 50% decrease of glucose responsiveness compared with wild type pGLuc 85 construct. Mutations in Sp1A + Sp1B resulted in a loss of responsiveness to glucose (Fig.5 B). Thus, both Sp1 sites appear to be essential for glucose induction of PAI-1. These results support the involvement of the Sp1 transcriptional factor in the glucose activation of PAI-1 gene. To test if transcription factor Sp1 binds to the site Sp1A and Sp1B in RASM cells, EMSAs were performed with RASM nuclear extracts prepared from either lactate-treated cells or glucose-treated cells and32P-labeled oligonucleotides consisting of Sp1Aand Sp1B sequences spanning −85 to −63 and −53 to −30 of the PAI-1 promoter. As seen in Fig. 6, nuclear extracts from lactate-treated cells formed one unique complex with 32P-labeled −85/−63 probe (lane 1) and four distinct complexes indicated by arrows on the right of Fig. 6 with the 32P-labeled −53/−30 probe (lane 3). Extracts from glucose-treated cells formed different protein-DNA complexes with distinctly differing mobility. Three major complexes were formed with 32P-labeled −85/−63 probe (lane 2) and two major complexes were formed with 32P-labeled −53/−30 probe (lane 4). The DNA-protein complexes from glucose-treated cells migrated more rapidly than those from lactate-treated cells. To determine the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes formed with the −85/−63 and −53/−30 probes, excess unlabeled consensus Sp1, wild-type, and mutant oligonucleotides were included in the binding reactions. The results of these competitive analyses on the formation of DNA-nuclear protein complexes are shown in Figs.7 and 8. As seen in Fig. 7, one band from lactate-treated nuclear extract and three bands from glucose-treated nuclear extract are specific since competition with 100 molar excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (corresponding with sequence −85/−63) and consensus Sp1 oligonucleotides effectively prevented complex formation (lanes 2, 4 and 6, 8). The Sp1A site is critical for this binding, as unlabeled oligonucleotides with a mutated Sp1A site did not compete for the binding (lanes 3 and 7). In addition, excess unlabeled of wild-type −53/−30 oligonucleotide (containing Sp1B) partially competed the bands (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 8, in either lactate-treated (lanes 1–5) or glucose-treated (lanes 6–10) nuclear extracts, several proteins bind specifically to the32P-labeled −53/−30 oligonucleotide containing Sp1B site (lanes 1 and 6). The specificity of these proteins is demonstrated by the fact that they were effectively competed by excess unlabeled wild-type −53/−30 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 7). The unlabeled oligonucleotide with a mutated Sp1B did not compete for binding (lanes 3 and 8). Interestingly, in the lactate-treated nuclear extract, the unlabeled wild-type −85/−63 oligonucleotide containing the Sp1A site reduced the apparent intensity of bands 1 and 3 (lane 4) while the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide eliminated only band 1 (lane 5). In the glucose-treated nuclear extract, unlabeled wild-type −85/−63 oligonucleotide effectively eliminated bands 1 and 2 (lane 9) and the unlabeled consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide eliminated band 1 (lane 10).Figure 8EMSA with 32P-labeled −53/−30 oligonucleotide and RASM cell nuclear extract. The double-stranded oligonucleotides −53/−30 of PAI-1 were end labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts from RASM cells grown in lactate- (lanes 1–5) or glucose-containing medium (lanes 5–10).Lanes 1 and 6 were positive controls (no unlabeled competitor added). The unlabeled wide-type −53/−30 oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 7), or −53/−30 oligonucleotide with mutant Sp1B site (lanes 3 and 7), or wild-type −85/−63 oligonucleotide (lanes 4 and 9), or consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and 10) was added to the binding mixture in the mobility shift assay. Arrows indicate the specific bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Supershift assays were performed using antibody against Sp1, which has been reported to mediate the glucose response in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the lactate-treated nuclear extract, the antibody against Sp1 yielded a novel band with reduced mobility using the 32P-labeled −86/−63 probe (Fig.9 A, lane 3). The antibody against Sp1 also supershifted band 1 formed with the32P-labeled −53/−30 probe (Fig. 9 B, lane 3). In contrast, in the glucose-treated nuclear extract, the antibody against Sp1 formed a larger, supershifted band with the32P-labeled −86/−63 probe (Fig. 9 A, lane 5) and a very faint supershifted band with 32P-labeled −53/−30 probe. Therefore, it appears that Sp1 is present in the complexes formed with the −85/−63 oligonucleotide under control and hyperglycemic conditions. Sp1 also appears to be present in complexes formed with the −53/−30 oligonucleotide under control conditions, but its presence under hyperglycemic conditions is uncertain. In similar experiments, a polyclonal antibody against Sp3 and a monoclonal antibody against Rb protein failed to induce a similar supershift (data not shown). These results indicate that Sp1 is one of the factors binding to the Sp1A and Sp1B sites located between nucleotides −85 and −30 of the PAI-1 promoter and suggest that the transcriptional complex or accessibility to antibody differs in the protein-DNA complexes bound to the two oligonucleotides. Previous experimental studies have indicated that increased ambient glucose concentrations stimulate the expression of PAI-1 in cultured endothelial cells (9Nordt T.K. Klassen K.J. Schneider D.J. Sobel B.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1822-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Maiello M. Boeri D. Podesta F. Cagliero E. Vichi M. Odetti P. Adezati L. Lorenzi M.

The present studies extend this observation to include vascular smooth muscle cells. Increased glucose appears to induce dose-dependent and protracted increases in PAI-1 mRNA levels in cultured RASM cells. This effect is not merely a response to altered media osmolarity, as control experiments using equivalent concentrations of mannitol failed to produce similar effects (data not shown). Furthermore, glucosamine, a metabolite of glucose and the product of hexosamine pathway, did not mimic the effect of glucose in stimulating PAI-1 gene expression. The recent description and identification of specific glucose-response elements in the regulatory regions of several genes prompted a systematic search for elements in the PAI-1 promoter that contribute to this response (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24German M.S. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4067-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although sequence analysis suggested that candidate sequence motifs were present at −683 and −562 of the PAI-1 promoter, sequential deletion reporter constructs indicated that glucose responsiveness does not reside in these regions. Instead, glucose responsiveness was maintained in the reporter constructs down to a length of −85. Beyond that point, glucose responsiveness was lost in a stepwise manner following deletion to −54 and obliterated in deletion constructs down to −45. In this sequence reside two distinct Sp1 sites. Given previous reports that Sp1 sites mediate the glucose response in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), these sites were examined for their functional role in glucose responsiveness by examining the effects of site-specific mutations to these regions. Indeed, mutations in either Sp1 site of PAI-1 promoter independently reduced glucose responsiveness by approximately 50%, while constructs engineered to have mutations in both sites lost their glucose responsiveness. The specificity of these mutations is supported by the observation that mutation of the intervening P-box, located between the two Sp1 sites, failed to diminish glucose responsiveness. These findings confirm and extend previous observations that the glucose responsive region of the transforming growth factor-α promoter maps to a region including Sp1 sites (26McClain D.A. Paterson A.J. Roos M.D. Wei X. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8150-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Sayeski P.P. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15237-15243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that Sp1 sites may provide a mechanism for glucose responsiveness in vascular tissue. The systematic analysis of the response of serially truncated or mutated reporter constructs merely identifies potential glucose-responsive regions of the PAI-1 promoter. Although Sp1 sites are identified, this does not establish that the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 is responsible for this effect. However, EMSA studies confirmed that the electrophoretic mobility of oligonucleotides comprised of these regions of interest was altered by increased glucose concentrations. Furthermore, immunological analyses of these complexes suggested that authentic Sp1 was present under control conditions and remained associated to at least one of the labeled Sp1 sites in the presence of increased glucose. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility that Sp1 is bound to the putative Sp1 sites under normal conditions, but that transcription is suppressed by the presence of a bound repressor. In the presence of increased glucose, the repressor molecules are released, leaving Sp1 bound to the Sp1 sites, and transcription ensues. Ample precedent exists to permit this mechanism to be entertained as a potential explanation for the effects of glucose described in this study and in fact, a similar mechanism has recently been described through which Sp1 mediates induced expression of the acetyl carboxylase gene (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Alternatively, glucose has been reported to induce gene expression by promoting the binding of transcriptional activators (14Daniel S. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24German M.S. Wang J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4067-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Sharma A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 871-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the present findings are not entirely consistent with this possibility, it cannot be completely excluded. We have suggested that hyperglycemia promotes the displacement of a transcriptional repressor present in the Sp1 transcriptional complex. However, the identity of this repressor protein or proteins is unknown at present. Studies with antibodies against the retinoblastoma gene product and against the related protein Sp3 have failed to establish the presence of these proteins in EMSA studies. Further studies are now underway to identify potential negative and positive co-factors in the Sp1 regulatory complex localized to the Sp1 sites in the PAI-1 promoter. As atherosclerotic lesions progress in terms of severity (Stage IV and beyond), there is increased deposition of fibrin, fibrinogen, and collagen in areas of advanced atherosclerosis (29Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10018) Google Scholar). Advanced lesions are also characterized by smooth muscle cell invasion and proliferation. The fibrinolytic system, i.e. plasmin, is primarily responsible for the proteolytic degradation of fibrin and fibrinogen. Furthermore, plasmin is indirectly responsible for the dismantling of excess collagen by virtue of the role it plays in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (30Alexander C.M. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1989; 1: 974-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Plasmin also plays a role in regulating the smooth muscle cell content of atherosclerotic lesions through its role in activating latent transforming growth factor-β (31Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Metcalfe J.C. Liu A.C. Lawn R.M. Williams N.R. Grace A.A. Schofield P.M. Chauhan A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), which has potent antimigratory and antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, it is quite evident that plasmin plays a multifaceted housekeeping role in the vessel wall, and that fibrinolytic activity likely retards the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. This view is supported by recent studies indicating that plasminogen deficiency accelerated the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE knockout mice (32Xiao Q. Danton M.J. Witte D.P. Kowala M.C. Valentine M.T. Bugge T.H. Degen J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10335-10340Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Apart from its effects on intraluminal fibrinolytic balance, PAI-1 is topologically distributed to influence fibrinolytic function in the vessel wall. Several studies have now confirmed the presence of increased amounts of PAI-1 in human atherosclerotic plaques (7Schneiderman J. Sawdey M.S. Keeton M.R. Bordin G.M. Bernstein E.F. Dilley R.B. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 33Robbie L.A. Booth N.A. Brown A.J. Bennett B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The presence of excess PAI-1 in atherosclerotic lesions reduces local plasmin generation (35Padro T. Emeis J.J. Steins M. Schmid K.W. Kienast J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In such a milieu, a relative paucity of plasmin production likely reduces matrix remodeling capacity. Furthermore, since transforming growth factor-β has potent antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (36Grainger D.J. Kemp P.R. Witchell C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a reduction in the plasmin-dependent activation of this critical cytokine likely exerts a permissive effect on the growth of an atherosclerotic lesion. Thus, increased local production of PAI-1 likely contributes to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions, and PAI-1 expression appears to be regulated by glucose in vascular tissues. This relationship may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic disease in diabetes. In conclusion, these studies indicate that hyperglycemia directly stimulates PAI-1 expression in cultured VSMC. This response appears to be localized to two independent Sp1 sites just upstream from the transcription start site of PAI-1. The present findings suggest that glucose induces this effect on PAI-1 transcription by dislodging an unidentified transcriptional repressor from the Sp1 complex. The ability of glucose to stimulate directly the expression of PAI-1 in vascular tissue may have important clinical ramifications. Local overexpression of PAI-1 in the blood vessel wall would be expected to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and fibrosis. The development of diffuse and severe vascular disease in diabetes is an all too common manifestation of the disease, and is responsible for a great deal of the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen in this disorder. Improved glucose control would be expected to result in reduced vascular PAI-1 expression, which in turn may contribute to a reduction in the development of vascular disease and its complications."

These sequences generally contain one or more binding sites for a heterodimeric DNA binding complex termed hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). To analyze this response further, Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with plasmids bearing HREs linked to genes encoding immunoselectable cell surface markers, and clones that showed reduced or absent hypoxia-inducible marker expression were selected from a mutagenized culture of cells. Analysis of these cells revealed several clones with transacting defects in HRE activation, and in one the defect was identified as a failure to express the α-subunit of HIF-1. Comparison of hypoxia-inducible gene expression in wild type, HIF-1α-defective, and HIF-1α-complemented cells revealed two types of response. For some genes (e.g. glucose transporter-1), hypoxia-inducible expression was critically dependent on HIF-1α, whereas for other genes (e.g. heme oxygenase-1) hypoxia-inducible expression appeared largely independent of the expression of HIF-1α. These experiments show the utility of mutagenesis and selection of mutant cells in the analysis of mammalian transcriptional responses to hypoxia and demonstrate the operation of HIF-1α-dependent and HIF-1α-independent pathways of hypoxia-inducible gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

Naturally occurring genetic mutations have provided many insights into gene function. In an effort to extend this source of information, a large number of targeted or untargeted means of introducing mutations and selecting by genotype or phenotype have been devised. In somatic cells, one classical approach has been to subject a mutagenized culture to a substance whose toxicity is dependent on the activity of a set of genes involved in a signal transduction or metabolic pathway (1Hankinson O.

However, the number of properties that are “intrinsically selectable” in this way is limited, leading some workers to explore the possibility of introducing selectable properties by transfection of recombinant plasmids (4Pellegrini S.

Here we describe the use of a selection strategy based on the linking of HIF-1-binding hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) with minimal promoters coupled to genes encoding cell surface antigens. We describe the selection, from a mutagenized culture of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells, of cells that are deficient in HRE-dependent transactivation and the identification of one line that is functionally defective in the α-subunit of HIF-1. We demonstrate the utility of this cell line in characterizing HIF-1α-dependent and HIF-1α-independent patterns of hypoxia-inducible gene expression. Cells were grown in Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Globepharm), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 IU/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml).

A stable transfectant of CHO-K1 cells bearing two hypoxia-inducible cell surface markers was obtained by transfection with pHPGK-CD2 (20 μg) and pSV2Neo (1 μg) followed by selection in G418 (0.5 mg/ml) and then supertransfection of one clone with p(E1–25)5SV-ESel (20 μg) and pSV2Hyg (1 μg) and selection in hygromycin B (0.7 mg/ml).

For assays of the metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, the cells were grown in serum-free medium for 24 h before a further 24-h exposure in serum-free medium to the experimental conditions. To assay for gene expression in low glucose, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with either 25 mm or 0.5 mm glucose for 48 h. Stable transfection of the mutant derivative Ka13 with a human HIF-1α gene was performed by electroporation using pcDNA3/Neo/HIF-1α (containing the HIF-1α sequence from pBluescript/HIF-1α 3.2–2T7 cloned into pcDNA3/Neo) (20 μg) and pPur (1 μg) (CLONTECH) followed by selection in puromycin (Sigma) 5 μg/ml. For fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis, cells were detached in 2 mm EDTA in HBSS, centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 °C, and washed twice in 3 ml of PFA (PBS with 0.1% sodium azide and 1% fetal calf serum). Antibody labeling was performed on ice for 30 min using a phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgG2b anti-human CD2 (Serotec) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG1 anti-human E-selectin (R & D Systems). Cells were then washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS before FACS analysis (Becton Dickenson). For immunological selection by panning (16Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), cells were harvested as above and then washed twice in panning buffer (PBS with 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) at 4 °C. Antibody labeling (30 min, 4 °C) was performed either with mouse IgG2b anti-human CD2 (Serotec) at a 1:10 dilution or with mouse IgG1 anti-human E-Selectin (Serotec) at 1:100 dilution. The cells were then washed twice in panning buffer, resuspended in 5 ml of panning buffer, and poured onto prepared panning plates. Plates were left at room temperature for 15–60 min, after which the panning buffer was gently aspirated to harvest the nonadherent cells. These cells were washed in culture medium and plated out in selective medium. Panning plates were prepared as follows. Petri dishes were coated with 5 ml of a 10 μg/ml solution of affinity-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in 50 mmTris, pH 9.5, for 1 h at room temperature. The dishes were then washed three times in PBS, blocked by overnight incubation with 5 ml of sterile blocking buffer (2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS), and stored at −20 °C. Parental cells were CHO-K1 cells and an hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient (HPRT−) derivative of Ka13 selected in hypoxanthine-free medium containing 10 μm 6-thioguanine. For fusions, equal quantities of CHO-K1 and HPRT− Ka13 cells were mixed and plated such that the cells were overconfluent. After 4 h, the cells were washed with serum-free medium, and 0.5 ml of neutralized polyethylene glycol solution (Mr 1300–1600, 1 g/ml) was added for 1 min. The polyethylene glycol was diluted in 5 ml of serum-free medium over a further 2 min and then removed, after which the cells were washed gently in serum-free medium, incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in complete medium, and then trypsinized and replated. Selective medium (HAT containing G418) was added 24 h later. Nuclear extract was prepared using a modified Dignam protocol, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described in Ref. 17Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc.

For Western analysis, nuclear extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. HIF-1α was detected using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a recombinant immunogen containing amino acids 530–652 of human HIF-1α, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO), and enhanced chemiluminescence. RNA was extracted by a modified acid/guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (RNAzol B, Cinna/Biotec Laboratories, Houston), dissolved in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, 400 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), and analyzed by an RNase protection assay or dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled H2O for Northern blotting. For Northern blotting, 30 μg of total RNA were fractionated on a denaturing agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The filters were hybridized with probes labeled with [32P]dCTP using random nonamer priming (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for ARNT and by polymerase chain reaction for HIF-1α. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (18Pugh C.W. Tan C.C. Jones R.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10553-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the protected species was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and was related to an internal control assay for a constitutively expressed U6 small nuclear RNA. Fully homologous riboprobe templates for Chinese hamster genes were generated by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides based on published sequences for other species and cloned into pSP72 or pGemTeasy. Details of riboprobe templates for Chinese hamster or mouse genes are given in Table I. For endogenous genes, the quantity of RNA analyzed was as follows: U6, small nuclear 5 ng; GAPDH, 2 μg; GRP78, 10 μg; Glut-1 and HO-1, 20 μg each; ornithine decarboxylase and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2, 30 μg each; gelatinase 92 and transferrin receptor, 40 μg each; AK3 and HIF-1α, 50 μg each; and EPAS-1 and VEGF, 100 μg each.Table IDetails of riboprobes used in RNase protection assaysGeneSpeciesAccession number/nucleotidesAdenylate kinase 3Mouse−/−EPAS-1Chinese hamster*U81983/496–669Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseChinese hamster*X02231/774-1072Gelatinase 92Chinese hamster*Z2723/1941–2147Glucose transporter-1MouseM23384/1073–1208Glucose regulated protein 78Chinese hamsterM17169154–354Heme oxygenase-1Chinese hamster*X56826/15–162Hypoxia inducible factor-1αHumanU22431/150–270Hypoxia inducible factor-1αMouseX95002/1–192Ornithine decarboxylaseChinese hamsterX16910/804–895Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2Chinese hamster*J05593/690–927Transferrin receptorChinese hamsterL19142/1722–1930U6 small nuclearToadX01366/1–107Vascular endothelial growth factorChinese hamster*M95200/177–391 Open table in a new tab Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates using a commercial assay system (Promega) and a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs). β-Galactosidase activity in cell lysates was measured usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A central difficulty in using selection against exogenous genetic markers introduced by transfection to derive mutants that are functionally defective in components of an interacting transcriptional mechanism is that the transfected gene is generally much less stable than the endogenous genome. As a result, selection against an inducible transfected marker gene will generate a large excess of cells that have simply lost or suppressed expression of the marker over those bearing defects in the endogenous mechanism of gene regulation. We employed two strategies to limit this problem. First, two separately integrated, hypoxically inducible immunoselectable markers were used. This enabled us to limit selection of cells that had simply lost one or the other integration (by alternate selection against each of the two hypoxically inducible antigens) and also allowed us to detect such cells rapidly by FACS analysis. Second, positive selection for co-transfected drug resistance markers was continued throughout the negative immunoselection procedure. First, to assess the efficiency of various HIF-1-dependent HREs in supporting hypoxia-inducible gene expression in CHO-K1 cells, transient transfections were performed with plasmids bearing different HRE/promoter combinations coupled to cDNAs for cell surface markers. Inducible marker gene expression was measured by mRNA and FACS analysis (data not shown). The two plasmids that showed the highest induction of marker expression were chosen for stable transfection and are illustrated in Fig.1. CHO-K1 cells were first transfected with pHPGK-CD2 and pSV2Neo, and clones were selected in G418. One such clone was further transfected with p(E1–25)5SV-ESel and pSV2Hyg, and clones were selected in hygromycin B. Several resistant clones were assayed for hypoxia-inducible expression of the transfected cell surface markers, and one (C4.5) was selected on the basis of showing the greatest inducible expression of both markers. Fig.2 A shows FACS analysis of normoxic and hypoxic cultures of C4.5 cells after labeling cells with monoclonal antibodies against human CD2 and E-selectin. Both markers are clearly inducible by hypoxia. Untransfected CHO-K1 cells did not express either marker gene as assessed by RNase protection and FACS. For mutagenesis, the CHO line C4.5 was exposed to ICR191. In pilot experiments, one exposure to a dose of 1 μg/ml of mutagen for 5 h resulted in nearly 1 in 103 mutants at the HPRT locus per clonable cell (data not shown). Since we anticipated that disabling mutations of hypoxia-inducible transcription would be much less frequent, approximately 7 × 107 C4.5 cells, in 10 separate aliquots, were exposed to ICR191 at 1 μg/ml for 5 h. Previous reports had described a higher frequency of mutation following multiple exposures to ICR191 (19John J. McKendry R. Pellegrini S. Flavell D. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), so cells were allowed to recover and then subjected to a further two exposures of the same dose and duration. The cells were maintained in the 10 separate aliquots throughout these further exposures to ICR191 and the subsequent selection procedure. Cell mortality after one exposure was approximately 55%. The isolation of cells that were unable to support HRE-dependent induction of gene expression was made by antibody labeling of the HRE-linked cell surface markers and selection by panning. After a 16-h hypoxic exposure, cells were harvested, labeled with primary antibody to CD2 or E-selectin, and then placed on a prepared dish coated with secondary antibody. Cells that failed to adhere to the panning plates were collected, washed, and replated in tissue culture dishes. Once the cells had multiplied to about 5 × 106/pool, they were again made hypoxic, and another round of panning was undertaken. To measure the extent of selection obtained in this way, preliminary experiments were performed in which a marker CHO cell (bearing a constitutively expressed intercellular adhesion molecule-3 gene) was mixed with C4.5 cells in a ratio of 1:1000. After three rounds of panning of this mixed cell pool for nonexpression of E-selectin, the pool was tested for intercellular adhesion molecule-3 expression by FACS. These cells had now reached a prevalence of approximately 10% in the pool (and remained undetectable by FACS in a parallel pool that had simply been passaged without selection). From this, it was estimated that for a mutation frequency likely to be less than 1 in 106, approximately 10 rounds of panning would be required to enrich sufficiently for such a mutant population. Panning of the mutagenized C4.5 cells was therefore performed alternately with anti-CD2 and anti-E-selectin antibodies, to a total of 10 rounds. Throughout the procedure, selection was continued in neomycin and hygromycin B. Each pool was then tested for inducibility of both CD2 and E-selectin and compared with C4.5 cells. Results for one of the pools are shown in Fig. 2 B. A clear reduction in the hypoxia inducible expression of both markers was observed in a significant proportion of cells. Clonal populations from each pool were obtained by limiting dilution and then examined for noninducibility of both surface markers by FACS analysis. 44 clones that showed impaired regulation of these markers were tested further for defects in HRE activation by transient transfection with pHTK-Luc, a plasmid bearing an HRE-dependent luciferase reporter gene. In this assay, 32 of these clones showed levels of HRE activity that were the same or similar to wild type C4.5. However, 11 showed a clear but incomplete reduction in the hypoxia-inducible response ranging from 20 to 65% of that observed in wild type C4.5 cells. For nine of these clones, this change was stable over 12 weeks of continuous passage. One clone, Ka13, showed an absent response. Fig. 2 C illustrates expression of CD2 and E-selectin in Ka13. Ka13 was stable with respect to this phenotype and has been subject to detailed further analysis. First, the behavior of Ka13 was assessed in cell fusion studies. An HPRT− variant of Ka13 was selected in 6-thioguanine (a toxic analogue of the substrate hypoxanthine), and this phenotype was confirmed by sensitivity to HAT medium (the HPRT gene is required for survival in HAT). Equal quantities of the HPRT− Ka13 cells and the parental CHO-K1 cells were fused using polyethylene glycol, and hybrids (acquiring a neomycin phosphotransferase gene from Ka13 and an HPRT gene from the parental K1 cells) were selected in HAT medium containing G418. Each of several pools from two independent fusions showed restoration of the hypoxic response (Fig. 2 D). Since cDNAs encoding the heterodimeric HRE binding complex HIF-1 had been identified at an earlier stage in this work (10Wang G.L. Jiang B.-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4928) Google Scholar), we next tested if the defect in Ka13 could be corrected by transfection with cDNAs encoding HIF-1α or ARNT. Ka13 cells were co-transfected with pHTK-Luc and expression plasmids encoding HIF-1α, ARNT, or no cDNA. Results are shown in Fig.3 A. Co-expression of HIF-1α, but not ARNT, supported a high level of reporter gene expression. Increasing levels of expression in normoxic cells were observed with increasing concentrations of HIF-1α expression plasmid and could be further enhanced by exposure of transfected cells to hypoxia. For comparison, the activity of pHTK-Luc in the parental C4.5 cells is shown. These results suggested that Ka13 cells were defective in some aspect of HIF-1α expression or function but retained the ability to respond to hypoxia and regulate the activity of a heterologous HIF-1α gene. To address this defect further, Ka13 cells and wild type C4.5 cells were co-transfected with a Gal4-HIF-1α fusion gene (pGAL/α530–826) (21Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and a galactosidase-responsive reporter (pUASTKLuc) (Fig.3 B). Similar inducible activity was observed in both cell types, confirming that the underlying regulatory mechanism was functioning normally. Expression of HIF-1α mRNA and protein was next measured. Using RNase protection and Northern analysis, the total level of mRNA in Ka13 cells was shown to be greatly reduced when compared with wild type (Fig. 4 B). No abnormal transcripts were detected, and although the level of HIF-1α mRNA in Ka13 cells was at the limit of detection on the Northern blot, prolonged exposure of the autoradiograph revealed a faint signal corresponding to the mobility of wild type HIF-1α mRNA. In contrast, mRNA levels for ARNT were normal. Western analysis for HIF-1α protein was performed on nuclear extracts from wild type and mutant CHO cells (Fig. 4 C). For comparison, nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were run in parallel. HeLa and wild type C4.5 cells show similar nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α after stimulation, whereas there was no detectable HIF-1α immunoactivity in Ka13 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a HIF-1 binding oligonucleotide from the mouse erythropoietin 3′-enhancer demonstrated loss of the HIF-1 complex in nuclear extracts from Ka13 cells (Fig.4 A). Species showing the normal HIF-1 mobility shift were undetectable in Ka13, although the constitutive species was observed as in wild type C4.5 cells. Recently, another basic-helix-loop-helix PAS protein, termed EPAS-1, has been described. Since it possesses substantial sequence similarly to HIF-1α, dimerizes with ARNT, and binds similar DNA sequences (15Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W.

We also tested the ability of a human EPAS-1 expression plasmid to correct the defect in HRE activity in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 3 C, results were similar to those obtained with HIF-1α expression. Expression of E"

Although execution of the CD95 death pathway is largely independent of reactive oxygen intermediates, activation-induced cell death is blocked by a variety of antioxidants. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of redox processes in the regulation of CD95 ligand (CD95L) expression in Jurkat T cells. We show that various antioxidants potently inhibited the transcriptional activation of CD95L following T cell receptor ligation or stimulation of cells with phorbol ester and ionomycin. Conversely, a prooxidant such as hydrogen peroxide alone was able to increase CD95L expression. As detected by Western blot and cytotoxicity assays, functional expression of CD95L protein was likewise diminished by antioxidants. Inhibition of CD95L expression was associated with a decreased DNA binding activity of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, an important redox-controlled transcription factor. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB activity by a transdominant IκB mutant attenuated CD95L expression. Our data suggest that, although reactive oxygen intermediates do not act as mediators in the execution phase of CD95-mediated apoptosis, they are involved in the transcriptional regulation of CD95L expression.

Apoptosis is an active form of cell death that is fundamental for a number of biological processes and which can be induced by a variety of stimuli and conditions. In the immune system, apoptosis has been recognized as a major element controlling the development of lymphocytes and the extent and duration of an immune response (reviewed in Green and Scott (1Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar)). Activation of T lymphocytes through the T cell receptor-CD3 complex under certain circumstances leads to apoptosis. This process, referred to as activation-induced cell death (AICD), 1The abbreviations used are: AICD, activation-induced cell death; CD95L, CD95 ligand; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NF, nuclear factor; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; DTT, dithiothreitol; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; bp, base pair(s); XTT, 2,3-bis[methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-phenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide. is assumed to play an essential role in the induction of peripheral tolerance and in downsizing of the immune response (1Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). An important mediator of apoptosis in the immune system is the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) receptor/ligand system (reviewed in Refs. 2Nagata S.

CD95 belongs to an increasing family of cell surface receptors with homology to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. Its ligand CD95L is a type II transmembrane protein of 40–42 kDa that induces apoptosis in sensitive target cells (5Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). CD95L can be proteolytically cleaved from the membrane by a metalloprotease and also occur as a soluble cytokine of about 26 kDa (5Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S.

Activation of T cells with anti-T cell receptor/CD3 antibodies or mimicking agents, such as phorbolester and calcium ionophore, rapidly induces CD95L expression. CD95L then triggers cell death in CD95-positive target cells by an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. AICD mediated by CD95L represents an important safeguard in the immune system to control the expansion of activated T lymphocytes. The consequences of a failure of this process are demonstrated by the phenotype of lpr and gld mice. In these animals, the lack of functional CD95 receptor and ligand leads to the accumulation of previously activated T cells with extensive lymphoadenopathy and splenomegaly (10Watanabe-Fukunaga R.

Miyazaki S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2909-2915PubMed Google Scholar), activated monocytes (18Oyaizu N. Adachi Y. Hashimoto F. McCloskey T.W. Hosaka N. Kayagaki N. Yagita H. Pahwa S. J.

This led to the proposal that the CD95 system accounts for maintaining the immune privilege of these organs by preventing activated lymphocytes from tissue infiltration. Constitutive expression of CD95L has been detected also in tumor cells of different origin, such as melanoma (22Hahne M. Rimoldi D. Schröter M. Romero R. Schreier M. French L.E. Schneider P. Bornand T. Fontana A. Leinard D. Cerottini J. Tschopp J. Science. 1996; 274: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), astrocytoma (23Saas P. Walker P.R. Hahne M. Quiquerez A.-L.

A. 1997; 94: 6420-6425Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This suggested that the expression of CD95L may allow tumor cells to escape the host's immune surveillance and promote tumor progression (26Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 130-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rapid progress has been achieved in the elucidation of the signaling pathway of CD95-mediated apoptosis (reviewed in Fraser and Evan (27Fraser A. Evan G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar)). Upon binding of CD95L or agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies, an adapter molecule, called FADD, is instantly recruited to the so-called death domain of the intracellular part of CD95. This then results in binding and activation of FLICE (Mach) which is a member of a growing family of apoptosis-relevant proteases, called caspases. Further downstream in the death pathway, activation of FLICE presumably triggers the proteolytic processing and activation of other caspases, which then finally cleave various not well defined cellular substrates (28Chow S.C. Weis M. Kass G.E.N. Holmström T.H. Eriksson J.E. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,29Los M. van de Craen M. Penning L. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Another class of mediators that have been implicated in several forms of cell death are reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) (reviewed in Refs. 30Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar, 31Kroemer G. Petite P. Zanzami N. Vayssière J.L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 32Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). ROIs are highly reactive compounds that are generated during normal metabolism, and cells possess many systems to limit their damaging effects (33Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). The major source of ROIs in most cell types is probably the leakage of electrons from the mitochondrial electron transport, which results in the formation of superoxide anions. Superoxide anions can be converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutases. Hydrogen peroxide is then detoxified by glutathione peroxidase and catalase. However, hydrogen peroxide can also generate the highly toxic hydroxyl radical in the iron-dependent Fenton or Haber-Weiss reaction (33Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). The notion that ROIs are involved in apoptosis is mainly based on the following lines of evidence. First, excessive formation of ROIs as well as the depletion of cellular antioxidants can result in apoptosis in a number of cellular systems (34Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 35Schulze-Osthoff K. Walczak H. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Second, when cells are stimulated to undergo apoptosis, they often hyperproduce ROIs that subsequently causes lipid peroxidation and other noxious consequences of ROI-mediated damage (36Zanzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petite P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Third, antioxidant compounds as well as the overexpression of antioxidant enzymes inhibit cell death induced by different apoptotic agents (34Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar, 37Sandstrom P.A. Buttke T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 38Sandstrom P.A. Mannie M.D. Buttke T.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A number of data, however, indicate that ROIs may be important but not common and obligatory mediators of all forms of apoptosis. In the CD95 pathway, a role of ROIs is less obvious, since treatment of cells with antioxidants does not or only weakly diminishes cell death (39Schulze-Osthoff K. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 40Hug H. Enari M. Nagata S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced upon CD95 ligation or by other agents can even proceed in nearly anaerobic conditions where no ROIs are generated (41Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that an increase in superoxide anions blocks apoptosis triggered through CD95 in melanoma cells (42Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that AICD is blocked by antioxidant compounds (38Sandstrom P.A. Mannie M.D. Buttke T.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 43Jones D.P. Maellaro E. Jiang S. Slater A.F.G. Orrenius S. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 45: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 44Williams M.S. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar). Since AICD is a two-step mechanism, one involving the expression of CD95L and the other the execution of the CD95 death pathway, the possibility arises that ROIs may be selectively implicated in the first activation step of AICD. There is increasing evidence that small amounts of ROIs are not cytotoxic but may rather fulfill a signaling role as second messengers in the control of gene expression. We and others have recently shown that particularly two transcription factors, NF-κB and AP-1, are largely controlled by redox-dependent processes (reviewed in Refs. 45Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar and46Schulze-Osthoff K. Los M. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the involvement of ROIs in the activation-induced expression of CD95L. In Jurkat T cells, we show that antioxidants potently inhibited the transcriptional activation of CD95L. Conversely, the sole exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide was sufficient to up-regulate CD95L. Prevention of CD95L expression by antioxidants was associated with a suppression of the activation of NF-κB, a prooxidant-induced transcription factor. In addition, constitutive inhibition of NF-κB activity by a dominant IκB mutant attenuated inducible CD95L expression. Our data indicate that, although ROIs are not involved in the execution of AICD, activation-induced expression of CD95L in T lymphocytes is redox-controlled. These findings may be also relevant in apoptotic pathways induced by other agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, which induce NF-κB activation and subsequent CD95L expression. The human T cell line Jurkat and the murine fibrosarcoma line L929 stably transfected with human CD95 cDNA (39Schulze-Osthoff K. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine and antibiotics. Recombinant human CD95L was expressed in stably transfected 293 cells as a soluble Flag-tagged fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. 2M. Vogt and K. Schulze-Osthoff, manuscript in preparation. Chimeric receptor decoy proteins consisting of the extracellular part of CD95 or TNF-R1 fused to IgG1-Fc were kindly provided by Immunex (Seattle). Mouse-anti-human CD95L (clone G247-4) was purchased from Pharmingen (Hamburg, FRG). Anti-CD3 (OKT3) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the antioxidant compounds clotrimazole, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), dithiothreitol (DTT), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and rotenone were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, FRG). Cells were plated at 2 × 106/well in six-well plates and pretreated for 30 min with the inhibitors, followed by the addition of a combination of PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for additional 60 min. Total cell extracts were then prepared by resuspending PBS-washed cell pellets in a high salt buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out essentially as described previously (47Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the extracts (about 10 μg of crude protein) were incubated with the 32P-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide and loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The oligonucleotide with a high affinity NF-κB binding motif (Promega, Heidelberg, FRG) was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim, FRG) followed by P-10 gelfiltration (Bio-Rad, Munich, FRG) to remove nonincorporated radioactivity. Expression of CD95L mRNA was examined by reverse transcription-PCR essentially as described previously (48Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 × 106 Jurkat cells by the acidic guanidinium thiocyanate phenol-chloroform method (49Chomcynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed after heat denaturation (3 min, 60 °C) and annealing with 2.5 μmrandom hexamer primers (Perkin-Elmer, Weiterstadt, FRG) in the presence of 50 units of MnLV reverse transcription (Perkin-Elmer), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm of each dNTP in 20 μl for 30 min at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation for 5 min at 95 °C. Aliquots of 10 μl of the cDNA were then amplified in a DNA thermocycler (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG) with 1.25 units of Ampli-Taq DNA-polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 100 pm of both upstream and downstream CD95L primers, and 2 mm MgCl2 in a volume of 50 μl. Each of the PCR cycles consisted of a denaturation step (94 °C, 1 min), an annealing step (54 °C, 1 min), and an elongation step (72 °C, 1 min). For GAPDH mRNA expression, which was analyzed as a control for sample loading and integrity, 2 μl of cDNA were amplified (1 min 94 °C, 1 min 62 °C, 1 min 72 °C). The PCR products (498-bp human CD95L fragment and 397-bp human GAPDH fragment) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The quantities of the PCR products were determined by densitometric scanning using the Image Master 1D Prime software (Pharmacia, Freiburg, FRG). Primers used for amplification were human CD95L sense primer corresponding to nucleotides 386–410 (5′-ATGTTTCAGCTCTTCCACCTACAGA-3′) and antisense primer complementary to nucleotides 884–858 (5′-CCAGAGAGAGCTCAGATACGTTGACA-3′), and GAPDH sense (5′-ATGGCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′). Jurkat cells were pretreated for 30 min with the antioxidants and then stimulated by incubation in anti-CD3-coated (OKT3, 10 μg/ml) culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and lysed for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cellular proteins from 4 × 105 cells were loaded in each lane and electrophoretically separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS and reducing conditions. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semidry electroblotting. The loading and transfer of equal amounts of protein was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% non-fat dry milk powder in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with anti-CD95L (1.5 μg/ml). Membranes were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. Following extensive washing, the reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescent staining using ECL reagents (Amersham-Buchler). The biological activity of CD95L was measured in supernatants of Jurkat cells pretreated with the various antioxidants and stimulated with anti-CD3 and a combination of PMA and ionomycin. 18 h following stimulation of cells, supernatants were harvested and dialyzed thoroughly to eliminate any side effects of the inhibitors during the bioassays. Dilutions of the supernatants were then incubated with sensitive L929-CD95 target cells (39Schulze-Osthoff K. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was assessed after 24 h by measuring DNA fragmentation to hypodiploid DNA. Briefly, following incubation with CD95L-containing supernatants, L929-CD95 cells were pelleted, washed twice in PBS, and fixed for 30 min in cold acetone-methanol (1:1). Cells were then washed again and incubated on ice for 1 h in PBS containing RNase A (1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide (100 μg/ml). Histograms of DNA were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS-Calibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, FRG) using the CellQuest program. Cells to the left of the 2N peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered as apoptotic. For constitutive and specific inhibition of NF-κB activity, cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding a transdominant IκB mutant and green fluorescent protein (GFP) which was used as marker of transfection. The mutant IκB-α S32/36A, in which the serine phosphorylation sites are substituted by alanine residues, lacks the sequences for signal-induced proteolytic degradation of IκB-α (50Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3-EGFP encoded a codon-optimized GFP suitable for flow cytometry and was kindly provided by W. Wybranietz (University of Tübingen, FRG). Briefly, Jurkat cells were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/0.2 ml Tris-buffered saline, and cotransfected with 12 μg of pcDNA3-EGFP and 8 μg of either pCMV-IκB-α S32/36A or the parental vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands). Transfection was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (150 μF, 500 V). After transfection, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 1 × 106 cells/well and stimulated with the indicated reagents after 24 h. Eight hours later, cells were analyzed for CD95L expression by flow cytometry. For flow cytometric analyses, transfected GFP-positive cells were gated in the FL-1 channel. Transfection efficiency was between 10 and 18%. CD95L expression in the transfected subpopulation was analyzed in the FL-2 channel following staining with anti-CD95L and phycoerythrin-labeled goat-anti-mouse IgG (Dianova). Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by staining with propidium iodide. In the initial experiments, the involvement of ROIs in activation-induced CD95L expression was examined by reverse transcription-PCR. Jurkat cells were stimulated with the phorbolester PMA and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, and after 4 h mRNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using CD95L-specific primers. As shown in Fig. 1, CD95L-specific PCR products were not detected in unstimulated cells, whereas treatment with PMA and ionomycin resulted in potent CD95L mRNA expression. Pretreatment of cells with the thiol agent DTT almost completely abrogated the induction of CD95L mRNA (Fig.1 A). In contrast, expression of GAPDH mRNA, which was measured as a control for equal loading and integrity of the RNA, was not affected by this treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment of Jurkat cells with different concentrations of the dithiocarbamate PDTC, an iron chelator and ROI scavenger, strongly inhibited inducible CD95L expression (Fig. 1 B). Since hydroxyl radicals have been proposed to act as signaling molecules (51Essani N.A. Fisher M.A. Jaeschke H. Shock. 1997; 7: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 52DeForge L.E.

Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), we next examined the effect of Me2SO, a cell-permeable hydroxyl radical scavenger. Fig.2 A shows that Me2SO dose-dependently inhibited CD95L expression. Likewise, incubation of cells with phenanthroline, which chelates transition metals and thereby prevents formation of hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton reaction, inhibited induction of CD95L mRNA (data not shown). Chain-breaking antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, however, were less effective in inhibiting CD95L mRNA expression (data not shown). We further wished to identify the source of ROIs involved in inducible CD95L expression. An important intracellular ROI source is the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where electrons can be transferred directly from reduced ubiquinone to molecular oxygen (33Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar). It has been shown that blockade of electron entry at proximal elements of the respiratory chain, such as complex I, prevents mitochondrial ROI formation (54Konstantinov A.A. Peskin A.V. Papova E.Y. Khomutov G.B. Ruuge E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B demonstrates that preincubation of Jurkat cells with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone inhibited CD95L expression. Another important cellular electron transfer reaction, where ROIs can be formed, includes the cytochrome P450 system. Incubation of cells with the cytochrome P450 inhibitors clotrimazole (Fig. 2 C) and SKF 525A (data not shown) also strongly inhibited expression of CD95L-specific transcripts. We further investigated the effect of antioxidants on CD95L expression in response to a more physiological stimulus. To this end, Jurkat cells were pretreated with the various antioxidants and enzyme inhibitors, and then stimulated by incubation in anti-CD3-coated culture plates. Similar to the previous experiments, anti-CD3-induced CD95L expression was strongly inhibited"

Here, we report that high frequencies of CD28null CD4+ T cells were found in elderly individuals. Because deviations in the function of these unusual CD4+ T cells might be directly related to CD28 deficiency, we examined the molecular basis for the loss of CD28 expression in CD4+ T cells. In reporter gene bioassays, the minimal promoter of the CD28 gene was mapped to the proximal 400 base pairs (bp) of the 5′ untranslated region. CD28 deficiency was associated with the loss of two noncompeting binding activities within a 67-bp segment of the minimal promoter. These binding activities were not competed by consensus Ets, Elk, orAP3 motifs that were found within the sequence stretch. The DNA-protein complexes were also not recognized by antibodies to Ets-related transcription factors. Furthermore, introduction of mutations into the 67-bp segment at positions corresponding to the two DNA-protein interaction sites, i.e. nucleotides spanning −206 to −179 and −171 to −148, resulted in the loss of specific nuclear factor binding activities and the abrogation of promoter activity. These observations implicate at least two regulatory motifs in the constitutive expression of CD28. The loss of binding activity of trans-acting factors specific for these sequences may contribute to the accumulation CD4+CD28null T cells during aging.

Among the many consequences of aging is the progressive decline in protective immunity. Elderly individuals have increased susceptibility to infections and blunted responses to vaccines. The incidence of various forms of malignancies and the risk of developing autoimmune diseases also increases with age. Although the molecular processes leading to the aging of the immune system are not yet clear, there is compelling evidence that changes in T cell populations and concomitant changes in T cell effector functions may underlie many aging-related immune dysfunctions (1Miller R.A. Science. 1996; 273: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Because of thymic involution from the onset of reproductive maturity, aging leads to the inability to generate new T cells. Thus, there is a progressive replacement of naive (CD45RA+) T cells with those having a memory (CD45RO+, CD29hi, and CD44hi) phenotype (2Nagelkerken L. Hertogh-Huijbregts A. Dobber R. Drager A. Eur.

Paradoxically, expansion of the memory T cell population is not associated with enhanced memory immune responses in the elderly. Although the reason for this phenomenon is not known, previous studies indicate that T cells undergo functional changes with aging. Defects in signal transduction and, consequently, decreased proliferation and interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; hGFP, humanized green fluorescence protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PMA, phorbol 12-myristyl 13-acetate; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s); GCG, Genetics Computer Group; CMV, cytomegalovirus. -2 production have been reported (6Ernst D.N.

Ageing Dev. 1995; 82: 105-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Other reported aging-related changes in T cell function are the inability of T cells to support B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production (1Miller R.A. Science. 1996; 273: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 12Yang X. Stedra J. Cerny J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, T cell-dependent B cell responses are impaired with aging as demonstrated by the marked reduction in the efficacy of vaccines in the elderly (13Fagiolo U. Amadori A Cozzi E. Bendo R. Lama M. Douglas A. Palu G. Aging. 1993; 5: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar, 14Degelau J.J. O'Leary J.J. Hallgren H.M. Aging: Immunol. Infect. Dis. 1994; 5: 27-41Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify mechanisms of impaired immune responses, we studied a cohort of elderly individuals. Phenotypic T cell profiles of these individuals indicate that a subgroup had accumulated CD4+ T cells deficient in the expression of CD28, a membrane glycoprotein typically found on CD4+ T cells that provides the requisite costimulatory signal for T cell activation (15Linsley P. Ledbetter J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 16Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). In the elderly, these CD28null cells can comprise up to 45% of the total CD4+ T cell compartment. A similar CD4+ T cell subset is typically found among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of the T cell receptor usage of these in vivo expanded CD4+CD28null T cells (17Schmidt D. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 18Martens P.B. Goronzy J.J. Schaid D. Weyand C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1106-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) indicated that they are oligoclonal (19Schmidt D. Martens P.B. Weyand C.M. Goronzy J.J. Molec. Med. 1996; 2: 608-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and persist for many years (20Waase I. Kayser C. Carson P.J. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 904-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We propose that the emergence of CD4+CD28null T cells may reflect an aging immune system. Consistent with this hypothesis are the features of these cells, namely, their in vivo clonality and longevity, memory phenotype, and unusual functional profiles, including defective B cell help activity (17Schmidt D. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 18Martens P.B. Goronzy J.J. Schaid D. Weyand C.M.

Ageing Dev. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). All of these characteristics are considered to be hallmarks of an aging immune system (1Miller R.A. Science. 1996; 273: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as CD4+CD28null T cells appear to be a distinct subset of functional T cells in the elderly but not among younger individuals, further assessment of the immunobiology of these cells may provide insight into the cellular processes involved in immunosenescence. Our interest in studying the biology of CD4+CD28null T cells in humans lies in the well documented role of CD28 in immune responses as the major costimulatory molecule required for T cell activation (15Linsley P. Ledbetter J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 191-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 16Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar). In the mouse, the CD28 molecule is expressed on virtually all CD4+ T cells and has been unequivocally shown to be required for the maintenance of T cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and the de novo synthesis of many T cell-specific genes. In the absence of CD28-mediated signals, T cell recognition of antigen results in anergy or the induction of apoptosis. Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the critical requirement for CD28 in T cell-mediated immunity is the CD28-deficient mouse, which exhibits various forms of immune dysfunctions (23Harding F.A. McArthur J.G. Gross J.A. Raulet D.H. Allison J.P. Nature. 1992; 356: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 24Shaninian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W. Science. 1993; 261: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 25Corry D.B. Reiner S.L. Linsley P.S. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4142-4148PubMed Google Scholar, 26Boise L.H. Noel P.J. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Among the important issues related to the biology and emergence of the CD4+CD28null T cells is the molecular basis for the deficiency of CD28 expression. The genomic and cDNA structures of the gene have been reported previously (27Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar), but the structural and biochemical requirements for gene transcription remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we initiated studies to examine the structural requirements for the constitutive expression of CD28. It is important to note that although CD28 is constitutively expressed on CD4+ T cells, previous studies showed that the levels of its expression are not static. The level of CD28 expression has been shown to either transiently increase or decrease, depending on the stimulus (29Turka L.A. Ledbetter J.A. Lee K. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1646-1653PubMed Google Scholar, 30Linsley P.S. Bradshaw J. Urnes M. Grossmaire L. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3161-3169PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the levels of its expression profoundly influence its costimulatory function. The observed deficiencies in cell surface expression of CD28 among CD4+ T cells is correlated with a lack of CD28mRNA. 2J. J. Goronzy and C. M. Weyand, unpublished data. , 3T. Namekawa, C. M. Weyand, and J. J. Goronzy, submitted for publication. Similar observations have also been reported for transformed CD4+CD28null T cells without apparent genomic lesions of CD28 itself (27Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the hypothesis that CD28 deficiency in human CD4+ T cells is associated with a transcriptional block. In the present paper, bioassays were carried out to assess the transcriptional activity of the CD28 gene promoter in CD28-deficient cells. Additionally, studies were conducted to identify sequence motifs that may be associated with the differential surface expression of CD28 in primary human CD4+ T cells. Given the important role of CD28 in the immune response, elucidation of the biochemical and molecular basis for the modulation of its expression will facilitate our understanding of the biology of CD4+CD28null T cells. Because these unusual T cells appear to be a feature of the elderly, studies of the pathways controllingCD28 expression will provide insight on molecular mechanisms associated with the emergence of CD28null cells in the aging CD4 T cell compartment. A total of 60 Caucasians who did not have a personal or family history of autoimmune diseases were chosen. Mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood by isopycnic centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were subjected to standard immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD4, and CD28 (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and the lymphocyte population was analyzed by flow cytometry using either a FACScan or FACSVantage cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). All analyses of the staining profiles of lymphocytes were carried out using PC-LYSIS II software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). The frequency patterns of CD28+ and CD28null cells among CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes were analyzed as a function of age. Statistical analyses of the frequencies were performed using the Mann-Whitney test (SYSTAT for Windows, SYSTAT, Inc., Evanston, IL). The CD28null CD4+ and CD28+CD4+ T cell clones used in this study have been described previously (17Schmidt D. Goronzy J.J. Weyand C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2027-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 21Park W. Weyand C.M. Schmidt D. Goronzy J.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). They were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotech, Ft. Collins, CO), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). To enhance their expansion, cultures were also supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA) to a final concentration of 20 units/ml and cocultured with 1 × 105 cells/ml of neuraminidase-treated γ-irradiated (10,000 rad) Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cells every 7–10 days. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C/7.5% CO2 incubator. Cells were periodically examined for their expression of CD3, CD4, and CD28 by flow cytometry. Cell lines used in the study were derived from selected individuals with high percentages (≥20%) of CD28nullCD4+ T cells. CD3+CD4+ cells were isolated from peripheral lymphocytes by standard fluorescence-activated cell sorting procedures and propagated in vitro. The CD28null and the CD28+ sublines were generated from their respective parental CD4+ lines by at least two successive cell sorting procedures. Purity of the sublines for their CD28 phenotype was assessed periodically by flow cytometry. With these approaches, the parent cell lines maintained to date are 30–40% CD4+CD28null, whereas the CD28+ sublines are generally ≥98% pure, and the CD28null sublines are 100% CD28-negative. Jurkat and HUT78 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Both cell lines were maintained in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine. Jurkat cells were grown in 5% fetal calf serum (Summit Biotech) and 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies), and HUT78 cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum. Expansion of HUT78 was enhanced by the addition of recombinant human IL-2 to a final concentration of 5 units/ml. Both cell lines were also maintained at a cell density of 107cells/ml while in culture. Cells were cultured in a humidified 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator. Under these culture conditions, high efficiencies of transfection (see below) have been achieved. The genomic template for the cloning of the CD28 gene 5′-UTR was obtained by a combined strategy (see Fig. 2) of restriction enzyme digestion, Southern blotting, and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a healthy donor was prepared using standard techniques and digested with a mixture of restriction enzymes containing HindIII,BglII, and ScaI. Restriction fragments were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membranes. The appropriate fragment was identified by hybridization with a synthetic 41-bp oligonucleotide probe (see Fig. 2 B, probe 41) corresponding to a segment within the CD28 5′-UTR described previously (28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). This 41-bp segment of the 5′-UTR contains the putative Ets1 and AP3 binding motifs. This combination of the two motifs within the 41-bp segment was found to be unique for the CD28 gene. Ets and AP3 motifs were determined by structural analysis of the published sequence of the CD28 5′-UTR (28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar) using the Map program in GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) interfaced with the transcription factor data base (NCBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The appropriate restriction fragment was purified and used as a template for the isolation of the 5′-UTR by PCR with gene-specific primers using the Expand PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim). All PCR primers used in this study contained an engineered 5′ restriction enzyme site to facilitate subsequent cloning into plasmid vectors. Synthesis and purification of oligonucleotide probes and primers and the PCR conditions have been described (31Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The appropriate PCR amplification products were identified by the Southern hybridization procedure described above. These PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme, purified by GeneClean (BIO 101, La Jolla, CA), and cloned into a cloning/expression plasmid (see below). Plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) by standard transformation and drug selection protocols. Recombinants were screened initially by colony lift hybridization using the 41-bp probe followed by the direct PCR of positively hybridizing colonies using the same amplification primers used in the initial PCR. Clones containing the CD28 5′-UTR were authenticated by sequencing. For the present studies, a cloning/reporter plasmid was specifically created. The plasmid, pSVGFPAmpR, was a fusion of the appropriateBamHI-HindIII fragments from pGLPromoter (Promega, Madison, WI) and phGFP-S65T (CLONTECH). It contains the ampicillin resistance gene, f1ORI, a multiple cloning site, and the minimal SV40 promoter. The humanized green fluorescence protein (hGFP) cDNA sequence with the associated SV40 poly(A) site is located downstream of the minimal SV40 promoter. This plasmid was used as one of the control plasmids in transient transfection assays, as well as the cloning vector for the construction of a series of hGFP reporter plasmids containing fragments of the CD28 5′-UTR. Truncation variants of the CD28 5′-UTR were generated by PCR and cloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of pSVGFPAmpR after excision of the minimal SV40 promoter. These plasmids were amplified in bacteria as described above. Sequencing authenticated all CD28 5′ UTR reporters generated, and two independent clones for each truncation variant were chosen for subsequent bioassays. All plasmids used in reporter bioassays were purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation. The plasmid preparations were then dialyzed against 1× Tris-EDTA, desalted by column chromatography (NAP-10 columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and stored at −20 °C. Reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into Jurkat and HUT78 cells by electroporation. 1 × 107 cells resuspended in 300 μl of drug-free culture medium were aliquoted to electroporation cuvettes (4-mm gap Cuvette Plus, BTX, San Diego, CA). 28 μg of each hGFP reporter, resuspended in 50 μl of serum-free drug-free RPMI medium, was added to the cell suspension. The cell-DNA mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min and then electrically pulsed at 350 V with a capacitance of 960 μF and resistance of 129 ohms using an electroporator (ElectroCell 600, BTX Electroporation Systems). Cuvettes were immediately transferred onto ice and incubated for 10 min. About 1 ml of culture medium was then added to the cuvettes to resuspend the cells and subsequently transferred to sterile 6-ml tubes. Culture medium was added to the tubes to a final volume of 3.5 ml, and the cells were incubated overnight in a tissue culture incubator. hGFP expression was determined by flow cytometry 20 h after transfection. The analyses were carried out by electronically gating on viable cells by standard propidium iodide staining. For each experiment, a total of 50,000 events were collected for quantitative analysis. In experiments involving mitogens, transiently transfected cells were initially incubated in tissue culture medium for 4 h before the mitogens were added. Phorbol 12-myristyl 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, and ionomycin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. In initial experiments (data not shown), these concentrations of PMA and ionomycin were found to promote the proliferation of primary CD4+ T cells and IL-2 production by Jurkat cells under the culture conditions described above. For each transfection experiment, two control transfections were carried out. One of the controls involved the transfection of pSVGFPAmpR that served as the basal/vector control. The other involved transfection of phGFP-S65T (CLONTECH), a hGFP reporter under the control of the CMV promoter. hGFP reporter gene bioassays conducted also involved the cotransfection of 2 μg of the luciferase plasmid pCMVLuc (32Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This was done to normalize for transfection efficiency of each test hGFP reporter. Luciferase activities were determined by bioluminescence using a bioassay kit (Promega), and photoemissions were measured by a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold Analytical, Nashua, NH). In the present work, EMSAs were conducted using nuclear extracts from both CD28+ and CD28null CD4+ T cell lines and clones described above. Additional extracts from Jurkat, HUT78, other non-T cell ATCC lines (HeLa, K562, RD, and U937), and the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line HT10 were also prepared. Binding probes used in these assays were as indicated (see “Results” and Fig. 4). In competitive EMSAs, competitors were added to the binding reaction at 5–300-fold excess concentrations relative to the binding probe. The conditions for the preparation of nuclear extracts, radiolabeling of oligonucleotide probes, binding reactions, nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and visualization of gel shifts have been described (33Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29813-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Results of EMSAs indicated that there are two sequence motifs in the CD28 promoter 5′-UTR that bound nuclear factors from CD28+, but not CD28null, CD4+ T cells (see “Results”). To further evaluate the role of these two motifs in the promoter activity of the 5′-UTR, site-specific mutations were introduced into reporter constructs containing the minimalCD28 promoter (see “Results” and Fig. 3). Cluster of overlapping mutations, as indicated, were introduced by the gene splicing by overlap extension technique described previously (31Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. PCR Methods Appl. 1994; 4: S123-S130Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For these studies, the mutants were cloned into the BglII-HindIII sites of the vector, pGLPromoter (Promega) after the excision of the minimal SV40 promoter. Two independent clones for each mutant were selected. The plasmids were purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation and used in transient transfection assays with Jurkat cells as described above. For each transfection experiment, the plasmid pCMVLuc (32Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was used as positive control, and the pGLPromoter plasmid served as vector control. Transfection efficiency was normalized by the cotransfection of 2 μg of the β-galactosidase reporter, pCMVβgal (32Vallejo A.N. Allen K.S. Pease L.R. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined by bioluminescence using the Dual-Light Assay kit (Promega), and photoemissions were measured by a luminometer (Lumat LB9501). Mutants that showed ablation of reporter activity were identified, and their corresponding sequences were synthesized. Such oligonucleotides were used in EMSAs either as binding probes or as competitors to the wild type sequence. Preparation of nuclear extracts, conditions of binding reactions, and resolution and visualization of gel shifts were as described above. The cloned 600-bp segment of the CD28 5′-UTR was subjected to transcription factor mapping using the Map program in the GCG software interfaced with the transcription factor data base. Mapping algorithms were set at high stringency in that the relevant nuclear factor binding sites were identified with exact matches or with a single allowable mismatch. Our previous studies indicated that CD4+CD28null T cells are extremely infrequent in the majority of healthy individuals; however, a subset of individuals showed increased frequencies (18Martens P.B. Goronzy J.J. Schaid D. Weyand C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1106-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We examined an extended cohort of healthy Caucasian individuals to identify factors associated with the increased numbers of CD4+ CD28null cells. As shown in Fig.1, the frequency of CD4+ CD28null T cells was significantly correlated with age. These cells were rarely found among individuals younger than 40 years. In contrast, many of the elderly have a marked increase in the frequency of CD4+CD28null T cells. In some elderly individuals, these cells comprised up to 45% of the total CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1, inset). It is important to note that there were also elderly individuals who had extremely low frequencies of these unusual cells (<1% of the total CD4+ T cells) and those who completely lacked them. Conversely, there were occasionally those younger than 40 years with high frequencies (>2%) of CD4+CD28null T cells. These results indicate that there are other age-independent factors influencing the presence of these cells in the peripheral blood. The deficiency in the cell surface expression of CD28 in CD4+ T cells was previously shown to be due to the uniform lack of CD28 mRNA.2, 3 By standard reverse transcription-PCR techniques, none of the splice variants of CD28 mRNA (27Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar) were detectable. To test the hypothesis that a transcriptional block might account for the deficiency in CD28 expression, studies were initiated to isolate the 5′-UTR of the gene for functional assays. The genomic structure of the human CD28 gene has been described (28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 344-352PubMed Google Scholar). The restriction map of the gene has also been reconstructed by the mapping of contiguous phage clones. However, the sequence encompassing the entire gene domain remains to be determined. The regions of the gene that have been sequenced include 760 bp of the 5′-UTR, exons 1–4, and parts of introns 1–3. Intronic sequences that have been determined are those that immediately flank the exons. Using this information, we conducted a limited restriction enzyme analysis to isolate the appropriate genomic template for the cloning of the CD28 5′-UTR. For these studies, HindIII, BglII, and ScaI enzyme digestion was performed. As indicated previously (28Lee K.P. Taylor C. Petryniak B. Turka L.A. June C.H. Thompson C.B. J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl may play a functional role in signal transduction, since c-Cbl interacts with many crucial signaling molecules including protein-tyrosine kinases, adaptor proteins, and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase. Therefore, it is essential for our understanding of the functions of c-Cbl in signal transduction to identify its tyrosine phosphorylation sites, to determine the protein-tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate these sites, and to elucidate the role of these sites in the interactions of c-Cbl with other signaling proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that tyrosines 700, 731, and 774 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl in T cells in response to pervanadate treatment, as well as in response to TcR/CD3 ligation. Coexpression experiments in COS cells demonstrate that among T cell-expressed Src- and Syk-related protein-tyrosine kinases, Fyn, Yes, and Syk appear to play a major role in phosphorylation of c-Cbl, whereas Lck and Zap phosphorylate c-Cbl ineffectively. Fyn, Yes, and Syk phosphorylate the same sites of c-Cbl that become phosphorylated in stimulated T cells. Among these kinases, Fyn and Yes demonstrate strong binding to c-Cbl, which involves both phosphotyrosine-dependent and phosphotyrosine-independent mechanisms.

The retroviral Gag-v-Cbl protein contains the 355 amino acid-long N-terminal domain of murine c-Cbl, which is 98.5% homologous to the N-terminal 357 amino acid residues of human c-Cbl. The sequence of c-Cbl is extended beyond the stop codon of v-Cbl and, unlike v-Cbl, features a long C-terminal domain containing a RING finger, a leucine zipper, and numerous proline-rich motifs. This C-terminal domain accounts for more than half the total length of c-Cbl, which equals 913 or 906 amino acids for murine and human proteins, respectively (1Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse III, H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Gag-v-Cbl and the truncated form of c-Cbl corresponding to its sequence in Gag-v-Cbl are present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, whereas c-Cbl is exclusively cytoplasmic (2Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that c-Cbl undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to the antigen receptor-mediated stimulation of T cells (3Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J.

Because of the large number of interactions involving c-Cbl, it is crucial for our understanding of its functions to locate the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of this protein, to identify the PTKs phosphorylating these sites, and to determine the role of individual sites in the interactions of c-Cbl with other signaling proteins. These questions were earlier addressed in a study focusing on tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in Abl-transformed cells (23Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar), in which two sites that are essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, Tyr700 and Tyr774, were identified. However, no information is available regarding the location of tyrosine phosphorylation sites in c-Cbl following external stimulation of T cells, the nature of the PTKs phosphorylating these sites, or the interactions of these phosphotyrosines with proteins that are involved in signal transduction in T cells.In this report, we demonstrate that tyrosines 700, 731, and 774 are the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl in T cells in response to pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, as well as to the TcR/CD3-induced stimulation. We also analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in COS cells coexpressing various Src- and Syk-related PTKs with either wild-type or mutant c-Cbl. This analysis demonstrates that Fyn, Yes, Src, and Syk are capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl. Expression of Fyn, Yes, and Syk is typical for T cells, although not restricted to them. Furthermore, Fyn and Syk are thought to play a major role in the TcR/CD3-mediated signal transduction (38Tsygankov A. Bolen J. Stem Cells. 1993; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Bolen J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 40Zenner G. Dirk zur Hausen J.

Fyn, Yes, and Syk phosphorylate the same tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated in stimulated T cells. Phosphorylation of c-Cbl by Lck was substantially less profound than that by other Src family PTKs. Zap, another PTK crucial for T cell activation, was unable to phosphorylate c-Cbl in the absence of other PTKs but phosphorylated it in the presence of Lck, albeit to a lower extent than Syk, Src, Fyn, or Yes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that binding of c-Cbl to Fyn and Yes is higher than its binding to other T cell-expressed Src- and Syk-related PTKs. Physical interactions between Fyn and c-Cbl involve phosphotyrosine-dependent binding that is mediated by the Fyn SH2 domain. However, phosphotyrosine-independent mechanisms also contribute substantially to the overall binding of Fyn to c-Cbl. In contrast, binding of Yes and Src to c-Cbl is primarily phosphotyrosine-dependent.DISCUSSIONIt has previously been shown that several proteins, including PTKs, interact with c-Cbl in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and that several PTKs of T cells are capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl. In this report, we identify the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl in stimulated T cells as tyrosines 700, 731, and 774. This identification is based on the analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Cbl molecules containing Tyr → Phe mutations, as well as on the analysis of Phe → Tyr reconstitution mutations of the tyrosine phosphorylation-defective Tyr5 → Phe form of c-Cbl, which lacks tyrosines 674, 700, 731, 735, and 774. Most of our experiments were conducted with reconstitution mutations, because a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation caused by a single Tyr → Phe mutation was typically more difficult to detect than an increase caused by a single reconstitution Phe → Tyr mutation. This fact can be explained by low partial contributions of some tyrosine phosphorylation sites to the overall phosphorylation of c-Cbl, and/or by an increase in phosphorylation of secondary sites followed by the removal of any major phosphorylation site. Tyrosines of c-Cbl other than 700, 731, and 774 do not appear to be substantially phosphorylated in T cells. First of all, the mutant form of c-Cbl, which lacks tyrosines 700, 731, and 774 is not appreciably phosphorylated. Furthermore, the reconstitution mutations of tyrosines 674 (F674Y) and 735 (F735Y) do not result in a detectable increase in c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation for the c-Cbl proteins containing double and triple reconstitution mutations approaches that of the wild-type c-Cbl. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out entirely that mutations of c-Cbl induce structural changes in this protein, preventing recognition and/or phosphorylation of other sites of c-Cbl by PTKs. In such a case, some of the phosphorylation sites might go undetermined using this approach. Nevertheless, this possibility does not invalidate the identification of tyrosines 700, 731, and 774 as notable tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl.Although the pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is caused by the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases and not by the activation of PTKs as in the case of TcR/CD3 ligation (51Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the same sites of c-Cbl are phosphorylated following both pervanadate treatment and TcR/CD3 ligation. Moreover, the relative phosphate acceptor potentials of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation sites appear to rank in the same order for both anti-CD3 and pervanadate stimulation of Jurkat cells. These findings are consistent with the fact that pervanadate mimics natural stimuli with respect to both early signal transduction events and biological responses in T cells (51Secrist J.P.

Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) are capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl. Therefore, we further analyzed the ability of four Src family kinases, Fyn, Src, Yes, and Lck, as well as both Syk-family kinases, Zap and Syk, to phosphorylate c-Cbl in COS cells. Among Src family PTKs, Src, Fyn, and Yes phosphorylate c-Cbl to a high level, whereas Lck phosphorylates c-Cbl rather poorly. It is impossible to explain the observed differences in the ability of various Src family PTKs to phosphorylate c-Cbl by their differential enzymatic activities toward all kinds of substrates. Indeed, the enzymatic activity of Lck in COS cells, as judged by its autophosphorylation, is substantially higher than that of Yes, approaching that of Fyn. Despite the relatively high autokinase activity of Lck, the level of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in Lck-expressing COS cells barely exceeds such a level in COS cells transduced with an empty vector. This result is consistent with the ability of Fyn and Yes, but not Lck, to coprecipitate with c-Cbl from T cell lysates and to phosphorylate c-Cbl in these immune complexes (25Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,26Tsygankov A. Mahajan S. Fincke J. Bolen J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7792-7800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of Src-related PTKs to phosphorylate c-Cbl correlates with their structure, because Src, Yes, and Fyn belong to the same structural subfamily of Src-related PTKs, whereas Lck is substantially different from the first three kinases (63Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar).Among Syk family PTKs, only Syk, and not Zap, is capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl in the absence of Src family PTKs. Interestingly, the difference between these two Syk family PTKs with regard to their ability to phosphorylate c-Cbl closely mirrors their differences regarding the tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain of the TcR-CD3 complex (64Latour S. Fournel M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Fyn and Syk play a major role in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in stimulated T cells. Although Yes is also capable of phosphorylating c-Cbl when coexpressed in COS cells, its role in the activation-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in T cells is unclear, because the physiological stimuli that regulate the activity of Yes in T cells remain to be defined. Therefore, c-Cbl appears to be preferentially phosphorylated by PTKs that are expressed ubiquitously, not in a T cell-specific fashion. In conjunction with the fact that c-Cbl itself is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to many distinct stimuli, this finding suggests that c-Cbl-dependent signaling is not cell type-specific but is, instead, ubiquitous.Interestingly, all PTKs that have been shown to phosphorylate c-Cbl in this study phosphorylate the same three sites of this protein, namely tyrosines 700, 731, and 774. These are the same residues that are phosphorylated in response to T cell activation. Indeed, each of the phosphorylated tyrosines is surrounded by a sequence containing recognition elements for Src as defined earlier in Ref. 65Zhou S. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar. Most of these recognition elements are negatively charged amino acid residues (see Fig. 1), which are a characteristic feature of many tyrosine phosphorylation and autophosphorylation sites (66Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Importantly, none of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl exhibits recognition elements for Lck (65Zhou S. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), consistent with the actual ineffectiveness of Lck in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl in COS cells. It should be noted, however, that the search of the c-Cbl amino acid sequence for potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites as defined in Ref. 65Zhou S. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar suggests that tyrosines 141, 368, 371, and 455 also are sound candidates for being phosphorylated by Src. Our results demonstrate no appreciable phosphorylation of these residues, indicating that the actual tyrosine phosphorylation sites of a large protein molecule, such as c-Cbl, might differ from those predicted.These experiments also indicate that the double and the triple reconstitution mutations of the Tyr5 → Phe c-Cbl result in higher tyrosine phosphorylation levels for the “reconstituted” c-Cbl proteins than the simple sums of tyrosine phosphorylation for the corresponding single reconstitution mutations (see Figs. 3 and Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). It should be noted that all PTKs phosphorylating c-Cbl demonstrate this trait, although it is more evident for Yes and Syk (Figs. 6 and 7). These results argue that there is a certain degree of positive cooperativity between the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl, which may be due to the fact that phosphorylation of the first site generates a “docking spot” for PTKs facilitating further phosphorylation of c-Cbl.To determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in physical interactions of c-Cbl with Src family and Syk family PTKs, we examined the association of wild-type and mutant forms of c-Cbl with these PTKs. The results of these experiments indicate that association of Src family PTKs with c-Cbl is usually stronger than that of Syk family PTKs, although substantial variations are evident within the Src family. Both phosphotyrosine-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in these interactions, although their relative contributions to the overall binding appear to be different for various PTKs. Thus, the role of tyrosine phosphorylation is substantial, but not predominant, for Fyn, whereas Yes and Src bind to c-Cbl primarily through the phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions. Consistent with this notion, Yes is capable of binding to any form of c-Cbl containing at least one tyrosine phosphorylation site. In contrast, phosphotyrosine-dependent binding of Fyn and its SH2 domain to the c-Cbl molecules containing only a single reconstitution mutation is very weak and is dramatically increased by reconstitution of additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites. This synergism between tyrosine phosphorylation sites of c-Cbl may be due to the fact that, for some PTKs, several PTK molecules have to be associated with the molecule of c-Cbl to stabilize this complex.The tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is likely to have multiple consequences for signal transduction and cell activation. First of all, phosphorylation of one site may facilitate further phosphorylation of c-Cbl as a result of Src family PTK binding to this site. Furthermore, the existence of several tyrosine phosphorylation sites allows simultaneous binding of several signaling proteins to c-Cbl in an activation-dependent manner. In turn, simultaneous binding of PTKs and their substrates to c-Cbl might result in tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates. It has earlier been proposed that a similar mechanism might promote Fyn-driven phosphorylation of Zap, a small fraction of which was fou"

Adipocyte membranes had substantial levels of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO). SSAO activity and immunoreactive SSAO protein were maximal in plasma membranes, and they were also detectable in intracellular membranes. Vesicle immunoisolation analysis indicated that GLUT4-containing vesicles from rat adipocytes contain substantial levels of SSAO activity and immunoreactive SSAO protein. Immunotitration of intracellular GLUT4 vesicles indicated that GLUT4 and SSAO colocalize in an endosomal compartment in rat adipocytes. SSAO activity was also found in GLUT4 vesicles from 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rat skeletal muscle.Benzylamine, a substrate of SSAO activity, caused a marked stimulation of glucose transport in isolated rat adipocytes in the presence of very low vanadate concentrations that by themselves were ineffective in exerting insulin-like effects. This synergistic effect of benzylamine and vanadate on glucose transport was totally abolished in the presence of semicarbazide, a specific inhibitor of SSAO. Subcellular membrane fractionation revealed that the combination of benzylamine and vanadate caused a recruitment of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of adipose cells. The stimulatory effects of benzylamine and vanadate on glucose transport were blocked by catalase, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide production coupled to SSAO activity plays a crucial regulatory role. Based on these results we propose that SSAO activity might contribute through hydrogen peroxide production to the in vivo regulation of GLUT4 trafficking in adipose cells.

Insulin stimulates glucose transport in adipose tissue and cardiac and skeletal muscle by promoting glucose transporter translocation from an intracellular locus to the cell surface (1Gould G.W.

In the absence of insulin, GLUT4 is concentrated in membrane vesicles, which can be separated from cellular microsomes by velocity gradient centrifugation (5James D.E. Lederman L. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

To delineate the intracellular trafficking pathway of GLUT4, it is important to identify the proteins that colocalize with GLUT4 in the same vesicles.

As a result, we have identified a semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO, E.C. 1.4.3.6) as another protein found in GLUT4 vesicles from rat adipocytes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and rat skeletal muscle, and we demonstrate a stimulatory role of SSAO on glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in adipose cells. The identification of SSAO as a protein found in GLUT4 vesicles is in keeping with a recent report by Morris et al. (32Morris N.J. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Ross S.A. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride was obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). γ-globulin, goat anti-mouse IgG, semicarbazide hydrochloride, pargyline, clorgyline, tyramine, benzylamine, and most commonly used chemicals were from Sigma. Purified porcine insulin was a kind gift from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). All electrophoresis reagents and molecular weight markers were obtained from Bio-Rad. Anti-GLUT4 antibody (OSCRX) was produced from rabbit after immunization with a peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus (33Gumà A. Mora C. Santalucı́a T. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Anti-SSAO antibody was produced from rabbit after immunization with the membrane-associated SSAO purified from bovine lung. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat β1-integrin were kindly given by Dr. C. Enrich (Universitat de Barcelona). Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Wistar rats (180–220 g) by digestion in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 15 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, bovine serum albumin (3.5% w/v), and 1.5 mg/ml collagenase. After digestion for 35–45 min at 37 °C under shaking, isolated fat cells were filtered and washed three times in the same buffer without collagenase (KRBH buffer). After a preincubation period of 45 min at 37 °C, each vial containing 400 μl of cell suspension in KRBH containing the tested drugs (added in 4 μl of suitable dilutions to obtain the final concentrations) received an isotopic dilution of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose, giving a final concentration of 0.1 mm equivalent to approximately 1,300,000 dpm/vial. Assays were further incubated for 10 min and then stopped with 100 μl of 100 μm cytochalasin B. 200-μl aliquots of the cell suspension were centrifuged as described by Olefsky (34Olefsky J.M. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in microtubes containing dinonyl phthalate. After centrifugation, the cells (upper part of the tubes) were placed in scintillation vials, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted. The extracellular 2-deoxyglucose present in the cell fraction was determined with adipocytes previously stopped with cytochalasin B; it did not exceed 1% of the maximum 2-deoxyglucose transport in the presence of insulin, as previously reported (35Carpéné C.

Fat cell suspensions were incubated in KRBH buffer in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin for 30 min. Cells were homogenized with a Potter-Elvejheim Teflon pestle, and subcellular membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (36Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E.

Cells were maintained and passaged as preconfluent cultures at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. Two days postconfluence (day 0), differentiation was induced with methylisobutylxanthine (0.5 mm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and insulin (5 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 days, the methylisobutylxanthine and dexamethasone were removed, and insulin was maintained for 2 additional days. On day 4, and thereafter, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum was replaced every 2 days. Before each experiment, cell monolayers were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h. Cells were used for experimentation between days 8 and 14. Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 membranes was performed as in rat adipocytes. Microsomes from rat skeletal muscle were prepared as described (37Muñoz P. Rosemblatt M.R. Testar X. Palacı́n M.

Lafontan M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody was coupled to acrylamide beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000; Pierce) at a concentration of 1 mg of antibody/ml of resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before use, the beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (134 mm NaCl, 2.6 mmKCl, 6.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.46 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for at least 30 min at room temperature. Intracellular membranes were incubated with beads overnight at 4 °C (50 μg of membranes and 20 μl of beads). The beads were spun down, the supernatant was taken for later analysis, and the beads were washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline. The adsorbed material was used directly to determine amine oxidase activity; in some experiments, the adsorbed material was eluted with electrophoresis sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, cooled, and microcentrifuged before subjecting the extracts to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on membrane proteins following Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon in buffer consisting of 20% methanol, 200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3. After transfer, the filters were blocked with 4% fish gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated with antibodies in 1% nonfat dry milk, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. Transfer was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel after the electroblot. Detection of the immune complex with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies was accomplished using 125I-protein A for 4 h at room temperature or using the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham). The autoradiograms were quantified using scanning densitometry. Immunoblots were performed under conditions in which autoradiographic detection was in the linear response range. Amine oxidase activity was determined radiochemically following the procedure by Fowler and Tipton (39Fowler C.J. Tipton K.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 3329-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in 200 μl of 0.2 m phosphate buffer at 37 °C in the presence of radioactive benzylamine (50 or 100 μm; 50 mCi/mmol) or tyramine (50 or 100 μm; 50 mCi/mmol) at pH 7.4 for 60 min unless otherwise stated. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 225 μl of 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 4n HCl, and the products were extracted into toluene/ethyl acetate 1:1 (v/v) containing 0.6% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole before liquid scintillation counting. Blank values were measured in assays stopped immediately after the addition of cellular extracts and represented less than 1% of total radioactivity added in each incubation mixture. Time course assays were performed to ensure that initial rates of the reaction were precisely determined; proportionality to enzyme concentration was established in each case. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) with γ-globulin as a standard. Preliminary studies indicated the existence in crude membranes from rat adipocytes of substantial levels of [3H]idazoxan binding to imidazoline-I2 sites, characterized by an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 12 ± 2 nm and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 390 ± 112 fmol/mg of protein (n = 7). This is in agreement with previous reports showing a large number of imidazoline-I2binding sites in membranes from white adipocytes (25Carpéné C. Galitzky J. Larrouy D. Langin D. Lafontan M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26MacKinnon A.C. Brown C.M. Spedding M. Kilpatrick A.T. Br. J.

This was done by assaying the oxidation of tyramine, a substrate than can be oxidized by monoamine oxidases A and B (41Yu P.H. Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Yu P.H. Neuromethods: Five. Series I, Neurochemistry. Neurotransmitter Enzymes. V. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1986: 235-272Google Scholar) and by SSAO in the absence or presence of pargyline (a preferential irreversible inhibitor of MAOs) or semicarbazide (an inhibitor of SSAO). Results shown in Fig.1 clearly indicate that liver extracts express MAO activity since all tyramine oxidation is blocked by pargyline and does not express SSAO activity since no inhibition occurs in the presence of semicarbazide. On the other hand, adipocyte extracts contain both MAO and SSAO; complete inhibition of tyramine oxidation is only obtained by the addition of semicarbazide and pargyline (Fig. 1). Previous studies have also reported the activity of SSAO in crude extracts from adipose tissue (42Barrand M.A. Callingham B.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Raimondi L. Pirisino R. Ignesti G. Capecchi S. Banchelli G. Buffoni F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Further studies were performed comparing the oxidation of tyramine to that of benzylamine (a preferential substrate of SSAO) but also oxidized by MAO-B (42Barrand M.A. Callingham B.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 2177-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in light microsomes from isolated rat adipocytes; they indicated the presence of a high SSAO activity in light microsomes. This was substantiated by (a) tyramine oxidative activity largely inhibited (89% decrease) by 10−4m semicarbazide (Fig.2 A) and (b) benzylamine oxidative activity totally blocked by semicarbazide (Fig.2 B). In contrast, the tyramine oxidation measured in mitochondrial fractions from rat adipocytes was barely inhibited by semicarbazide (less than 9% inhibition at 10−3m inhibitor) but was totally blocked by the MAO inhibitor clorgyline (90% inhibition at 10−4m) (Fig.2 C). Of note, clorgyline blocked tyramine oxidation by only 10%, and it did not alter benzylamine oxidation in light microsomes from rat adipocytes (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that most of benzylamine and tyramine oxidation by light microsomes is not due to MAO activity. Furthermore, light microsomes from rat adipocytes contain SSAO, which can be assayed by using benzylamine as a specific substrate or by evaluating the fraction of tyramine oxidation that is semicarbazide-sensitive. Substantial semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity was also detected in light microsomes obtained from 3T3-L1 adipocytes or from intracellular membranes obtained from rat skeletal muscle (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation of membranes from isolated rat adipocytes revealed high semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity, assayed as the oxidation of benzylamine or the oxidation of tyramine sensitive to semicarbazide, in plasma membrane preparations (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). SSAO activity in plasma membrane was near 4-fold greater than in light microsomes (Fig. 3 A). Low monoamine oxidase activity was detected both in plasma membrane and in light microsomes (data not shown). The utilization of a polyclonal antibody raised against SSAO purified from bovine lung microsomes detected a single band in adipocyte membranes showing an electrophoretic mobility similar to that observed in bovine lung microsomes (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of immunoreactive SSAO protein indicated that it was more abundant in plasma membrane than in light microsomes (Fig.3 B). Incubation of adipocytes for 30 min in the presence of 100 nm insulin did not alter SSAO activity in light microsomes or in plasma membrane preparations (Fig. 3 A). No alteration in the abundance of immunoreactive SSAO protein was detected after incubation with insulin in plasma membranes or in light microsomes (Fig. 3 B). Based on the presence of SSAO activity in light microsomes from adipose cells and skeletal muscle, we next examined whether semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase activity colocalized with intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles. In a first step, we fractionated intracellular membranes obtained from rat skeletal muscle in sucrose gradient. These membranes are highly enriched in intracellular markers such as GLUT4, SCAMPs, cellubrevin, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 and are free from plasma membrane markers (9Sevilla L. Tomàs E. Muñoz P. Gumà A. Fischer Y. Thomas J. Ruiz-Montasell B. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Blasi J. Zorzano A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3006-3015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Muñoz P.

Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8133-8139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis of fractions obtained from sucrose gradient centrifugation demonstrated a parallelism between the profile of GLUT4 abundance and the activity of SSAO present in the different membrane fractions (Fig. 4). More direct evidence was obtained in vesicle immunoisolation assays. Quantitative vesicle immunoisolation analysis using monoclonal antibody 1F8, specific against GLUT4, and coupled to acrylic beads was performed in light microsomes from rat adipocytes. This method of vesicle immunoisolation adsorbed 70–90% of total GLUT4 from the fractions in a specific manner (Fig. 5 A). Under these conditions, GLUT4 vesicles specifically contain immunoreactive SSAO protein, which accounted for by 18–24% of total SSAO present in light microsome membranes (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, GLUT4 vesicles contain active SSAO. Thus, whereas the material nonspecifically bound to IgG beads contained very low levels of SSAO activity, 1F8 antibody brought a substantial level of SSAO activity (Fig. 5 B). Near 25%"

The message is expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined, and the cDNA complements Lec13, a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line deficient in GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase activity. The human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase polypeptide shares 61% identity with the enzyme from Escherichia coli, suggesting broad evolutionary conservation.

Finally, we show that the two homologous enzymes fromE. coli are sufficient to carry out the same enzymatic pathway in bacteria. Fucose is found as a component of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids in a wide range of species from humans to bacteria. For example, fucose is a component of the capsular polysaccharides and antigenic determinants of bacteria, while in mammals fucose is present in many glycoconjugates, the most widely known being the human blood group antigens. Fucose-containing glycoconjugates have been implicated as playing key roles in embryonic development in the mouse (1Feizi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and more recently in the regulation of the immune response, specifically as a crucial component of the selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X (reviewed in Refs. 1Feizi T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 84-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 2Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, fucose is transferred from GDP-fucose to glycoconjugate acceptors by specific transferases. Thus, defects in GDP-fucose biosynthesis will affect all fucosylation within the cell. Recently, individuals deficient in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose have been identified (3Frydman M. Etzioni A. Eidlitz-Markus T. Avidor I. Varsano I. Shechter Y. Orlin J.B. Gershoni-Baruch R. Am. J.

These patients fail to synthesize fucosylated blood groups, and their leukocytes do not express the fucose containing carbohydrate sialyl Lewis X. The patient's leukocytes do not extravasate normally, which leads to recurrent infections. In his pioneering work in the early 1960s, Ginsberg (5Ginsberg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2196-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ginsberg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2389-2393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) elucidated the enzymatic pathway converting GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Later, Yurchenco and Atkinson (7Yurchenco P.D. Atkinson P.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that this was the primary biosynthetic route to GDP-fucose. As shown in Fig.1, GDP-mannose is converted to GDP-fucose by GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase via the oxidation of mannose at C-4 followed by the reduction of C-6 to a methyl group, yielding GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose. The reaction has been reported to proceed with transfer of a hydride from C-4 to C-6 (8Oths P.J. Mayer R.M. Floss H.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 198: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by a tightly bound cofactor, thought to be NADP+ or NAD+, which is regenerated during the reaction. This intermediate is then epimerized at C-3 and C-5 to yield GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-glucose and finally reduced by NADH or NADPH at C-4 to produce GDP-fucose. In the initial studies, it was not certain if the last two steps, the epimerizations and reduction, were performed by one enzyme or two. One potential regulatory mechanism in the pathway was first revealed in the studies of Kornfeld and Ginsberg (9Kornfeld R.H. Ginsburg V. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 117: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase was inhibited by the final product in the biosynthetic pathway, GDP-fucose. Recent studies have addressed several open questions about the enzymes in this pathway. Two studies have shown that GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase utilizes NADP+ and not NAD+ as a cofactor. Yamamoto et al. demonstrated this with the enzyme from Klebsiella pneumoniae (10Yamamoto K. Katayama I. Onoda Y. Inami M. Kumgagai H. Tochikura T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and more recently Sturla et al. detected NADP+ bound to the Escherichia coli enzyme (11Sturla L. Bisso A. Zanardi D. Benatti U. De Flora A. Tonetti M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This requirement for NADP+ differentiates GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase from the two other well characterized sugar nucleotide 4,6-dehydratases, dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase and CDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase, both which require NAD+ (12Glaser L. Zarkowski H. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 465-497Google Scholar, 13Yu Y. Russell R.N. Thorson J.S. Liu L. Liu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5868-5875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies have addressed the question of whether the epimerase and reductase activities are present in one protein or are two separate proteins as is the case in dTDP-rhamnose biosynthesis (14Melo A. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1475-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jiang X.-M. Neal B. Santiago F. Lee S.J. Romana L.K. Reeves P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Serif and co-workers (16Chang S. Duerr B. Serif G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1693-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the 3,5-epimerase and 4-reductase activities were present on a single polypeptide when they purified small amounts of the enzyme from pig thyroids (16Chang S. Duerr B. Serif G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1693-1697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed by Tonetti et al. (17Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) when they cloned the human protein FX. Sequencing the gene revealed homology to the bacterial sugar nucleotide reductases. Using antibody depletion experiments, purified protein, and cell extracts as a source for the GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, they demonstrated that FX combined both the epimerase and reductase activities in one polypeptide. To understand better the human enzymes involved in this pathway, their role in selectin-mediated cell adhesion, and the LADII defect, we have undertaken the molecular cloning of the human gene encoding GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase. Furthermore, utilizing purified recombinant enzymes expressed in E. coli, we have reconstituted the GDP-fucose biosynthetic pathway in vitro. We demonstrate that two enzymes, GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase, 4-reductase, are sufficient to synthesize GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose, confirming earlier studies suggesting that both epimerase and reductase activities are encoded in a single polypeptide. Additionally, we show that human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase has a strict specificity for NADP+ over NAD+. Using the homologous E. coli enzymes, GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase, 4-reductase (WCAG), we demonstrate that the same is true in bacteria. We also show that human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase is subject to feedback inhibition by GDP-fucose and that this, along with its differential levels of gene expression, provides potential mechanisms for regulating its activity. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) EST data base was searched with BLAST on the NCBI server. The human and E. coli dehydratase peptides were aligned with the program GAP of the Genetics Computer Group analysis package. Amino terminal peptides of the GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase from different species were aligned using the GeneWorks program from IntelliGenetics, Inc. A cDNA library was constructed from HL-60 cells as described by Sako et al. (18Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cumming D.S. Larsen G.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This plasmid-based cDNA expression library was assembled into 19 pools, each representing 60,000–100,000 individual clones/pool. The pools were screened by PCR using DNA primers based on both the mouse EST (accession number W29220) and the published E. coli sequence: 5′-TGATGAGCCAGAGGACTTTGTCATAGCTAC-3′ and 5′-CAGAAAGTCCACTTCAGTCGGTCGGTAGTA-3′. Two pools gave the expected 200-base pair fragment. The 200-base pair PCR product was reamplified by PCR, random primer-labeled with32P, and used to identify positive clones from the two library pools by colony hybridization. This approach yielded plasmid pMT-hGMD containing the cDNA of human GDP-mannose dehydratase in a eukaryotic expression vector. A similar approach was taken to isolate the human epimerase reductase genes using following oligonucleotides based upon the published sequence (17Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar): 5′-CTGACATGGGTGAACCCCAGGGATCCATGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCCATCCTCGATGTTGAAGTTGTCGTGG-3′. The positive pools were probed with the 32P-labeled PCR primers. This yielded plasmid pMT-hFX, containing the cDNA of human GDP-mannose epimerase-reductase in a eukaryotic expression vector. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line Lec13, was obtained from Professor P. Stanley at Albert Einstein Collage of Medicine. This line was first transfected with pMTNeoFTIV, a vector expressing human fucosyltransferase IV and the neomycin resistance genes, by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (19Kumar R. Potvin B. Muller W.A. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21777-21783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To make this cell line capable of replicating vectors containing the polyoma virus origin of replication, one of the Fuc-T IV-positive cell lines, clone 9E9A, was again transfected with pCDNA3.1 ZeoPyLT, a plasmid expressing the early region of polyoma virus including large T, by the lipofectamine method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). One zeocin-resistant clone had Fuc-T IV activity and was replication-competent. This cell line, 9E9A LT2.9, was transfected with pMT-hGMD or pMT-hFX by the lipofectamine method. After 48 h, cells were analyzed for Lewis X expression by immunofluorescence after staining with CD15 antibody (Immunotech) and goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibody (Boehringer Manheim). Mutant CHO cells transfected with human dehydratase cDNA, human epimerase-reductase cDNA, or wild type CHO cells were lysed under nitrogen pressure in 0.75 ml of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT for 5 min in a Parr Bomb at 900 p.s.i. on ice. The cell debris was pelleted at 50,000 ×g for 1 h, and soluble extracts were assayed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 μm GDP-mannose, with 100,000 cpm of14C-labeled GDP-mannose for 2 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Unlabeled GDP-mannose and GDP-fucose were added as standards. GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose and the 4-keto 6-deoxy intermediate were separated as described by Yamamotoet al. (10Yamamoto K. Katayama I. Onoda Y. Inami M. Kumgagai H. Tochikura T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) except the amide-80 column (Tosohaas) was run in 66% acetonitrile and 7.5 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 4.0. The14C-labeled sugar nucleotides were detected with a flow through scintillation counter Beta-1 (Packard) run with a solid scintillant cell. The unlabeled sugar nucleotides were detected at 254 nm. The human dehydratase and epimerase-reductase genes were cloned by PCR into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of vector pRSETB (Invitrogen) for expression in E. coli. This yielded vectors pRSEThGMD and pRSEThFX. The inserts in the resulting vectors were sequenced in their entirety. The resulting dehydratase fusion protein had the sequence MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSPSAGTMEF added to amino acid 20 of the predicted sequence, the position homologous to the start of the E. coli enzyme. For the epimerase-reductase, the same 43-amino acid fusion peptide was added to amino acid 2 of the published sequence. The two expression vectors were transformed into E. coli strain BL21/DE3 and the bacteria were grown in LB media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Both the dehydratase-expressing cells and epimerase-reductase-expressing cells were grown at room temperature to an A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–4 h. The cells were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing DNase I and lysed in a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. After clarification, the dehydratase was purified by successive chromatography over nitrolotriacetic acid-Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) eluting with 200 mm imidazole, chromatography over ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) eluting with a phosphate gradient (0.0–0.5m), and chromatography over MonoQ (Pharmacia) eluting with a NaCl gradient (0.0–0.5 m). The epimerase-reductase was purified by successive chromatography over nitrolotriacetic acid-Ni2+-agarose eluting with 200 mm imidazole and chromatography over 2′–5′ ADP-Sepharose eluting with 10 mm NADP+. The resulting proteins were greater than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Amino terminal sequencing of the first 15 amino acids of the proteins confirmed their identity as fusion protein expressed from the pRSET vector. A second expression construct was made for each gene, which had a 20-amino acid amino-terminal leader, MRGSHHHHHHGSDYKDDDDK, added to the Met19 of hGMD or Met1 of hFX. To construct these expression plasmids, synthetic DNA was used to rebuild the hGMD gene from the AgeI site near the 5′-end of the gene. The synthetic DNA was hybridized and ligated to the AgeI–HindIII fragment of pRSEThGMD into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pRSETB to yield pT7hGMD. A similar approach was taken to construct pT7hFX using the BamHI–HindIII fragment of pRSEThFX. The resulting vectors pT7hMGD and pT7hFX were transformed into E. coli strain BL21/DE3, and protein was expressed and purified as above. No significant differences were observed in the activity, substrate, or cofactor preference for both the human dehydratase or epimerase-reductase having either the longer or shorter N-terminal fusion. Purified proteins were assayed in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm DTT, 25 μm GDP-mannose with 100,000 cpm of 14C-labeled GDP-mannose for 1 h at 37 °C. When sequential reactions were performed, the mix was incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C after adding second enzyme or cofactor. The reactions were stopped by boiling for 2 min followed by centrifugation for 1 min at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Unlabeled GDP-mannose and GDP-fucose were added at this point as internal standards. Kinetic constants were determined graphically using S/V versus S plots with GDP-mannose concentrations ranging from ½ to 5Km. The reaction conditions were as above with 1 mm NADP+ added to reactions. 14C-Labeled GDP-mannose, GDP-fucose, and reaction products were incubated in 0.2 mNaBH4 for 15 min at room temperature to reduce keto intermediates and then were cleaved from the sugar by incubating in 1m trichloroacetic acid for 10 min in boiling water. This mixture was chromatographed on Whatman 3MM paper in descending mode using three different solvent systems (solvent I, water-saturated methyl ethyl ketone for 24 h; solvent II, ethyl acetate/pyridine/water (3.6:1.0:1.15) for 7 h; solvent III, ethyl acetate/pyridine/water (10:2.5:1.5) for 17 h. Free sugar standards were localized by staining with AgNO3 in acetone followed by NaOH in methanol (20Chaplin M.F. Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1986: 1-37Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by cutting the paper into strips, and 1-cm sections of each strip were counted in 1 ml of water plus 10 ml of formula 989 (Packard). GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose was synthesized from GDP-mannose using the purified human and purifiedE. coli dehydratases. Typical reaction conditions for human dehydratase were 2.5 mm GDP-mannose, 0.1 mg/ml human dehydratase, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μmNADPH, and 10 μm NADP+ at 37 °C for 3–6 h. Typical reaction conditions for E. coli dehydratase were 10 mm GDP-mannose, 0.1 mg/ml E. colidehydratase, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm NADPH, and 100 μm NADP+ at 37 °C for 3–6 h. The reactions were allowed to proceed to completion as judged by HPLC, and the protein was removed by ultrafiltration on a Centricon-10. The resulting mix was desalted on Sephadex G-10 run in water and lyophilized. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose prepared this way was stable frozen at −20 °C either as a dried powder or in water and was judged essentially pure by HPLC and ESI-MS analysis. For ESI-MS analysis, 500 mm citric acid-sodium phosphate buffer was added to a 20 pmol/μl solution of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose (in 50% acetonitrile) to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm at pH 4. Flow injection at 10 μl/min was used to introduce this sample into the Micromass Platform II electrospray ionization-equipped mass spectrometer, which was operated in the negative ion mode with a cone voltage of 40 V. The intermediate was further characterized by high field NMR. All NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Unity plus 600-MHz spectrometer. Samples were dissolved in D2O, and HDO was used as an internal reference, set to 4.76 ppm at 25 °C. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, and heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence were performed with standard Varian pulse sequences. The gmd and wcaG genes were cloned from the E. coli K-12 genome using PCR oligonucleotides that created an NcoI site overlapping the initiating methionine of each gene and aHindIII site following the termination codon of each gene. The PCR products were cloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of pSE380 (Invitrogen), yielding pSEGMD and pSEWCAG. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. During the sequencing of the wcaG gene, it was discovered that multiple clones contained two nucleotide differences from the published sequence (21Stevenson G. Anadrianopoulos K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The last nucleotide in codon 255 and the first nucleotide in codon 256 changed from a CG in the published sequence to a GC in the cloned gene. This changed the predicted amino acids in those positions from an aspartate at amino acid 255 and a valine at amino acid 256 in the published sequence to glutamate and leucine in the cloned gene. E. colistrain GI934 harboring either pSEGMD or pSEWCAG were grown in LB media containing ampicillin at 370 °C to anA600 of 0.5. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 4 h. Cell pellets were broken in a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. After clarification, the E. colidehydratase was purified by successive chromatography over Toyopearl DEAE (TosoHaas) eluting with a NaCl gradient (0.0–0.5 m), chromatography over ceramic hydroxyapatite eluting with a phosphate gradient (0.0–0.5 m), and chromatography over MonoQ eluting with a NaCl gradient (0.0–0.5 m). The E. coli epimerase-reductase was purified by successive chromatography over Toyopearl DEAE eluting with a NaCl gradient (0.0–0.5m), followed by chromatography over heparin-Toyopearl eluting with 200 mm NaCl. The resulting proteins were greater than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Amino-terminal sequencing of the first 15 amino acids of the proteins confirmed their identities. To clone human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, we first performed a TBLASTN search of the NCBI EST data base using the sequence of the E. coli enzyme. This identified a mouse EST, accession number W29220, with a high degree of homology to the E. coli enzyme. We designed two oligonucleotide primers based on conserved amino acids present in both the E. coli sequence and the partial sequence of the mouse gene. Using the oligonucleotides as primers, we obtained a 200-base pair PCR fragment from a human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 cDNA library. This fragment was then used as a probe to isolate two apparently full-length cDNA clones for the putative human GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase, the sequence of which is shown in Fig. 2. There are two potential initiator methionines located at nucleotides 76 and 130 of this sequence. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the downstream methionine of the human protein more closely aligns with the initiating methionine of the E. coli protein. However, alignment of the human sequence to the recently cloned arabidopsis GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase gene and a putative C. eleganstranslation product (Fig. 3 B) suggests that translation of the human protein initiates at the first methionine, at nucleotide 76, and that dehydratases from nonbacterial sources contain an amino-terminal extension. The human and E. coli proteins are 61% identical over their entire lengths, and both contain an extended consensus sequence, GXXGXXG, identifying the βαβ fold found in many NAD+- and NADP+-binding proteins (22Wiergenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This sequence is found between amino acids 9 and 15 of the E. coli enzyme. Fig.4 shows that the human dehydratase gene encodes a single mRNA transcript of about 1.7 kilobase pairs that is expressed in all tissue and cell types examined, albeit at varying levels. The mRNA levels are highest in pancreas followed by small intestine, liver, colon, and prostate and lowest in ovary, brain, lung, spleen, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Likewise, a varied level of expression was seen in the human cell lines examined (Fig.4 C).Figure 3Alignment of GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratases. A, the peptide sequence for human GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase is shown above the sequence of the E. coliprotein. This alignment illustrates that the second methionine in the human sequence aligns more closely with the start of the E. coli peptide. B, alignment of amino termini of GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratases, showing the extension relative to the bacteria enzyme. The translated peptide sequences of human enzyme, putative C. elegans translation product (accession numberZ68215), Arabidopsis cDNA clone (accession numberU81805), and E. coli gmd (accession number P32054) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Northern analysis of human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase gene expression.

Analysis of the β-actin messages are shown at the bottom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate the isolated cDNA encoded GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase activity, we transiently transfected it into Lec13, a CHO cell line that previously has been identified as lacking GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase activity (23Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To monitor the GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase activity, we first stably transfected Lec13 with human fucosyltransferase IV (19Kumar R. Potvin B. Muller W.A. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21777-21783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that utilizes GDP-fucose to synthesize the Lewis X (CD15) epitope. This gave a readily identifiable cell surface marker dependent upon the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose. Restoration of dehydratase activity in the mutant cells should restore GDP-fucose biosynthesis and produce Lewis X antigen on the cell surface. As demonstrated in Fig.5 A, culture of these Fuc-T IV-expressing Lec13 cells in media containing fucose allowed the synthesis of GDP-fucose through the salvage pathway and generated CD15-positive cells. Transient transfection of the same cell line with the vector expressing the human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, in media lacking fucose, also causes the cells to stain positive for Lewis X, demonstrating that the dehydratase gene complements the CHO cell defect (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, transfection with the same vector expressing the human epimerase-reductase gene, again in media lacking fucose, shows no staining by CD15 (Fig. 5 C). As further evidence, lysates of Lec13 cells transiently transfected with human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase cDNA readily converted14C-labeled GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose (Fig.6 B), whereas lysates of Lec13 cells transfected with the human epimerase-reductase cDNA in the same expression vector did not (Fig. 6 A). The level of activity in dehydratase-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B, 25 μg) is higher than that of wild type CHO cells (Fig. 6 C, 125 μg). Based on this data, we conclude that the cDNA encodes GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase.Figure 6In Vitro assay of dehydratase and epimerase-reductase activity in wild type CHO and transfected Lec13 CHO cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2003485524,"Alkalosis is a clinical complication resulting from various pathological and physiological conditions. Although it is well established that reducing the cellular proton concentration is lethal, the mechanism leading to cell death is unknown. Mitochondrial respiration generates a proton gradient and superoxide radicals, suggesting a possible link between oxidative stress, mitochondrial integrity, and alkaline-induced cell death. Manganese superoxide dismutase removes superoxide radicals in mitochondria, and thus protects mitochondria from oxidative injury. Cells cultured under alkaline conditions were found to exhibit elevated levels of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, and calcium which was accompanied by mitochondrial damage, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and calcium, restored mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and prevented cell death. The results suggest that mitochondria are the primary target for alkaline-induced cell death and that free radical generation is an important and early event conveying cell death signals under alkaline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2157776145,"Induction of neuronal differentiation of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12 cells, by nerve growth factor (NGF) requires activation of the mitogen-activatedprotein (MAP) kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) also can induce differentiation of these cells. Like NGF, the ability of PKA to differentiate PC12 cells is associated with a sustained activation of ERKs. Here we show that maximal sustained activation of ERK1 by NGF requires PKA. Inhibitors of PKA partially blocked activation of ERK1 by NGF but had no effect on activation of ERK1 by EGF. Inhibition of PKA also reduced the ability of NGF and cAMP, but not EGF, to activate the transcription factor Elk-1, reduced the induction of both immediate early and late genes after NGF treatment, and blocked the nuclear translocation of ERK1 induced by NGF. We propose that PKA is an important contributor to the activation of ERK1 by NGF and is required for maximal induction of gene expression by NGF.

Rev. 1968; 48: 534-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 3Levi-Montalcini R. Science. 1987; 237: 1156-1162Crossref Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). This differentiation has been examined extensively in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12 cells, a well studied model of growth factor actions (4Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar, 5Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, neuronal differentiation by NGF requires activation of themitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (also called extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases, or ERKs) (6Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which NGF activates ERKs have been the subject of many studies. Upon NGF binding, activation of the NGF receptor, TrkA, triggers the assembly of a multimeric protein complex that includes the small monomeric G protein Ras (7Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 937-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ras activation triggers a cascade of phosphorylations on protein kinases that lie upstream of the ERKs (8Ohmichi M. Pang L. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14604-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) also induces ERK activation via Ras. Unlike that of NGF, the EGF activation of Ras and ERK triggers a mitogenic program within PC12 cells. The ability of NGF to trigger neuronal differentiation instead of proliferation is thought to depend, in part, on its ability to activate ERKs for long, sustained periods. Sustained activation of ERKs may be required for the translocation of ERKs into the nucleus where they induce a distinct set of gene expression (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). In contrast, ERK activation after EGF stimulation is transient. This is a consequence of the rapid termination of signals to ERK via a short feedback loop involving an ERK-dependent phosphorylation of the Ras activator SOS (10Buday L. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331PubMed Google Scholar). This loop uncouples Ras-dependent activation of ERKs from upstream activators (11Porfiri E. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5871-5877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The activity of this feedback loop is reflected in the transient activation of Ras by EGF. Interestingly, although NGF induces a sustained activation of ERKs, Ras activation after NGF treatment of PC12 cells is terminated rapidly (7Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 937-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Since NGF activation of ERK is sustained despite the rapid inactivation of Ras, NGF may utilize Ras-independent pathways that are not inactivated rapidly to allow the sustained activation of ERKs. Here we test this hypothesis by examining the requirement of PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, for NGF activation of ERK1. We have recently identified a novel Ras-independent pathway by which cAMP induces sustained activation of ERKs in PC12 cells (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). This pathway involves the Ras-related small G protein Rap1 as well as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA. In this study, we examine the possibility that PKA also participates in NGF signaling to the MAP kinase cascade by providing NGF a Ras-independent pathway to ERKs. We show that inhibition of PKA can inhibit signaling of NGF to ERK, to the transcription factor Elk-1, and to a specific marker gene of differentiation and can block the nuclear translocation of ERK1 induced by NGF. In addition, we demonstrate that NGF as well as PKA can activate the small G protein Rap1 and that this activation is blocked by the PKA inhibitor PKI. Therefore, we propose that PKA participates in NGF signaling to ERKs, in part via the activation of Rap1, and that this pathway contributes to the sustained activation of ERKs that characterizes NGF signaling. PC12-GR5 cells were kindly provided by Rae Nishi (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon). A126-1B2 cells, PKA-deficient PC12 cells, and stromelysin-1 (transin) cDNA were provided by Gary Ciment (Oregon Health Sciences University). Plasmids encoding Elk-1/Gal-4, 5xGal4-E1b/luciferase, protein kinase inhibitor (cPKI), and loss-of-function mutant of PKI, cPKImut, were gifts of Richard Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University). Agarose-conjugated ERK1 (c-16) used in immunoprecipitations was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. NGF was from Boehringer Mannheim. EGF was from Sigma. Forskolin, H89, and 8-CPT-cAMP were purchased from CalBiochem. PC12 cells and A126-1B2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum on 100-mm plates to 50–60% confluence at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before harvesting. For immune complex assays and Northern blotting, cells were deprived of serum and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before treatment with various reagents. 10 μm H89 was added to plates 15 min before treatment with NGF (50 ng/ml) or forskolin (10 μm). Lipid-modified PKI peptide (sPKI) was added at 5 μm, 10 min before treatment with NGF. 60–80% confluent PC12 cells were co-transfected with the indicated cDNAs using a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Corp.) was added to each set of transfections to ensure that each plate received the same amount of DNA. Four h after transfection, cells were glycerol-shocked and allowed to recover in serum-containing media overnight. Cells were then starved overnight in supplemented serum-free media (N2) that contained Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 μg/ml insulin, 100 μg/ml apotransferrin, 30 μm sodium selenite, 100 μm putrescine, and 20 nm progesterone (13Yao H. Labudda K. Rim C. Capodieci P. Loda M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20748-20753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After serum deprivation, cells were treated with the indicated reagents for 6 h before harvesting. Luciferase assay was performed as described previously (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped in PBS, spun at low speed to collect cells, and lysed by freeze-thawing three times in 100 μmK2PO4 (pH 7.8). For determination of Elk-1 activity, cells were transfected with 5 μg of Elk-1/Gal4 and 5 μg of 5XGal4-E1B-luciferase and other plasmids as indicated. Luciferase activity was assayed using a luminometer (AutoLumat LB953), as described previously (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with pcDNA3 in the absence of reporter plasmids provided a base-line value that was subtracted from all subsequent measurements. Luciferase activity was reported as the -fold increase above the basal levels reached in untreated cells that were transfected with the reporter plasmids alone. The expression of β-galactosidase was used to identify transfectants. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum on collagen-coated plates. Plasmids were transfected along with RSV-β-gal (3 μg/plate) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free media. After 4 h, 10% serum was reintroduced. Sixteen h later the cells were washed and placed in serum-free N2 media. The transfected cells were exposed to NGF (50 ng/ml) or 8-CPT-cAMP (175 μm) for 2 days before fixation. PC12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, after which cells were washed in PBS and subjected to a β-galactosidase assay. Cells were incubated in PBS containing 2 μm MgCl2, 5 μmferric cyanide, 5 μm ferrous cyanide, and 0.1% X-gal in overnight at 37 °C. Transfected cells, identified as those staining blue, were then counted to determine the percent of blue cells with neurites in each set of transfections. Each set of transfections was done in duplicate, and at least 200 cells were counted for each experimental condition. RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST, Inc. Friendswood, Texas) per the instructions of the manufacturer. Stromelysin (transin) riboprobes used to detect transin mRNA were synthesized after linearizing pGEM-TR1 with HindIII by using T7 RNA polymerase to make antisense RNA transcripts. Northern blotting using transin riboprobe has been previously described (13Yao H. Labudda K. Rim C. Capodieci P. Loda M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20748-20753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MKP-2 riboprobe synthesis and Northern blotting using this cRNA probe were done as described previously (14Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All filters were scanned and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445SI. Treated or untreated cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 10% sucrose, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 μm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 μm EDTA, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmsodium vanadate, and 10 μm sodium fluoride. The lysates were spun at low speed to remove debris, and the supernatant was assayed for ERK1 activity. One hundred μg of protein (as determined by Bradford Assay) from the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with an agarose-coupled antibody to ERK-1(C-16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and assayed for kinase activity by incubating with 25 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 60 μl of buffer containing 40 μm Hepes (pH 7.4), 40 μm MgCl2, 0.1 μm ATP, 4 μm sodium vanadate, and 10 μm sodium fluoride for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 60 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitations were performed by scanning the gel using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445SI. After treatment with the indicated reagents, PC12 cells were harvested, and soluble PKA was measured as described previously (15Carr D.W. DeManno D.A. Atwood A. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20729-20732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were incubated for 2 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μm cAMP. For GTP loading studies, PC12 cells were transfected with 15 μg of poly-histidine-tagged Rap1b together with or without cPKI using the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Rap1 was precipitated with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and GTP loading was assayed as described (16Urano T. Emkey R. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) with the addition of a preclearing step using activated charcoal. Nucleotide samples were spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose chromatography plate along with GTP and GDP standards (Sigma), resolved in 1 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4) at room temperature, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445SI. The GTP fraction was calculated as follows: (GTP counts/3)/[(GTP counts/3) + (GDP counts/2)]. PC12 cells were seeded onto Permanox chamber slides (Nunc, Inc.) at 30–40% confluency, serum- starved for 16 h, and treated with or without NGF (50 ng/ml) for 90 min. H89 (10 μm) was added 15 min before NGF, as indicated. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, 50 μm glycine (pH 2.0) at −20 °C for 20 min. The cells were incubated with ERK1 antisera (1:400 dilution) or normal rabbit sera (1:400 dilution) in PBS containing 0.5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes with PBS, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature and visualized using a Leitz DMRB microscope (Leica, Inc.). Both NGF and agents that activate PKA, including forskolin and the cAMP analog 8-CPT-cAMP, induce sustained activation of ERK1 in PC12 cells (Fig. 1). ERK1 activation by forskolin peaked by 20 min and remained elevated for at least one h. 8-CPT-cAMP induced a similar induction of ERK1 (Fig.1 A). The activation of ERK1 by forskolin was completely blocked by an inhibitor of PKA, H89 (17Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the actions of cAMP on ERK1 require PKA. NGF activation of ERK1 was inhibited at multiple time points (20, 40, and 60 min of stimulation) in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 1,B and C). In contrast, EGF activation of ERKs was not blocked by H89 at 5 or 20 min (and only minimally blocked at 10 min) in the data presented in Fig. 1 D, suggesting that H89 was preferentially acting on kinases downstream of NGF at this concentration. PKA can be inhibited by the proteinkinase inhibitor (PKI), a physiological inhibitor of PKA (18Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Patten S.M.V. Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this specific inhibitor of PKA could alter NGF activation of ERK1, we treated wild type PC12 cells with a peptide corresponding to PKI sequences from amino acids 5 to 22 that had been shown to be a specific inhibitor of PKA (18Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Patten S.M.V. Howard P. Walsh D.A. Maurer R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2114-2122PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide was modified by the addition of a stearyl group at the amino terminus (sPKI) to allow penetration into the cell (20Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vivo, sPKI inhibited NGF stimulation of ERK1 minimally at early time points but showed significant inhibitory effects at later time points (20 and 40 min) compared with NGF-treated cells not receiving peptide (Fig. 2 A). The addition of sPKI in vitro completely inhibited 8-CPT-cAMP-stimulated PKA activity (Fig. 2A, right panel), demonstrating that the addition of the stearyl group did not interfere with the ability of PKI to inhibit PKA catalytic activity. Unrelated peptides that contained the stearyl modification did not alter the ability of NGF to activate ERK1 at the time points examined, 2H. Yao and P. J. S. Stork, unpublished observations. suggesting that the inhibition by sPKI was not due to a toxic effect of peptide. sPKI completely inhibited the activation of ERK1 by forskolin at 20 min (Fig. 2 A). The requirement of PKA in NGF activation of ERKs was also examined in a PC12 line that is deficient in cAMP responses, A126-1B2 cells (21VanBuskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A126-1B2 cells contain near wild type levels of type I PKA but have greatly reduced levels of type II PKA. Furthermore, these mutant cells display altered PKA type I and type II regulatory subunits, as judged by ion-exchange chromatography. These alterations, as well as alterations in specific PKA-anchoring proteins (22Cassano S. Gallo A. Buccigrossi V. Porcellini A. Cerillo R. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29870-29875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), greatly reduce the response of the cell to cAMP (21VanBuskirk R. Corcoran T. Wagner J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1984-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In these cells, NGF activation of ERK1 was reduced at 20, 40, and 80 min compared with wild type cells but appeared unchanged at early time points (2, 5, and 10 min) (Fig. 2 B, upper and middle panels). The activation of ERK1 by 8-CPT-cAMP in these cells was blunted (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Western blotting demonstrated that the decrease in ERK1 activation after NGF stimulation in A126-1B2 cells was not due to the altered expression of ERK1.2 These results, together with the previous data, demonstrate that PKA is required for maximal activation of ERK1 by NGF, particularly at later time points. The transcriptional effects of ERKs are mediated, in part, by its activation of Elk-1, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors and a component of the serum response factor (23Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 24Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingound V. Nordheim A.

Biol. 1995; 5: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA was required for activation of Elk-1 by NGF, we examined the activation of Elk-1 directly in a mammalian two-hybrid system that measured the transactivation of a 5xGal4-E1b/luciferase gene by an Elk-1/Gal4 fusion protein (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 26Roberson M.S. Misra-Press A. Laurence M.E. Stork P.J.S. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 17: 3531-3539Crossref Google Scholar). These plasmids were co-transfected with or without cDNA encoding the PKA inhibitor (cPKI) or an inactive mutant of PKI (cPKImut) (18Day R.N. Walder J.A. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 431-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal activation of Elk-1 by both NGF and 8-CPT-cAMP was blocked by PKI but not by the expression of cPKImut (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the activation of Elk-1 by EGF was not blocked by either wild type or mutant PKI. Therefore, PKI specifically interferes with the activation of Elk-1 by NGF and 8-CPT-cAMP, but not EGF, demonstrating that NGF activation of Elk-1 is mediated in part by PKA. To examine further the requirement of PKA for NGF-regulated gene expression, we chose to study the immediate early gene MKP-2. It has been previously shown thatMKP-2 expression is rapidly increased in response to NGF in PC12 cells (14Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Its gene product, MAP kinase phosphatase 2, dephosphorylates and inactivates multiple members of the MAP kinase family including JNKs (c-Jun N-terminusKinase) and p38 in vitro and in vivo(14Misra-Press A.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), these actions of MKP-2 have been proposed to mediate the neurotrophic action of these agents (27Hirsch D.D. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4568-4575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MKP-2 expression in PC12 cells is also induced by a variety of other neurotrophic agents that activate ERKs, including fibroblast growth factor, insulin, and cAMP. 3A. Misra-Press, H. Yao, and P. J. S. Stork, unpublished observations. Since the induction of MKP-2 mRNA by NGF may require ERK activation, we examined the role of PKA in this process. The level of MKP-2 mRNA after NGF stimulation of wild type PC12 cells was reduced significantly by H89 (Fig. 3 B, left panel). In addition, in the PKA-deficient cell line A126-1B2, MKP-2 induction by NGF was also reduced compared with wild type PC12 cells (Fig. 3 B,right panel). The expression of the metalloprotease transin (stromelysin) is stimulated by NGF but not EGF and has been used as a marker for neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (1Shackleford G.M. Willert K. Wang J. Varmus H.E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 865-875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Machida C.M. Scott J.D. Ciment G. J.

Its induction by NGF is dependent on Ras, the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf, and ERKs (13Yao H. Labudda K. Rim C. Capodieci P. Loda M. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20748-20753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has been shown that this induction requires multiple transcription factors, including those of the Ets family (33deSouza S. Lochner J. Machida C.M. Matrisian L.M. Ciment G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9106-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34Kirstein M. Sanz L. Quiñones S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Saus J. J. Biol.

J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and by 24 h of stimulation, expression levels could be easily detected by Northern blot (Fig. 3 C). 8-CPT-cAMP could not stimulate the expression of transin in the absence of additional agents (30Machida C.M. Scott J.D. Ciment G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). However, 8-CPT-cAMP dramatically enhanced the ability of NGF to stimulate transin (data not shown), suggesting that NGF and PKA are synergistic in their induction of transin gene expression. The synergistic action of NGF and 8-CPT-cAMP on transin expression reflects the action of these agents on neurite outgrowth as well (35Connolly J.L. Greene S.A. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Gunning P.W. Landreth G.E. Bothwell M.A. Shooter E.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 916-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The participation of PKA signaling in NGF induction of transin mRNA was examined using H89. Preincubation with H89 blocked the induction of transin mRNA by NGF, suggesting that PKA activity was required for NGF induction of this gene (Fig.3 C). Neither treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP or H89 alone stimulated transin mRNA to detectable levels (Fig. 3 C). These data demonstrate that maximal induction of specific immediate early and late genes by NGF may require PKA. Since we observed the involvement of PKA in NGF signaling, we determined whether NGF could stimulate total cellular PKA activity directly. Based on the kinetics studies shown in Fig. 2, we treated cells with NGF over a time course extending from 5 to 40 min and examined total PKA activity retained within lysates prepared from those cells. We could not detect increases in PKA activity after NGF treatment at any of the time points examined (Fig.4 A). Similar results were seen after EGF treatment (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, 8-CPT-cAMP induced a 5-fold increase in PKA activity at the time points examined (Fig. 4 B). The activity within all lysates could be stimulated in vitro by cAMP except cells pretreated with H89, demonstrating the presence of PKA and the action of H89 on PKA in this experiment (Fig. 4 B). These results are consistent with previous reports showing that adenylyl cyclase and PKA activities are not significantly increased after NGF stimulation of these cells (38Race H.M. Wagner J.A. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1588-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,39Balbi D. Allen J.M. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 23: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data raise the possibility that a fraction of the total cellular pool of PKA is activated by NGF. Alternatively, basal activity of PKA may play a permissive role in NGF regulation of ERKs. The PKA activation of ERK in PC12 cells requires Rap1, a small GTP-binding protein in the Ras superfamily. Rap1 is a selective activator of one of the isoforms of MAP kinase kinase kinase, B-Raf, and the expression of B-Raf is required for Rap1 to activate ERKs (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). We show data that suggest that NGF utilizes PKA to activate ERK. It is possible that PKA participates in the NGF stimulation of ERK via its actions on Rap1. To test this hypothesis, we examined the GTP loading of transfected histidine-tagged Rap1 after transfection in PC12 cells. Both 8-CPT-cAMP and NGF increased GTP loading of Rap1 in this assay (Fig.5), raising the possibility that Rap1 participates in NGF signaling. Activation of Rap1 by both NGF and 8-CPT-cAMP was reduced to basal levels by the co-transfection of cPKI, suggesting that PKA contributes to the activation of Rap1 by both NGF and 8-CPT-cAMP. Since Rap1 mediates the ability of PKA to activate ERKs in PC12 cells (12Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), the activation of Rap1 by PKA may contribute to NGF activation of ERKs in these cells. 4R. H. York, H. Yao, and P. J. S. Stork, manuscript in preparation. We have previously shown that Rap1 activation is not required for the elaboration of neurites seen after NGF treatment of PC12 cells"
https://openalex.org/W2084125591,"Abstract The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria is a versatile reporter protein for monitoring gene expression and protein localization in a variety of systems. Applications using GFP reporters have expanded greatly due to the availability of mutants with altered spectral properties, including several blue emission variants, all of which contain the single point mutation Tyr-66 to His in the chromophore region of the protein. However, previously described “BFP” reporters have limited utility, primarily due to relatively dim fluorescence and low expression levels attained in higher eukaryotes with such variants. To improve upon these qualities, we have combined a blue emission mutant of GFP containing four point mutations (Phe-64 to Leu, Ser-65 to Thr, Tyr-66 to His, and Tyr-145 to Phe) with a synthetic gene sequence containing codons preferentially found in highly expressed human proteins. These mutations were chosen to optimize expression of properly folded fluorescent protein in mammalian cells cultured at 37 °C and to maximize signal intensity. The combination of improved fluorescence and higher expression levels yield an enhanced blue fluorescent protein that provides greater sensitivity and is suitable for dual color detection with green-emitting fluorophores."
https://openalex.org/W2012174792,"CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme, predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells during differentiation, that catalyzes the synthesis (cyclase) and the degradation (hydrolase) of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), a powerful calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. Due to the well established role of calcium levels in the regulation of apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation, the CD38/cADPR system seems to be a likely candidate involved in the control of these fundamental processes. The ectocellular localization of the cyclase activity, however, contrasts with the intracellular site of action of cADPR. Here we demonstrate that ectocellular expression of human CD38 in CD38− HeLa and 3T3 cells results in intracellular CD38 substrate (NAD+ + NADH) consumption and product (cADPR) accumulation. Furthermore, a causal relationship is established between presence of intracellular cADPR, partial depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores, increase in basal free cytoplasmic calcium concentration, and decrease of cell doubling time. The significant shortening of the S phase in CD38+ HeLa cells, as compared with controls, demonstrates an effect of intracellular cADPR on the mammalian cell cycle.

CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed on lymphocytes (1Jackson D.G. Bell J. J.

Immunologically, CD38 can be defined as an “orphan receptor” since its binding by specific monoclonal antibodies directed against ectocellular epitopes elicits cellular responses in lymphocytes, including proliferation, activation, and rescue from apoptosis (6Kirkham P.A.

Cyclic ADPR is a potent Ca2+ mobilizer from intracellular stores, in invertebrate as well as in mammalian cells (11Lee H.C. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and its presence has been described in most mammalian tissues (12Walseth T. Aarhus R. Zeleznikar R.J. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The widespread tissue distribution of the CD38/cADPR system suggests its involvement in the control of pivotal Ca2+-controlled functions like contraction, secretion, cell proliferation/differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the topological paradox of the ectocellular production of an intracellular Ca2+ mobilizer has raised questions on both the immunological and the biochemical functions of the CD38/cADPR system (13De Flora A. Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1149-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 45-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death has been advocated as a means for local increase in extracellular NAD+ concentrations, sufficient to elicit the production of cADPR by the ectoenzyme CD38; in this respect, nanomolar concentrations of NAD+ have been detected in plasma (15Franco L.

J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F469-F475PubMed Google Scholar), extracellular, exogenously added cADPR was demonstrated to elicit functional responses in intact cells, but most reported effects of cADPR on cellular functions require permeabilization of target cells to ensure binding of the nucleotide to its intracellular receptor(s). Internalization of membrane-bound CD38, as observed in human Namalwa B-lymphocytes upon incubation with NAD+ or thiol reagents, is followed by an increase of intracellular cyclase activity (insensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors) and of intracellular cADPR concentration ([cADPR]i) (17Zocchi E. Franco L. Guida L. Piccini D. Tacchetti C. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that cytosolic NAD+ is available to intravesicular CD38. This observation prompted us to investigate whether modulation of the ectocellular expression of CD38 could affect both the [cADPR]i and the free cytosolic ionized calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The experimental models developed for this study were human HeLa and murine 3T3 cells transfected or retrovirally infected with human full-length CD38. Neither wild type cell line expresses CD38. Several biochemical parameters were investigated during the progressive selection for high CD38 expression and on established CD38+cell lines. The results obtained indicate that expression of CD38 is associated with decrease of [NAD+ + NADH]i, appearance of intracellular cADPR, elevation of basal [Ca2+]i, and reduction of cell doubling time. Cell cycle analysis of CD38+ HeLa cells demonstrates a significant shortening of the S phase. These findings provide new insight into the physiological significance of the modulation of CD38 expression observed during hematopoietic stem cell and lymphocyte proliferation/differentiation processes (1Jackson D.G. Bell J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar). Fura2-AM was purchased from Fluka, Milano, Italy. [3H]Thymidine (80 Ci/mmol) and [3H]NAD+ (30 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, Milano, Italy. Cyclic ADPR and [3H]cADPR were prepared enzymatically from NAD+ and [3H]NAD+, respectively, with Aplysia californica cyclase (courtesy of Prof. H. C. Lee, Minneapolis, MN) and HPLC-purified. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb), IB4, was kindly provided by Prof. F. Malavasi, Torino, Italy, and anti-bromodeoxyuridine mAb was from Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA. Goat anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic beads (4.4 μm diameter) were from Unipath, Milano, Italy. 8-Amino-cADPR was generously provided by Prof. H. C. Lee. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Milano, Italy. HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells (3T3), obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfected and infected cells were routinely maintained under geneticin (1 mg/ml) selection in the above medium. The complete coding sequence of the human full-length CD38 cDNA (1Jackson D.G. Bell J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar) was recovered asXbaI fragment and cloned in the same restriction site of the pRC-CMV expression plasmid. The same full-length cDNA recovered asXhoI fragment was cloned in the XhoI restriction site of LXSN retroviral vector to generate the LCD38SN sense and antisense vectors. From a number of mutant CD38 forms obtained in our laboratory by site-directed mutagenesis, we selected the K129N/L131H mutant, which expressed very low NAD+-glycohydrolase activity (3% of wild type CD38), to be used as a control in this study. The synthetic oligonucleotide used for site-directed mutagenesis was as follows: 5′-ATAAATGATCACGCCCATCAGTTC-3′. Mutant CD38 was cloned into the XbaI site of pRC-CMV (CMV-CD38mut). To generate the amphotropic producer cell lines, the GP+E-86 ecotropic packaging cell line (18Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected with 10 μg of LXSN or LCD38SN sense and antisense vectors using a standard Ca2+ phosphate method (19Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Two days post-transfection the supernatant was collected and used to infect the GP+env AM-12 amphotropic packaging cell line (20Markowitz D. Goff S. Bank A. Virology. 1988; 167: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) for 16 h, followed by three subsequent cross-infections using the ping-pong technique. The amphotropic packaging cell line was then plated at low density and selected with geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, Scotland) at 1.2 mg/ml (active form) for 10 days. After geneticin selection, individual clones were collected, and their titer was assessed by infecting HeLa cells with a serial dilution of the different viral stocks. The absence of replication competent retrovirus was assessed by the absence of serially transmitted geneticin resistance on HeLa and 3T3 cells (21Cone R.D. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 81: 6349-6353Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). CMV-CD38 and CMV-CD38mut, both sense and antisense, were transfected into HeLa and 3T3 cells using a standard Ca2+ phosphate procedure (19Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The lower NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) specific activity of mutant, as compared with wild type CD38, was demonstrated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis of Triton X-100-solubilized pellets of transfected 3T3 cells; samples with similar protein content showed a 46-kDa band of comparable intensity (as detected by ECL), whereas samples with similar NADase activity showed a much higher band intensity in the mutant lane as compared with wild type CD38 (not shown). For cell line infection, HeLa and 3T3 cell lines were plated on 6-well plates, and the filtered retroviral supernatant of a high titer, cloned packaging cell line was added overnight in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Two days after gene transfer, geneticin (1 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium, and transduced cells were maintained under antibiotic selection throughout the study. Several successive magnetic bead selections for high expression of CD38 were performed on transduced cells during the first 2 weeks following gene transfer and were thereafter repeated monthly using anti-CD38 mAb and goat anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic beads. Expression of CD38 was monitored routinely by immunofluorescence (>95% of cells were positive) and by assay of CD38 ectoenzyme activities on intact cells (see below): NADase (production of ADPR from NAD+), cyclase (production of non-hydrolyzable cGDPR from the NAD+ analog NGD+), and hydrolase (production of ADPR from cADPR). Detachment of adherent cells with a brief trypsin treatment was found not to decrease either CD38 immunofluorescence or any of its enzyme activities as compared with detachment with PBS/EDTA. Thus, trypsin was used throughout this study for removing adherent cells. NADase, cyclase, and hydrolase activities were assayed on NAD+, NGD+, and cADPR, respectively, by incubating 2 × 105 cells in a total volume of 400 μl of PBS/glucose (10 mm) with 0.2 mm NAD+, NGD+, or cADPR. At different times, 60-μl aliquots of the incubations were removed and briefly centrifuged, and 50-μl supernatants were analyzed by HPLC (22Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed on an aliquot of the incubations by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The total pyridine dinucleotide content of cells was determined by a modification of a sensitive enzymatic cycling method (24Zerez C. Lee S. Tanaka K. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), as described (25Zocchi E. Polvani C. Guida L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), on alkaline extracts from 106 cells. Values were occasionally confirmed by HPLC analysis of neutralized perchloric acid extracts (3 × 106 cells). The intracellular cADPR concentration was determined with a specific radioimmunoassay, as described in detail in Ref. 26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, on neutralized perchloric acid extracts (2 × 107 cells). The cADPR-specific chicken antibody used was obtained following immunization of the animals with mono-succinylated cADPR and partially purified from eggs as described (26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The antibody was specific for cADPR; the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50, for cold cADPR was approximately 2 nm, whereas other nucleotides (ADPR, NAD+, NMN, and ATP) produced no displacement at similar concentrations. However, the millimolar range of the intracellular concentrations of some nucleotides could interfere with the radioimmunoassay (26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, prior to radioimmunoassay, cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with the following enzymes: NADase (from Neurospora crassa), 0.25 units/ml; nucleotide pyrophosphatase (fromCrotalus atrox), 1.75 units/ml; alkaline phosphatase (from bovine intestine), 50 units/ml; and apyrase (from potato) 5 units/ml, as described (26Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although cADPR is resistant to these enzymes, other nucleotides potentially interfering with the assay were completely removed. Finally, each extract was divided into 2 aliquots, one of which was incubated in the presence of 0.2 μg of purified CD38 for 1 h at 37 °C to hydrolyze cADPR. Both aliquots were then heated at 100 °C for 15 min to inactivate CD38, and the concentration of cADPR in the cell extract was calculated from the difference between the radioactivity values of the CD38-treated (control) and untreated sample. For each experiment, cell doubling time was determined according to three different methods as follows: [3H]thymidine (TdR) incorporation, direct cell count, and protein determination. For [3H]TdR incorporation cells were seeded in triplicate at 104/well in 24-well plates, and 1 μCi of [3H]TdR was added to each well. At different times (typically 14, 19, 24, 36, 40, and 48 h) cells were removed with trypsin, and the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble, incorporated radioactivity was harvested on glass fiber filters (Whatman, Maidenstone, UK). For direct cell count and protein determination 2 × 104 cells were seeded, in duplicate, in 25-cm2 flasks. At different times (typically 24, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 h) cells were removed and counted, and the cell pellets were washed twice with PBS in a microcentrifuge, and total protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The cell doubling times obtained with the different methods,i.e. the time required to double either the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble incorporated [3H]TdR radioactivity, the cell number, or the total protein content, were always closely comparable. The cell doubling time was calculated as the mean of the above three values. Adherent (on 20-mm coverslips) cells were incubated with 6 μm Fura2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura2-AM) in standard saline containing 5 mm glucose for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed several times with standard saline at room temperature. This protocol resulted in optimal loading of the dye, which lasted for several hours. The specimen was then mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM35, Germany) and continuously perfused with solutions fed by gravity, through solenoid microvalves and removed by a hydraulic vacuum pump. Cells were viewed through a 100 × Nikon Fluor objective. The field contained from 1 to 10 cell bodies. Cells were illuminated by a 75-watt Xenon lamp (PTI, Brunswick, NJ) equipped with a rotating wheel with six interference filters, four filters centered at 340 nm and two centered at 380 nm. A computer-driven spectrophotometer system (Cairn Research, Sittingbourne, UK) controlled both rotor speed and emitted light acquisition through a photomultiplier (ThornEMI, Ruinslip, UK). The emissions relative to each series of filters (E340 and E380, respectively) were mediated, and the ratio R =E340/E380 was calculated after subtraction of background fluorescence. The rotor speed was set at 32 rps, and emission ratios were averaged on-line over 16 revolutions to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The final frequency of recording was 1 point/0.5 s. The intracellular free calcium concentration was calculated according to Equation 1 (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i=βKD(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)Equation 1 where R isE340/E380;Rmin isE340/E380 in zero calcium; Rmax isE340/E380 in calcium-saturated solution; β is E380 in zero calcium/E380 in calcium-saturated solution; and KD = 140 nm (the dissociation constant of the dye at room temperature). To obtain the parameter values, after each experiment cells were incubated in 10 μm4-bromo-calcium ionophore A23187 for 20–40 min in a zero-calcium bath (0 calcium + 1 mm EGTA) and then perfused with the saturated Ca2+ solution. At the end of this procedure, 5 mm MnCl2 was added to the bath to quench the fluorescence of the dye and determine the background values. The standard physiological saline contained the following (in mm): NaCl 135, KCl 5.4, CaCl21.8, MgCl2 1, Hepes 5, pH 7.4. The volume of the recording chamber was 200 μl, and the bath solution flowed at the rate of 100 μl/s, assuring a complete exchange of the solution in few seconds. Cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization was achieved by incubating cells with 25 μm digitonin in Ca2+-free standard solution. The experiments were performed in Ca2+-free external solution to observe modifications of intracellular ionic calcium originated from internal compartments only. This was obtained as described (28De Flora A. Benatti U. Guida L. Forteleoni G. Meloni T. Blood. 1985; 66: 294-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on La3+trichloroacetic acid extracts of 107 cells. For determination of calcium influx, 5 × 105 cells per time point were incubated at 37 °C in standard saline solution (see above) with 10 mm glucose containing 5 μCi/ml45Ca2+. At various times, individual incubation mixtures were centrifuged; the cell pellets were rapidly washed in chilled standard solution without 45Ca, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined. In efflux experiments, cells were equilibrium-loaded with45Ca2+ by culture for 72 h in complete medium supplemented with 45Ca2+ (5 μCi/ml). Thereafter, cells were detached with trypsin, rapidly washed twice in chilled standard solution, and resuspended at 4 × 106/ml in the same buffer containing EGTA (2 mm). The radioactivity released in the supernatant, after incubation at 37 °C, was determined at various times after brief centrifugation of the cells. HeLa cells, washed twice with PBS, were reversibly permeabilized with SLO, essentially as described (29Paillasson S. Van De Corput M. Dirks R.W. Tanke H.J. Robert-Nicoud M. Ronot X. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), except that cells were treated with SLO in suspension (400 units/ml/106 cells) for 20 min at room temperature. Permeabilization was confirmed on aliquots of cells by detection of fluorescent lucifer yellow (molecular weight, 572) uptake. Permeabilized cells were divided into 2 aliquots, either cADPR or ADPR (100 μm final concentration) was added, and cells were further incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were resealed by addition of 1 volume of complete medium, incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and washed twice in complete medium, and resealing was checked by lucifer yellow permeability; routinely more than 97% of resealed cells were again impermeant to the fluorescent dye. Resealed cells were then seeded in duplicate in 25-cm2 flasks, as described above, for determination of total protein content and cell number during the following 5 days' culture. Aliquots of cells were seeded on glass coverslips for measurement of [Ca2+]i and cultured for up to 5 days in sterile Petri dishes. To monitor the metabolic fate of encapsulated cADPR, the same protocol was used for entrapment of [3H]cADPR (250 cpm/pmol, 100 μm final concentration) into wild type HeLa cells. Immediately after resealing and at various times of culture, 2–4 × 106 cells were trichloroacetic acid-extracted, and the radioactivity incorporated into nucleotides was analyzed by HPLC (22Guida L. Franco L. Zocchi E. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing CD38+/− transfected HeLa cells (seeded at 106/75-cm2 flasks 12 h before) were labeled for 30 min with 30 μm 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were then washed with PBS and either immediately fixed (time 0) or further cultured in complete medium for 4 h. BrdUrd-labeled cells were detached with trypsin, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm EDTA, and fixed in chilled 70% ethanol. For detection of BrdUrd incorporation into DNA, double-stranded DNA was denatured with 3 n HCl for 20 min at room temperature, and DNA denaturation was stopped with 0.1m sodium tetraborate, pH 8.5. The pellet was incubated with 1 ml of 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS/Tween) containing 0.5% normal goat serum (Dakopatts, Denmark) for 10 min at room temperature. The incorporated BrdUrd was then visualized by incubating cells with the anti-BrdUrd mAb diluted 1:10 in PBS/Tween for 30 min and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG mAb diluted 1:50 in PBS/Tween for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then stained for their DNA content with a propidium iodide solution containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 25 μg/ml RNase in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Simultaneous measurements of red (DNA content) and green (BrdUrd content) fluorescence were done on 30,000 cells for each sample. BrdUrd-positive (BrdUrd+) subpopulations were identified on each sample by biparametric BrdUrd/DNA analysis, and cell cycle phase percentages of BrdUrd+ cells were calculated. The DNA synthesis time (tS) was calculated from the measurement of relative movement (RM) (30Begg A.C. McNally N.J. Shrieve D.C. Kaercher H. Cytometry. 1985; 6: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) which assumes that the rate of cell progression through the S phase is constant and that at the time of BrdUrd pulse labeling the mean DNA content of BrdUrd-labeled S phase cells is in the middle of the interval between the G1 and G2M peaks. The RM was calculated using Equation 2. RM=(FS−FG1)/(FG2−FG1)Equation 2 where F is the mean red fluorescence of the corresponding phase of the cell cycle. Following transfection or infection of 3T3 and HeLa cells with sense (CD38+) and antisense (CD38−) CD38, establishment of geneticin-resistant cell lines required about 2 weeks. No growth of geneticin-resistant clones in wild type (not transfected/infected), HeLa, or 3T3 cells was observed during this period; no wild type cells survived longer than 4–6 days in geneticin (1 mg/ml). After 15–20 days, CD38 surface expression of geneticin-resistant, transfected cells was low as compared with infected cells (0.17 and 0.31 nmol/min/mg GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity as compared with 4.31 and 4.38 for 3T3 and HeLa cells, respectively, Fig. 1). Magnetic beading was performed once on infected and 4 times on transfected cells to enrich for high CD38 expression. Both CD38+ and CD38− cells were subjected to immunoselection, although no attachment of magnetic beads to CD38− cells was ever observed. At this point, all CD38+ cell lines were approximately 100% positive for CD38 expression as detected by immunofluorescence (not shown). Although surface cyclase activity of both transfected and infected HeLa cells remained stable after the initial increase following immunoselection, CD38 expression on 3T3 cells, transfected as well as infected, decreased rapidly (1–2 weeks) and sharply (>50%) in the first weeks following gene transfer, despite repeated magnetic beadings (see Fig.1). On the other hand, cyclase expression of 3T3 cells transfected with mutant CD38 was stable at approximately 3 nmol/min/mg, and this level of expression was maintained for 10 months with regular immunoselection. Stable expression of the cyclase activities listed in Table I on transduced cells has been maintained for 14 (transfected) and 8 (infected) months by constant culture in geneticin and regular monthly immunoselection. The ratio between NADase, GDP-ribosyl cyclase, and cADPR hydrolase activities (approximately 100:10:1) expressed on 3T3 cells transduced with wild type CD38 (33 nmol of ADPR/min/mg, 2.8 nmol of cGDPR/min/mg, and 0.4 nmol of ADPR/min/mg, respectively) was the same as that observed on human purified CD38 (5De Flora A.

On the other hand, this ratio was significantly different in 3T3 cells expressing mutant CD38; although cyclase activity on NGD+ was comparable to that of wild type CD38, NADase and hydrolase activities were approximately 3 and 7% of"

CAPS acts at a stage in exocytosis that follows ATP-dependent priming, which involves the essential synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2).

The high negative charge density, the high degree of head group hydration, and the positive curvature of PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes would likely increase rather than decrease the barrier to bilayer fusion (20Chernomordik L. Zimmerberg J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Hence, fusion may require segregation of these lipids by PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding proteins. In general, polyphosphoinositides may serve as spatially-localized membrane signals that recruit specific binding proteins required for signal transduction, cytoskeletal regulation, and aspects of membrane trafficking (21Janmey P.A.

PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding proteins that mediate the essential role of this phospholipid in regulated exocytosis remain to be identified.

ATP-dependent priming of LDCVs is insensitive to the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, suggesting that 3-phosphorylated inositides are not essential for exocytosis (25Martin T.F.J.

A role in exocytosis for the Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to PtdIns(4,5)P2 may be indicated by recent studies in which inositol polyphosphate inhibitory effects on evoked neurotransmitter release were reversed by preincubation with the synaptotagmin C2B antibody (26Mochida S.

Another Ca2+-binding protein CAPS (calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion) is essential for neurosecretion and reconstitutes LDCV exocytosis at a late post-docking step in exocytosis beyond the point of ATP-dependent priming (1Walent J.

Here we report that CAPS is a specific PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding protein and suggest that it may serve as an effector that mediates the essential role of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in Ca2+-regulated fusion. Phospholipids were resuspended to 10 mg/ml in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and aliquots were dried to a thin film under argon in glass tubes. The dried phospholipids were resuspended in buffer by vortexing until a cloudy suspension was formed and bath sonicated for 20 min at 25–30 °C to form small unilamellar liposomes or micelles, which were stored at −70 °C. The bovine phospholipids PtdChol, PtdSer, PtdEt, PtdIns, and PtdIns(4)P, and synthetic phospholipid dipalmitoyl PtdIns(3,4)P2 were purchased from Sigma or Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline was purchased from Amersham. Bovine PtdIns(4,5)P2 was either obtained commercially (Sigma), was provided as a gift by Dr. R. A. Anderson (University of Wisconsin), or was purified from bovine brain as described (28Palmer F.B. St C. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 1296-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schacht J. J.

Micelles and liposomes were recovered from reactions by sedimentation at 200,000 × g for 45 min. Under the centrifugation conditions used, at least 85% of the micelles and liposomes were recovered in the pellet whereas negligible amounts of CAPS was recovered in the absence of phospholipids. Pellets were washed with 1 volume of buffer, recovered by sedimentation, and resuspended in sample buffer for analysis by electrophoresis on 8% SDS gels. Supernatants were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets for immunoblotting with a specific CAPS rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a CAPS peptide corresponding to amino acids 574–589. Stained gels and autoradiograms were quantitated with a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer or PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase-CAPS fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli by subcloning the coding region of CAPS cDNA (10Hay J. Fisette P. Jenkins G. Fukami K. Takenawa T.

E. coliCAPS was kindly cloned and expressed by Dr. B. Porter. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech) without bound protein or with glutathione S-transferase or glutathioneS-transferase-CAPS were incubated with liposomes at room temperature for 60 min in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA with a molar ratio of protein to phospholipid of 2.56:1. Liposomes, prepared as described above, were made at a ratio of 2:1:1 for PtdChol:PtdSer:phosphoinositide (PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2) or 2:1 for PtdChol:PtdSer with [3H]PtdChol, and clarified by sedimentation at 500 × g for 15 min. Incubations of liposomes with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were terminated by sedimentation for 5 min at 500 × g. Beads were washed with a 10-fold volume of buffer, collected at the same speed, and extracted with 10% SDS (10-fold volume). The first supernatant (A), wash supernatant (B), and bead SDS extract (C) were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, and liposome binding was calculated as (disintegrations/min (3H)PtdChol in C)/(dpm (3H) A + B + C) × 100%. Proteolytic digestions of CAPS were conducted at room temperature for 60 min in either 2 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol (with or without Ca2+) or in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, with mass ratios of proteinase K to CAPS of 0.01:1 and trypsin to CAPS of 0.1:2. Liposomes were made as described previously and were usually added 10 min prior to protease addition. Proteinase K digestion studies employed liposomes at a mass ratio to CAPS of 6:16 for liposomes lacking phosphoinositides or at 1–1.5:16 for phosphoinositides, and trypsin digestion studies used liposomes at a mass ratio to CAPS of 1:1. Digestions were terminated by 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus 1 mmaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride (final concentrations), and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 13.5% polyacrylamide SDS gels followed by Coomassie staining. Proteolytic fragments of CAPS were identified by N-terminal sequence analysis by Edman degradation chemistry using an Applied Biosystems sequencer and analyzer. Sequence analyses of some of the CAPS fragments were kindly provided by M. Jennings (Monsanto, Chesterfield, MO). The synthesis and applications of [3H]BZDC-acyl-PtdIns(4,5)P2 have been previously described (32Chen J. Profit A.A. Prestwich G.D. J. Org.

Photolabeling studies with baculovirus-encoded recombinant CAPS were conducted on ice in 28 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA for 45 min at 2 cm from a 360-nm light source (Southern N.E., Ultraviolet Co., Bradford, CT) after a 10-min preincubation on ice with a 1:1 molar ratio of CAPS to [3H]BZDC-acyl-PtdIns(4,5)P2 with a specific activity of 42.5 Ci/mmol. Competition studies involved coincubation with a 1000-fold molar excess of Ins(1,4,5)P3or PtdIns(4,5)P2 during irradiation. Incorporation of the [3H]BZDC-acyl-PtdIns(4,5)P2probe was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and fluorography using EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) as described previously (35Mohamed M.A. Lerro K.A. Prestwich G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CAPS is a novel neural/endocrine-specific dimer of 145-kDa subunits that was identified by its activity in reconstituting Ca2+-dependent secretion in permeable neuroendocrine cells (1Walent J. Porter B. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although CAPS was initially purified as a soluble protein from rat brain cytosol, recent biochemical studies 2B. Berwin, E. Floor, and T. F. J. Martin, manuscript submitted. revealed that a substantial portion of the protein in brain homogenates localized as a peripherally-bound membrane protein. Saturable, high affinity binding of CAPS to protease-treated membranes suggested that CAPS was a phospholipid-binding protein.2 This was confirmed in direct binding studies conducted by sedimentation of liposomes of defined phospholipid composition (Fig.1 A). CAPS binding to PtdChol liposomes was negligible whereas binding to liposomes containing the acidic or neutral phospholipids PtdIns and PtdSer/PtdEt was significant. Binding was much more substantial to micelles of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and to a lesser extent PtdIns(4)P (Fig.1 A). The association of CAPS with PtdIns(4,5)P2micelles was not attributable to the high negative charge density of this phospholipid since CAPS binding to micelles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a more highly acidic phospholipid, was similar to that of PtdIns or PtdSer/PtdEt (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained with phosphoinositides incorporated into liposomes with other phospholipids (see below). The results indicated that CAPS interactions with PtdIns(4,5)P2 were stereoselective for the phosphates on the inositol head group. Equilibrium binding studies with a recombinant protein demonstrated that CAPS is a Ca2+-binding protein (27Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present studies, Ca2+ was found to markedly inhibit CAPS binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the binding of CAPS to PtdChol liposomes that lacked or contained the acidic phospholipids PtdEt, PtdSer, or PtdIns was increased by the inclusion of Ca2+ in the binding mixtures. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of binding to PtdChol/PtdIns(4,5)P2 liposomes and the stimulation of binding to PtdChol/PtdEt liposomes occurred over a similar range of Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2 B) exhibiting half-maxima at ∼10–100 μm free ionic Ca2+. This is within the range of the estimated KD (∼170 μm) for the higher affinity Ca2+-binding site on CAPS that was detected in different buffer and pH conditions (27Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A. Loyet K.M. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The phospholipid composition dependence of the effects of Ca2+ on CAPS binding were particularly evident in studies where the liposome content of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was varied (Fig. 2 C). The binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to CAPS was dose-dependent and saturable. Although CAPS bound to PtdIns(4,5)P2 with high specificity, it was with relatively low affinity. A KD for PtdIns(4,5)P2binding was estimated in the sedimentation assay using a range of concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 presented as micelles or as PtdChol-containing liposomes. An apparent KD of 50–150 μm was observed with either recombinant or native CAPS (data not shown). The ability of CAPS to bind phospholipids was confirmed in an independent assay using immobilized CAPS incubated with3H-liposomes of varied phospholipid composition. A glutathione S-transferase-CAPS fusion protein produced in E. coli was tethered to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with [3H]PtdChol liposomes containing the acidic phospholipids PtdSer, PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2. Whereas glutathione-Sepharose beads with or without bound glutathione S-transferase retained only background levels of liposomes, the beads with immobilized CAPS specifically retained liposomes that contained acidic phospholipids (Fig. 3). Consistent with the sedimentation assay results, immobilized CAPS preferentially retained liposomes containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 and to a lesser extent PtdIns(4)P. The binding of CAPS to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing liposomes, but not to liposomes containing other acidic phospholipids, was accompanied by an apparent conformational change in CAPS as indicated by an altered susceptibility to limited proteolysis by either trypsin or proteinase K. The major polypeptides in the purified baculovirus-encoded recombinant CAPS consisted of the full-length 163-kDa protein and ∼60 kDa CAPS protein proteolytic fragments (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Limited proteolysis of this preparation with trypsin generated ∼6 fragments in the 22–70-kDa range (Fig. 4 A, lane 2), which were also generated in the presence of PtdChol/PtdEt, PtdChol/PtdSer, or PtdChol liposomes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–6). In contrast, the digestion pattern was markedly altered in the presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 micelles (Fig. 4 A, lane 3, second and third arrowheads). Similar results were obtained in digestions with proteinase K, which were limited to generate several core fragments in the 18–25-kDa range that represent ∼60% of the CAPS sequence (Figs. 4, B-E, arrowheads). Presentation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in both micellar and liposome form resulted in an altered pattern of proteolysis (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–6). The molar % of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in PtdChol/PtdSer liposomes that promoted changes in proteolysis similar to those with micellar PtdIns(4,5)P2 corresponded to between 10 and 25% (Fig. 4 B). As was true for trypsin, the altered proteolysis of CAPS by proteinase K was only observed with liposomes containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 but not other acidic phospholipids such as PtdSer or PtdIns (Fig. 4, B and D). Because PtdIns(4,5)P2 did not affect the proteolytic activity of trypsin or proteinase K toward other proteins tested (data not shown), the altered susceptibility of CAPS to proteolysis is inferred to represent a conformational change in the protein induced by PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding. The PtdIns(4,5)P2-induced increase in proteolysis by proteinase K was largely restricted to 25- and 19-kDa fragments of CAPS (Fig. 4 B, lane 2, top and bottom arrowheads, respectively). Sequencing these fragments indicated that they correspond to C- and N-terminal fragments (residues 859–1075 and 94–258, respectively) of the 1289-residue CAPS protein. Identification of the proteinase K-resistant 20- and 22-kDa fragments (Fig. 4 B, middle two arrowheads) by sequencing indicated that they correspond to central regions of CAPS (residues 469–650 and 662–860, respectively). Similarly, the trypsin-resistant 38-kDa fragment (Fig.4 A, top arrowhead, residues 371–665) was derived from a central region of CAPS. These results indicate that the altered proteolytic susceptibility induced in CAPS by phosphoinositide binding principally involves the N and C termini of the protein. By conducting brief incubations, it was possible to generate the core proteolytic fragments prior to the addition of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). Delayed addition of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was found to accelerate the proteolysis of the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment but not the 19-kDa N-terminal fragment (Fig. 4 C, lane 4 versus 3). This result indicates that the 25-kDa C-terminal fragment retained PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding activity that was coupled to a conformational change. In contrast, the CAPS protein domain corresponding to the 19-kDa N-terminal fragment appears to undergo a conformational change that is indirect and secondary to phosphoinositide binding to the intact protein. The enhanced susceptibility of CAPS to proteinase K digestion exhibited a high degree of selectivity for phosphoinositides phosphorylated at the D-4 and D-5 position of the inositol ring (Fig. 4 D). PtdIns(4,5)P2 maximally increased digestion of the 19- and 25-kDa fragments whereas PtdIns(4)P enhanced cleavage to a more limited extent. PtdIns(3,4)P2 promoted a partial enhancement of proteolysis resembling that observed with PtdIns(4)P, which was preferential for the 25-kDa fragment. In contrast, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 exerted virtually no effect on CAPS proteolysis (Fig. 4, D and E). The results indicate that CAPS exhibits a stereoselective interaction with phosphoinositides that stringently requires inositol D-4 and D-5 phosphates and the absence of a D-3 phosphate. Stereoselective phosphoinositide binding to the C-terminal domain and possibly other sites (see below) may be coupled to more global conformational changes in the CAPS protein that secondarily affect the proteolytic susceptibility of N-terminal domains. In sedimentation assays, Ca2+ was shown to reduce phosphoinositide interactions with CAPS. Similarly, inclusion of Ca2+ in the protease digestions reversed the enhanced proteolytic susceptibility of the 19- and 25-kDa fragments promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 4 E). Although Ca2+ stimulated the interactions of CAPS with PtdChol-, PtdEt-, PtdIns-, and PtdSer-containing liposomes in sedimentation assays, only subtle effects of this divalent cation on CAPS proteolysis in the presence of PtdChol/PtdSer or PtdChol/PtdSer/PtdIns liposomes were detected. These were found among the higher molecular mass fragments and corresponded to the previously reported effects of Ca2+ on CAPS proteolysis observed in the absence of lipids (27Ann K. Kowalchyk J.A.

However, the molecular bases for the transitions between these states are unknown. In the present study, changes in the accessibility of several β1 epitopes (e.g.N29, B44, and B3B11) were used to probe activation-related conformational changes. Dithiothreitol or Mn2+ activation of integrin-mediated adhesion in the human B cell line, IM9, resulted in a marked increase in the exposure of the B44 epitope, while N29 expression levels were most sensitive to dithiothreitol treatment. These results contrasted with the epitope expression patterns of spontaneously adherent K562 cells, where N29 was almost fully accessible and B44 was low. Addition of a soluble ligand resulted in a marked increase in B44 levels, suggesting that this antibody detected a ligand-induced binding site. The N29 epitope was mapped to a cysteine-rich region near the NH2 terminus of the integrin chain, thus defining a novel regulatory site.These studies indicate that the activation of integrin function by different stimuli may involve related but nonidentical conformations. Both Mn2+ and dithiothreitol appear to induce localized conformational changes that mimic a ligand-occupied receptor. This differs from the “physiologically” activated integrins on K562 cells that display a marked increase in overall epitope accessibility without exposure of the ligand-induced binding site epitopes.

Members of the integrin family mediate cellular interactions with elements of their microenvironment (1Hynes R.O.

This prerequisite ensures that integrin function is operative only at the appropriate anatomical or pathological sites.Although the structural basis for the underlying changes associated with the acquisition of integrin functionality is unknown, data from a number of different biochemical and immunological approaches clearly demonstrate activation-associated alterations in integrin conformation (10Calvette J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Calvette J.J. Mann K. Schafer W. Fernandez-Lafuente R. Guisan J.M. Biochem.

Antibody-binding studies and protease-susceptibility studies have shown that there are activation-associated changes in the accessibility of regions of the complex (10Calvette J.J. Thromb.

Fluorescent energy transfer studies on αIIbβ3 have also demonstrated that there are alterations in the spacing and interaction of αIIb and β3 in the activated integrin structure (12Sims P.J.

Changes in epitope expression are also observed following receptor occupancy (13Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Collectively the data suggest that the activated integrin complex acquires a more open conformation than is observed in the latent structure.Recently models of integrin activation have been proposed that involve allosteric mechanisms for the acquisition of an adhesion-competent conformation (17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee O.-J Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Support for such a model derives from the observations that the binding of ligand to purified integrin inhibits the binding of an inhibitory antibody to the β1 chain (19Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The pattern of inhibition displays characteristics that are most compatible with an allosteric mechanism. However, as pointed out by Mould (17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the situation with the integrins is more complex than a classical allosteric mechanism, as the “active” integrin does not necessarily acquire a conformation that approximates the ligand-bound receptor.

Mn2+ and the bifunctional reducing agent, DTT, 1The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. have been shown to activate integrin binding in a number of systems (22Dransfield I.

Since both of these agents activate purified integrins, it would appear that their effects on adhesion might be directly on the receptor complex (19Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7138-7156PubMed Google Scholar). These agents may provide useful probes for the analysis of the changes associated with integrin activation and ligand binding.We have previously described a panel of regulatory antibodies to the human β1 integrin chain and localized their continuous epitopes (27Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Ni H. Wilkins J.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Three noncompeting groups of antibodies were identified, and one set of antibodies was shown to react with the membrane proximal β1 region (28Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The present study localizes a novel stimulatory region to the cysteine-rich amino-terminal portion of the β1 chain. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that it is possible to generate functionally “activated” integrins with overlapping but nonidentical conformations.DISCUSSIONThe present studies provide several new pieces of data relevant to integrin activation. 1) The stimulatory antibody, N29, recognizes a new regulatory region located near the NH2 terminus of the β1 molecule. 2) The stimulatory antibody, B44, identifies an epitope, which is exposed on ligand binding. 3) Mn2+ and DTT induce changes in β1 epitope accessibility, which resemble those observed in the ligand occupied receptor. 4) The overall accessibility of epitopes in physiologically active integrins is increased relative to those on nonadherent cells or on Mn2+- and DTT-activated cells.The initial assumption that N29 might identify an activation epitope does not appear to be fully supported by the results of this study. In the case of DTT-treated cells, there was an almost total exposure of the N29 epitope associated with activation of adhesion. However, the N29 levels on spontaneously adhesive cells such as K562 and Jurkat 2H. Ni and J. A. Wilkins, unpublished results. or following treatment with Mn2+ were elevated 2–4-fold, such that 20–30% of the integrins displayed this epitope. There were also low but detectable levels of N29 exposure on nonadherent cells. Thus the correlation between integrin functional status and N29 accessibility appeared to be semiquantitative rather than a qualitative one.The antibody B44 identifies an epitope, which under normal conditions appears to be of very limited accessibility. Thus the expression levels of this epitope on adhesion competent cells such as Jurkat and K562 are significantly lower than the total integrin levels. However, occupancy of integrin by ligand or by an RGD-containing antagonist results in a marked increase in B44 expression. The B44 epitope is reduction resistant under SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions, implying that the antibody detects a continuous peptide sequence. It appears that ligand binding exposes the cryptic epitope to the solvent and renders it antibody accessible. However, it is unlikely that this epitope represents a ligand contact site as B44 binding has been shown to induce adherence in Jurkat cells (28Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The properties of B44 most resemble those of two other antibodies, 15/7 (35Puzon-McLaughlin W. Yednock T.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16580-16585Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and HUTS-21 (36Luque A. Gomez M. Puzon W. Takada Y. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11067-11075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which detect integrins in a ligand-occupied or high affinity state. These antibodies have been shown to react with epitopes that are located in the cysteine rich region of the β1 (residues 355–425). However, to date it has not been possible to determine the location of the B44 epitope.Treatment of IM9 cells with Mn2+ induces B44 epitope expression. The implication is that the Mn2+ induces alterations that resemble those caused by ligand binding to a competent integrin. It has been suggested that Mn2+ may stimulate adhesion by forming a co-ordination complex with residues in the cation binding domains of the integrin and the aspartate residue of the ligand (37Bergelson J.M. Hemler M.E. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), or by facilitating the ligand entry to the binding site via an exchange mechanism (18Lee O.-J Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Recently it has been proposed that Mn2+ may induce a conformation resembling the ligand occupied receptor thus permitting ligand access to the binding region of the integrin (17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding pattern of B44 is compatible with the latter explanation of Mn2+ action. However, it does not address the issue of the relative contributions of Mn2+ to cation-facilitated exchange and ligand co-ordination.Activation of adhesion by reducing agents has also been described in several systems. Edwards et al. (25Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Southon E.A. Chong A.S.-F. Graf L.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2288-2301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) noted that there was an obligate requirement for a bifunctional thiol with a minimal spacing of four carbons between the two –SH groups. Early studies on the activation of platelet adhesion by DTT indicated that there were changes in αIIbβ3 electrophoretic mobility associated with activation by this agent (26Peerschke E.I. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 73: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DTT-dependent activation of mutant αIIbβ3 in platelets from a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia by DTT was shown to be associated with the appearance of activation epitopes (39Kouns W.C. Steiner B. Kunicki T.J. Moog S. Jutzi J. Jennings L.K. Cazenave J.-P. Lanza F. Blood. 1994; 84: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, DTT-induced activation of αLβ2 mediated adhesion of natural killer cells to intercellular adhesion molecule 1-expressing target cells failed to reveal conformational changes using two reporter antibodies (25Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Southon E.A. Chong A.S.-F. Graf L.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2288-2301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these authors could not demonstrate the appearance of free thiol groups in the αLβ2 complex, implying that the integrin chains were not directly modified by DTT treatment (25Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Southon E.A. Chong A.S.-F. Graf L.H. Blood. 1995; 86: 2288-2301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present data clearly indicate that significant conformational changes are induced by DTT as access to the B44 and the N29 epitopes are markedly increased.The increased B3B11 and N29 expression on K562 cells implies that physiologically activated integrins undergo changes that allow an increased accessibility to the membrane proximal and NH2-terminal regions of the molecule. Although the integrins on these cells are in an adhesion competent state, ligand binding is required for B44 epitope expression. These results would seem to suggest that there is an intermediate conformation in which the integrin is adhesion-competent but unoccupied. The fact that agents such as Mn2+ and DTT induce conformations that resemble the ligand-occupied state suggests that they stimulate adhesion competence by generating integrin intermediates that are distinct from the native active forms observed in K562. Although different functional forms of integrins have been described or postulated (16Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C. Goldbach E.G. Shaw G. Ellis D.K. Liau C. Fritz L.C. Tanner L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28740-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is unclear at this point whether active forms such as those induced by DTT or Mn2+ are representative of physiological integrin intermediates. These observations suggest that caution should be exhibited when attempting to correlate competent states induced by these agents with those found in physiologically activated integrins.The localization of the N29 epitope between residues 15 and 54 places it in a highly conserved cysteine-rich region (41Calvette J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This area has not previously been identified as a regulatory site, although it is adjacent to region that has been shown to be a cation and ligand sensitive in the β3 chain (34Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Unlike the β3 situation, the binding of N29 is relatively insensitive to the cationic composition of the extracellular milieu. Thus if a homologous region exists in the β1 chain it would appear that it is not located in the N29 reactive 15–54 sequence of the molecule.The antibodies N29, B44, and B3B11/JB1B were originally identified because of their abilities to stimulate Jurkat adherence to collagen and fibronectin (28Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in those cases where their corresponding epitopes have been identified (28Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Ni H. Wilkins J.A. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar), the stimulatory epitopes map to regions that are in close proximity to residues that are predicted to be involved in disulfide bonds between sequentially distant cysteines (i.e. Cys7–Cys415and Cys444–Cys671). The present results extend those of others employing interspecies β1 chimeras (16Bazzoni G. Shih D.-T Buck C.A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Takada Y. Puzon W. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and expands the locations of regulatory sites to include both the membrane proximal and the distal regions of the β1 (Fig. 8).It might be speculated that the NH2-terminal region of the β1 chain is involved in the normal control of integrin function. The increased N29 expression on K562 could reflect a situation in which physiologically activated integrins undergo a conformational change to expose this site. The exposure may indicate accessibility to the ligand-binding site. However, it seems unlikely that N29 contact is required for binding as Mn2+ induces adhesion competence with minimal effects on N29 exposure. Subsequent to ligand binding, the B44 epitope is expressed, and this presumably reflects a secondary change in the integrin conformation, perhaps as a consequence of ligand displacement of previously buried residues. It is important to bear in mind that, although the results of the antibody studies indicate changes in the accessibility of β1integrin epitopes following activation, the basis for these changes are unknown. They could relate to integrin conformational changes, to alterations in the patterns of integrin-associated proteins, or to both of these mechanisms. Studies with purified integrin may permit the differentiation of these possibilities. Members of the integrin family mediate cellular interactions with elements of their microenvironment (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). These contacts can lead to cellular adhesion, migration, and activation (4Sjaastad M.D. Nelson W.J. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 5Haazenberger D. Klominek J. Holgersson J. Bergstrom S.-E. Sundqvist K.-G. J.

In a number of cell types, such as platelets and leukocytes, the activities of integrins are tightly regulated such that host cell activation is required before cell binding can proceed (7Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 8Wright S.D. Meyer B.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1759-1764PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shimizu Y. Van Seventer G.A. Morgan K.J. Shaw S. Nature. 1990; 345: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). This prerequisite ensures that integrin function is operative only at the appropriate anatomical or pathological sites. Although the structural basis for the underlying changes associated with the acquisition of integrin functionality is unknown, data from a number of different biochemical and immunological approaches clearly demonstrate activation-associated alterations in integrin conformation (10Calvette J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Calvette J.J. Mann K. Schafer W. Fernandez-Lafuente R. Guisan J.M. Biochem.

Antibody-binding studies and protease-susceptibility studies have shown that there are activation-associated changes in the accessibility of regions of the complex (10Calvette J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Calvette J.J. Mann K. Schafer W. Fernandez-Lafuente R. Guisan J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fluorescent energy transfer studies on αIIbβ3 have also demonstrated that there are alterations in the spacing and interaction of αIIb and β3 in the activated integrin structure (12Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in epitope expression are also observed following receptor occupancy (13Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25570-25577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Collectively the data suggest that the activated integrin complex acquires a more open conformation than is observed in the latent structure. Recently models of integrin activation have been proposed that involve allosteric mechanisms for the acquisition of an adhesion-competent conformation (17Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lee O.-J Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Support for such a model derives from the observations that the binding of ligand to purified integrin inhibits the binding of an inhibitory antibody to the β1 chain (19Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20365-20374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The pattern of inhibition displays characteristics that are most compatible with an allosteric mechanism. However, as pointed out by Mould (17Mould A.P. J.

Similar fucosylation was also shown to occur on the EGF domain of human factor IX (6Nishimura H. Takao T. Hase S. Shimonishi Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17520-17525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in this case the fucose residue was at the reducing end of a tetrasaccharide: NeuAcα2→6Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→3Fucα1→O-Ser61(7Harris R.J. van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In all cases described above, the attachment of O-linked fucose to serine or threonine was found to occur on EGF domains within the sequence Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Gly-Ser/Thr-Cys (8Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although all examples of mammalian O-fucosylation characterized to date have been modifications of EGF domains (8Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), it is possible that O-linked fucosylation occurs in non-EGF-containing proteins. Studies by two other laboratories using the lec1 mutant cell line indicated that O-fucosylation occurs on many proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells (9Stults N.L. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Moloney D.J. Lin A.I. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19046-19050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These studies were not performed in a manner that would enable EGF domain-containing proteins to be distinguished from those without EGF domains. Structural analysis has also revealed that O-linked fucose is present on an insect protease inhibitor (11Nakakura N. Hietter H. van Dorsselaer A. Luu B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although the flanking amino acids were not represented by the consensus sequence described above, and the protease inhibitor sequence is not homologous to an EGF domain. We have focused our research mainly on the biosynthesis of this post-translational modification. Recently, we reported the development of an assay for the GDP-l-fucose:polypeptide fucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the attachment of fucose through anO-glycosidic linkage to the conserved serine or threonine residue in EGF domains (12Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.L. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The assay uses a recombinant human factor VII EGF-1 domain as acceptor substrate and GDP-fucose as donor substrate. Using this assay, we were able to detect activity in extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat liver. In addition, when rat liver was homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors, 37% of the activity was recovered by Triton X-100 extraction of the membrane particles after extensive aqueous washes. These results suggest that the enzyme is probably a membrane protein and, by analogy with other glycosyltransferases, probably has a “stem” region that is very susceptible to proteolysis (13Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the purification of thisO-fucosyltransferase to apparent homogeneity. This study also includes the initial characterization of the purified enzyme and its acceptor substrate specificity. The assay procedure was essentially the same as described previously (12Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.L. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 0.1m imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm of GDP-[14C]fucose (4000–8000 cpm/nmol), 20 μm recombinant human factor VII EGF-1 domain, and enzyme preparations typically containing 0.01–0.1 milliunit of activity. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C typically for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by placing the mixture on ice and then diluting with 950 μl of 0.25 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Separation of incorporated fucose from GDP-fucose, fucose-phosphate, and free fucose was carried out by passing the solution through a C18 cartridge (Alltech, Extract Clean, C18, 200 mg). The cartridge was washed with 5 ml of H2O, and the product was then eluted with 3 ml of 80% acetonitrile containing 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluant was mixed with 10 ml of Aquasol II (NEN Life Science Products) and counted using a liquid scintillation counter. The recombinant forms of human factor VII EGF-1 domain used for assays and affinity chromatography were prepared as described previously (12Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.L. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The construction of human factor IX EGF domain and its mutant genes were the same as for factor VII EGF-1 domain. The sequence of factor IX EGF domain was taken from residues 45–87 of the mature protein, with six histidine residues attached at carboxyl terminus of the sequence followed by three residues from the vector, YVDGDQCESNPCLNGGSCKDDINSYECWCPFGFEGKNCELDVTHHHHHHGSA. The potential glycosylation site is underlined. The gene encoding factor IX EGF domain without the polyhistidine sequence was made first by annealing primers designed to form oligonucleotide cassettes as listed in Table I, using standard molecular biology techniques (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, New York1989Google Scholar). The gene was then cloned into the MluI and BamHI sites of a phagemid vector, pA4G32 (15Dennis M.S. Lazarus R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22129-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), previously developed for bacteriophage display. The recombinant phagemid, pF9EGF, contained the alkaline phosphatase promoter and the bacterial stII signal sequence upstream of the gene encoding the EGF domain as well as the β-lactamase gene as a selectable marker. The construction of the gene for factor IX EGF domain with a polyhistidine tag, pF9EGF-His6, was made by replacing part of the COOH-terminal sequence with another oligonucleotide cassette containing the polyhistidine sequence, utilizing the restriction sitesSstI and BamHI as shown in TableI. The mutants were constructed using the similar oligonucleotide cassettes with mutated sequences. The plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli strain 27C7 by electroporation. Expression of the proteins was carried out in 1 liter of AP minimum medium, at 37 °C overnight. The recombinant EGF domains were purified from periplasmic shockates using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction for nondenaturing purification. For 1 liter of culture fluid, 0.5 ml of resin was used, and the eluant was then concentrated in a Centricon-3 (Amicon) to about 200 μl and used for subsequent experiments.Table IOligonucleotide sequences used to generate cassettes encoding human factor IX EGF domainCassettesPrimersSequences1f9egf1 5′-CGCGTATGCATATGTCGACGGAGATCAGTGTGAGTCCAATCCATGTTf9egfaATACGTATACAGCTGCCTCTAGTCACACTCAGGTTAGGTACAAATTT-5′2f9egf2 5′-TAAATGGCGGCAGTTGCAAGGATGATATCAATTCCTATGAATGTTGGTf9egfbACCGCCGTCAACGTTCCTACTATAGTTAAGGATACTTACAACCACAGG-5′3f9egf3 5′-GTCCCTTTGGATTTGAAGGAAAGAACTGTGAGCTCGATGTAACAGf9egfcGAAACCTAAACTTCCTTTCTTGACACTCGAGCTACATTGTCCTAG-5′f9egfh6f9egfh62 5′-CGATGTAACACACCATCACCATCACCATGf9egfh6bTCGAGCTACATTGTGTGGTAGTGGTAGTGGTACCTAG-5′ Open table in a new tab Suspension culture of Chinese hamster ovary cells was maintained in serum-free Ham's F12/DMEM (50:50) media, supplemented with insulin, putrescine, selenium, ferrous sulfate, and polyvinyl alcohol, in a 40-liter bio-reactor. The cells were harvested when the density reached 3.4 × 106 cells/ml, 98% viable, using a centrifugation method. The collected cell paste was frozen at −70 °C and used for purification of the O-fucosyltransferase without further treatment. Buffer A was 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0. Buffer B was 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 25%(w/v) glycerol. Buffer C was 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mmMnCl2, and 0.1 mm GDP. Buffer D was 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, and 25% (w/v) glycerol. Buffer E was 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, and 25% (w/v) glycerol. Frozen Chinese hamster ovary cell paste (100 g) was thawed at room temperature and kept on ice. The cells were homogenized by sonication (Virsonic 550, at 20% output with a ½-inch probe) with three 30-s bursts in 300 ml of buffer A containing 25 mm NaCl. DNase I (2 mg/ml, 1 ml) and MgCl2 (1m, 0.4 ml) were added to the homogenate, which was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g (Sorvall RC-5, GSA rotor) for 45 min. The supernatant (355 ml) was used for further purification. Two columns, DE-52 (Whatman, 2.5 × 30 cm) and Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad, 2.5 × 15 cm), were connected in series and equilibrated with buffer A containing 25 mm NaCl. The supernatant from the previous step was loaded onto the DE-52 column (1 ml/min), and the columns were washed with 500 ml of the same buffer. The DE-52 column was then detached from the Affi-Gel Blue column. The latter was washed with 200 ml buffer of buffer A containing 125 mm NaCl and followed by 400 ml of high salt (buffer A with 1 m NaCl) elution. The eluted fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B. The final volume was 40 ml. The affinity resin with the acceptor substrate as ligand was made by mixing 6 mg of factor VII EGF-1-His6 with 10 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was then packed into a column (1.5 × 6 cm) and washed with 40 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by another wash of 30 ml of 0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl. It was then equilibrated with the same buffer used for dialysis in the previous step. The dialyzed sample was supplemented with 1 mmMnCl2 and 0.1 mm GDP (Sigma) and loaded onto the affinity column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min followed by 40 ml of buffer C. The column was then washed with 45 ml of buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl and 45 ml of buffer D, respectively. The enzyme was then eluted off the column with 90 ml of 0.3 mimidazole-HCl, pH 7.0, 25% (w/v) glycerol. The fractions containing activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D and ready for the next step. The affinity resin with donor substrate analog as ligand was made by coupling GDP-hexanolamine (30 μmol, provided by Dr. R. L. Hill, Duke University) to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin (10 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resin was then packed in a column (inner diameter, 1.5 cm) and equilibrated with buffer F. The dialyzed sample (13 ml) was supplemented with 5 mmMnCl2 and loaded onto the column at 5 ml/h. The column was then washed with 30 ml of buffer E, followed by 45 ml of the same buffer with 125 mm NaCl and then another 10 ml of buffer E. The elution was carried out by using a linear gradient from 0–2 mm GDP; it started with 100% of buffer E and finished with 100% of buffer E containing 2 mm GDP in a total volume of 50 ml. The column was washed with another 40 ml of the latter buffer. Fractions containing activity were first examined by silver-stained SDS-PAGE, and those with only a single band (44,000 Da) were pooled. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 50% (w/v) for storage at −20 °C. The flow-through fractions containing enzyme activity from the first GDP-hexanolamine-agarose chromatography were pooled (14 ml total). A column (2.5 × 20 cm) of Sephadex G-50 fine was equilibrated and run with buffer B at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Half of the pooled sample was loaded at a time, and the column effluent was monitored for absorbance at 280 nm. Two well separated peaks were identified. Reverse phase HPLC analysis of the fractions within the second peak determined that it mainly contained factor VII EGF-1-His6. The fractions within the first peak were then pooled, supplemented with 5 mm MnCl2, and loaded onto the GDP-hexanolamine-agarose column as described above. Pure protein in storage buffer (0.4 μg, 50 μl) was first precipitated with 250 μl of acetone at −20 °C for 30 min and was then spun in a microcentrifuge for 15 min. The pellet was washed with 200 μl of acetone and air-dried. The protein was then redissolved in 10 μl of 0.5% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.15 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. The digestion was carried out by adding 0.5 unit of PNGase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 20 μl of 2% Nonidet P-40, 30 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, to the denatured protein mix, and the solution was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digested sample (10 μl) was directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein was denatured as described above. Digestion was carried out with 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) in 30 μl of 50 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 4.5 h. An aliquot (10 μl) of the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Assays for measuring Km and Vmax were carried out essentially as described above except with variations in substrate concentrations. The amount of enzyme applied was limited to give no more than 10% conversion of substrate to product to obtain accurate initial reaction rates.Km and Vmax were calculated from duplicate data points using double reciprocal plots. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was determined by performing the assays in 0.1 m solutions of the following buffers: sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4.7, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3, and 5.5; sodium cacodylate, pH 5.5, 5.7, 5.9, 6.1, 6.3, and 6.5; imidazole-HCl, pH 6.5, 6.7, 6.9, 7.1, 7.3, and 7.5; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.7, 7.9, 8.1, 8.3, and 8.5; and sodium borate, pH 8.5, 8.7, 8.9, 9.1, 9.3, and 9.5. The metal ion requirement of the purified enzyme was examined by performing the assays in a 50 mm solution of various divalent metal ions or 25 mm EDTA. Excess manganese ion present in the purified enzyme preparation was removed using gel filtration chromatography (NAP-5 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, according to the manufacturer's procedure). HPLC-MS analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 liquid chromatography system interfaced with a Perkin-Elmer/Sciex AP-300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Separations were carried out on a C-18 column (2.1 × 250 mm, Vydac), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Buffer A was 0.06% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and buffer B was 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile. The gradient had the following steps: 0–1 min, 2–10% B; 1–5 min, 10–25% B; 5–25 min, 25–35% B; and 25–30 min, 35–98% B. The column effluent was monitored at 214 nm for protein and subsequently introduced into the mass spectrometer through a 1:5 splitter upstream of a regular ion sprayer. The orifice potential was set at 50 V, and the ion spray potential was at 4700 V. Mass scans were performed from 400 to 2500m/z with a step size of 0.5 atomic mass units and a dwell time of 0.1 ms. The data were analyzed using BioMultiView 1.2 (Perkin-Elmer/Sciex). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins in sodium dodecyl sulfate was performed on 12% gel as described earlier (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Lowry (17Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Amido Black (18Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 56: 502-514Crossref Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) method. We have reported previously the identification and development of an assay for the O-fucosyltransferase that modifies certain serine or threonine residues of proteins (12Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.L. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). During the course of that work, several properties of the enzyme were observed. Most of the enzyme activity was recovered in the soluble fraction of Chinese hamster ovary cell lysate. The activity did not bind to DE-52 anion exchange column but was quantitatively retained on Affi-Gel Blue resin. As described in our previous paper (12Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.L. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the enzyme was enriched approximately 8-fold. The objective of the present study was the purification of this enzyme to homogeneity. The specifics of the purification were as follows. The frozen Chinese hamster ovary cell paste was thawed at room temperature and kept at 4 °C afterward for the entire procedure. Low ionic strength buffer was used during homogenization to help break the cells, and DNase I was added to the homogenate to reduce its viscosity and facilitate the following chromatography steps. As shown in TableII, 86% of the activity was recovered after the first step, which achieved 2.2-fold purification.Table IISummary of the purification of O-fucosyltransferasePreparationTotal proteinTotal volumeTotal activitySpecific activityStep purificationTotal purificationStep yieldYieldmgmlunitsunits/mg-fold-fold%%Homogenate57364000.9110.0001622221.

GDP-hexanolamine-agarose0.237210.1860.7841949374620 Open table in a new tab Since preliminary experiments had demonstrated that the enzyme flowed through DE-52 at pH 7 and bound to Affi-Gel Blue, the two columns were connected in series for loading and initial washing steps. The DE-52 column was detached from the Affi-Gel Blue column after the initial wash (Fig. 1, point A). Some nonspecifically bound protein was eluted when the salt concentration was increased from 25 mm to 125 mm NaCl. The enzyme was then eluted with 1 m NaCl (Fig. 1, point B). The combined purification for the two columns was 7.3-fold with 70% yield. The total volume of the preparation was reduced from 350 to 40 ml. In efforts to further purify the O-fucosyltransferase, we determined that the enzyme had high affinity toward both its acceptor substrate, the recombinant EGF domain, and a donor substrate analog, GDP-hexanolamine. Hence, affinity resins were made with these two molecules as ligands. The affinity resin with factor VII EGF-1 domain as ligand was made by taking advantage of the polyhistidine sequence originally designed for purification of the recombinant protein. the O-fucosyltransferase was found to bind to the resin better when the polyhistidine tag was at the carboxyl terminus of the EGF domain rather than at its amino terminus; hence, the former was used for the purification. The coupling of the EGF to Ni2+-NTA-agarose was almost quantitative, and the resin was very stable; no leakage of recombinant EGF domain was detected after extensive washes. As shown in Fig. 2, the binding of the O-fucosyltransferase activity to this affinity resin was quantitative. At point A, the column was washed with the buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and a large amount of nonspecifically bound protein was eluted. The binding of enzyme to the EGF domain was found to be strong enough to withstand 2m NaCl. Because the association between the enzyme and the EGF domain was so strong, an alternative method of elution was used to avoid denaturing the enzyme. Since the linkage of EGF domain to Ni2+-NTA resin is noncovalent, the recovery of the enzyme activity was achieved by dissociating the EGF domain from the resin by using imidazole to displace the polyhistidine binding to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose. The column was washed at point B with buffer containing 25 mm imidazole to elute more nonspecifically bound protein. At point C, a solution of 0.3m imidazole was used to elute the polyhistidine-tagged EGF domain together with the enzyme off the column. The step purification was actually significantly higher than 16-fold as stated in Table II, since there was almost 6 mg of recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domain present in the eluant. The pooled activity from the factor VII EGF-1 affinity purification step was applied to a column of GDP-hexanolamine-agarose (Fig.3). Unexpectedly, at least half of the enzyme activity flowed through this column. Experiments examining this flow-through activity will be described below. At point A, the column was washed with buffer containing 125 mm NaCl to elute nonspecifically bound protein. Then a GDP gradient (0–2 mm) was used for specific elution of the enzyme (point B). The fractions collected contained very limited amounts of protein. SDS-PAGE with silver staining was used to assess the purity of the preparation as shown in Fig.4. Only one band, with a molecular weight of 44,000, was visible on the gel. The variation of the band intensity also corresponded to that of the enzyme activity among different fractions.Figure 4Reduced SDS-PAGE of O-fucosyltransferase. Each lane shows the protein detected by silver stain in a fraction collected from the GDP-hexanolamine-agarose chromatography shown in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As described above, approximately half of the enzyme activity was in the flow-through fractions of the GDP-hexanolamine-agarose column. Possible explanations for this observation included the following: 1) the binding capacity of the GDP-hexanolamine column had been exceeded; 2) the column had resolved different fucosyltransferase activities that had been co-purified throughout the EGF affinity column; and 3) the presence of a large molar excess of the recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domain had interfered with binding of the O-fucosyltransferase to the GDP-hexanolamine column. Of these possibilities, the first was very unlikely, since preliminary experiments performed in the absence of the factor VII EGF-1 domain showed that the resin had higher capacity than would be required to bind all of the fucosyltransferase activity in the sample. To examine the latter two possibilities, the flow-through fractions from the GDP-hexanolamine agarose column were pooled and loaded on a Sephadex G-50 column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two protein peaks were identified. One was in the void volume and contained enzyme activity, presumably now in a 1:1 stoichiometry of enzyme and the recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domain; the other eluted later and consisted of the recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domain, as assessed by HPLC. The fractions of the first peak were pooled and rerun on the GDP-hexanolamine-agarose column using the conditions described above. All of the activity was now retained on the column. SDS-PAGE analysis of eluted fractions gave a single band with the same molecular weight (44,000) as had been observed with the bound fraction of the first run of the GDP-hexanolamine column. These results indicated that the presence of a large molar excess of the acceptor substrate had interfered with the efficiency of binding of the enzyme to the GDP-hexanolamine column and that the bound versus unbound fractions did not represent different enzymes or molecular forms. The final purification of the enzyme was nearly 5000-fold (Table II). The combined enzyme activity from two GDP-hexanolamine-agarose runs gave a total purification yield of about 20%. the O-fucosyltransferase accounted for approximately 0.02% of total Chinese hamster ovary cell protein at the start of the purification. The nature of glycosylation on the purified O-fucosyltransferase was examined using two endoglycosidases, PNGase F and endoglycosidase H, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5shows that after PNGase F digestion, the molecular weight of the protein was reduced from 44,000 to 40,000 (lane 2), suggesting the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides. Digestion with endoglycosidase H gave rise to two bands (lane 3) of lower molecular weight than the undigested protein (lane 1). These results were consistent with the presence of more than one high mannose type oligosaccharide on the enzyme. the Km and Vmax for factor VII His6-EGF-1, factor VII EGF-1 and GDP-fucose were measured and are listed in Table III. The enzyme activity was inhibited at high concentrations (>15 μm) of recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domains (data not shown). The parameters for the EGF domains obtained here were calculated from data generated with acceptor substrate concentrations up to 8 μm, in which the initial rate increased linearly with substrate concentration. The presence of the six histidine residues at the amino terminus of the EGF domain did not have a significant effect on enzyme activity. Because of the acceptor substrate inhibition, two different concentrations of factor VII His6-EGF-1 were used to measure the parameters for GDP-fucose (Table III). As a consequence, the Vmax values obtained for GDP-fucose are much lower than the ones for the recombinant factor VII EGF-1 domain. Although the Km values for GDP-fucose did not change with different factor VII EGF-1 domain concentrations, the Vmax values decreased with the increased concentrations of the acceptor substrate. To understand the exact nature of the substrate inhibition, more detailed kinetic studies would be required.Table IIIKm and Vmax of donor and acceptor substratesSubstrateHis6-EGF-1KmVmaxμmμmμmol/min · mgHis6-EGF-1112.5EGF-1152.4GDP-fucose255.90.88GDP-fucose1006.40.62 Open table in a new tab The purified O-fucosyltransferase was active from pH 5.5 to pH 8.0.

By screening two mixed-stageCaenorhabditis elegans cDNA libraries, a total of 11 distinct sequence homologs of the ppGaNTase gene family were cloned, sequenced, and expressed as truncated recombinant proteins (gly-3, gly-4, gly-5a,gly-5b, gly-5c, gly-6a,gly-6b, gly-6c, gly-7, gly-8, and gly-9). All clones encoded type II membrane proteins that shared 60–80% amino acid sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of mammalian ppGaNTase enzymes. Two sets of cDNA clones (gly-5 and gly-6) contained variants that appeared to be produced by alternative message processing.gly-6c contained a reading frameshift and premature termination codon in the C-terminal lectin-like domain found in most other ppGaNTase proteins, and a second clone (gly-8) lacked the typical C-terminal region completely. Homogenates of nematodes and immunopurified preparations of the recombinant GLY proteins demonstrated that worms express functional ppGaNTase enzymes (GLY-3, GLY-4, GLY-5A, GLY-5B, and GLY-5C), which can O-glycosylate mammalian apomucin peptide sequences in vitro. In addition to demonstrating the existence of ppGaNTase enzymes in a nematode organism, the substantial diversity of these isoforms in C. elegans suggests that mucin O-glycosylation is catalyzed by a complex gene family, which is conserved among evolutionary-distinct organisms. The initiation of mucin-typeO-glycosylation is catalyzed by a family of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGaNTase) (EC 2.4.1.41). By screening two mixed-stageCaenorhabditis elegans cDNA libraries, a total of 11 distinct sequence homologs of the ppGaNTase gene family were cloned, sequenced, and expressed as truncated recombinant proteins (gly-3, gly-4, gly-5a,gly-5b, gly-5c, gly-6a,gly-6b, gly-6c, gly-7, gly-8, and gly-9). All clones encoded type II membrane proteins that shared 60–80% amino acid sequence similarity with the catalytic domain of mammalian ppGaNTase enzymes. Two sets of cDNA clones (gly-5 and gly-6) contained variants that appeared to be produced by alternative message processing.gly-6c contained a reading frameshift and premature termination codon in the C-terminal lectin-like domain found in most other ppGaNTase proteins, and a second clone (gly-8) lacked the typical C-terminal region completely.

In addition to demonstrating the existence of ppGaNTase enzymes in a nematode organism, the substantial diversity of these isoforms in C. elegans suggests that mucin O-glycosylation is catalyzed by a complex gene family, which is conserved among evolutionary-distinct organisms. The diversity of O-linked oligosaccharides displayed on secreted and cell surface glycoproteins is determined by the repertoire of glycosyltransferases present in the Golgi apparatus. The biosynthesis of mucin-type oligosaccharides at specificO-glycosylation sites begins with the transfer of the monosaccharide N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) 1The abbreviations used are: GalNAc,N-acetylgalactosamine; ppGaNTase, UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; EST, expressed sequence tag; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; UTR, untranslated region; nt, nucleotide(s); aa, amino acid(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. to specific threonines and serines of an apo-protein. This initiation event is regulated in mammals by a family of at least seven enzymes, known as UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGaNTases) (EC 2.4.1.41). Four ppGaNTase isozymes have been cloned and functionally expressed from rodent and human cDNAs: ppGaNTase-T1 (1Homa F.L. Hollander T. Lehman D.J. Thomsen D.R. Elhammer A. J. Biol.

Evidence for three additional members of this gene family has been obtained, using a polymerase chain reaction approach. 2K. G. Ten Hagen, F. K. Hagen, and L. A. Tabak, manuscript in preparation. An eighth murine isoform having high amino acid sequence homology to ppGaNTase-T1 has also been suggested by nucleic acid cross-hybridization to a genomic library (7Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 92: 12070-12074Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Transcripts encoding specific ppGaNTase enzymes have distinct tissue patterns of expression, indicating that the acquisition of O-glycans can be regulated by differential expression of the ppGaNTase gene family. The substrate reactivity of the mammalian isozymes varies from those that are broad (ppGaNTase-T1) to those that recognize a narrow range of specific peptide sequences (ppGaNTase-T4); therefore, O-glycosylation of specific proteins in vivo requires the coordinate expression of polypeptide substrates and their cognate ppGaNTase enzymes. An analysis of the human and murine expressed sequence tag (EST) data base revealed numerous new sequence homologs, suggesting that an even larger and more complex family may exist in mammals (8Hagen F.K. Gregoire C. Tabak L.A. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The complexity and potential redundancy of the ppGaNTase gene family in mammalian systems is underscored by a ppGaNTase gene ablation study in mice, in which the deletion of an exon from a putative ppGaNTase gene produced mice that appeared normal and unaffected in their ability to O-glycosylate proteins (7Hennet T.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The growing number of ppGaNTase isoforms isolated in mammals indicates that a genetic approach to ablating ppGaNTase activity in a murine model will be a lengthy undertaking. In this present study, we have searched for a simple model organism that is suitable for using a genetic approach to study the roles of mucin-type O-glycosylation during development and differentiation. We selected Caenorhabditis elegans because nematodes express hyperabundant mucin-like glycoproteins and becauseC. elegans is amenable to classical and reverse genetic studies. In addition, the EST data base revealed numerous C. elegans clones, which encoded putative sequence homologs of the mammalian ppGaNTases, providing us with a system for identifying the size and properties of the complete ppGaNTase family in a whole organism. Biochemical studies performed here revealed that worms express ppGaNTase enzyme activity and that this activity is encoded by a family of enzymes. A total of 11 distinct C. eleganscDNAs (encoded by glygenes), 3The gly gene name designation is used by the C. elegans community to refer to glycosylation-related gene products; therefore, “gly” genes include the ppGaNTase homologs identified in this study, as well as other glycosyl transferases, glycosidases, and components related to the N- and O-linked glycosylation pathway. containing complete open reading frames with sequence homology to mammalian ppGaNTase, were isolated, sequenced, and expressed. Two sets of these cDNAs appear to be splice variants. Functional analysis of recombinant worm enzymes demonstrated that five of the members of this family catalyzed the ppGaNTase reaction in vitro using mammalian peptides as acceptor substrates. C. elegans N2 worms were grown on 15-cm egg plates for 2–3 weeks, washed with M9 medium (22 mm KH2PO4, 22 mm Na2HPO4, 86 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4), and harvested. Worms were purified from debris by sedimentation overnight at 4 °C in M9 medium in a graduated cylinder. The concentrated nematodes were diluted with two volumes of 100 mm NaCl. Resuspended worms were mixed with an equal volume of 60% sucrose and centrifuged at 2000 rpm in a SH3000 rotor (Sorvall) for 5 min at 4 °C. Floating worms were removed and resuspended in a large volume of 50 mm NaCl and centrifuged as above but only for 2 min. This final worm pellet was resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and then frozen at −70 °C. To prepare a homogenate of mixed-stage nematodes, aliquots of frozen worms were thawed, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Nematodes (0.5 grams) were placed in a 2-ml tube containing 1 ml of 1-mm glass beads and 1 ml of homogenization medium (500 mmsucrose, 2 mm Tris maleate, pH 6.4, 1 mmMnCl2 and MgCl2, 1% dextran (average molecular weight = 250,000), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Worms were disrupted three times with 1-min pulses, using a Mini-Beadbeater-8 cell disrupter (Biospec Products). One volume of this homogenate was diluted with 10 volumes of H2O and centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was resuspended in 230 μl of extraction solution (50 mm sodium cacodylate, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2.5% Triton X-100) and homogenized with a 1.5-ml tube plunger. After 30 min of rocking, the tube was centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was removed and saved. The pellet fraction was re-extracted as above, and the supernatants were combined, mixed, and stored at −70 °C. Enzyme activity was measured in vitro using the following assay conditions: a final volume of 25 μl containing a final concentration of 500 μm EA2 peptide, 50 μmUDP-[14C]GalNAc (25,000 cpm), 10 mmMnCl2, 40 mm cacodylate pH 6.5, 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Peptide substrates (amino acid sequences in parentheses) used in these assays are: EPO-T (PPDAATAAPLR), EPO-S (PPDAASAAPLR), and EA2 (PTTDSTTPAPTTK) at a concentration of 500 μm and TPPP at 1 mm. Three μl of worm extract, purified bovine colostrum ppGaNTase (2Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or immunopurified recombinant enzymes were used in this standard enzyme assay (Fig. 1). All enzyme assay points were performed in duplicate, and these were repeated with duplicate enzyme preparations from worm extracts or COS7 cell supernatants. Glycosylated14C-labeled peptides were separated from unincorporated UDP-[14C]GalNAc by anion exchange chromatography on formate form AG 1x8 resin spin columns (Bio-Rad). The amino acid sequence of the mouse ppGaNTase-T1 was used as a query to perform a TBLASTN analysis of the data base of expressed sequence tags (dBEST) (10Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70634) Google Scholar). All EST sequences derived from the C. elegans data base were conceptually translated and aligned to the four known mammalian ppGaNTase isoforms, ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, -T3, and -T4. Any clone that contained at least three homologous segments (eight amino acids in length) with conserved spacing between each segment was treated as a putative homolog of the ppGaNTase family and used to generate a cDNA hybridization probe. Seven different expressed sequence tag (EST) clones (yk2f11, yk3 g10, yk15e11, cm13e2, yk151a8, yk72f6, and cm16e9) were selected for probe design (probes B for gly-4, C for gly-7, D for gly-6, E for gly-5b and -5c, F for gly-8, G for gly-5a, and H for gly-9). EST clones yk2f11, yk3 g10, and yk15e11 were obtained from Dr. Y. Kohara. EST clones cm13e2 and cm16e9 were obtained from Dr. L. Fulton and Dr. Robert Waterston. Nucleic acid hybridization probes, specific for each EST, were prepared by isolating polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of a 190–330-nt region in each cDNA from the data base. EST clones described above were used as templates for amplifying probes for gly-4, gly-6, and gly-7, while first strand cDNA from mixed stage nematode total RNA was used as a template for amplifying fragments of the remaininggly clones. First strand cDNA was synthesized using a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH), oligo(dT)18, and total RNA from mixed stage C. elegans N2 nematodes. The oligonucleotides used for the amplification of each isoform is described in Table I.32P-Labeled probes were generated using purified PCR products, antisense oligonucleotides for cDNAs gly-4through gly-9, and a PCR labeling protocol. Briefly, 30 ng of PCR product was added to a 12.5 reaction mixture containing 1 μm primer, 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm dATP, dGTP, dTTP (each), 0.75 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and 5 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Reactions were amplified for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s, 49 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s.Table IOligonucleotides used for screening and expression constructscDNAN-terminal MluI site1-2001Sense strand primer used to introduce aMluI site immediately following the transmembrane anchor.

Open table in a new tab Full-length coding regions for 10 of the sequence homologs were obtained by screening two C. eleganscDNA libraries: an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library and a random-primed cDNA library, λ-ACT-RB1 and λ-ACT-RB2, respectively (kindly provided by Dr. R. Barstead; Ref. 11Barstead R.J. Waterston R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10177-10185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven hundred thousand phage of each library RB1 and RB2 were plated onto 24 × 24-cm Nunc plates and a lawn of LE392 Escherichia coli cells. The plates were plaque-lifted using Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membranes were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in 5× SSPE, 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, containing 3 × 105 cpm/ml of each 32P-labeled denatured probe. Filters were washed three times for 20 min each in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at the following three temperatures: 42, 64, and 42 °C. Initial screening was performed with a mixture of seven probes for isoformsgly-4, gly-5a, gly-5b,gly-6, gly-7, gly-8, and gly-9. Ninety-six positive plaques were cored, dot-blotted on multiple Hybond-N membranes, and probed with individual isoform-specific probes, using the conditions above. Twenty-one clones, corresponding to 10 different cDNAs, were isolated to homogeneity. Cre-lox excision of the pACT plasmid from each λ clone was accomplished by transduction into the E. coli strain RB4, which expresses the Cre recombinase. CsCl2 quality plasmid DNA was prepared in the RB4 host and used directly for infrared fluorescence DNA sequencing, using Bca DNA polymerase in a Ladderman Core sequencing protocol (PanVera) and a LICOR model 4000L DNA sequencer. IRD41 dye-labeled primers were designed for the pACT plasmid, using the following sequences: PACT-F primer d(CTATCTATTCGATGATGAAG) and PACT-R primer d(ACAGTTGAAGTGAACTTGCG). Both strands of clonesgly-4 through gly-9 were completely sequenced by creating deletion from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA inserts. Radioactive DNA sequencing was used to fill small gaps in sequence reads. Splice variants were completely sequenced on one strand, and the alternative spliced region was sequenced on both strands. One splice variant, gly-6b, was present on a partial cDNA, lacking the first 151 amino acid codons. The full-length sequence of gly-6b was obtained by using overlapping gly-6cDNA clones. Similarly, the 5′ end of the gly-5a isoform was obtained by using overlapping gly-5 clones. The sequence of the 11th cDNA, gly-3, cDNA was determined by sequencing a gly-3 PCR product (using the primers in TableI) and the sequence data in the GenBank data base from clones CE17E3 (EST) and ZK688.8 (genomic clone). Expression constructs were designed such that the cDNAs were expressed as secreted recombinant proteins, lacking their natural N-terminal membrane anchors (for amino acid sequence, see Fig. 2). To clone all of the isoforms, a new expression vector construct, pIMKF3, was created. The SV40 promoter-driven expression plasmid pIMKF3 is virtually identical to pIMKF1 (6Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. Beres T.M. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that the multiple cloning site was expanded to include four new unique restriction sites: ApaI,BglII, NotI, and SacII (Fig. 5). Seven cDNA clones (gly-3, gly-4,gly-5a, gly-6a, gly-7, gly-8, and gly-9) were introduced into the 5′ MluI and 3′ multiple cloning site of pIMKF3, creating the constructs pF3-GLY3, pF3-GLY4, pF3-GLY5a, pF3-GLY6a, pF3-GLY7, pF3-GLY8, and pF3-GLY9, respectively. The MluI restriction site was introduced into all constructs by PCR amplification of the stem region with a PCR primer (Table I, column two) and a downstream antisense strand primer in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) or vector sequences (Table I, column four). Only the cDNA sequences encoding the full-stem, catalytic region, C-terminal coding region, and part of the 3′-UTR was present in each expression construct (the first amino acids used in the secretion construct are indicated in Fig. 2). With the exception of pF3-GLY3, the majority of the coding region was replaced by a restriction fragment of the cDNA clone obtained from the original library screen, such that the PCR-derived fragment was minimal in size. All PCR-derived sequences and cloning sites were completely re-sequenced to verify that no random PCR-induced mutations or frameshift artifacts existed in the expression constructs. Expression constructs of the “b” and “c” splice variants of gly-5 and gly-6 were constructed by replacing the 3′ end of the cDNA in the pF3-GLY5a and pF3-GLY6a clones with the original cDNAs that contain the variant regions. These splice variant constructs were sequenced to verify that the sequence and reading frames matched the original cDNAs. The pF3-GLY6b construct was unstable in E. coli.Figure 5Design of vector for expression and secretion of recombinant proteins. Truncated cDNAs encoding the 10 worm GLY proteins were introduced into the expression vector pIMKF3.A, pIMKF1, the parent plasmid pIMKF3, was previously constructed in pSVL, a SV40 promoter/enhancer-driven mammalian expression vector (6Hagen F.K.

The cDNA insert begins with the stem region of the GLY proteins, which is cloned into the MluI site of pIMKF3 (circled residue in Fig. 2 indicates the first amino acid codon used in each expression clone); therefore, each construct directs secretion of a truncated GLY protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recombinant enzymes were expressed by transient transfection of COS7 cells, using these pF3-GLY3 through pF3-GLY9 constructs and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (6Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G. Beres T.M. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13843-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of supercoiled DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE was used to transfect a 35-mm dish of COS7 cells at 90–100% confluence. After 5 h, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum was gently added to the cells. Eighteen hours after the start of transfection, the transfection medium was removed and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were grown at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Medium was harvested from these cultures and clarified by a centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min. The transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted by adding 500 μl Cell Extraction Buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The recombinant proteins were partially purified by incubating the culture medium (1.5 ml) or the cell extract (375 μl) with 150 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 3 h to overnight at 4 °C with rocking. After a 5-s centrifugation step at 2000 × g, the supernatant was removed using a 30-gauge needle and syringe. The antibody-agarose pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of Storage Buffer (50 mmsodium cacodylate, 50% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and FLAG peptide at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml). After 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking, the antibody-agarose was centrifuged as above, and the eluted recombinant enzyme was removed with a 30 gauge needle and syringe. To determine the yield of recombinant proteins, immunopurified enzymes were 32P-labeled and analyzed by Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE) (21Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10477) Google Scholar). 32P Labeling of proteins was accomplished by first incubating 1 μl of the FLAG-purified recombinant proteins in 10 μl of heart muscle kinase (HMK) buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2) with 5 units of heart muscle kinase (Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]rATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) at 37 °C for 60 min. Next, 6 μl of 5× Tricine Gel Loading Buffer (20% SDS, 60% glycerol, 250 mm Tris, pH 7, 0.05% Coomassie G-250, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the labeled protein and heated at 65 °C for 20 min; 2 μl were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Enzyme assays were performed with 3 μl of the FLAG-purified recombinant GLY proteins. Detergent extracts of homogenates from mixed stage worms were assayed for ppGaNTase activity using a mammalian multisite peptide substrate EA2 (PTTDSTTPAPTTK), which was derived from the tandem repeat motif in the rat submandibular gland (RSMG) mucin (12Albone E.F. Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16845-16852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minimal ppGaNTase activity was detected at 37 °C. Because C. elegans is a soil organism that thrives at a temperature of 16 to 25 °C, the temperature optimum of the native nematode enzyme activity was determined. In vitro ppGaNTase enzyme assays were performed at incubation temperatures varying from 4 °C to 60 °C in a 2-h transferase reaction. The native enzymes fromC. elegans reached a maximal enzyme activity between 20 and 25 °C (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the native mammalian enzyme isolated from bovine colostrum was maximally active at 40 °C. Temperatures above 30 °C resulted in a sharp drop in worm enzyme activity, and at 50 °C both the worm and mammalian ppGaNTase enzyme activities were undetectable. At present, only one cosmid (ZK688) in the completed portion of the C. elegans genome sequence data base encodes a putative homolog for a ppGaNTase. The ZK688.8 gene, designatedgly-3, contains six exons that encode a 612-amino acid protein with a type II membrane structure. The total 612-aa size is similar to that of mammalian ppGaNTase enzymes. The sequence of the central 330 amino acids of ZK688.8 is 80% similar to the catalytic domain of the mammalian ppGaNTase-T1 enzyme. The gly-3cDNA was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using total RNA from wild type C. elegans N2 and sequence information from C. elegans genome sequencing project (13Sulston J. Du Z. Thomas K. Wilson R. Hillier L. Staden R. Halloran N. Green P. Thierry-Mieg J. Qiu L. Dear S. Coulson A. Craxton M. Durbin R. Berks M. Metxstein M. Hawkins T. Ainscough R. Waterston R. Nature. 1992; 356: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PCR-amplified gly-3cDNA was identical to that predicted by the genomic sequence and the GeneFinder DNA analysis computer program, except for an asparagine to serine codon change at position 560 in the protein. The coding region following the N-terminal transmembrane domain was cloned downstream from an insulin secretion signal into the mammalian expression vector pIMKF3, such that the recombinant protein is produced as a secreted soluble protein. The pIMKF3 expression construct containing this truncated GLY-3/ZK688.8 protein is labeled pF3-GLY3. Protein expression was obtained by transient transfection of COS7 cells, which secreted the recombinant GLY-3 protein into the culture medium. To assay the functional activity of GLY-3, the recombinant GLY-3 protein was immunopurified using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody to remove any potential COS7 cell endogenous enzyme contamination. In parallel, pF3-mT1, encoding the secreted form of the mouse ppGaNTase-T1 isozyme, was transfected into COS7 cells. The pF3-GLY3 clone expressed sufficient ZK688.8 protein to demonstrated ppGaNTase activity (Fig.1 B). Enzyme assays performed at a range of incubation temperatures revealed that the temperature optimum for the recombinant worm GLY-3 protein was approximately 23 °C, while the recombinant mouse ppGaNTase-T1 had a temperature optimum of 45 °C. Putative sequence homologs of the ppGaNTase family were detected in a C. elegans expressed sequence tag (EST) data base using the mouse ppGaNTase-T1 amino acid sequence (6Hagen F.K. Ten Hagen K.G.

A total of 20 EST cDNA clones contained at least three blocks of sequences conserved with mouse ppGaNTase-T1; however, many of these were overlapping clones. Nucleic acid hybridization probes were designed from seven non-overlappingC. elegans EST clones: probes B, C, D, E, F, G, and H in Table II. Two C. elegans λ ACT cDNA libraries, RB1 and RB2, containing oligo(dT) and random-primed cDNA clones, respectively, were hybridized with a mixture of the seven 32P-labeled EST probes. A total of 1.4 million phage were screened, resulting in 584 clones with a moderate to strong hybridization signal. Therefore, on average, one positive clone was detected for every 2400 clones plated. Dot-blot analysis of 96 clones (48 from each library) revealed the frequency of each EST in the cDNA library (Table II). Hybridization with individual probes revealed that some cDNA clones hybridized to two probes, E and G. The abundance of these RNA messages in the cDNA library suggested the following relative frequency of each clone: most abundant =gly-7 > gly-5 > gly-8> gly-6 > gly-4 >gly-9 > least abundant. The frequency of these cDNAs in the RB1 cDNA library was not an accurate representation of the frequency of the message in the RNA population because the 3′-UTR of some of the cDNAs (gly-6 and gly-9) were unstable in high copy DNA vehicles. Surprisingly, gly-8 was not detected in the random-primed RB1 cDNA library, although 19 clones out of 48 encodedgly-8 in the RB2 library. DNA sequence analysis of the av"

FaNaCh is homologous to the subunits that compose the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, to Caenorhabditis elegans degenerins, and to acid-sensing ionic channels. FaNaCh properties were analyzed in stably transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). The channel was functional with an EC50 for FMRFamide of 1 μm and an IC50 (25 °C) for amiloride of 6.5 μm as assessed by 22Na+ uptake measurements. The channel activity was associated with the presence of a protein at the cell surface with an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa. The 82-kDa form was derived from an incompletely glycosylated form of 74 kDa found in the endoplasmic reticulum. Formation of covalent bonds between subunits of the same complex were observed either after formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds following cell homogenization and solubilization with Triton X-100 or after use of bifunctional cross-linkers. This resulted in the formation of covalent multimers that contained up to four subunits. Hydrodynamic properties of the solubilized FaNaCh complex also indicated a maximal stoichiometry of four subunits per complex. It is likely that epithelial Na+channels, acid-sensing ionic channels, degenerins, and the other proteins belonging to the same ion channel superfamily also associate within tetrameric complexes.

This new gene superfamily encodes ionic channels expressed in epithelial (i.e. ENaC) as well as excitable tissues (i.e. FaNaCh, ASIC, or degenerins) (16Barbry P. Hofman P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G571-G585PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins belonging to this family are characterized by a large extracellular domain located between two large hydrophobic zones forming the transmembrane regions. The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains are cytoplasmic (17Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite increasing information on the structure and function of these channels, the stoichiometry of the functional complexes remains unknown. Biochemical handling of FaNaCh is facilitated by several properties: (i) unlike ENaC which comprises α, β, and γ subunits, active FMRFamide Na+ channels are formed by a homomultimerization of the FaNaCh channels; (ii) unlike ENaC, the FaNaCh channel is totally silent in the absence of FMRFamide, and therefore not toxic for cells that express it. The determination of the oligomeric arrangement of the FaNaCh channel might serve as a model for other channels within this family (ENaC, degenerins, and ASIC). After extensive functional and biochemical characterization of the channel complex, we show that four FaNaCh subunits participate in the formation of the FMRFamide-activated sodium channel. FaNaCh cDNA structure has been previously described by Lingueglia et al. (1Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The cDNA was inserted either into the plasmid pBSSK−-SP6-globin (18Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) for efficient expression in Xenopus oocytes or in pRC/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen) for transfection of eucaryotic cells. A tagged FaNaCh was constructed by polymerase chain reaction, leading to the addition of the FLAG sequence (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) to the COOH terminus of the protein. This epitope, which does not alter the channel activity (not shown), can be detected by a commercial monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) with a high specificity and a low background. Stable transfection was carried out on HEK-293 cells with the FaNaCh or FaNaCh-FLAG pRC/CMV plasmid (Invitrogen) by the Ca2+-phosphate technique (19Barbry P. Champe M. Chassande O. Munemitsu S. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. Maes P. Frelin C. Tartar A. Ullrich A. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were seeded in collagen-coated 24-well clusters (Falcon). Confluent cells were rinsed twice with the flux buffer (140 mm choline chloride orN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride, 20 mmHEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4) and then incubated with 200 μl of flux buffer supplemented with 2 mm22NaCl (0.5–1 μCi/ml Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 12 Ci/mmol) with or without amiloride or FMRFamide. External 22Na+was washed out by four 1-ml washings with cold flux buffer, and trapped radioactivity was measured using a Packard 1600 CA liquid scintillation counter. Dose-dependent activations and/or inhibitions were measured after a 150-s incubation. The cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain of FaNaCh (amino acids 570–625) was produced in the glutathione sulfhydryl transferase fusion protein expression vector pGEX-3X according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The peptide was injected intradermally into a rabbit as described previously (17Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were first characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on pure antigen, then used for immunoprecipitation experiments. Some experiments were carried out using the FaNaCh-FLAG construct. The FLAG was detected by the commercial monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak). Cells were rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution, scraped, and recovered in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm K2SO4, 5 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors (100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After lysis in a Potter and slow centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged 1 h at 30,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended at about 2 mg/ml in lysis buffer and stored at −70 °C. 10–20 μg of membrane proteins were heated at 65 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 2 m urea, bromphenol blue, with or without 4% β-mercaptoethanol) and applied to SDS-PAGE. After migration, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific binding was blocked by a 1–2-h incubation in 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 5% milk. The filter was incubated overnight in the same buffer with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (dilution 1/1000, Kodak), rinsed 3 times for 10 min with 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated 45 min with a goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase (Jackson Immunotech), rinsed, and revealed by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Confluent cells were incubated in a methionine- and cysteine-deficient medium for 30 min prior to the addition of 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Trans35S-LABEL, ICN, 1077 Ci/mmol). After a pulse of 2–3 h (or 30 min for pulse-chase experiments), the cells were rinsed and incubated in complete medium (plus 10% fetal calf serum) for various lengths of time. Cells were subsequently pelleted and lysed with 50 μl of chilled radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 1% C12E8 (Nikko Chemicals), protease inhibitors)/35-mm dish. After preclearing with pansorbin (Calbiochem), the lysate was incubated overnight with the polyclonal antibody (1/100), and pelleted using protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). After washing, samples were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and applied to 6.5 or 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were treated with 1 m salicylic acid for 30 min, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimager imaging plate. Cell surface labeling was performed according to Dalemans et al. (20Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer F. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were rinsed with PBS+(phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm MgCl2). 250 μl PBS+, 10 units of lactoperoxidase (Sigma), and 500 μCi of 125I (NEN Life Science Products, 2200 Ci/mmol) were added to each 35-mm dish at 4 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding 10 μl of H2O2 0.01%; this addition was repeated twice (every 30 s). Cells were rinsed several times in PBS+, and resuspended in the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate. Proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to phosphorimager imaging plate. Cells were solubilized after membrane preparation, metabolic labeling, or cell surface iodination in the cross-linking assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA). Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with DSS (suberic acid bis(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, Sigma) at pH 9.4 with SADP (N-succinimidyl(4-azidophenyl)-1,3′-dithiopropionate, Sigma) or with NHS-ASA (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid, Pierce) at pH 7.4. Reactions were stopped with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4. SADP- or NHS-ASA-treated samples were then exposed for 10 min to an UV source (252 nm). Following cross-linking, samples were applied to a 5% Laemmli or 3.5% Weber-Osborn polyacrylamide gel (21Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were solubilized and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 15 min. In some experiments, the solubilized material was also cross-linked using 500 μmDSS, or the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds was prevented by the addition of 10 mm iodoacetamide. The solubilized material was recovered and applied to the top of a linear 5–15% sucrose gradient formed in water or in D2O (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 or CHAPS, protease inhibitors). β-galactosidase (100 μg), catalase (100 μg), alkaline phosphatase (67 units), and cytochrome c (100 μg), used as markers, were also applied on top of the same gradient. After a 17 h run at 39,000 rpm (190,000 × g) on a SW41-TI rotor (Beckman), 300-μl fractions were recovered. They were assayed for the presence of the standards and either immunoprecipitated overnight with the anti-FaNaCh antibodies (for metabolic and cell surface labelings) or assayed by Dot-blot with the anti-FLAG antibody. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The apparent sedimentation coefficients of FaNaCh in H2O and D2O were determined. From these values and the values of densities and viscosities, it was possible to determine the sedimentation coefficient at 20 °C in water (s20,w), and the partial specific volume (v̄, equal to the inverse of the density) of the detergent-protein complex (22Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5459-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of the detergent to the complex was deduced from that latter value, knowing the partial specific volume of Triton X-100 (equal to 0.908 cm3/g), and the partial specific volume of proteins (using a mean value equal to 0.73 cm3/g) (23Davis A. Venter C.J. Harrisson L.C. Molecular and Chemical Characterization of Membrane Receptors. 3. Alan R. Liss, 1984: 161-178Google Scholar). Stokes radius was determined from gel filtration data. According to Siegel and Monty (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), the total mass of the protein-detergent complex was deduced from the Equation 1. Mcomplex=6πη20,wNAs20,wRStokes1−ρ20,wν¯Equation 1 where η20, is the viscosity of water at 20 °C (equal to 0.01002 Poise), NA is the Avogadro number (6.02 1023) and ρ20,wis the density of water at 20 °C (0.99823 g/cm3). The molecular weight of the protein complex was deduced from this value, taking into account the contribution of the detergent to the total mass of the complex. FMRFamide-activated sodium channel activity was measured after stable transfection of the FaNaCh cDNA into HEK-293 cells. Fig. 1 shows that the properties of the channel observed in FaNaCh-transfected HEK-293 cells were identical to those of the native channel recorded in snail neurons (25Green K.A. Falconer S.W. Cottrell G.A. Pflügers Archiv. 1994; 428: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and to those of the channel recorded in Xenopus oocytes injected with the corresponding cRNA (1Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).22Na+ uptake was largely increased after stimulation with 30 μm FMRFamide in transfected cells (Fig. 1 A). The time course of the uptake was biphasic. After a relatively fast rise to a plateau, the 22Na+uptake declined to a lower intermediate value. The initial event is consistent with the rapid development of a Na+permeability. The decline of the signal observed after 2.5 min is likely due to the inactivation of the channel (25Green K.A. Falconer S.W. Cottrell G.A. Pflügers Archiv. 1994; 428: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) combined with a sustained Na+/K+-ATPase activity. A Michaelis-Menten relationship was observed between the external concentration of sodium and the initial ratio of22Na+ uptake (Fig. 1 B) with a half-maximal activation of 1.4 mm. A similar value (K0.5 = 5 mm) has been reported for the external sodium dependence of the ENaC activity after expression in Xenopus oocytes (4Canessa C. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). FMRFamide activated the 22Na+ uptake in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal activation at a concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 1 C), nearly identical to the 2 μm value measured by electrophysiological techniques after FaNaCh expression in Xenopus oocytes (1Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The channel expressed in HEK-293 cells was also blocked by amiloride (Fig. 1 D). At 37 °C, the IC50 for amiloride was 42 μm. The IC50 was shifted to 6.5 μm at 25 °C and to 1.6 μm at 8 °C. An IC50 of 10 μm was previously determined in snail neurons at 25 °C (25Green K.A. Falconer S.W. Cottrell G.A. Pflügers Archiv. 1994; 428: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The protein expressed in transfected cells was first characterized using a polyclonal antibody directed against the COOH-terminal domain. In pulse-chase experiments, the polyclonal antibody immunoprecipitated a 74-kDa protein, which matured after 2–3 h into a 82-kDa protein (Fig.2 A). After deglycosylation of the immunoprecipitated material with N-glycosidase F (data not shown), or pretreatment of the cells with tunicamycin (a blocker of N-glycosylation), a 67-kDa protein was detected in good agreement with a predicted molecular mass equal to 71 kDa for the polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 B also shows that the 74-kDa band was the only product detected after a 3 h pulse-chase made in the presence of brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular transport. Since the 74-kDa form was also sensitive to endoglycosidase H (data not shown), which cleaves high mannose structures characteristic for glycosylations in the endoplasmic reticulum, it probably corresponds to an intermediate form of maturation of FaNaCh. On the contrary, the 82-kDa form, detected after longer times of metabolic labeling, was resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion (data not shown) and is thus considered to correspond to a fully mature terminally glycosylated form. Fig.2 C demonstrates that the 82-kDa protein can indeed be detected at the cell surface since it is immunoprecipitated by anti-FaNaCh antibodies after a cell surface labeling of FaNaCh-transfected cells with Na125I and lactoperoxidase. The channel complex is present in large amounts at the surface since the FaNaCh signal represented up to 10% of the total radioactive material. When SDS-PAGE migration was performed under nonreducing conditions, oligomeric forms of FaNaCh were observed (Fig.3 A). These forms were sensitive to β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting the existence of disulfide bonds between subunits. When membranes were prepared in the presence of 10 mm iodoacetamide, the monomer was the only form detected (Fig. 3 A). This result shows that formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds is not occurring in the native channel, but rather that it results from a redox potential alteration created by the experimental conditions during cell lysis or the following steps. Disulfide bond formation was increased after solubilization with Triton X-100. Whereas we detected only the monomeric form (74–82 kDa) on iodoacetamide-treated membranes after solubilization with 1% Triton X-100, additional bands at 151–164 kDa (dimer), 205–230 kDa (trimer), and 305–327 kDa (tetramer) were observed in parallel analysis with control membranes prepared in the absence of iodoacetamide (Fig.3 A). The Triton X-100 effect was time-dependent. An overnight incubation with Triton X-100 (instead of 15 min) significantly increased the percentage of tetrameric form (data not shown). In vitro intersubunit disulfide bond rearrangement or formation has been reported for a variety of other oligomeric proteins such as Shaker K+ channel (26Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), synaptophysin (27Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8869-8873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the brain glutamate transporter (28Haugeto O. Ullensvang K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A. Honore T. Nielsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In the two latter cases, the extent of rearrangement depended on the detergent used for solubilization. It was maximal with SDS for synaptophysin and with CHAPS for brain glutamate transporter. For FaNaCh, formation of tetramers was only observed after solubilization with Triton X-100 and not after solubilization with CHAPS or with deoxycholate. After a lactoperoxidase labeling of the cell surface proteins with 125I and covalent reticulation with DSS, the material was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked proteins were detected on a 3.5% Weber-Osborn gel (nonreducing conditions) at apparent molecular masses of 180 (dimer), 260 (trimer), and 345 kDa (tetramer) (Fig. 3 C). Most of the cross-linked material appeared as trimers, but the presence of a tetramer was detected in three out of eleven experiments as a diffuse band around 345 kDa. When membranes were solubilized with Triton X-100 then cross-linked with the heterobifunctional reagent SADP (Fig. 3 B), the tetramer was the main form detected by Western blot. Fig. 3 Balso shows an increase of the tetrameric form when SADP concentration was increased from 100 to 500 μm. The formation of covalent tetramers was not restricted to Triton X-100-solubilized material. They were also detected on CHAPS-solubilized material after a reticulation with the heterobifunctional cross-linker NHS-ASA (Fig.3 D). The pool of FaNaCh proteins expressed at the cell surface was analyzed by sedimentation experiments through sucrose gradients after a solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 + 0.5% deoxycholate. A unique peak characterized by an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 9.5 S was observed. This peak was not modified after cross-linking of the membrane proteins with DSS (not shown). This proved that a unique FaNaCh complex (formed by a given number of subunits) was expressed at the cell surface and was resistant to solubilization by 1% Triton X-100 + 0.5% deoxycholate. Hydrodynamic characterization of the complex solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 was then performed. The apparent sedimentation coefficients in a linear 5–15% sucrose gradient formed in water and in D2O were determined (Figs. 4, A and B). The sedimentation coefficient at 20 °C in water (s20,w) of the Triton X-100-protein complex was equal to 9.12 ± 0.02 S, and the partial specific volume v̄ was equal to 0.774 ± 0.004 cm3/g (n = 2). A 25% detergent contribution to the total mass of the complex was deduced, assuming a partial specific volume of FaNaCh in the absence of detergent equal to 0.73 cm3/g. The Stokes radius was equal to 73 ± 4 Å (n = 3), as determined by a chromatography on a Superdex-200 column (Fig. 4 D). Results are summarized in Table I.Table IHydrodynamic propertiesSedimentation coefficient s20,w = 9.12 ± 0.02 SStokes radius RStokes = 73 ± 4 ÅPartial specific volume v̄complex = 0.774 ± 0.004 cm3/gMolecular weight of the complex 310 kDa ≤ Mcomplex ≤ 358 kDaMolecular weight of the glycoprotein complex (without detergent) forv̄protein = 0.73 cm3/g: 233 kDa ≤Mprotein ≤ 268 kDa and 3 ≤ n ≤ 3.4 for v̄protein = 0.76 cm3/g: 281 kDa ≤ Mprotein ≤ 322 kDa and 3.6 ≤ n≤ 4.1 Open table in a new tab Using Equation 1, a value of 333 ± 24 kDa was found for the complex formed by the protein and Triton X-100, and 251 ± 18 kDa for the glycopeptidic complex in the absence of detergent. Assuming a mean molecular mass of 78 kDa for a FaNaCh monomer (due to the fact that the 74- and 82-kDa forms contribute equally to the total FaNaCh signal (Fig. 3 A), a first estimate of the subunit stoichiometry equal to 3.2 was found. Since formation of interchains disulfide bonds occurred after solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. 3 A), two distinct control experiments were performed to ensure that the Triton X-100-solubilized material was not denatured. First, a unique peak with similar s20,w and v̄(8.8 S and 0.806 cm3/g) was detected after membranes had been treated with 10 mm iodoacetamide, which prevented the formation of covalent oligomers. Second, a similar sedimentation profile was obtained after solubilization of the complex with CHAPS (Fig. 4 C). The peak was characterized by an apparent sedimentation coefficient equal to 9.7 ± 0.3 S (n= 3). The unknown value of the partial specific volume of the protein affected the estimation of the stoichiometry (Table I). Small changes can significantly affect the evaluation of the detergent contribution to the complex. A maximal stoichiometry, however, can be obtained assuming that no detergent is bound to the complex. In that case, the total mass of the complex only represents oligomers of FaNaCh. A maximal value equal to 4.3, that is, strictly below 5, was deduced in agreement with the tetrameric organization demonstrated by cross-linking experiments. The material sedimented through a sucrose gradient was also analyzed by Western blot. Fig. 5 shows that the covalent dimers, trimers, and tetramers formed by oxidation after Triton X-100 solubilization are co-sedimenting. This indicates that formation of disulfide bonds only occurred between subunits of the same complex. Taken together with the other data presented above, this is consistent with a tetrameric organization of the FaNaCh complex. The properties of the FMRFamide-gated sodium channel expressed in HEK-293 cells are quite consistent with the properties of the channel recorded in native tissues or after expression of the cloned cDNA into Xenopus oocytes. Since FaNaCh expression in HEK-293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes is able to generate a large FMRFamide-induced inward current, it is likely that the functional channel corresponds to a homomultimeric structure, and does not need association with endogenous subunits. The transfected cells therefore represent a useful model to study the pharmacological and biophysical properties of the FMRFamide-gated sodium channel. These results also demonstrate that correct assembly of the channel complex is possible in these transfected cells, which can be used to characterize the quaternary structure of the channel. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the maturation pattern and the quaternary structure of the FMRFamide-gated sodium channel. In transfected HEK-293 cells, FaNaCh glycosylation occurs in two steps. An immature precursor core-glycosylated form is produced into the endoplasmic reticulum and is then converted into a fully glycosylated form abundantly expressed at the cell surface, which generates the expected channel activity. Figs. 3 and 5 show that the immature form is already assembled into an oligomeric complex that sediments at the level of a unique peak on the sucrose density gradient. This proves that tetrameric assembly occurs at an early step of maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum. A similar type of assembly has also been reported for the tetrameric potassium channel Shaker(29Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Covalent tetramers were observed after use of three distinct chemical cross-linkers, i.e. DSS, SADP, and NHS-ASA. They were also detected after oxidation of the protein through the formation of interchain disulfide bonds. Triton X-100 increased the latter covalent bonding, but tetramers were also observed after solubilization in the presence of other detergents such as CHAPS, followed by chemical cross-linking (Fig. 3). It is therefore unlikely that tetramers only represent artifactual denaturation due to Triton X-100. Thus, cross-linking experiments provided a minimal stoichiometry of the complex equal to 4, and hydrodynamic properties of the solubilized FaNaCh complex provided a maximal stoichiometry strictly below 5. Taken together, these results led us to the conclusion that the FaNaCh complex is composed of four subunits. Since the FMRFamide-gated sodium channel is a member of the same structural family as ENaC, degenerins, and ASIC, a stoichiometry of 4 can also be expected for these channels. McNicholas and Canessa (30McNicholas C.M. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) analyzed the properties of epithelial Na+ channels generated after coexpression of αENaC and βENaC, or αENaC and γENaC. Using different ratios of injected cRNAs, they showed an optimal signal after injection of equal amounts of αENaC + βENaC and αENaC + γENaC. This would also be consistent with a tetrameric organization in which two α subunits would be associated with one β and one γ subunit. The same type of conclusion is also suggested by the results of Gründer et al. (31Gründer S. Firsov D. Chang S. Jaeger N. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R. Rossier B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These authors have analyzed the residual ENaC current generated after mutation of a highly conserved region located before the first transmembrane region of α, β, or γENaCs. As assessed by the residual current recorded after expression of a mutant subunit with two other wild-type chains, the role of the three subunits was not strictly equivalent. A stronger effect was observed after mutation of αENaC than after mutation of β or γENaCs. A tetrameric organization of the ENaC complex with two copies of αENaC, one copy of βENaC, and one copy of γENaC might suggest that the dominant negative effect would directly depend upon the number of mutated subunits participating in the complex. Gain-of-function mutations affecting MEC-4 and MEC-10 degenerins, which are likely subunits of a common complex expressed in the six touch-receptor neurons of C. elegans, cause neurodegeneration of these cells. Modulation of MEC-4 and/or MEC-10-induced degenerations by a supplementary loss-of-function mutation in trans was analyzed for MEC-10 (8Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and MEC-4 (32Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It was concluded that there are at least two copies of MEC-10 and two copies of MEC-4 in the complex. A tetrameric organization of the MEC-4/MEC-10 complex formed by two copies of MEC-10 and two copies of MEC-4 would then imply that the other mec gene products that build up the complex such as MEC-6 (8Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) are not degenerins. This work is the first direct demonstration that one member of the ENaC/FaNaCh/ASIC/degenerins superfamily can form tetramers. It is interesting to note that the family of inward rectifying K+channels, in which each of the subunits is also characterized by the presence of only two transmembrane domains, but which displays no homology with proteins of the ENaC/FaNaCh/ASIC/degenerins family, also has a tetrameric organization (33Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It might be tempting to speculate that the P2x subtype of purinergic receptors, which also displays a structural organization with two transmembrane domains per subunit, (34Surprenant A. Buell G. North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) also forms tetramers.

Dioxygenases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the incorporation of two atoms of molecular oxygen into a substrate (1Nozaki M. Top. Curr. Chem. 1979; 78: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes play an important role in the aerobic decomposition of aromatic compounds in bacteria. The aromatic ring of the substrate is generally hydroxylated by either a ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase or a ring-hydroxylating monooxygenase, and the intermediate possessing two hydroxyl groups is subsequently cleaved by a ring-cleaving dioxygenase (2Harayama S. Timmis N. Hopwood D.A. Chater K.F. Genetics of Bacterial Diversity. Academic Press, New York1989: 151-174Google Scholar, 3Harayama S. Timmis N. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 28. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 99-156Google Scholar).Dioxygenases cleaving an aromatic ring that possesses two adjacent hydroxyl groups are divided into two classes. One class of enzymes, the extradiol type, cleaves the ring at a bond proximal to one of the two hydroxylated carbon atoms. The other class of enzymes, the intradiol type, cleaves the aromatic ring between two hydroxylated carbon atoms (1Nozaki M. Top. Curr. Chem. 1979; 78: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of gentisate containing two hydroxyl groups at a position para to each other, the ring is cleaved between carbon 1 and carbon 2 by gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, and the ring-fission mechanism is believed to resemble that of extradiol-type fission (4Harpel M.R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 22187-22196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extradiol dioxygenases and gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase contain non-heme ferrous iron, whereas intradiol dioxygenases contain non-heme ferric iron (6Harayama S. Kok M. Neidle E.L. Annu. Rev.

Non-heme iron is essential for the activity of these ring-cleaving dioxygenases.In bacterial pathways for the degradation of phenanthrene viao-phthalate, the initial substrate is transformed to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, which is further oxidized by the ring cleavage enzyme, 1-hydroxy-2-napthoate dioxygenase (Fig.1) (7Kiyohara H.

Timmis N. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 28. Marcel Dekker, New York1992: 99-156Google Scholar). The biochemical reason for the requirement of two hydroxyl groups for ring cleavage is not yet understood. A model for the mechanism of extradiol dioxygenases has recently been proposed, and it was suggested that two hydroxyl groups of the substrate would interact with the catalytic iron, deprotonation of one of these hydroxyl groups being the first step of ring cleavage (16Shu L. Chiou Y.-M. Orville A.M. Miller M.A. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase is unique among ring-cleaving dioxygenases because it can cleave a singly hydroxylated aromatic ring.3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate was a competitive inhibitor of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase, whereas 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoate and salicylate exhibited no effect on the enzyme activity. Comparing the structures of these compounds, a fused ring structure and the position of the carboxyl group seem to be important for binding to the substrate-binding pocket of this enzyme.The previously characterized ring-cleaving dioxygenases required Fe(II) or Fe(III) for their activities. Fe(II) is required for extradiol-type ring-cleaving dioxygenases and gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, whereas Fe(III) is required for intradiol-type ring-cleaving dioxygenases (1Nozaki M. Top. Curr. Chem. 1979; 78: 145-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase also required Fe(II) for its activity, as has been suggested by Barnsley (10Barnsley E.A. J.

However, the amino acid sequence of this enzyme was not related to that of any previously characterized ring-cleaving enzyme. 1-Hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase cleaved the aromatic ring between the carboxylated and hydroxylated carbons of the substrate. Such cleavage has also been observed in the reaction catalyzed by gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase. The subunit size of gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Comamonas acidovorans and C. testosteroni was approximately 40 kDa, which is close to that of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase (4Harpel M.R.

Although 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase was not able to cleave the ring of gentisate, it is still possible that the structure and catalytic mechanism of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase are similar to those of gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase.

https://openalex.org/W2139963282,"d-Lactate dehydrogenase (d-LD) is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It spans the membrane once in an Nin-Coutorientation with the bulk of the protein residing as a folded domain in the intermembrane space. d-LD is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal cleavable presequence and is imported into the mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent, but mt-Hsp70-independent manner. Upon import in vitro d-LD folds in the intermembrane space to attain a conformation indistinguishable from endogenous d-LD. Sorting of d-LD to the inner membrane is directed by a composite topogenic signal consisting of the hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a cluster of charged amino acids C-terminal to it. We propose a model for the mode of operation of the sorting signal ofd-LD. This model also accounts for the driving force of translocation across the outer membrane, in the apparent absence of mt-Hsp70-dependent assisted import and involves the folding of the d-LD in the intermembrane space. d-Lactate dehydrogenase (d-LD) is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. It spans the membrane once in an Nin-Coutorientation with the bulk of the protein residing as a folded domain in the intermembrane space. d-LD is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal cleavable presequence and is imported into the mitochondria in a Δψ-dependent, but mt-Hsp70-independent manner. Upon import in vitro d-LD folds in the intermembrane space to attain a conformation indistinguishable from endogenous d-LD. Sorting of d-LD to the inner membrane is directed by a composite topogenic signal consisting of the hydrophobic transmembrane segment and a cluster of charged amino acids C-terminal to it. We propose a model for the mode of operation of the sorting signal ofd-LD. This model also accounts for the driving force of translocation across the outer membrane, in the apparent absence of mt-Hsp70-dependent assisted import and involves the folding of the d-LD in the intermembrane space. Nuclear encoded proteins of the inner membrane of mitochondria contain topogenic signals which function to sort them to the membrane following their import. These topogenic signals comprise hydrophobic cores of varying length and are flanked usually by charged amino acids. In many instances these signals form integral parts, the transmembrane anchors, of the sorted protein. In a small number of cases they are proteolytically cleaved following the sorting event. These topogenic signals are distinct from mitochondrial targeting sequences that serve to target the precursor initially to the mitochondria and to initiate membrane potential (Δψ)-dependent translocation across the inner membrane. In some cases these topogenic signals are located after N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signals (presequences) and operate in conjunction with them. This is not the case for all topogenic signals as many proteins of the inner membrane are synthesized without presequences but rather contain internal mitochondrial targeting signals.Bearing these differences in mind, together with the wide variety of orientations displayed by inner membrane proteins, it would appear unlikely that the topogenic signals operate in an uniform manner. How do they act to ensure the sorting of proteins to the inner membrane? Recently we have described that the topogenic signals of a subset of inner membrane proteins serve as export signals directing the export of domains of the protein from the matrix to the intermembrane space following the complete import of the preprotein into the matrix (1Rojo E.E.

Cytochrome c acts as an electron acceptor in the oxidation reaction, connecting the reaction to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Recently the gene for d-LD was cloned and appears to contain an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (9Lodi T. Ferrero I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The data presented here demonstrate that d-LD is a mitochondrial protein anchored to the inner membrane with an Nin-Cout orientation. We present here information on the topogenic signal sequence and energetic requirements necessary for d-LD to achieve this membrane orientation.DISCUSSIONThe sequence information responsible for targetingd-LD to the mitochondria and for sorting into the inner membrane resides entirely in the N-terminal 72-amino acid residues ofd-LD. As shown here this short region contains both a cleavable mitochondrial targeting signal, which is followed by the inner membrane topogenic signal. The topogenic signal apparently serves to arrest the d-LD in the inner membrane during import.Dissection of the topogenic signal revealed it to be a composite one, comprising essential hydrophobic and hydrophilic features. The hydrophobic transmembrane region is essential for sortingd-LD to the inner membrane. Furthermore, our results suggest that the degree of hydrophobicity of this segment is crucial for sorting of d-LD to the inner membrane. If the length (and thereby the hydrophobicity) is increased, d-LD preferentially partitions into the outer membrane in such a manner that further translocation to the inner membrane is prevented. The hydrophobic transmembrane segment is flanked directly on both sides by a positively charged amino acid. These charges appear to play a minor role in the sorting process of d-LD. Deletion of the cluster of charged amino acids located C-terminally of the hydrophobic domain, however, led to a massive missorting of the protein to the matrix. The cluster of charges is therefore one of the two major determinants of the topogenic signal required to attain the Nin-Cout orientation of d-LD, the second one being the transmembrane domain. Deletion of one of these two determinants results in the efficient missorting of the protein into the matrix. The importance of these two features suggests a specific recognition of the topogenic signal which involves both a hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction as well as a hydrophilic-hydrophilic one.Hydrophobic interactions may actually occur at the level of the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM machinery), where the transmembrane segments of Tim17 or Tim23, components of the TIM complex, may display an affinity for hydrophobic segments of incoming preproteins, and thus serve to retard further translocation across the inner membrane (20Gruhler A.

Alternatively, it is feasible that a channel of the translocase may open out to the lipid bilayer and thus the hydrophobic domain of incoming d-LD may preferentially partition into the membrane from the TIM machinery, thus aborting further translocation.Not every hydrophobic topogenic signal, however, functions to arrest preproteins in the inner membrane. Indeed many are imported into the matrix where they serve as re-export signals targeting insertion into the inner membrane (1Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3445-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Herrmann J.M. Koll H. Cook R.A. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hence there must be a second control mechanism to distinguish whether a topogenic signal should be arrested or further translocated. We propose this may constitute the role of the second topogenic signal determinant, the cluster of charged amino acids located at the C-terminal side of the transmembrane segment. The importance of this cluster indicates a degree of protein:protein interaction may also be involved in the mode of operation of the sorting signal. How this cluster of charges functions for the sorting of d-LD remains a matter of speculation. Due to their positioning with respect the transmembrane anchor, these charged residues are probably recognized by (a) proteinaceous factor(s) exposed to the intermembrane space; hydrophilic domains of Tim17 or Tim23, which are exposed to the intermembrane space could conceivably be involved. Alternatively, one could imagine that the cluster of charged amino acids might function to slow down the translocation across the inner membrane and thus serve to enhance the partitioning of the hydrophobic domain into the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane.A similar cluster of charged amino acids are found at the C-terminal side of the transmembrane domain of other inner membrane proteins with an Nin-Cout orientation, such as Sco1p, Sco2p, and CoxVa. The mechanism which d-LD uses to achieve its membrane orientation may therefore be common to these other membrane proteins. The transmembrane domains of all these proteins are relatively short (16–18 amino acids) and are flanked on each side by a positive charge, with the exception of CoxVa which has a negative charged residue at the C-terminal position. The importance of both the short transmembrane segment and of the charged cluster in sorting of these other inner membrane proteins remains to be studied. A similar charged cluster is not found in the sorting signals of other proteins,e.g. cytochrome b2 and cytochrome c1, where a stop-transfer mechanism of sorting is currently being debated, thus supporting the case for an alternative sorting mechanism of these proteins (4van Loon A.P.G.M.

Translocation of the N terminus of d-LD across the inner membrane into the matrix occurs in response to the Δψ and does not require mt-Hsp70 and matrix ATP. Import of the N terminus to the matrix is a rapid process even at lower temperature. The topogenic signal of d-LD appears to function in halting import in the inner membrane. No evidence for the transient passage of part or all of d-LD through the matrix during its sorting to the inner membrane was obtained. As we have demonstrated previously, the presence of a hydrophobic sorting signal in proximity to the N-terminal matrix-targeting signal of a preprotein can secure the translocating polypeptide chain in the import channel in a manner that does not require mt-Hsp70 activity (20Gruhler A. Arnold I. Seytter T. Guiard B. Schwarz E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17410-17415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Completion of translocation of C-terminal elements across the outer membrane thus occurs independently of mt-Hsp70, and in the case of d-LD, appears to be the rate-limiting step for import. Upon import across the outer membrane,d-LD folds to attain a protease-resistant conformation. The kinetics and temperature sensitivity of this folding step paralleled those of import. The folding of translocated domains on the trans side of the outer membrane may be the driving force for the completion of translocation across the membrane.

Here, we report the crystal structures of the H221L 17β-HSD1 mutant complexed to NADP+ and estradiol and the H221L mutant/NAD+ and a H221Q mutant/estradiol complexes. These structures provide a complete picture of the NADP+-enzyme interactions involving the flexible 191–199 loop (well ordered in the H221L mutant) and suggest that the hydrophobic residues Phe192-Met193 could facilitate hydride transfer. 17β-HSD1 appears to be unique among the members of the SDR protein family in that one of the two basic residues involved in the charge compensation of the 2′-phosphate does not belong to the Rossmann-fold motif. The remarkable stabilization of the NADP+ 2′-phosphate by the enzyme also clearly establishes its preference for this cofactor relative to NAD+. Analysis of the catalytic properties of, and estradiol binding to, the two mutants suggests that the His221-steroid O3hydrogen bond plays an important role in substrate specificity.

Thus, preventing the formation of E2 by a specific inhibition of 17β-HSD1 activity should be of paramount importance for cancer therapy. The 17β-HSD1 (Mr = 34,900, 327 residues) is active as a homodimer (8Lin S.X. Yang F. Jin J.Z. Breton R. Zhu D.W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol.

A consensus sequence Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Lys (Tyr155 and Lys159 in 17β-HSD1) as well as a generally conserved serine residue (Ser142 in 17β-HSD1) characterize this protein family.

Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Tyr155, Ser142, and the E2O17 atom form a triangular hydrogen-bonding arrangement that may result in easier deprotonation of the putatively reactive tyrosine. Lys159 participates in the NAD(P)+stabilization by establishing hydrogen bonds with O2′ and O3′ of the nicotinamide ribose. Based on amino acid sequence alignments, 17β-HSD1 was thought to belong to the group of NAD(H)-preferring enzymes (22Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, biochemical studies (7Luu-Thee V. Zhang Y. Poirier D. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and the structure of the 17β-HSD1·E2·NADP+ ternary complex (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) have shown that 17β-HSD1 is able to bind both NAD(H) and NADP(H). 17β-HSD1 appears to be unique among the SDR family because it lacks both the aspartic acid residue at position 36 (Leu36 in 17β-HSD1), characteristic of NAD(H) preferring enzymes, and the basic residue located in the consensus sequence of the dinucleotide binding motif Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Gly (which is replaced by Ser12 in 17β-HSD1). This motif forms an ionic interaction with the ribose 2′-phosphate and is characteristic of NADP(H)-preferring enzymes. His221, first identified by affinity labeling studies (27Murdock G.L.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3322-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was thought to be involved in the specific binding of the steroid. Indeed, the construction of an H221A mutant led to an enzyme displaying a higher Km and lowerVmax relative to the wild type (16Puranen T.J. Poutanen M.H. Peltoketo H.E. Vihko P.T. Vihko R.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the enzyme complexed with E2 (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 26Arezki A. Rehse P.H. Zhu D-W. Campbell R.L. Labrie F. Lin S-X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) revealed that His221 is directly involved in the specific binding of the steroid. Here, we report the construction of H221L and H221Q mutants, their characterization by enzymatic assays, their crystallization, and the determination of the structures of the binary complexes H221Q·E2 and H221L·NAD+ and the ternary complex H221L·NADP+·E2 at 2.7, 3.0, and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. We show for the first time a well ordered conformation for the 191–199 loop and speculate about its role in cofactor binding and hydride transfer. Moreover, the specificity of the enzyme for estrogens is reassessed. Spodoptera frugiperda, purified AcNPV DNA (Autographa Californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus), and transfer vector pVL1393 were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation; Grace's insect cell culture medium, yeastolate, lactalbumin hydrolysate, fetal bovine serum, and restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies Inc.; NAD+, NADP+, estradiol, and estrone were from Sigma; and Blue-Sepharose CL-6B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The TNM-FH medium was prepared from Grace's medium by the addition of 3.3 g/liter yeastolate and 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate. The Sf9 cells were grown as monolayers at 28 °C in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–1 plaque-forming unit to produce virus stocks or at multiplicity of infection >10 for maximal protein expression. Cells were harvested 60 h after infection. The two mutants H221Q and H221L were constructed with one round of polymerase chain reaction made on the pVL/17β-HSD transfer vector previously constructed for 17β-HSD1 overexpression in baculovirus (30Breton R. Yang F. Jin J.-Z. Li B. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 50: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These mutations use two primers. The first one is located on the cDNA, upstream of aPstI unique site (5′-GTAGTAGGGACTGTGCGG-3′). The second one introduces the mutation. For H221Q and H221L, it overlaps the codon to be mutated and a NruI unique site (5′-GCCGCCTCGCGAAAGACTTGCTTGCTTTGGGCGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCCGCCTCGCGAAAGACTTGCTTGCTGAGGGCGAGG-3′, respectively). Amplified fragments and pVL/17β-HSD1 were digested with NruI and PstI. The mutated fragments were then cloned instead of the nonmutated one. Mutations were checked by dideoxynucleotide sequencing, and mutated transfer vectors were cotransfected in Sf9 cells with the wild-type AcNPV virus following the protocol described by Invitrogen. Recombinant viruses were purified by plating. The purification of mutant proteins was performed as described previously for the wild-type protein (30Breton R. Yang F. Jin J.-Z. Li B. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 50: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The only modification concerned the H221L mutant which was purified at pH 7.0 instead of pH 7.5. The activities of the wild-type and the mutated 17β-HSD1s were measured as described by Langer and Engel (31Langer L.J. Engel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 583-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with few modifications. The enzymes were assayed by spectrophotometric measurement of the concentration changes of NADPH at 340 nm. Reactions were run in 50 mmNaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer, pH 9.2, for the oxidation and 50 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer, pH 5.8, for the reduction, both containing 0.5–16 μmsteroid (estradiol or estrone, respectively). In both cases, 10 μl of enzyme preparation (from 55 to 90 μg/ml) were added to 500 μl of buffer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of a 10 mm NADP+ or NADPH solution, and the absorbance variations were measured against a blank containing all components except steroid and coenzyme. Controls containing all components except steroid were also run. Reactions were followed from 30 s to 3 min after addition of NADP+ on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer. For NADP+ reduction measurements, the same protocol was used except that the estradiol concentration was fixed to 25 μm while NADP+ concentrations varied from 0.05 up to 5 mm. Velocities were calculated from the slopes of the zero order portion of the kinetics obtained and were corrected for the control absorbance. The enzymatic activity was calculated as described previously (8Lin S.X. Yang F. Jin J.Z. Breton R. Zhu D.W. Luu-The V. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16182-16187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and defined in units per milliliter (taking a micromole per min as a unit). Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine the Km and the Vmax values. Protein concentrations of enzyme preparations were measured using a micro BCA protein reagent kit from Pierce.

The H221Q mutant was crystallized in conditions similar to those of the wild-type enzyme (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm E2, 2–4% propanediol, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000) (25Breton R.

The H221L mutant was crystallized in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0–6.3, 1 mmNAD(P)+, 100 mm NaCl and 2.2–4.4 mm decyl-β-d-maltoside or 9–18 mm octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside and 2–2.4m ammonium sulfate as precipitant.

Crystals were then flash-cooled under a nitrogen gas stream at −150 °C, transferred into liquid propane at −160 °C, and conserved in solid propane at −196 °C until data collection was carried out at a synchrotron radiation source. A data set of the H221Q mutant was collected at room temperature on the in-house Siemens/Xentronics area detector X1000 system, mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode-x-ray generator. Two data sets of the H221L mutant were collected at low temperature (−150 °C) on the D2AM French-Collaborative Research Group synchrotron beam line at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble), using an XRII-CCD detector (33Moy J.P. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. Sec. A. 1994; 348: 641-644Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Data were processed with XENGEN (34Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Olhendorf D.H.

Data collection statistics are summarized in Table I. For the H221Q mutant, a rigid body refinement with the model of the wild-type 17β-HSD1 was sufficient to place it correctly in the unit cell. The H221L mutant structure was solved by molecular replacement methods with the wild-type 17β-HSD1 as a search model using AMoRe (37Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). Four molecules per asymmetric unit were found. The mutants structures were refined with X-PLOR (Version 3.1) (38Brünger, A.

Two different crystalline complexes were obtained with the H221L mutant: the first one by co-crystallizing the protein with NADP+ and diffusing E2 in the crystal, and the second one by crystallizing the protein in the presence of NAD+. Both complexes crystallize in the monoclinic P21 space group (Table I) with four molecules in the asymmetric unit corresponding to two biologically active dimers (Fig. 1), here named mA/mB and mC/mD, respectively. In the H221L·NADP+·E2 ternary complex, the electron density is very well defined all along the polypeptide chain, including the 191–199 loop that was disordered in the wild-type structure (Fig. 2). The observed conformation for this loop is completely different from that proposed by Ghosh et al. (24Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z. Zhu D.-W. Wawrzak Z. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Labrie F. Lin S.-X. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) but the 190–192 segment conformation is similar to that of residues 184–186 in mouse lung carbonyl reductase (MLCR) (22Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The electron density map is also very well defined for the steroid and cofactor (Fig. 4). As a result, NADP+ and estradiol have been modeled with full occupancies in the four subunits.Figure 3Superposition of the 187–209 loop of the wild-type 17β-HSD1 model (1bhs (24Ghosh D. Pletnev V.Z.

The map, computed with 2.7 Å resolution data, is contoured at the 1 ς level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the H221L·NAD+ binary complex, the electron density for NAD+ and the 191–200 loop is well defined for monomers mA and mC but discontinuous for monomers mD and mB. Consequently, the 191–199 loop was not included in the models of these two monomers. Since this site is known to have Michaelian kinetics, we do not understand the observed difference in NAD+ occupancy. It may be due to subtle packing effects difficult to characterize at this resolution. Both NADP+ and NAD+ bind in the same extended conformation already observed for the wild-type enzyme: the cofactor points toward the active site of the enzyme with the nicotinamide ring in the syn conformation and the adenine in the anti conformation (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The structure of the H221Q·E2 binary complex displays two conformations for Gln221. In one of these, the amide group of the Gln221 forms a hydrogen bond with the steroid O17 atom; whereas in the other, Gln221 is oriented toward the solvent. The double conformation of the Gln221 may be a consequence of the partial occupation of the steroid-binding site, as it was already suggested in the case of the wild-type enzyme (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). No electron density was found for the cofactor. Having a complete model of the cofactor binding site allows for a full description of the NAD(P)+/protein interactions. Some of these interactions are common to NADP+ and NAD+, and most of them were present in the wild-type ternary complex (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, due to the disorder in the neighborhood of the NADP+ binding site in the latter structure, two major interactions were not observed: the extensive hydrophobic contact between the nicotinamide moiety and the Phe192 side chain, and the charge compensation of the dinucleotide 2′-phosphate through salt bridges with Arg37 and Lys195 side chains (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition, the 2′-phosphate is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Ser11 Oγ. In the NAD+·H221L complex, the binding pocket of the ribose 2′-phosphate of monomers mA and mC is occupied by a sulfate ion, presumably coming from the crystallization solution. This ion is bound to the protein·NAD+ complex through a hydrogen bond network involving 2′-OH adenine ribose, Lys195, Arg37, Ser11, and Thr41 side chains. This phenomenon has already been observed in glutathione reductase where an inorganic phosphate ion substitutes for the missing 2′-phosphate group when NAD+ is bound (41Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In both NAD+ and NADP+ complexes, the NH3+ group of Lys195 interacts with the O1A of the pyrophosphate. The 191–199 loop, located between the βF sheet and the αG helix, seems to be predominantly stabilized by its interactions with the dinucleotide, particularly by the salt bridge between Lys195 and the 2′-phosphate. In the H221L·NAD+ complex, where a sulfate ion replaces the 2′-phosphate, the electron density corresponding to the 191–199 loop is less well defined even though the NAD+ site appears to be fully occupied. This implies that although the sulfate ion establishes a series of interactions with both the protein and the cofactor, these are less efficient in stabilizing the 191–199 loop than those formed by the covalently bound 2′-phosphate. Once stabilized, the 191–199 loop appears to protect the coenzyme from solvent as the NADP+ accessible surface (42Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS, Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar) is reduced from 122 Å2 when the loop is removed to 38 Å2when it is well ordered. The E2 molecule and the residues forming the steroid binding site are well superposed in the two wild-type structures (Table III). On the other hand, the rms differences values resulting from the superposition of each mutant onto the wild-type models show a significant deviation for estradiol, relative to the residues involved in the hydrophobic site (Fig. 6). In this respect, the loss of a hydrogen bond between residue 221 and estradiol may be responsible for the increased steroid mobility observed in the H221L mutant. There is also a significant difference in substrate position between two non-equivalent monomers such as mC and mD. The slight substrate reorientation observed in the H221Q mutant is likely to be due to a shift of the hydrogen bond between E2-O3 and Gln221-Nε1.Table IIIEstradiol positional differencesrms on all atoms3-2001The side chain of residues Phe226 and atom CE of Met147 were excluded from the calculations.

Open table in a new tab The catalytic efficiency is strongly affected by mutations at the His221 position (Table IV). Reduction is decreased 10-fold for the H221L mutant and 4-fold for the H221Q mutant (18-fold and 6-fold, respectively, for the oxidation). This may be partially explained by a 4.4-fold increase in the reduction reaction Km for H221L and a respective 2.3-fold increase for the H221Q mutant (4-fold and 3.4-fold, respectively, for the oxidation reaction). As the histidine-to-glutamine mutation preserves the hydrogen bond with C3-OH, this interaction seems to be essential for the catalytic activity. As expected from the structure, the H221L mutation has a limited effect on the cofactor binding site architecture, the Km value for NADP+ reduction being close to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table V). The H221L mutant provides the first image of a well ordered 191–199 loop in a 17β-HSD1 structure. The conformation of this loop in the H221L·E2·NADP+ complex is very likely to be identical to that of the wild-type enzyme when fully complexed to the cofactor. This is supported, on the one hand, by biochemical results that indicate that the affinity of the H221L mutant enzyme for NADP+ is similar to that of the wild-type protein (Table V) and, on the other, by the fact that the 191–199 loop is located at the protein surface, and it is not involved in potentially constraining crystal packing interactions in either structure. The stabilization of the 191–199 loop, that is disordered in the absence of cofactor, is mediated by the interactions of Lys195 and Phe192 with NADP+. Furthermore, loop residues Phe192 and Met193 shield NADP+ from solvent and contribute to the hydrophobic character of the nicotinamide binding pocket. Other dehydrogenases also have a similarly flexible loop near their dinucleotide binding site. One example is the mobile loop comprising residues 16–20 in Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase which is involved in hydride transfer (43Li L. Falzone C.J. Wright P.E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7826-7833Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This loop, which becomes well ordered only in the enzyme·NADP+·folate complex, has been found to shield the nicotinamide moiety from solvent and to participate on the transition-state stabilization (44Bystroff C. Oatley S.J. Kraut J. Biochemisty. 1990; 29: 3263-3277Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Replacement of the Met16-Ala19 stretch by glycine results in a 550-fold decrease in the hydride transfer rate. Another case is lactate dehydrogenase. As in 17β-HSD1, a loop comprising residues 97–123 is stabilized by interactions with NADH and shields the cofactor from solvent (45Abad-Zapatero C. Griffith J.P. Sussman J.L. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 445-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the SDR family, E. coli 7α-HSD (23Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) exhibits a large conformational change of the 195–210 loop upon substrate binding that also results in shielding of the catalytic site. In the 3α,20β-HSD structure (19Ghosh D. Erman M. Wawrzak C.M. Duax W.L. Pangborn W. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a small conformational change of the 184–189 loop located close to the active site is also observed. In the MLCR·NADP+ complex (22Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the Met186 interaction with the nicotinamide moiety is similar to the one observed between Phe192 and the NADP+ in 17β-HSD1 (Fig. 3). However, it is not known whether the 184–190 loop has the same conformation in the MLCR apoenzyme. All the SDR loops described above are located between the βF sheet and the αG helix and are flanked by two proline residues (Pro187 and Pro200 in 17β-HSD1). As it was previously suggested by Tanaka et al. (23Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7715-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), these two prolines may prevent conformational changes from propagating to the rest of the protein. An amino acid sequence alignment of SDR enzymes reveals that a proline residue located at position 185 (17β-HSD1 numbering) is highly conserved, except for 17β-HSD1, where this residue is found at position 187 (Fig.7). Furthermore, a hydrophobic residue, equivalent to Phe192 of 17β-HSD1, is found in 38 out of the 46 amino acid sequences analyzed (Fig. 7). These loops, that are stabilized by both substrate or cofactor, may be characteristic of enzymes belonging to the SDR family. In turn, their protection of the nicotinamide moiety and contribution of hydrophobic residues to the active site structure suggest they are involved in catalytic hydride transfer. As indicated by the different x-ray complex structures, and by previous biochemical results (7Luu-Thee V. Zhang Y. Poirier D. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), 17β-HSD1 is able to bind both NADP+ and NAD+ cofactors. The 17β-HSD1·NADP+ complex has been shown to be stabilized through hydrogen bonds established between the dinucleotide 2′-phosphate moiety and the main chain NHs of residues Cys10, Ser11, and Arg37 (25Breton R. Housset D. Mazza C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In most known structures of NADP+-preferring enzymes, the two negative charges of the 2′-phosphate group are compensated by one or two positively charged residues. Due to disorder of the 191–199 loop, these interactions were not observed in our NADP+/wild-type 17β-HSD1 complex structure. Now, the H221L mutant structure with its well defined 191–199 loop, allows us to definitely classify 17β-HSD1 among the NADP+-preferring enzymes. Three residues, Ser11, Arg37, and Lys195, interact with the dinucleotide 2′-phosphate group of the cofactor (Fig. 5). Arg37 forms a salt bridge that compensates one of the two negative charges of the phosphate. Incidentally, this residue, as Arg39, is also present in the MLCR·NADP+complex (22Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Nakanishi M. Deyashiki Y. Hara A. Mitsui Y. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In both structures, it is located in the turn between the β-sheet B and the α-helix C of the βA-αB-βB-αC-βC-αD-βD motif that forms the Rossmann fold (Figs. 1 and 7). This arginine is conserved in 26 of the 46 proteins known to be NADP+-preferring enzymes (46Bairoch A. Boeckmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3093-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). A second basic residue, located in the 4th position of the Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-Xaa-Gly consensus sequence of the dinucleotide binding motif, often further compensates the 2′-phosphate charge. Indeed, sequence alignment studies reveal that this residue is conserved in 54% of the NADP+-preferring SDR proteins (Fig. 7). In 17β-HSD1, there is no basic residue in the 4th position. Instead, the 2′-phosphate group interacts with Ser11, which is located in the third position of the consensus sequence. In fact, among the 21 NADP+-preferring enzymes of the SDR family that do not have a basic residue at this position, 15 are found to have either serine or threonine instead (Fig. 7). In 17β-HSD1, further charge compensation of the 2′-phosphate group is afforded by Lys195. This residue is not conserved in the SDR family of amino acid sequences, and superposition of the known SDR structures shows that it is located in a variable loop. Moreover, in most of the NADP+·enzyme complex structures having a Rossmann-fold binding motif (47Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), the 2′-phosphate group interacts with one to three residues located in either the βAαB or the βBαC turn (Fig. 1). Thus 17β-HSD1 is the first SDR structure for which such an atypical charge compensation is observed. This may be relevant to the understanding of the evolution of the NADP(H) binding motif. In the wild-type structure, His221 was found to hydrogen bond to the C3-OH of the estradiol moiety. This hydrogen bond is preserved in the H221Q mutant. In the H221L mutant, however, the mutated leucine residue can only participate in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket of the steroid binding site. Consequently, it can be concluded that this hydrogen bond is not essential to substrate binding. However, comparison of all the available x-ray structures shows that, as a function of the immediate environment, estradiol can occupy slightly different positions in its hydrophobic pocket and that the largest differences concern its C and D rings (Fig. 6). The lack of hydrogen bond formation in the H221L mutant reduces the catalytic efficiency by 9 to 18-fold. This can be compared with a 4- to 5-fold reduction in the H221Q mutant (Table IV). Taken together, these results suggest that the hydrogen bond between His221 and the C3-OH group is important for enzyme specificity because it helps in establishing the catalytically relevant steroid/protein interactions of O17, Tyr155 Oη, and Ser142 Oγ. These observations may explain the specificity of 17β-HSD1 for aromatic A ring-containing substrates. With substrates like testosterone or 4-androstenedione, the orientation of the C3–O3 bond relative to the C17–O17 bond is different. Accordingly, we suggest that for these substrates, the interaction of His221 with the O3 atom would place the O17 in a position which is unfavorable for catalysis. We thank J.-L. Ferrer and M. Roth (IBS, Grenoble) for help using the D2AM ESRF beam line."

M. and Parsons, J. T. (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 3169–3178). We examined the expression and regulation of Graf as a prelude to understanding the role of Graf in mediating signal transductionin vivo. We demonstrated that Graf is a ubiquitously expressed 95-kDa protein with high levels observed in heart and brain and cells derived from these tissues. Stimulation of PC12 cells with epidermal growth factor or nerve growth factor induced a phosphatase-reversible mobility shift upon gel electrophoresis, indicative of phosphorylation. In vitro, purified mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase catalyzed the phosphorylation of Graf on serine 510, suggesting that Graf phosphorylation may be mediated through MAP kinase signaling. In addition, the mutation of serine 510 to alanine inhibited the epidermal growth factor-induced mobility shift of mutant Graf protein in vivo, consistent with serine 510 being the site of in vivo phosphorylation. Based on these data we suggest that phosphorylation of Graf by MAP kinase or related kinases may be a mechanism by which growth factor signaling modulates Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes in PC12 and perhaps other cells.

These proteins are 30% identical to Ras and 55% identical to each other. The Rho family members have been linked to a variety of cellular effects, including changes in cytoskeletal dynamics (actin polymerization and reorganization), gene expression (p38/Jun NH2-terminal kinase and serum response factor activity), cleavage furrow formation, G1 cell cycle progression, endocytosis, exocytosis, and superoxide production (2Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Regulation of the cytoskeleton by Rho family members seems to be dependent on a cascade of events within the actinomyosin system (2Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In response to a variety of stimuli (including bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1) cells send out exploratory filopodia, a process regulated by Cdc42. Activation of Rac (by Cdc42-mediated signaling or in response to stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor, EGF, bombeson, or insulin) results in extensions of broad sheet-like lamellipodia. Finally, activation of Rho (by Rac-mediated signaling or by stimulation with bombesin or lysophosphatidic acid) results in the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (3Ridley A.J.

Each of these structures is formed by the ordered polymerization of F-actin and presumably serve to mediate specialized cellular functions, such as endocytosis, cell migration, and cell division (9Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Like all smw G proteins, Rho family members exist in an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. The rate of conversion between the GDP-bound form and GTP bound form is modulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which inhibit GDP dissociation, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which stimulate the replacement of GDP by GTP, and by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which stimulate the rate of intrinsic GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase (10Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). To date, at least seven mammalian GEFs and 10 mammalian GAPs have been identified for the Rho GTPase family (11Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Horii Y.

Quilliam L.A. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) The existence of multiple GAP proteins suggests that these proteins may act on different subcellular pools of Rho proteins or may have different effector-functions upon association with Rho proteins. Although GAP proteins down-regulate the signal input by rapidly converting the G protein to its inactive GDP bound state, certain GAP proteins, including p120Ras GAP, n-chimaerin, and phospholipase C (a GAP for heterotrimeric G proteins) simultaneously send a signal that is required for downstream signaling from the G protein (15McCormick F. Cell. 1989; 56: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 16Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Paulssen R.H. Woodson J. Liu Z. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26622-26629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For example, microinjection of the Rac GAP, n-chimaerin, (like activated Rac) induces the formation of lamellipodia, an effect that is dependent on Rac, but not dependent on the GAP activity of n-chimaerin (16Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Apparently, the binding of n-chimaerin to activated Rac enhances a functional interaction between n-chimaerin and other unknown protein(s) to regulate cellular morphology. It is currently unclear how the Rho cascade is activated and how the signal progresses from one smw G protein to another. It is possible that one smw G protein may alter the GEF or GAP activity toward another smw G protein to modify signal transduction. Indeed, in yeast, Cdc24 directly links the smw G protein Bud1 and Cdc42 by being a binding target for Bud 1 and a GEF for Cdc42 (8Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells a putative Rac effector, Ost, is a GEF for Cdc42 and Rac (13Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Also, RasGAP associates with p190RhoGAP, suggesting a possible interplay between these two G protein activators (18Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GEFs or GAPs may be directly regulated by external stimuli resulting in altered activity or subcellular localization. For example, the activity of the Ras GEF Cdc25Mm is stimulated by muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphorylation in vivo (19Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Also, the in vitroactivity of the Rac GAP n-chimaerin is stimulated by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid and inhibited by phospholipids such as lysophosphatidic acid (20Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory identified Graf, a GAP forRho associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) following screening a chicken embryo λgt11 expression library with a radiolabeled carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK (21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This protein contains a centrally located GAP domain followed by a serine/proline-rich domain and a carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain. The Graf SH3 domain was shown to specifically bind to a proline-rich region in the COOH terminus of FAK. In vitro analysis revealed that the Graf GAP domain enhanced GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42 and RhoA but not Rac or Ras. The experiments presented herein examine the expression and regulation of Graf as a prelude to understanding the role of Graf in mediating signal transduction in vivo. We demonstrate that Graf is ubiquitously expressed with high levels observed in heart and brain. Somewhat suprisingly, Graf phosphorylation is mediated by EGF/NGF signaling through MEK/MAP kinase. In vitro, purified MAP kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of Graf on Ser510, a residue within the serine/proline-rich domain. The mutation of Ser510 to Ala inhibits EGF-induced phosphorylation of mutant Graf protein in vivo. Phosphorylation of Ser510 causes a slower mobility of Graf upon SDS-PAGE, suggestive of a conformational change in Graf. Together, these data indicate that Graf may be a site of convergence of growth factor signaling with Rho-mediated cytoskeletal changes. Cardiomyocytes from adult chicken ventricles were isolated by collagenase digestion using a Langendorf perfusion apparatus as described previously (22Shlafer M. Kane P.F. Kirsh M.M. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1982; 83: 830-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed immediately for immunoprecipitation or plated on laminin-coated glass coverslips and maintained in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for immunocytochemistry. PC12 cells (obtained from ATCC) were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, and a 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cDNA construct encoding the NH2-terminal Flag-tagged variant of Graf (F-Graf; amino acid residues 1–584) was generated by PCR using primers that generated 5′ HindIII and 3′ XhoI restriction sites. The resultant PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and ligated with HindIII and XhoI digested pcDNA3 DNA containing sequences encoding a 7 amino acid NH2-terminal epitope tag with the sequence, DYKDDDK. Mutations in Graf, Ser496 to Ala, Ser499 to Ala, and Ser510 to Ala were generated in F-Graf using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quick Change, Stratagene). PCR-generated Graf cDNA sequences encoding amino acid residues 171–404 (GST-GrafGAP) and 471–584 (GST-GrafSH3) were cloned into pGex3X as described previously (21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). FAK cDNA sequences that encode amino acid residues 686–1053 (CT and CT-P878A with a Pro to Ala mutation) were cloned into pGEX2TK as described previously (21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A fusion protein containing both the Graf GAP and SH3 domain (GST-GrafGAPSH, amino acid residues 171–584) was generated by PCR amplification using primers that generated 5′ BclI and 3′XhoI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with BclI and XhoI and ligated with pGex4T2 DNA digested with BamHI and XhoI. For antigen production, the GrafSH3 and GrafGAP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and the fusion proteins purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione (in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.12 m NaCl), and dialyzed against PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.15m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to GST-GrafGAP (αGGAP) and GST-GrafSH3 (αGSH3) were generated in New Zealand White female rabbits. The serum was affinity-purified using purified antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was isolated from chicken or rat tissues by phenol chloroform extraction using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), and mRNA was selected using oligo(dT)-Sepharose chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). RNA was resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and Northern blots containing chicken RNA were probed with a 1.5-kb Graf cDNA probe (nucleotides 285–1804). The mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (2 μg of poly(A+) RNA per lane, CLONTECH) and the rat Northern blot (containing 20 μg of total RNA) were probed with a32P-labeled 0.9-kb mouse cDNA probe (corresponding to nucleotides 498–1400 of the chicken Graf sequence). The probes were labeled, hybridized, and the Northern blots washed as described previously (21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 24Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.91-4.98Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing the blots to Kodak XAR film for 24–48 h. Tissue samples or cultured cells were lysed by homogenization in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Hepes, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.2) containing 1 mmNa3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2 pyrophosphate. Graf was immunoprecipitated by incubation of 1–2 mg of cell extract with the polyclonal antibody, αGGAP (5 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose-conjugated beads (Pharmacia). The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and once with TBS (0.2m NaCl and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), boiled in sample buffer and the proteins resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins wre transferred to nitrocellulose, and a Western blot was performed using the polyclonal antibody αGSH3 at a 1/500 dilution. Blots were then incubated with HRP-conjugated Protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1/1000 dilution, followed by visualization by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro GST binding experiments, 5 μg of GST, GST-CT, or GST-CT-P878A were added to 1–2 mg of cell or tissue extract in modified RIPA buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. GST fusion protein complexes were collected on glutathione-agarose beads, the beads were washed, and Graf was detected by immunoblotting as described above. For expression of Graf in HEK 293 cells, F-Graf cDNA was combined with the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and incubated with cells according to the manufacturers protocol. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 24–48 h prior to lysis in sample buffer (for direct blotting) or modified RIPA buffer (for immunoprecipitation). Transfected proteins were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using the epitope tag specific mAb M5 (which recognizes the peptide DYKDDDK; Eastman Kodak Co.). MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated by incubation of PC12 cell extract (100 μg) with the p42MAPK-specific mAb (1B3B9; gift from Dr. Michael Weber) as described above. The immune complexes were resuspended in MAP kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, and 50 μm unlabeled ATP) containing myelin basic protein (2 μg) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant wild-type p42MAPK was purified to apparent homogeneity as described previously (26Catling A.D. Reuter C.W.M. Cox M.E. Parsons S.J. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30014-30021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of GST or GST-Graf fusion proteins (approximately 2–6 μg) were incubated with purified MAP kinase (10 ng) and [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) in MAP kinase reaction buffer. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer resolved by 14% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. GST-Graf fusion proteins (phosphorylated by MAP kinase as described above) were digested with chymotrypsin as described previously (27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were spotted onto thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates, resolved by high-voltage electrophoresis (40 min at 1,000 V in pH 8.9 buffer containing 0.295 m amonium bicarbonate), followed by chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer (27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Positions of phosphorylated peptides were determined by autoradiography. Individual phosphopeptides were isolated by aspiration onto a polyethylene disk (Omnifit) followed by elution in pH 1.9 buffer (27Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled phosphochymotryptic peptides were applied to Sequelon arylamine membrane (Milligen), dried, coupled, and washed as described previously (28Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Mark J. Aebersold R. Koster H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound peptide was placed into an Applied Biosystems 470A sequencer and cycled as described previously (29Aebersold R. Pipes G.D. Wettenhall R.E.H. Nika H. Hood L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The products of each cleavage reaction were collected, and 32P was detected by Cerenkov counting. Northern blot analysis using a chicken-Graf cDNA probe revealed a 5.0-kb Graf RNA in chicken brain and liver, consistent with previously published data (Fig. 1 A; Ref.21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, Northern analysis using a mouse Graf cDNA probe directed to the SH3 domain revealed a major 8.5-kb RNA species in most rodent tissues (Fig. 1 B). The 8.5-kb transcript was most abundant in mouse heart and brain with lower levels expressed in kidney. Several smaller transcripts were observed in other mouse tissues, including a ubiquitous RNA species of approximately 4.5 kb and more restricted expression of RNAs of approximately 7, 2.5, and 2 kb. Similar results were observed when the blot was hybridized with a mouse Graf GAP domain cDNA probe (data not shown). As observed in Fig. 1, the major RNA species expressed in chicken co-migrates with a RNA expressed in rat (A) and may thus correspond to the 4.5-kb RNA species observed in the mouse Northern blot (B). Further evidence for alternative RNA processing arises from the identification of a variant of Graf (which contains sequences encoding a unique NH2-terminal domain) in a chicken brain cDNA library. 2J. M. Taylor and J. T. Parsons, unpublished observation. A cDNA probe complementary to this alternative NH2-terminal sequence specifically hybridized with a transcript of approximately 2 kb, which was highly expressed in liver relative to brain, indicating that at least the 2-kb RNA species in liver may arise by alternative splicing. RNA from several cells lines was analyzed by Northern analysis, including RNA from REF52 (rat embryo fibroblasts), chicken embryo fibroblasts, Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, rat vascular smooth muscle cells, bovine endothelial cells, and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. Of these, only PC12 cells expressed detectable levels of Graf RNA (data not shown). These results indicate that Graf transcription is broadly detectable in tissues with highest levels in brain and heart, but that its expression in tissue cultured cell lines is quite restricted. Two polyclonal antibodies were used to determine the expression patterns and size of endogenous Graf protein in various tissues. The antibodies were generated against GST fusion proteins to the GAP domain (αGGAP) and the SH3 domain (αGSH3) of Graf. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with αGGAP and αGSH3, respectively, revealed an immunoreactive band of approximately 95 kDa in both chicken and rat tissues with high levels detected in brain and heart in agreement with the levels of transcripts detected in the Northern blot analysis (Fig.2, A and C). Significant levels of Graf protein were also observed in lung, liver, and testis. We previously determined that ectopically expressed Graf bound to a FAK COOH-terminal GST fusion protein (CT), but did not bind the FAK COOH-terminal fusion protein containing a P878A mutation (CT-P878A). Fig. 2 B shows that the 95-kDa immunoreactive band also binds efficiently to CT, but not to CT-P878A, consistent with this 95-kDa protein being endogenous Graf. A higher migrating band (approximately 190 kDa) was also observed in the rat brain lysate (Fig.2 C). The significance of this form is not known, but it appears not to be expressed in chicken brain (Fig. 2 A). Since whole heart extracts contain high levels of Graf protein, we isolated cardiomyocytes to determine whether the expression in heart is due to the presence of Graf in these contractile cells. Both immunonocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation revealed the expression of Graf in isolated cardiomyocytes. Endogenous Graf in cardiomyocytes was localized in punctate structures along the actin stress fibers (data not shown), similar to the localization observed when Graf was ectopically expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts (21Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that Graf, immunoprecipitated from freshly isolated cardiomyocytes, exhibited a retarded mobility on SDS-PAGE compared with Graf immunoprecipitated from whole heart extracts (Fig. 3 A). The mobility shift was reversed by treatment of Graf cardiomyocyte immunoprecipitates with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that Graf is phosphorylated in isolated cardiomyocytes and that phosphorylation appears to induce a change in mobility on SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, when Graf was immunoprecipitated from PC12 cells, it co-migrated with the major (presumably nonphosphorylated) form of Graf from whole heart extracts. However, treatment of PC12 cells with either EGF (100 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 min induced in a change in mobility of Graf, consistent with EGF- or NGF-induced phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). In some experiments two slower migrating forms of Graf were detected after EGF stimulation or upon isolation of cardiomyocytes. We found that Graf phosphorylation after treatment with EGF and NGF was not on tyrosine residues as determined by the lack of anti-Tyr(P) immunoreactivity (data not shown). These data indicate that Graf is phosphorylated on serine and/or threonine and that phosphorylation is regulated in PC12 cells. These data further indicate that the slower mobility of Graf observed in freshly isolated cardiomyocytes may be due to phosphorylation which was induced during the isolation procedure. Upon analysis of the time course of EGF and NGF-stimulated band shift of Graf, we observed a more rapid phosphorylation of Graf with EGF than NGF treatment. Thus, the temporal order of Graf phosphorylation was reminiscent of the temporal activation of MAP kinase by these agents in PC12 cells (30Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 31Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Weber M.J. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a correlation between the time course of MAP kinase activation and Graf phosphorylation (both measured by the mobility shift on SDS-PAGE) after stimulation of PC12 cells with EGF and NGF. A complete mobility shift of MAP kinase was observed 4 min after EGF treatment and 8 min after NGF treatment (A). The mobility shift of Graf lagged slightly behind, with a nearly complete shift observed 8 min after EGF treatment and 20 min after NGF treatment. The duration of the MAP kinase band shift was prolonged with NGF compared with EGF treatment (A). Similarly, the Graf mobility shift remained complete 45 min after NGF treatment, but was reduced 45 min after EGF treatment. These data indicate the possibility that EGF/NGF-induced Graf phosphorylation is mediated by signaling though MEK/MAP kinase. The MEK inhibitor PD098059 was used to determine whether the MAP kinase pathway was involved in Graf phosphorylation. Fig.5 shows that pretreatment of PC12 cells with PD098059 blocked the ability of EGF to induce the mobility shift of Graf (A) and inhibited the activation of MAP kinase as measured by MAP kinase mediated MBP phosphorylation (B). Thus the inhibition of MAP kinase activity correlated with the inhibition of Graf phosphorylation as measured by mobility shift. The amino acid sequence of Graf predicts four consensus sites for MAP kinase phosphorylation, Pro-X-Ser/Thr-Pro, each located within the serine/proline-rich region (Fig.6 A). To determine whether MAP kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of Graf directly, a GST fusion protein (GAPSH; Fig. 6 A) containing the four phosphorylation consensus sites was incubated with purified MAP kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 6 B shows that GAPSH was efficiently phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro. A fusion protein containing the three COOH-terminal consensus sites (SH3; Fig.6 A) was also phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro. In contrast, neither GST alone nor a Graf fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal most consensus site (GAP; Fig.6 A) was phosphorylated by MAP kinase. Based on these observations, we mutated each of the serines within the three COOH-terminal MAP kinase consensus sites (Ser496, Ser499, and Ser510) to alanine to determine which if any of these sites was phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro. Purified GAPSH with either the S496A or S499A mutation was phosphorylated by MAP kinase to the same extent as wild-type GAPSH. In addition, each of these mutant proteins exhibited the same pattern of phosphochymotryptic peptides as wild-type GAPSH (data not shown). In contrast, the ability of MAP kinase to phosphorylate GAPSH with the point mutation S510A was dramatically reduced (Fig.7 A). Mutation of Ser510 to Ala consistently resulted in a reduced yield of full-length GST fusion protein when expressed in E. coli.However, addition of three times more mutant protein resulted in equal quantities of full-length GAPSH and S510A fusion proteins (as observed by Coomassie stain, Fig. 7 A, left). Under these conditions, wild-type protein (GAPSH) was phosphorylated by MAP kinase, whereas the full-length mutant protein (S510A) was not. However a smaller product (presumably a breakdown product of S510A) was phosphorylated albeit at approximately 25% of control level. The inability of the full-length S510A fusion protein to be phosphorylated by MAP kinase strongly suggests that Ser510 is a target for MAP kinase. To confirm these data, the phosphorylated GAPSH and mutant fusion proteins were subjected to phosphopeptide mapping. Chymotrypsin digestion of the wild-type GAPSH fusion protein followi"
https://openalex.org/W2018093727,"Of the several strategies that eukaryotes have evolved to modulate transcription factor activity, phosphorylation is regarded as one of the major mechanisms in signal-dependent transcriptional control. To conclusively demonstrate that the human sex-determining gene SRY is affected by such a post-translational control mechanism, we have analyzed its phosphorylation status in living cells. In the present study, we show that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylates the human SRY protein in vitro as well as in vivo on serine residues located in the N-terminal part of the protein. This phosphorylation event was shown to positively regulate SRY DNA-binding activity and to enhance the ability of SRY to inhibit a basal promoter activity located downstream of an SRY DNA-binding site concatamer. Together these results strongly support the hypothesis that human SRY is a natural substrate for PKA in vivo and that this phosphorylation significantly modulates its major activity, DNA-binding, thereby possibly altering its biological function."

Insulin decreases the rate of GLUT4 endocytosis in addition to increasing its exocytosis. Endocytosis of the transporter is thought to occur at least in part via the clathrin-mediated endocytic system. The protein dynamin is involved in the final stages of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Here we show that the dynamin II isoform is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is present in isolated plasma membrane and low density microsomal fractions. Insulin reduced the levels of dynamin II associated with the plasma membrane by about half, raising the possibility that the hormone may reduce GLUT4 endocytosis by removing dynamin from the cell surface. A fusion protein containing the amphiphysin SH3 domain selectively bound dynamin II from 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lysates. Microinjection of the fusion protein into these cells inhibited transferrin endocytosis and increased the levels of GLUT4 at the cell surface. GlutathioneS-transferase alone, the SH3 domains of spectrin and Crk, and a mutated amphiphysin SH3 domain unable to bind dynamin II did not affect GLUT4 distribution. However, a peptide containing the dynamin II sequence that binds amphiphysin increased the surface presence of GLUT4. Moreover, in cells first treated with insulin to externalize GLUT4, the dynamin peptide, but not an unrelated control peptide, inhibited GLUT4 internalization upon insulin removal. These results suggest that interactions of dynamin II with amphiphysin may play an important role in GLUT4 endocytosis. We hypothesize that insulin may reduce GLUT4 endocytosis by regulating the function of dynamin II at the cell surface, as part of the mechanism to increase glucose uptake.

We hypothesize that insulin may reduce GLUT4 endocytosis by regulating the function of dynamin II at the cell surface, as part of the mechanism to increase glucose uptake. The GLUT4 glucose transporter is the major insulin-responsive transporter of muscle and fat tissues. In the basal state, it is largely sequestered in an intracellular compartment(s); however, several studies have shown that the transporter constitutively recycles between the cell surface and the intracellular loci (1Jhun B.H.

GLUT4 has been localized to clathrin-coated regions by immunocytochemistry of plasma membrane lawns (4Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and by immunoblotting of isolated clathrin-coated vesicles (5Chakrabarti R. Buxton J. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7926-7933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, lowering the intracellular K+ concentration, which disassembles clathrin lattices and prevents their reassembly, causes an accumulation of GLUT4 at the cell surface, presumably as a result of inhibiting the endocytic arm of its continuous recycling (6Nishimura H. Zarnowski M.J. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within its N-terminal domain, GLUT4 contains a putative internalization motif (FQQI) that is similar to the internalization consensus sequence YXXΦ (where X represents any amino acid and Φ represents bulky hydrophobic residues) present in numerous recycling proteins (7Marks M.S. Ohno H. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). GLUT4 also contains a dileucine motif near its C terminus. Both motifs have been shown to contribute to the internalization of GLUT4 (8Garippa R.J. Judge T.W. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J.

In addition to increasing the rate of exocytosis of transporters, insulin also increases GLUT4 surface levels by reducing their endocytosis. Using an impermeant photoactivable glucose analog, it was observed that insulin lowered the rate of internalization of GLUT4 in rat adipocytes by 2.8-fold (1Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar conclusion was reached when the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface was measured by taking advantage of its exofacial trypsin-sensitive site in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (17Czech M.P. Buxton J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9187-9190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin reduced the amount of GLUT4 associated with plasma membrane-derived clathrin-coated vesicles in the same cells (4Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J.

The final event in the formation of the clathrin vesicles at the plasma membrane is the periplasmic fusion at the neck of the newly formed pit.

One of the proteins that binds with great specificity to the proline-rich region of dynamin is amphiphysin (27David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we have investigated the effect of disrupting SH3-mediated interactions of dynamin on the steady-state distribution of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by microinjecting the SH3 domain of amphiphysin or a peptide of dynamin containing the amphiphysin-binding region.

Four to six days after differentiation, cultures were deprived of serum for 2 h and stimulated with 100 nminsulin for 20 min at 37 °C, as indicated in the figure legends. Total membranes and subcellular fractions (PM, LDM, HDM, and cytosol) from control and insulin-stimulated cells were prepared as described previously (31Volchuk A. Wang Q. Ewart H.S. Liu Z. He L.

A fusion protein comprising the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 linked to GST (construct V (residues 545–695), here called GST-AmphiSH3) was generated as described previously (27David C. McPherson P.S.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A fusion protein expressing two mutations (G684R and P687L) in the amphiphysin 1 SH3 domain (GST-AmphiSH3m) was generated as described (30Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Two GST fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of spectrin and Crk were generous gifts from Dr. A. Pawson (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto) (23Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P.

A 15-oligomer peptide (PPPQVPSRPNRAPPG) representing amino acids 828–842 of dynamin Iaa containing the amphiphysin SH3 domain-binding site was synthesized (30Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This sequence is highly conserved in dynamin II, which has recently been shown to interact with amphiphysin (28Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A 19-oligomer peptide (CVRRASEPGNRKGRLGNEK) (generous gift from Dr. S. Grinstein, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto) was used as an unrelated control peptide. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed twice in PBS and lysed with 1.2 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm dish (lysis buffer = 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin A, pH 7.4). Cells were placed on a shaker at 4 °C for 30 min, scraped, passed 10 times through a 25-gauge syringe, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (lysate) was removed, and the protein concentration was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Forty micrograms of GST, GST-AmphiSH3, or GST-AmphiSH3m were linked to glutathione-agarose beads by incubation at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle tumbling, followed by three washes with lysis buffer. To the beads was added 1 mg of adipocyte lysate, and incubation was continued with tumbling for 3 h at 4 °C. In competition experiments, the dynamin peptide was added together with the lysate at a final concentration of 300 μm. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and bound material was eluted with 25 μl of 2× concentrated sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis. 3T3-L1 cells were grown and differentiated on 25-mm diameter coverslips placed in 6-well dishes. Coverslips were placed in coverslip chambers (Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) containing 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (R 4130 Sigma) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 4% fetal bovine serum. A region of ∼1 mm2 on the bottom of the coverslip was marked for subsequent microinjection on the stage of a Nikon fluorescence microscope resting on a Newport BenchTop vibration isolation system fitted with an Eppendorf microinjection unit (Micromanipulator 5171 and Transjector 5246). Borosilicate microinjection pipettes (World Precision Instruments, Inc.) were pulled using a Sutter Instrument Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Model p-97). The majority (∼90%) of the cells in the marked area (typically 100–150 cells) were microinjected with a solution containing 2.0 mg/ml GST, GST-AmphiSH3, GST-AmphiSH3m, GST-spectrinSH3, or GST-CrkSH3, plus rhodamine-dextran (1.1 mg/ml) in microinjection buffer (110 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.2, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mm EDTA). The molar concentrations of these proteins in the microinjection solution were 75, 42, 41, 61, and 61 μm, respectively. When the dynamin peptide or the unrelated peptide was microinjected, the concentration of the peptide in this buffer was 17 mm. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by a 2-h incubation in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium alone. Cells in the injected and non-injected areas of the same coverslip were photographed 1.5 h after microinjection with phase-contrast and fluorescence optics under a 40× objective. Plasma membrane lawns (sheets) were prepared by a modification of the procedure of Robinson et al. (4Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Following the various treatments, cells were placed on ice and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Hypotonic swelling buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mmHEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) was added in three quick rinses. Five milliliters of breaking buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.5) were added, and the solution was aspirated up and down using a 1.0-ml pipettor to promote cell breakage. The adhered plasma membrane lawns were washed three times in breaking buffer and incubated with cold 3% paraformaldehyde in breaking buffer for 10 min on ice. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS, and excess fixative was quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl/PBS for 5 min, followed by three washes with PBS at room temperature. The lawns were subsequently blocked by a 1-h incubation in 5% goat serum in PBS at room temperature. Labeling with rabbit anti-GLUT4 antiserum (1:150) for 30 min at room temperature ensued, followed by three washes with PBS and labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (1:50) for 30 min. Immunolabeled lawns were rinsed four times with PBS and mounted with ProLong Antifade mounting solution (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Confocal images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a 63× objective. All images were collected under identical gain settings established in preliminary experiments. Confocal images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software for figure production or used to quantitate fluorescence intensity using NIH Imaging software. For quantitation, the fluorescence/unit area of each lawn was measured in two to four fields of microinjected and non-injected cells (each field contained 8–15 lawns). The results were collected in arbitrary units, and the S.E. for each experimental condition was calculated. Because each experimental condition had its own control (basal non-injected cells), once the S.E. values were calculated for the fluorescence intensity/unit area, the results were normalized to that control. Statistical analysis was by analysis of variance. Monolayers of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes on glass coverslips were microinjected with GST-AmphiSH3 or GST-AmphiSH3m as described above, except that detection of injection was achieved by co-injection of lucifer yellow (0.5 mg/ml). Following microinjection, cells were serum-deprived for 1 h and then exposed to 0.25 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled transferrin for 1 h at 37 °C (18Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 36Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Control experiments were performed at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 1 h, and mounted as described above. Confocal images were obtained as above using a 63× objective. Three mammalian dynamin genes have been cloned, each with several alternatively spliced forms (37Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607PubMed Google Scholar, 38Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Dynamin I is expressed exclusively in brain (39Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.-P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar); dynamin III is present abundantly in testis, with lower amounts present in brain and lung (40Nakata T. Takemura R. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cook T. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); and dynamin II was found to varying degrees in all tissues tested (42Sontag J.-M. Fykse E.M. Ushkaryov Y. Liu J.-P.

A. 1994; 91: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Dynamin I could not be detected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an isoform-specific antibody (data not shown). Using an antibody specific to dynamin II, we examined whether this protein is present in these cells. In Fig.1 A, the content of dynamin II is compared in total membranes from undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The protein was readily detected at both stages of differentiation to comparable extents. By comparison, relatively little dynamin II was detected in total brain microsomes. Dynamin II localization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was further analyzed by subcellular fractionation. Fig. 1 B shows the presence of different proteins in subcellular fractions isolated from unstimulated (basal) and insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Clathrin was found largely in the cytosol and to varying degrees in the membrane fractions. Its distribution was not affected by insulin stimulation. As expected, the cell-surface marker α1-Na/K-ATPase was found almost exclusively in the PM, and its distribution was also not affected by insulin stimulation. Dynamin II was detected in all membrane fractions, but was scarce in the cytosol. The concentration of dynamin II/unit protein was similar in the PM, LDM, and HDM fractions from unstimulated cells. Interestingly, insulin stimulation resulted in a decrease in dynamin II content in the PM of 44 ± 10% (n = 4), with small gains in both the LDM and HDM. In contrast, and confirming previous reports, the GLUT4 glucose transporter was most abundant in the LDM fraction in unstimulated cells, and its concentration dropped in this fraction and increased in the PM as a result of insulin stimulation. To assess whether dynamin plays a role in GLUT4 traffic, we attempted to interfere with its action by using the fusion protein GST-AmphiSH3, a construct that was recently shown to block synaptic vesicle endocytosis in lamprey axons (30Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To this effect, it was important to establish that this fusion protein, which encompasses the SH3 domain of the human amphiphysin 1 cDNA, can indeed bind the dynamin isoform present in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Therefore, Triton X-100 lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with glutathione-containing agarose beads bound to either GST or GST-AmphiSH3. Fig.2 A shows the protein profile of the cell lysate and of the material bound to both types of beads. The GST pellet showed the presence of a few proteins, which are considered to bind nonspecifically to GST-glutathione-agarose. The GST-AmphiSH3 pellet showed three additional proteins of ∼100, 45, and 30 kDa. The 100-kDa protein reacted with the anti-dynamin II-specific antibody (Fig. 2 B). The 45- and 30-kDa bands reacted with the anti-GST antibody and are therefore likely degradation products of the fusion protein. The experiment was repeated using GST-AmphiSH3m (containing the point mutations G684R and P687L). No dynamin was sedimented by this construct (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating the specificity of GST-AmphiSH3 to bind this protein. To verify that GST-AmphiSH3 interferes with endocytosis of proteins that internalize via clathrin-coated pits, we incubated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with fluorescently labeled transferrin. The presence of intracellular transferrin was used as a measure of its endocytosis. Under the conditions of this assay, very little transferrin is left at the cell surface upon washing prior to fixation (18Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 36Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The internalized fluorescence was examined in cells that were microinjected with GST-AmphiSH3 as well as in the non-injected cells on the same coverslips (Fig. 3). On coverslips incubated at 37 °C, the distribution of transferrin in the non-injected cells was punctate within the cytoplasm and concentrated in the perinuclear region. On the same coverslips, cells microinjected with GST-AmphiSH3 showed a marked reduction in intracellular transferrin; the perinuclear staining was no longer observed; and the cytoplasmic staining was equal to that observed in non-injected cells incubated at 4 °C. Control experiments with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts confirmed that GST-AmphiSH3 prevented transferrin endocytosis and that this effect was not reproduced by GST-AmphiSH3m (data not shown). GST-AmphiSH3 was then microinjected into 3T3-L1 adipocytes to assess its effects on cell-surface GLUT4 levels. The microinjected 3T3-L1 adipocytes were allowed to recover for 30 min and deprived of serum for 2 h prior to generation of plasma membrane lawns. Fig.4 A illustrates one experiment representative of three. As anticipated, in a non-injected region of the coverslip (first column), the level of GLUT4 immunofluorescence on plasma membrane lawns was low (bottom panel), indicating that only a small amount of GLUT4 is present at the surface of unstimulated cells. Approximately 80% of the microinjected cells in the 1-mm2 marked region of the coverslip clearly retained the microinjected rhodamine-dextran marker and were thus considered to be intact and retaining microinjected material (second column, middle panel). In the plasma membrane lawns of unstimulated cells that were microinjected with GST-AmphiSH3, the GLUT4 immunofluorescence was higher in many of the lawns compared with those of non-injected cells (second column, bottom panel). This suggests that the fusion protein elevated the surface content of GLUT4. Microinjection of GST did not affect the GLUT4 immunofluorescence compared with non-injected cells (third and fourth columns, bottom panels). Fig. 4 B shows one experiment representative of three in which GLUT4 immunofluorescence was detected in the lawn of cells microinjected with GST-AmphiSH3m. As with GST alone, the signal was not different from that in control cells. By comparison, insulin stimulation of cells resulted in a marked gain in surface GLUT4. The quantitated results of all experiments are shown in Fig. 4 C. Microinjection of GST-AmphiSH3 significantly doubled the amount of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane (p < 0.005). In contrast, neither GST nor GST-AmphiSH3m significantly affected the amount of surface GLUT4. Insulin stimulation of intact cells increased the amount of GLUT4 at the cell surface by ∼3.5-"

To determine the stoichiometry of the active DNA-enzyme complex and the mode of cooperative interaction, we have investigated the dependence of EcoRII cleavage on the concentration of EcoRII dimers. Maximal restriction was observed at dimer/site ratios of 0.25 and 0.5. The molecular weight of the DNA-enzyme complex eluted from a gel filtration column also corresponds to a dimeric enzyme structure bound to two substrate sites. We conclude that oneEcoRII dimer is sufficient to interact cooperatively with two DNA recognition sites. A Lac repressor “barrier” bound between two normally reactive EcoRII sites did not inhibit restriction endonuclease activity, indicating that cooperativity between EcoRII sites is achieved by bending or looping of the intervening DNA stretch. Comparative cleavage of linear substrates with differently spaced interacting sites revealed an inverse correlation between cleavage rate and site distance. At the optimal distance of one helical turn, EcoRII cleavage is independent of the orientation of the recognition sequence in the DNA double strand.

Concerning their substrate requirements, certain restriction endonucleases (ENases) 1The abbreviations used are: ENase, restriction endonuclease; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ENase, restriction endonuclease; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. that interact at a distance with at least two DNA recognition sites resemble proteins involved in processes like transcription control, DNA recombination, and replication in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Sadowski P.

In addition to EcoRII, the first ENase for which this special characteristic was described (Ref. 7Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; for a review see 8), comprehensive studies were also performed on NaeI. Electron microscopy of DNA-NaeI complexes revealed loop structures connecting NaeI sites on the same DNA molecule (9Topal M.D. Thresher R.J. Conrad M. Griffith J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another extraordinary type II ENase is SfiI, whose tetrameric enzyme structure bridges two specific recognition sites and cleaves them simultaneously (10Wentzell L.M. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 581-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Szczelkun M.D. Halford S.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1460-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A few other ENases are considered to belong to this particular ENase group (12Oller A.R. Vanden Broek W. Conrad M. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Reuter M. Kupper D. Pein C.-D. Petrusyte M. Siksnys V. Frey B. Krüger D.H. Anal.

Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14918-14925Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The complex mode of action of these particular ENases appears to limit their efficiency in DNA restriction and may reflect additional biological functions besides the destruction of invading DNA. Other type II ENases (non IIe) like EcoRI and EcoRV use the simpler and more powerful mechanism of linear diffusion along the helical pitch of the DNA that enables them to find every single recognition site and effectively restrict foreign DNA (15Jeltsch A.

Another study revealed the homology between a C-proximal sequence of ENase EcoRII with a motif characterizing the integrase family of recombinases. Site-directed mutagenesis resulting in a Y308F substitution abolished cleavage activity but not specific DNA binding (20Topal M.D. Conrad M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2599-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The combination of ligase/topoisomerase or integrase motifs with site-specific cleavage in these enzymes suggests that analyses of the structure-function relation and the unusual reaction mechanism of EcoRII and other type IIe ENases may disclose further evolutionary connections.EcoRII recognizes the partially degenerate nucleotide sequence 5′-CCWGG and cleaves it 5′ of the first base. The endonucleolytic activity is inhibited by canonical C-5 methylation of the internal cytosine. Moreover, the enzyme is catalytically inactive on single recognition sites in larger DNA molecules and even on two sites in the same DNA (located “in cis”) when their distance exceeds a critical length. Hydrolysis of these a priori resistant DNA substrates can be achieved by the addition of susceptible EcoRII sites “in trans,”e.g. of synthetic EcoRII recognition site-containing oligonucleotide duplexes. This intermolecularEcoRII enzyme activation depends on the DNA site concentration and is inversely correlated to the length of the activator DNA molecule (for a review, see Ref. 8Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Reuter M. Schroeder C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Apart from the demonstration of positive cooperativity of EcoRII enzyme activity and the development of a preliminary mechanistic model (8Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Reuter M. Schroeder C.

Rev. 1993; 57: 434-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of the EcoRII-DNA interaction has not been determined. To this aim, we have now analyzed the native molecular weight of homogeneous NH2-terminally His6-tagged EcoRII alone and complexed with substrate. We then investigated the dependence of EcoRII cleavage on the concentration of EcoRII dimers to calculate the composition of the active complex under optimal cleavage conditions. To discriminate between DNA translocation and looping as modes of cooperative site interaction, we examined the consequences of binding the Lac repressor as a molecular barrier between two normally reactive EcoRII sites on EcoRII cleavage activity. Furthermore, a series of DNA substrates was designed to elucidate the influence of spacing and orientation of two cooperating recognition sites on the EcoRII ENase reaction. Concerning their substrate requirements, certain restriction endonucleases (ENases) 1The abbreviations used are: ENase, restriction endonuclease; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ENase, restriction endonuclease; bp, base pair; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid. that interact at a distance with at least two DNA recognition sites resemble proteins involved in processes like transcription control, DNA recombination, and replication in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Sadowski P.

In addition to EcoRII, the first ENase for which this special characteristic was described (Ref. 7Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar; for a review see 8), comprehensive studies were also performed on NaeI. Electron microscopy of DNA-NaeI complexes revealed loop structures connecting NaeI sites on the same DNA molecule (9Topal M.D. Thresher R.J. Conrad M. Griffith J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another extraordinary type II ENase is SfiI, whose tetrameric enzyme structure bridges two specific recognition sites and cleaves them simultaneously (10Wentzell L.M. Nobbs T.J. Halford S.E. J. Mol.

A few other ENases are considered to belong to this particular ENase group (12Oller A.R. Vanden Broek W. Conrad M. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Reuter M. Kupper D. Pein C.-D. Petrusyte M. Siksnys V. Frey B. Krüger D.H. Anal.

Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14918-14925Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The complex mode of action of these particular ENases appears to limit their efficiency in DNA restriction and may reflect additional biological functions besides the destruction of invading DNA. Other type II ENases (non IIe) like EcoRI and EcoRV use the simpler and more powerful mechanism of linear diffusion along the helical pitch of the DNA that enables them to find every single recognition site and effectively restrict foreign DNA (15Jeltsch A.

EMBO J. 1996; 18: 5104-5111Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Some experimental results support the idea of an evolutionary relationship of type IIe ENases with other protein families; Jo and Topal (17Jo K. Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) discovered a sequence motif shared by ENase NaeI and the active site of human DNA ligase where the essential lysine 43 of the ligase is replaced by leucine in NaeI. A single amino acid substitution, L43K, in NaeI converts the ENase to a DNA topoisomerase with preferred binding to single-stranded and mismatched DNA and an increased sensitivity to intercalating agents (18Jo K.

However, α and β IFNs exhibit key differences in several biological properties. For example, IFN-β, but not IFN-α, induces the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor components ifnar1 and ifnar2, and has activity in cells lacking the IFN receptor-associated, Janus kinase tyk2. To define the structural basis for these functional differences we produced human IFN-β with point mutations and compared them to wild-type IFN-β in assays that distinguish α and β IFN subtypes. IFN-β mutants with charged residues (N86K, N86E, or Y92D) introduced at two positions in the C helix lost the ability to induce the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor chains and had reduced activity on tyk2-deficient cells. The combination of negatively charged residues N86E and Y92D (homologous with IFN-α8) increased the cross-species activity of the mutant IFN-βs on bovine cells to a level comparable to that of human IFN-αs. In contrast, point mutations in the AB loop and D helix had no significant effect on these subtype-specific activities. A subset of these latter mutations did, however, reduce activity in a manner analogous to IFN-α mutations. The effects of these mutations on IFN-β activity are discussed in the context of a family of related ligands acting through a common receptor and signaling pathway.

The mammalian type I IFNs, 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; HAT, hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine; 6TG, 6-thioguanine; MDBK, Madin-Darby bovine kidney; tyk, tyrosine kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. produced in response to viral infection and other inducers, are divided into α and β subtypes on the basis of their reactivity with antisera raised against IFNs derived, respectively, from leukocytes and fibroblasts (1Stewart W.E., II The Interferon System. Springer-Verlag, New York1979: 135-156Google Scholar). The human IFN-αs are encoded by a family of at least 15 different genes, while IFN-β is the unique member of its subtype (2Weissmann C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1986; 33: 251-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Primary sequence comparison between the α and β subtypes reveal an approximately 50% amino acid homology, while the amino acid homologies between the IFN-α subtypes are approximately 80% (2Weissmann C.

As the pleiotropic nature of these cytokines became apparent, with both subtypes eliciting a similar range of biological activities (3Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar), differences between α subtypes, and between IFN-α and -βs, in potency and cell type specific activities were noted (4Einhorn S. Strander H. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 35: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In particular, IFN-β elicits a markedly higher antiproliferation response in some cell types such as (5Rosenblum M.G. Yung W.K. Kelleher P.J. Ruzicka F. Steck P.A. Borden E.C. J.

The entire class of type I IFNs elicit their biological activities through engagement of a common cell surface receptor (8Branca A.A. Baglioni C.

In addition, tyk2-deficient cells retain partial responsiveness to IFN-β, but are completely unresponsive to IFN-αs (26John J. McKendry R. Pellegrini S. Flavell D. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Complementation of the tyk2 deficiency by expression of a kinase-inactive tyk2 partially restores IFN-α8 binding and activity, but has no effect on the IFN-β binding to these cells although it augments IFN-β-induced signaling (27Velazquez L.

Thus, potency and specificity differences between IFN-αs and -βs may reflect differences in receptor interaction. The type I IFNs are closely related members of the helical cytokine family (28Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Resolution of the three-dimensional structures for crystals of murine IFN-β (29Senda T. Matsuda S. Kurihara H. Nakamura K.T. Kawano G. Shimizu H. Mizuno H. Mitsui Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad.

Inspection of the crystal structures in light of previous extensive IFN-α mutational analyses (reviewed in Refs. 15Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J.

Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), directed us to exposed residues available for receptor binding. In this study we describe the functional consequences of site-directed mutations of human IFN-β. Our results reveal the importance of C helix residues in conferring subtype specific activities on IFN-β as judged from activity and biochemical assays. Mutation of AB loop (Arg27 and Arg35) and D helix (Lys123, but not Arg124) residues reduces activity in all assays and are qualitatively similar to effects seen for homologous IFN-α mutations. However, the AB loop and D helix IFN-β mutants retain IFN-β-specific activities in assays that distinguish between IFN-α and -β subtypes. We use the single letter code for amino acids. Substitutions are given as XnY, where X is the amino acid replaced, n, its number in the sequence and Y, the replacement. To facilitate discussion, we number the IFN-α amino acid sequences from the NH2 terminus according to the convention that counts the deletion at position 44 of IFN-α2 (29Senda T. Matsuda S. Kurihara H. Nakamura K.T. Kawano G. Shimizu H. Mizuno H. Mitsui Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Sci. 1990; 66B: 77-80Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Senda T. Saitoh S. Mitsui Y. J. Mol.

Human IFN-β is numbered from the NH2 terminus without deletion. This alignment leaves all α positions, n, with homologous β positions at n + 2, up to the COOH terminus of IFN-β. The five α helices of IFN are labeled from the NH2 terminus: ABCDE, the loops are labeled with the letters of the helices at their NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal ends. Substitutions introduced into human IFN-β are given in Fig. 1. The mutations were introduced into the human IFN-β gene carried on plasmid pJC017, a COS cell expression vector (Biogen, Inc. Cambridge, MA), using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). COS 7 cells were transiently transfected, and the supernatants from cultures (3 days posttransfection) were screened for the presence of immunoreactive IFN-β and then for biological activity on human HL116 cells, which carry a luciferase reporter under control of an IFN-α-β-inducible promoter (33Uzé G. Di Marco S. Mouchel- Vielh E. Monneron D. Bandu M.-T. Horisberger M.A. Dorques A. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Quantitation of IFN expression levels was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing rabbit polyclonal anti-IFN-β1a serum to coat plates, biotinylated rabbit polyclonal antibodies as a secondary reagent, followed by streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunochemical, West Grove, PA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay values were confirmed by Western blot analyses using a second rabbit anti-IFN-β1a polyclonal serum. Western blotting revealed two interferon bands corresponding to unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of the molecule which were present in roughly equal proportions. Molarities of interferons based on biological activity referenced to fully glycosylated, purified IFN-β1a were always less than those estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Experiments to investigate the effect of glycosylation on IFN-β activity suggest a 2-fold lower specific activity of unglycosylated versus glycosylated forms (53Runkel L. Meier W. Pepinsky B.

All the results presented in this report compare mutant and wild-type preparations that had similar proportions of glycosylated interferon. Supernatants were assayed for activity on cells with luciferase as an IFN-inducible reporter. Each production batch included a transfection with cDNA for unmutated wild-type IFN-β and a mock transfection control. Preliminary studies had shown that IFN-β could be routinely produced with supernatants yielding in a range around 1.0 nm and that such supernatants, stored at 4 °C, retained their activity over several months. Substitutions in the C helix of IFN-α were obtained by site-directed mutations introduced into the cDNA encoding the IFN hybrid alpha8[60]alpha1[92]alpha8 (35Meister A. Uzé G. Mogensen K.E.

This hybrid, in which part of the B helix, the BC loop, and part of the C helix are derived from human IFN-α1, is labeled P. Construction, expression, purification, and characterization of the P mutants have been described in detail elsewhere (33Uzé G. Di Marco S. Mouchel- Vielh E. Monneron D. Bandu M.-T.

Receptor chain coimmunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described previously (24Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Murti A. Wang C. Basu L. Hollander D. Russel-Harde D. Betts M.

For each experimental point 2 × 108 human Daudi B cells (ATCC no. CCL 213) were treated with wild-type or mutant IFN-β (2,500 units/mL, 10 min, 37 °C). Receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated from extracts using either anti-ifnar1 monoclonal antibody (AA3, Biogen Inc.), anti-ifnar2 monoclonal antibody (AB.B7.2, Biogen Inc.), or control mouse sera. Immune complexes were analyzed by Western blotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 7.5% gels, probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal AB-2 antibodies (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) followed by anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). The blots were stripped and reblotted with anti-ifnar1 monoclonal antibody to verify that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. The recombinant IFNs, human IFN-β was from Biogen Inc.; human IFN-α2 (2c) was a gift from Dr G. Adolf, Ernst Boehringer Institute, Vienna, Austria; human IFN-α8 and -α1 and hybrids of these were a gift from Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland. Concentrations of the IFNs were estimated against IFN reference preparations, pure recombinant IFNs, IFN-α at 5.0 nm, and IFN-β at 250 nm of active monomer. The IFN-α reference at 5 nm corresponds to 20,000 IU (MRC 69/19). Cell sensitivity to IFN was estimated in terms of the mean concentration required to obtain a 50% response in any given assay (see TableI).Table IDifferences in activities induced by human α and β IFNs in the various assay systems usedAssay system induced activity1-2001Antiviral activities expressed as average (∼) concentrations giving a 50% response; fidiucial limits at 95% in parentheses.Level of responsivenessβ/α differenceIFN-βIFN-α-foldEquine cells, antiviral∼2 nm∼1 pm2000Bovine MDBK cells∼3 pm∼0.2 pm15(0.6–15)(0.03–0.9)Human WISH cells, antiviral∼0.4 pm∼1.0 pm0.4(0.1–1.2) (0.7–1.3)Human tyk2− cells, antiviral∼100 pm>100 nm<0.001Human Daudi cells (ifnar1/ifnar2 co-IP)1-bLigand-induced coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) of phosphorylated ifnar1 and ifnar2.YesNo1-2001 Antiviral activities expressed as average (∼) concentrations giving a 50% response; fidiucial limits at 95% in parentheses.1-b Ligand-induced coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) of phosphorylated ifnar1 and ifnar2.

End points were at 50% luciferase induction and assays were repeated to obtain a precision (95%) of approximately ±0.3 log titer. Where activities are presented as percent of the unmutated form, this corresponds to a precision of 50–200%. Relative activities of mutant IFNs, estimated by luciferase induction, were confirmed at least once by both antiviral and antiproliferative assay. The human 2fTGH-derived, 11.1 (tyk2-deficient), cells do not express the intracellular tyrosine kinase tyk2 (26John J. McKendry R. Pellegrini S. Flavell D. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). They are also hprt− (hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl transferase) and carry bacterial gpt (xanthine/guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase) linked to the IFN sensitive 6–16 promoter, allowing IFN to be assayed in terms of its capacity to induce cellular growth in hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT) containing medium or cell mortality in medium containing 6-thioguanine (6TG) (27Velazquez L.

Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Strain A27 of the 11.1 tyk2-deficient cells was obtained from a fast growing colony of 11.1 cells, cultivated in HAT plus 1.0 nm IFN-β, which was then cloned and reselected in HAT plus 50 pm IFN-β and recloned. All selectant cultures, and clones derived from them, were tested for their sensitivity toward HAT alone and cultured in 6TG alone. The strain A27 died in HAT, grew in 6TG alone, and showed a growth response (positive in HAT, negative in 6TG) in the presence of 10 pm IFN-β, in contrast to the 11.1 cells which were between 10- and 100-fold less sensitive in their growth responses to IFN-β. Like the 11.1 cells, A27 produced no detectable immunoreactive tyk2 (20Barbieri G. Velazquez L. Scrobogna M. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further selections from A27 produced only clones that either grew in HAT alone and/or were unable to grow in 6TG alone. The characteristics of A27 have remained stable. The enhanced sensitivity of A27 to IFN, also seen in antiviral assay, allowed a full dose response range for the biological assay of the mutant IFN-βs. For IFN antiviral assays, bovine MDBK (ATCC no. 6071), primary equine dermis NBL6 (ATCC no. CCL57) at passage 20–24, human amnion-derived WISH and tyk2− cells were treated overnight with different concentrations of IFN and then challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus at the optimal multiplicities of infection, 0.01, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.01 for the respective cell lines. When control cultures showed 100% cell destruction, an index estimating the cytopathic effect of the virus was scored as a function of IFN concentration, with each point the mean of six replicates. End points were at 50% protection and assays were repeated to obtain a precision (95%) of approximately ±0.3 log titer. Where antiviral activities of IFNs are presented as percent of the unmutated form, this corresponds to a precision of 50–200%. The sensitivity of equine NBL6 cells toward IFN-β is such that mutant IFN-β preparations with reduced activity fail to give an end point on antiviral titration; such mutants are scored <wild type. The antiproliferative effects of the mutant IFNs were assayed on the Burkitt lymphoma-derived Daudi cell line. Models of IFN-α and IFN-β were generated by homology modeling with the Modeler, Protein Design, and Protein Health functions available with the Quanta package (MSI Inc., San Diego CA), using the α carbon coordinates of murine IFN-β (Brookhaven accession no. 2RMI) as template. Solvent accessibility of residues and their side chains and were obtained with the default settings of the Protein Design function of Quanta. Inspection of the recently published figures for IFN-α2b (31Radhakrishnan R. Walter L.J. Hruza A. Reichert P. Trotta R.P. Nagabhushan T.L. Walter M.R.

Meier W. Lipscomb W.N. Goelz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) suggest that these models were useful for the α helices and for the AB loop, COOH-terminal to cysteine 29 (cysteine 31 in human β); less so for the positioning of residues in the other loops. The putative distribution of α helices (A through E) and loops (identified by their bounding helices) are shown in the primary sequence comparison shown in Fig.1. The mutations in the C helix of IFN-β were confined to residues 86 and 92 (homologous with 84 and 90 in the IFN-αs) and were concerned with substituting the noncharged side chains with residues that would be charged at neutral pH. Previous work had demonstrated that these residues participate to confer subtype α8-specific activities onto a hybrid IFN-α1 (33Uzé G. Di Marco S. Mouchel- Vielh E. Monneron D. Bandu M.-T. Horisberger M.A. Dorques A. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), implicating them as important residues for defining the character of receptor mediated, subtype-specific activities. Single mutations N86E, N86K, and Y92D, as well as doubly substituted mutants at these positions, N86E,Y92D and N86K,Y92D, were investigated in this study. Sequence comparisons between type I IFN subtypes of equine (38Himmler A. Hauptmann R. Adolf G.R. Swetly P. DNA (N. Y.). 1986; 5: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and human origin revealed distinctly different amino acids in certain regions of the molecules, including the A helix, NH2-terminal AB loop, and D helix (Fig. 1). Mutational analysis of IFN-αs have identified the NH2-terminal AB loop as a critical domain for activity and receptor binding (reviewed in Refs. 15Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar and 32Mitsui Y. Senda T. Shimazu T. Matsuda S. Utsumi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 93-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The IFN-αs of equine and human origin are conserved in this region and retain a high degree of cross-species reactivity. These observations suggested that IFN-α and -β functional differences may reside in amino acid differences of the AB loop. Therefore, we chose substitutions of human IFN-β residues Arg27, Tyr30, and Arg35 with homologous residues of equine IFN-β. The D helix was scanned by alanine substitutions at residues Lys123, Arg124 (32Mitsui Y. Senda T. Shimazu T. Matsuda S. Utsumi J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 93-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and Tyr125(39McInnes B. Chambers P.J. Cheetham B.F. Beilharz M.W. Tymms M.J. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), that had previously been shown to be critical for IFN-α function and, therefore, likely to be involved in receptor interactions (15Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). All residues mutated, except Y125A, were estimated to be at least partially exposed to solvent. These predictions have been confirmed on the recently solved, three-dimensional structure of the human IFN-β1a (37Karpusas M. Nolte M. Benton C.B. Meier W. Lipscomb W.N. Goelz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The likelihood that Tyr125 is a buried residue, involved in intramolecular bonds, was confirmed on the three-dimensional structure of human IFN-β1a (37Karpusas M. Nolte M. Benton C.B. Meier W. Lipscomb W.N. Goelz S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11813-11818Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Three biological assays which distinguish between α and β IFNs are shown in Table I, where relative potencies of the two type I IFNs are also given. Typically, as for WISH cells or HL116 cells assayed with encephalomyocardial virus, the relative potencies of α and β IFNs are approximately the same on human cell lines. However, on equine NBL6 cells IFN-α has 2000 times more antiviral activity than does IFN-β. On bovine MDBK cells IFN-α has 15 times more antiviral activity than does IFN-β. On the human tyk2− line 11.1 (strain A27) IFN-β has at least 1000-fold greater antiviral activity than does IFN-α (19Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S.

In addition, to gain insights into effects of mutations on IFN interactions with its receptor, the mutant IFN-βs were analyzed in a biochemical assay which detects the capacity of IFN-β, but not IFN-α, to induce a co-immunoprecipitable complex between tyrosine phosphorylated ifnar1 and ifnar2 (22Platanias L.C.

https://openalex.org/W1991250636,"Molecular mechanisms of anesthetic action on neurotransmitter receptors are poorly understood. The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is glutamate, and recent studies found that volatile anesthetics inhibit the function of the α-amino-3-hydroxyisoxazolepropionic acid subtype of glutamate receptors (e.g. glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3)), but enhance kainate (GluR6) receptor function. We used this dissimilar pharmacology to identify sites of anesthetic action on the kainate GluR6 receptor by constructing chimeric GluR3/GluR6 receptors. Results with chimeric receptors implicated a transmembrane region (TM4) of GluR6 in the action of halothane. Site-directed mutagenesis subsequently showed that a specific amino acid, glycine 819 in TM4, is important for enhancement of receptor function by halothane (0.2–2 mm). Mutations of Gly-819 also markedly decreased the response to isoflurane (0.2–2 mm), enflurane (0.2–2 mm), and 1-chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (0.2–2 mm). The nonanesthetics 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane and 2,3-dichlorooctafluorobutane had no effect on the functions of either wild-type GluR6 or receptors mutated at Gly-819. Ethanol and pentobarbital inhibited the function of both wild-type and mutant receptors. These results suggest that a specific amino acid, Gly-819, is critical for the action of volatile anesthetics, but not of ethanol or pentobarbital, on the GluR6 receptor. Molecular mechanisms of anesthetic action on neurotransmitter receptors are poorly understood. The major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system is glutamate, and recent studies found that volatile anesthetics inhibit the function of the α-amino-3-hydroxyisoxazolepropionic acid subtype of glutamate receptors (e.g. glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3)), but enhance kainate (GluR6) receptor function.

These results suggest that a specific amino acid, Gly-819, is critical for the action of volatile anesthetics, but not of ethanol or pentobarbital, on the GluR6 receptor. There has been a shift of research focus in the field of mechanisms of anesthetic action from nonspecific lipid perturbation to specific protein sites of action (1Franks N.P. Leib W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Anesthetics inhibit the activity of the lipid-free enzyme luciferase (2Franks N.P. Lieb W.R.

We employed a similar strategy in this study. The neurotransmitter glutamate plays a major role in synaptic excitation in the central nervous system and is critical for information storage in memory and learning (6Hollman M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar). There has been an explosion in understanding the biochemistry and molecular biology of all the glutamate receptor types (N-methyld-aspartate, AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxyisoxazolepropionic acid), kainate, and metabotropic) (7Sommer B. Seeburg P.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 291-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have identified many different glutamate receptors (GluRs), with GluR1–4 (AMPA), GluR5–7 (kainate), and KA1–2 (kainate-binding proteins) representing three distinct families of non-N-methyl d-aspartate glutamate receptors based on sequence homology and pharmacological properties (7Sommer B. Seeburg P.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 291-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Kainate receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (8Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5525-5547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GluR6 is found in high levels in most regions of the hippocampus and also in the granule cells of the cerebellum, and an understanding of its roles in brain function is emerging. Previous studies have suggested a presynaptic function on unmyelinated moves (C-fibers) in the spinal cord (9Agrawal S.G. Evans R.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 87: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and on excitatory synapses within the CA3 region of the hippocampus (10Sawada S. Yamamoto C. Exp. Brain Res. 1985; 59: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent studies have found that GABA and glutamate release is inhibited by presynaptic kainate receptors in rat hippocampus (11Cunha R.A. Constantino M.D. Ribeiro J.A. Eur. J.

Nature. 1996; 379: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A role for kainate receptors in synaptic transmission in the CA3 region of the hippocampus was demonstrated in other recent studies (13Vignes M. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 14Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In addition, a genetic linkage study suggests that GluR6 is associated with the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (15Rubinsztein D.C. Leggo J. Chiano M. Dodge A. Norbury G. Rosser E. Craufurd D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). With regard to anesthesia, AMPA receptor antagonists decrease the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane or isoflurane (16Daniell L.C. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1991; 40: 767-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17McFarlane C. Warner D.S. Todd M.M. Nordholm L.

Analg. 1993; 77: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but there are no reports of the effects of kainate receptor antagonists on MAC. There are few studies of the effects of volatile anesthetics on AMPA and kainate receptors, but Dildy-Mayfield et al. (20Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger E.I., II Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar) found that enflurane, halothane, and isoflurane (at concentrations achieved during anesthesia) inhibited the function of GluR3 receptors, but enhanced GluR6 receptor function. One goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of anesthetic action on GluR6 receptors. For this purpose, we constructed GluR3/GluR6 chimeras and used these to determine a region of GluR6 that is essential for anesthetic action. We then constructed a series of mutant GluR6 receptors to define specific sites of anesthetic action in GluR6. cDNAs for rat GluR3(flop), GluR5(Q), and GluR6(R) subunits were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Steven Heinemann (6Hollman M.

Halothane was from Halocarbons Laboratories (River Edge, NJ). Enflurane and isoflurane were from Ohmeda Pharmaceutical Products (Liberty Corner, NJ). 1-Chloro-1,2,2-trifluorocyclobutane (F3), 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (F6), and 2,3-chlorooctafluorobutane (F8) were obtained from PCR Inc. (Gainesville, FL). The UltracompEscherichia coli transformation kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A QIAGEN plasmid kit was used for purification of plasmid cDNA. GluR3, GluR5, and GluR6 cRNAs were prepared using the mCAP mRNA capping kit (Stratagene). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for preparation of the single amino acid mutations. The cDNAs for the GluRs were inserted into the pGEM-HE vector. The cDNAs were linearized with NheI, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated with sodium acetate, and cRNA was prepared using the Stratagene mCAP mRNA capping kit. The cRNAs were extracted using phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate. To study the effects of anesthetics on GluR3/GluR6 chimeras, we used some GluR3/GluR6 chimeras (R6(R3S2), R6TM1R3, R3TM4R6) that were described by Stern-Bach et al. (21Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B.

The original names of the C4, C5, and C6 chimeras were R6(R3S2), R6TM1R3, and R3TM4R6, respectively (21Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F.

All point mutations were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. Isolation and microinjection of Xenopus oocytes were performed as described by Dildy-Mayfield et al. (22Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Mihic S.J. Liu Y. Deitrich R.A. Harris R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Xenopusoocytes were injected with 50 ng of cRNA coding for the GluRs. Oocytes were placed in a 100-μl recording chamber and perfused with modified Barth's solution containing 88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, and 0.91 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, at a rate of 1.8 ml/min at room temperature. Recording and clamping electrodes (1–5 megaohms) were pulled from 1.2-mm outside diameter capillary tubing and filled with 3m KCl. A recording electrode was impaled into the animal pole, and once the resting membrane potential stabilized, a clamping electrode was inserted, and the resting membrane potential was allowed to restabilize. A Warner OC 725-B oocyte clamp was used for voltage-clamping each oocyte at −70 or −90 mV. For oocytes expressing wild-type GluR5 or GluR6, chimeras from GluR6, or mutants of GluR6, 10 μm concanavalin A in modified Barth's solution was preapplied for 2 min to prevent desensitization (23Egebjerg J. Bettler B. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Heinemann S. Nature. 1991; 351: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 24Sakimura K. Morita T. Kushiya E. Mishina M.

The anesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, and F3), nonanesthetics (F6 and F8) (26Koblin D.D. Chortkoff B.S. Laster M.J. Eger E.I., II Halsey M.J. Ionescu P. Anesth. Analg. 1994; 79: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), ethanol, and pentobarbital were preapplied for 2 min to allow for complete equilibration in the bath. Solutions of volatile compounds were prepared immediately before use. The anesthetic, nonanesthetic, and ethanol concentrations in the figures represent bath concentrations, measured as described previously (20Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger E.I., II Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mihic S.J. McQuilkin S.J. Eger E.I., II Ionescu P. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar). In most experiments, we used maximally effective concentrations of kainate to study anesthetic modulation; specifically, 1, 10, or 400 μm was used, depending upon the sensitivity of the particular receptor (see figure legends for details). However, we used a submaximal concentration of kainate (100 nm) for Fig. 3to obtain large enhancement effects of anesthetics because Dildy-Mayfield et al. (20Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger E.I., II Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the potentiation by halothane is greater at low concentrations of kainate than at maximally effective concentrations. Results are expressed as percentages of control responses due to variability in oocyte expression. The control responses were measured before and after each drug application to take into account possible shifts in the control currents as recording proceeded. The n values refer to the number of oocytes studied. Each experiment was carried out with oocytes from at least two different frogs. Statistical analyses were performed using ttests with Dunnett's correction or analysis of variance for repeated measures. EC50 values for concentration-response curves were calculated using GraphPad Inplot software. The amino acid sequence of TM4 for GluR6 was modeled as an α-helix using the Biopolymer module of Insight II (MSI, San Diego, CA). The backbone atoms of the helix were tethered with a force constant of 10 kcal/Å, and side chain packing was optimized with Discover 97 (MSI) using the CFF91 force field. The effect of the G819A mutation was modeled by replacing Gly-819 with alanine and then re-optimizing the side chain packing while using a force constant of 10 kcal/Å to tether the backbone atoms. A molecule of halothane was modeled with the Builder module of Insight II and positioned near the pocket formed by Gly-819 in GluR6. The CFF91 force field was assigned to both TM4 (which was tethered as described above) and halothane. The halothane molecule was then docked onto TM4 using Discover 97. The difference in molecular volume caused by the mutation of glycine to alanine as well as the molecular volume of halothane were calculated with Spartan (Wavefunction, Inc., San Diego, CA). We studied effects of 2 mm halothane on chimeras between GluR3 and GluR6 (Fig. 1). The enhancement produced by halothane on wild-type GluR6 was eliminated in C1 and C2 by replacement of TM4 and some of the sequence N-terminal to TM4 with the same region from GluR3. Results with these chimeras indicated that TM4 was important for halothane potentiation. We also replaced the N- and C-terminal regions of GluR3 with GluR6 (C5 and C6). These chimeras were similar to GluR3, and halothane inhibited the kainate-induced current, indicating that neither the C- nor N-terminal region was the site of enhancement in GluR6 or the site of inhibition in GluR3. Likewise, 2 mm halothane inhibited the kainate-induced current by 47% on C4, suggesting that the N terminus, TM1, TM2, and C terminus were not very important in either enhancement or inhibition by halothane. It is notable that the inhibitory effect of halothane on C4 was converted to a stimulatory effect in C3 by changing the TM4 region. To further define the site of halothane enhancement in TM4 of GluR6, we made a series of mutants of C1 (Fig. 2). We replaced the 4 amino acids just before TM4 (T2) and in the middle of TM4 (T1 and T3). Halothane had little effect on T2 and T3; however, it enhanced the function of T1 by 72 ± 6%. These results indicate that the sequence GGIFI in TM4 is critical for the enhancing effects of halothane on GluR6. Next, we made single amino acid mutations of the GGIFI sequence as well as of the flanking amino acids, selecting residues that were different between GluR3 and GluR6 and changing the GluR6 residue to GluR3 (Fig.3). Halothane enhanced the M1 (G814S), M2 (V815L), and M3 (Q816S) mutant receptor function to an extent similar to that seen with the wild-type receptor (158 ± 12%). However, halothane enhancement was reduced in the M4 (I818V), M5 (G819A), M6 (I821V), and M7 (I823Y) mutant receptors to 80 ± 13, 34 ± 10, 92 ± 24, and 68 ± 9% of control, respectively. The reduction was greatest in GluR6(G819A), and these results suggested that position 819 was particularly important for halothane action, but the amino acids at positions 818, 821, and 823 may also have a role in the enhancement. It is important to note that mutations in the TM4 region did not alter the EC50 for kainate responses (TableI).Table IEC50 values for kainate activation of wild-type and mutant GluRs and GluR chimerasEC50μmWild-type GluR524.8 ± 4.4Wild-type GluR60.2 ± 0.1M1 (G814S)0.3 ± 0.1M2 (V815L)0.3 ± 0.1M3 (Q816S)0.3 ± 0.1M4 (I818V)0.3 ± 0.1M5 (G819A)0.4 ± 0.2M6 (I821V)0.6 ± 0.2M7 (I823Y)0.4 ± 0.2GluR6(G819Q)0.6 ± 0.1GluR6(G819L)0.6 ± 0.1GluR6(G819S)0.8 ± 0.2GluR6(G819H)0.5 ± 0.1GluR6(G819F)0.6 ± 0.1GluR6(G819W)0.7 ± 0.2GluR6(G819C)0.4 ± 0.1T10.4 ± 0.2T20.3 ± 0.2T30.4 ± 0.1C10.8 ± 0.1C20.7 ± 0.3C30.4 ± 0.2C43.8 ± 0.6C51.5 ± 0.5C650 ± 8Wild-type GluR360 ± 10 Open table in a new tab We compared the effects of halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, ethanol, the novel halogenated compound F3 (26Koblin D.D.

Chortkoff B.S. Laster M.J. Eger E.I., II Halsey M.J. Ionescu P. Anesth. Analg. 1994; 79: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) on wild-type GluR6 and mutant GluR6(G819A) receptors. Halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, and F3 enhanced the actions of kainate on the wild-type GluR6 receptor in a concentration-dependent manner, as reported earlier (20Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Eger E.I., II Harris R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1058-1065PubMed Google Scholar). However, these compounds had no significant effects on GluR6(G819A) (Figs. 4 and5 A). The nonanesthetics F6 and F8 had little effect on either wild-type GluR6 or GluR6(G816) (Fig. 5,B and C). At concentrations corresponding to anesthesia (MAC), halothane (0.25 mm) produced 30% enhancement of wild-type GluR6 function, enflurane (0.6 mm) produced 45% enhancement, isoflurane (0.28 mm) produced 20% enhancement, and F3 (0.8 mm) produced 60% enhancement (Fig. 4).Figure 5Concentration-response curves for the effects of F3 (0–2 m m) (A), F6 (0–35.6 μ m) (B), and F8 (0–17.6 μ m) (C) on the kainate-induced currents for the wild-type GluR6 and GluR6(G819A) receptors. F3, F6, and F8 were preapplied for 2 min before being coapplied with kainate (1 μm) for 20 s. Values are the means ± S.E. from six to eight oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also measured the effects of ethanol and pentobarbital on GluR6(G819A) function. Ethanol inhibited the kainate-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner with both wild-type GluR6 and GluR6(G819A) (Fig. 6). The pentobarbital inhibition was similar for wild-type GluR6 and GluR6(G819A). On wild-type GluR6, pentobarbital inhibited the kainate-induced currents by 27 ± 4 and 40 ± 5% at 100 and 200 μm, respectively. Pentobarbital (100 and 200 μm) also inhibited, by 23 ± 4 and 35 ± 3%, respectively, the kainate-induced currents in oocytes expressing GluR6(G819A) (Fig. 6). Next, we studied whether substitution of other amino acids at positions 819 would also abolish the action of volatile anesthetics. We made GluR6(G819C), GluR6(G819F), GluR6 (G819H), GluR6(G819L), GluR6(G819Q), GluR6(G819S), and GluR6(G819W) and measured the effects of volatile anesthetics on these mutants (Fig.7). All of the mutations reduced (or abolished) the potentiation of kainate action by volatile anesthetics. The action of halothane was affected the least by the G819F mutation, but this was still significantly different from halothane's action on wild-type GluR6 (p = 0.03). It should be noted that the modest enhancement produced by halothane (and the even smaller enhancement produced by isoflurane) on the mutant receptors may be due to the relatively high concentrations used for these drugs in Fig. 7. Halothane and isoflurane were tested at concentrations eight and seven times greater than the anesthetic (MAC) concentrations, whereas enflurane and F3 were tested at concentrations corresponding to three and one times MAC, respectively. In contrast to their effects on the actions of the volatile anesthetics, none of the mutations affected the action of ethanol or pentobarbital (Fig.8).Figure 8Effects of ethanol (200 mm) and pentobarbital (100 μm) on the kainate-induced currents for the wild-type GluR6, GluR6(G819A), GluR6(G819C), GluR6(G819F), GluR6(G819H), GluR6(G819L), GluR6(G819Q), GluR6(G819S), and GluR6(G819W) receptors. Anesthetics or ethanol was preapplied for 2 min before being coapplied with kainate (1 μm) for 20 s. Values are the means ± S.E. from 4–20 oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the GluR5 subunit is homologous in the Gly-819 region to GluR6 but not to GluR3 (GluR6 and GluR5 have identical amino acid sequence from Ala-810 to Ala-836) (6Hollman M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of ethanol and anesthetics on the function of homomeric GluR5 receptors. Modulation of GluR5 was quite similar to that of GluR6, with volatile anesthetics enhancing function and ethanol and pentobarbital inhibiting function (Fig.9 and Table I). Comparison of drug action on GluR3, GluR5, and GluR6 supported the idea that Gly-819 in GluR6 is a critical determinant of the effects of volatile anesthetics on AMPA/kainate receptors. Again, it should be noted that halothane and isoflurane were tested at eight and seven times MAC and enflurane and F3 at three and one times MAC, respectively, in Fig. 9. The model of TM4 shows that Gly-819 provides a small cavity that may not be filled by side chains of adjoining helices (Fig.10 A). This cavity can be filled by interaction with a halothane molecule (Fig. 10 B). The halothane molecule not only occupies the space provided by the small glycine side chain, it has favorable interactions with adjoining amino acids. Substitution of alanine for Gly-819 reduces the cavity at that position, as shown in the profile of the α-helix in Fig.10 C. The difference in molecular volume caused by the mutation of glycine to alanine is 99.2–78.9 = 20.3 Å3. Mutation of glycine to tryptophan decreases the molecular volume by 224.0–78.9 = 145.1 Å3. These decreases in volume can be compared with the 121.7-Å3volume of halothane itself. In this study, we identified specific amino acids in the TM4 region of GluR6 that determine actions of volatile anesthetic action on this receptor. In particular, several mutations of Gly-819 markedly decreased halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, and F3 enhancement. Recently, Mihic et al. (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) used mutagenesis to implicate several residues of the glycine α1-receptor subunit and of the GABAA α- or β-subunits as important sites for ethanol and enflurane actions on these receptors, suggesting that alcohol and volatile anesthetics act on a specific region of these proteins. Our results are consistent with findings in the GABAA and glycine receptors in that specific mutations markedly affect anesthetic action on all these receptors. Glutamate receptors have been proposed to contain a large extracellular N-terminal domain, four hydrophobic domains, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (6Hollman M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3662) Google Scholar, 21Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that TM2 is inserted into the ion channel pore, based on comparison of the amino acid sequence between the N-methyl d-aspartate receptor and K+ channels (28Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These models indicate that the region of TM4 implicated in anesthetic action on GluR6 in our study is close to the extracellular membrane surface. The site of enflurane action on GABAA and glycine receptors also appears to be near the extracellular surface (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The binding site for local anesthetics recently established on Na+ channels is also near the membrane surface, but in this case, it is the cytoplasmic surface (30Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Our results raise the question of why anesthetics had little effect on the kainate-induced currents for the GluR6 Gly-819 mutants. Previously, it was reported that domains in the extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 are part of the kainate-binding site based on chimeric receptors (21Stern-Bach Y. Bettler B. Hartley M. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In the present study, mutations in the TM4 region did not alter the EC50 for kainate responses, suggesting that this Gly-819 site is not close to the kainate-binding site. Halothane (0.2–2 mm), in contrast to its affect on wild-type GluR6, did not enhance the kainate-induced currents for GluR6(G819A); however, it is interesting to note that the hydrophilicity, hydropathicity, and polarity of alanine are similar to those of glycine (31Zimmerman J.M. Eliezer N. Simha R. J. Theor. Biol. 1968; 21: 170-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 32Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar). In addition, a variety of amino acid substitutions differing in physical properties all reduced anesthetic action. These results suggest that the hydrophilicity, hydropathicity, and polarity of amino acids at the site of action of anesthetics are not important factors for their effects. However, mutation of glycine to alanine may produce sufficient increase in volume to prevent halothane from binding within a cavity formed (in part) by the Gly-819 region of TM4. Modeling of TM4 shows that Gly-819 resides between more bulky amino acids and that a small cavity is created at this position that can be filled by halothane. However, the decrease in molecular volume of 20 Å3 created by the G819A mutation is small compared with the 122 Å3 of halothane, whereas the 145-Å3 decrease in volume caused by the G819W mutation exceeds that of halothane. In that both the G819A and G819W mutants are fully functional ion channels with EC50 values for glutamate similar to that of wild-type GluR6, it is clear that halothane must have some effect other than filling a cavity. It is tempting to suggest that halothane enhances receptor function by entering into a cavity and interacting with residues one turn above or below Gly-819. Ethanol and pentobarbital inhibit GluR6 function (25Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Harris R.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3162-3171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutations of GABAA and glycine receptors that affect volatile anesthetic actions also affect alcohol (but not barbiturate) actions (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), we asked if mutation of Gly-819 would change ethanol and pentobarbital inhibition of GluR6. We found that a range of mutations did not alter the action of ethanol or pentobarbital. This suggests a different mechanism of action, and perhaps different sites of action, for these drugs as compared with those of the volatile anesthetics on GluR6. Indeed, mutation of the TM2 region of AMPA receptors has been shown to alter the action of pentobarbital (34Yamakura T. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Shimoji K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A distinct site and mechanism of action could explain why alcohols and barbiturates inhibit the function of GluR6 receptors, but volatile anesthetics have the opposite effect. In conclusion, we identified amino acid residues of the GluR6 receptor that are important for volatile anesthetic potentiation of receptor function. These results support the view that volatile anesthetics interact with specific regions of membrane proteins rather than nonspecifically with multiple regions of lipids or proteins. By analogy to glycine and GABAA receptors (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that Gly-819 is part of a hydrophobic pocket and provides an anesthetic-binding site on GluR6 receptors. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to carry out the direct measurement of binding required to test this hypothesis. Although there is little information regarding the role of GluR6 in anesthesia, the creation of Gly-819 mutants in vivo using transgenic animal technology (35Hartenstein B. Schenkel J. Kuhse J. Besenbeck B. Kling C. Becker C.M. Betz H. Weiher H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) should be useful for answering this question. We thank Drs. S. J. Mihic, C. F. Valenzuela, M. P. Mascia, R. Cordoso, and V. Bleck for helpful discussions and technical suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2077595754,"It has been shown that treatment of bovine mitochondrial complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) with NADH or NADPH, but not with NAD or NADP, increases the susceptibility of a number of subunits to tryptic degradation. This increased susceptibility involved subunits that contain electron carriers, such as FMN and iron-sulfur clusters, as well as subunits that lack electron carriers. Results shown elsewhere on changes in the cross-linking pattern of complex I subunits when the enzyme was pretreated with NADH or NADPH (Belogrudov, G., and Hatefi, Y. (1994)Biochemistry 33, 4571–4576) also indicated that complex I undergoes extensive conformation changes when reduced by substrate. Furthermore, we had previously shown that in submitochondrial particles the affinity of complex I for NAD increases by ≥20-fold in electron transfer from succinate to NAD when the particles are energized by ATP hydrolysis. Together, these results suggest that energy coupling in complex I may involve protein conformation changes as a key step. In addition, it has been shown here that treatment of complex I with trypsin in the presence of NADPH, but not NADH or NAD(P), produced from the 39-kDa subunit a 33-kDa degradation product that resisted further hydrolysis. Like the 39-kDa subunit, the 33-kDa product bound to a NADP-agarose affinity column, and could be eluted with a buffer containing NADPH. It is possible that together with the acyl carrier protein of complex I the NADP(H)-binding 39-kDa subunit is involved in intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009042140,"To clarify the process of post-translational modification of l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC), we investigated the conversion of the 74-kDa form of HDC into the 53-kDa form in specialized organella of a rat basophilic/mast cell line (RBL-2H3). With treatment of streptolysin-O, RBL-2H3 cells released approximately 40% of HDC activity accompanied by over 90% of lactate dehydrogenase activity. Only the 74-kDa form of HDC was detected in the leaked fraction by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

From these results, it is assumed that the 74-kDa form of HDC, synthesized in the cytosol, is translocated into the lumen of the ER, where it is converted to the 53-kDa form. l-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC 1The abbreviations used are: HDC,l-histidine decarboxylase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FP2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. 1The abbreviations used are: HDC,l-histidine decarboxylase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FP2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase.; EC 4.1.1.22) catalyzes decarboxylation of l-histidine to histamine.

The recombinant 74-kDa form expressed in the particulate fraction of Sf9 cells had a low activity, while the recombinant 54-kDa form that lacks the C-terminal region of the 74-kDa form had a full activity (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Hori K. Higuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30813-30817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the particulate recombinant 74-kDa form was converted into soluble 53-kDa form with a high catalytic activity by porcine pancreatic elastase in vitro (22Tanaka S. Fukui T. Yamamoto J. Shima Y. Kume T. Ohgo M. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the translated HDC is post-translationally processed to active mature form. Very recently, we have shown the existence of the converting enzyme-like activity in the extract of mouse tissues (23Tanaka S. Funakoshi E. Kawahara A. Nemoto K. Fukui T. Suzuki T. Igarashi K. Ichikawa A. Methods Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 17: 25-29PubMed Google Scholar). Like the role of post-translational processing of proteins, the intracellular translocation of proteins is known. However, the intracellular localization of HDC remains to be clarified. In addition to the soluble form of HDC, membrane-associated HDC activity has been reported in various tissues, such as rat hypothalamus (24Snyder S.H. Brown B. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurochem. 1974; 23: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and rat brain (25Martres M.P. Braudry M. Schwartz J.C. Brain Res. 1975; 83: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Braudry M. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Agents Actions. 1973; 3: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 27Toledo A.

Blanco I. J. Neurochem. 1988; 56: 380-384Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, these reports did not refer to the molecular size of the membranous HDC. The aim of this study was to investigate the conversion of the 74-kDa form into the 53-kDa form in specialized organella of rat basophilic/mast (RBL-2H3) cells.DISCUSSIONBesides the 53-kDa form, known as a subunit of HDC-purified from various mammalian tissues (13Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Martin S.A.M. Bishop P.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), RBL-2H3 cells were found to contain the 74-kDa form, corresponding to the nascent HDC molecule. Most of the 74-kDa form in RBL-2H3 cells leaked out upon treatment of SLO, indicating that the 74-kDa form is localized primarily in the cytosol. Furthermore, [35S]methionine-labeled 74-kDa HDC is a short half-life protein as shown by its rapid degradation in the pulse-chase experiment. Since the 74-kDa form lacks an amino-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved after the translocation across the ER membrane (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it may be synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol as a nonsecreted protein. Regarding the degradation of the 74-kDa form of HDC, very recently we demonstrated the involvement of the proteasome system by the finding that the degradation of the 74-kDa form is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, such as carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal,n-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, and lactacystin (39Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of the cytosolic 74-kDa form of HDC may be regulated through post-translational steps including the proteasome system. It is notable that some of the 74-kDa form was also present in the particulate fraction, which has been revealed to exist in the ER, as judged from the distribution of the 74-kDa HDC and the PDI. The membrane topology of the 74-kDa form in the particulate fraction of RBL-2H3 cells was also analyzed by the technique of trypsin digestion of the permeabilized cells. Membrane-associated 74-kDa HDC was discharged upon Triton X-100 treatment and vanished upon trypsin treatment of the digitonin-permeabilized cells (Fig. 6). From these results, it is inferred that the 74-kDa form localizes on the surface of the ER. Regarding membrane-associated HDC activity, Snyder et al. (24Snyder S.H. Brown B. Kuhar M.J. J. Neurochem. 1974; 23: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated a low but significant amount of rat hypothalamic HDC activity associated with the membranous fraction, although the majority of the activity was found in the supernatant when subcellular particles were osmotically lysed. Furthermore, Martreset al. (25Martres M.P. Braudry M. Schwartz J.C. Brain Res. 1975; 83: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Braudry et al. (26Braudry M. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Agents Actions. 1973; 3: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and Toledoet al. (27Toledo A. Sabria J. Rodriguez R. Brandner R. Rodriguez J. Palacios J.M. Blanco I. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1400-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) also reported membrane-bound HDC activity in rat brain. Toledo et al. (28Toledo A. Rodriguez R. Sabria J. Rodriguez J. Blanco I. J. Neurochem. 1988; 56: 380-384Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) also reported that the membrane-bound HDC activity was solubilized by Ca2+. However, these reports did not refer to the molecular size of the membrane-bound HDC. From our results, it is deduced that membrane-associated HDC activity reported previously originated from the membrane-associated 74-kDa form.Since the 74-kDa form has not been purified, it is unknown whether it has full activity. In our previous report, the recombinant mouse 74-kDa form exhibited a low catalytic activity compared with purified HDC, comprising a dimer of the 53-kDa subunit (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yatsunami et al. reported that the 54-kDa monomer form of recombinant human HDC, being expressed in the cytosol fraction, has specific activity similar to that of the purified enzyme (21Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Hori K. Higuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30813-30817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, we observed that 40% of HDC activity in RBL-2H3 cells was discharged by SLO treatment (Table I), and this activity is inferred to chiefly originate from the 74-kDa form of HDC (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the 74-kDa form has significant enzymatic activity.In contrast to the present study, we previously reported that the recombinant 74-kDa form of HDC expressed in Sf9 cells was mostly recovered in the particulate fraction, while the mutant 53-kDa HDC in the expressed cells was the soluble form (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Hori K. Higuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30813-30817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Considering the solubilization of the precipitated 74-kDa HDC only on treatment with a mixture of 6 m guanidine and 10 mmdithiothreitol, it is quite possible that the precipitated recombinant 74-kDa HDC in Sf9 cells is an abnormal form of the protein similar to bacterial inclusion bodies, which have been reported in a baculovirus system (40Landford R.E. Kennedy R.C. Dreesman G.R. Eichberg J.W. Notnal L. Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Zuckerman A. Viral Hepatitis and Liver Diseases. Alan R. Liss, New York1987: 372-378Google Scholar).In addition, we showed that the 53-kDa form of HDC is essentially localized in the particulate fraction in RBL-2H3 cells. The particulate 53-kDa form is regarded to be localized in the luminal area of the ER, because the 53-kDa form was present in the fraction containing NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and PDI, and it was extremely resistant to trypsin digestion of digitonin-permeabilized cells but was sensitive to that of Triton X-100-permeabilized cells. In addition, the immunofluorescent study with anti-GST fusion HDC antiserum indicates that HDC is present in the luminal area of the ER, because there was evidence of co-localization with PDI but not with FP2 (Fig. 4). PDI is a typical marker protein exhibiting specific localization in the intraluminal space of the ER (41Quemeneur E. Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, anti-FP2 antiserum was raised against the whole protein of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, which has a short putative N-terminal membrane-anchored region with a long cytosolic tail (42Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the fluorescent signals of HDC in the ER may be mostly derived from the luminal 53-kDa form of HDC. Therefore, it is assumed that the initial translated 74-kDa form of HDC, synthesized on the surface of free ribosomes, is associated to and translocated across the ER membrane, and thereafter in the luminal space of the ER it is post-translationally processed to yield the 53-kDa form.The 53-kDa form of HDC was not detected in the extract of SLO- (Fig. 2) and digitonin-permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6). On the other hand, purified HDC, consisting of a dimer of the 53-kDa form, has been isolated from the supernatant fraction of homogenates of various tissues and cells. It is possible that particulate HDC is discharged during the homogenization of tissues and cells. In the present experiment, a significant amount of the 53-kDa form of HDC together with β-hexosaminidase, a typical granule marker, was recovered in the supernatant fraction of the homogenate as shown in Fig. 3.Histamine is stored in the granules in mast cells and basophils and is released extracellularly accompanying degranulation after stimulation (1Beaven M.A. Histamine: Its Role in Physiological and Pathological Processes. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1978Google Scholar). We observed that the 53-kDa form of HDC, originally located in the ER and Golgi, is moved to the granule fraction containing histamine, HDC activity, and β-hexosaminidase (Fig. 3, B and C). Subsequently, it is inferred that the 53-kDa form of HDC has a role in the synthesis of histamine in the granules.In summary, the 74-kDa form of HDC is the cytosolic enzyme, the 53-kDa form is the particulate enzyme in RBL-2H3 cells, and both are interconverted in the luminal area of the ER. l-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC 1The abbreviations used are: HDC,l-histidine decarboxylase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FP2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. 1The abbreviations used are: HDC,l-histidine decarboxylase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; SLO, streptolysin-O; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RIPA, radioimmune assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FP2, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase.; EC 4.1.1.22) catalyzes decarboxylation of l-histidine to histamine.

Neurochem. 1974; 23: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated a low but significant amount of rat hypothalamic HDC activity associated with the membranous fraction, although the majority of the activity was found in the supernatant when subcellular particles were osmotically lysed. Furthermore, Martreset al. (25Martres M.P. Braudry M. Schwartz J.C. Brain Res. 1975; 83: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), Braudry et al. (26Braudry M. Martres M.P. Schwartz J.C. Agents Actions. 1973; 3: 175-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and Toledoet al. (27Toledo A. Sabria J. Rodriguez R. Brandner R. Rodriguez J. Palacios J.M. Blanco I. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1400-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) also reported membrane-bound HDC activity in rat brain. Toledo et al. (28Toledo A. Rodriguez R. Sabria J. Rodriguez J. Blanco I. J. Neurochem. 1988; 56: 380-384Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) also reported that the membrane-bound HDC activity was solubilized by Ca2+. However, these reports did not refer to the molecular size of the membrane-bound HDC. From our results, it is deduced that membrane-associated HDC activity reported previously originated from the membrane-associated 74-kDa form.Since the 74-kDa form has not been purified, it is unknown whether it has full activity. In our previous report, the recombinant mouse 74-kDa form exhibited a low catalytic activity compared with purified HDC, comprising a dimer of the 53-kDa subunit (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Yatsunami et al. reported that the 54-kDa monomer form of recombinant human HDC, being expressed in the cytosol fraction, has specific activity similar to that of the purified enzyme (21Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Hori K. Higuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30813-30817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, we observed that 40% of HDC activity in RBL-2H3 cells was discharged by SLO treatment (Table I), and this activity is inferred to chiefly originate from the 74-kDa form of HDC (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the 74-kDa form has significant enzymatic activity.In contrast to the present study, we previously reported that the recombinant 74-kDa form of HDC expressed in Sf9 cells was mostly recovered in the particulate fraction, while the mutant 53-kDa HDC in the expressed cells was the soluble form (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Yatsunami K. Tsuchikawa M. Kamada M. Hori K. Higuchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30813-30817Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Considering the solubilization of the precipitated 74-kDa HDC only on treatment with a mixture of 6 m guanidine and 10 mmdithiothreitol, it is quite possible that the precipitated recombinant 74-kDa HDC in Sf9 cells is an abnormal form of the protein similar to bacterial inclusion bodies, which have been reported in a baculovirus system (40Landford R.E. Kennedy R.C. Dreesman G.R. Eichberg J.W. Notnal L. Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Zuckerman A. Viral Hepatitis and Liver Diseases. Alan R. Liss, New York1987: 372-378Google Scholar).In addition, we showed that the 53-kDa form of HDC is essentially localized in the particulate fraction in RBL-2H3 cells. The particulate 53-kDa form is regarded to be localized in the luminal area of the ER, because the 53-kDa form was present in the fraction containing NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and PDI, and it was extremely resistant to trypsin digestion of digitonin-permeabilized cells but was sensitive to that of Triton X-100-permeabilized cells. In addition, the immunofluorescent study with anti-GST fusion HDC antiserum indicates that HDC is present in the luminal area of the ER, because there was evidence of co-localization with PDI but not with FP2 (Fig. 4). PDI is a typical marker protein exhibiting specific localization in the intraluminal space of the ER (41Quemeneur E. Guthapfel R. Gueguen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5485-5488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, anti-FP2 antiserum was raised against the whole protein of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, which has a short putative N-terminal membrane-anchored region with a long cytosolic tail (42Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L. Negishi M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the fluorescent signals of HDC in the ER may be mostly derived from the luminal 53-kDa form of HDC. Therefore, it is assumed that the initial translated 74-kDa form of HDC, synthesized on the surface of free ribosomes, is associated to and translocated across the ER membrane, and thereafter in the luminal space of the ER it is post-translationally processed to yield the 53-kDa form.The 53-kDa form of HDC was not detected in the extract of SLO- (Fig. 2) and digitonin-permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 6). On the other hand, purified HDC, consisting of a dimer of the 53-kDa form, has been isolated from the supernatant fraction of homogenates of various tissues and cells. It is possible that particulate HDC is discharged during the homogenization of tissues and cells. In the present experiment, a significant amount of the 53-kDa form of HDC together with β-hexosaminidase, a typical granule marker, was recovered in the supernatant fraction of the homogenate as shown in Fig. 3.Histamine is stored in the granules in mast cells and basophils and is released extracellularly accompanying degranulation after stimulation (1Beaven M.A. Histamine: Its Role in Physiological and Pathological Processes. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1978Google Scholar). We observed that the 53-kDa form of HDC, originally located in the ER and Golgi, is moved to the granule fraction containing histamine, HDC activity, and β-hexosaminidase (Fig. 3, B and C). Subsequently, it is inferred that the 53-kDa form of HDC has a role in the synthesis of histamine in the granules.In summary, the 74-kDa form of HDC is the cytosolic enzyme, the 53-kDa form is the particulate enzyme in RBL-2H3 cells, and both are interconverted in the luminal area of the ER. Besides the 53-kDa form, known as a subunit of HDC-purified from various mammalian tissues (13Ohmori E. Fukui T. Imanishi N. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Taguchi Y. Watanabe T. Kubota H. Hayashi H. Wada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Watabe A. Fukui T. Ohmori E. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Martin S.A.M. Bishop P.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), RBL-2H3 cells were found to contain the 74-kDa form, corresponding to the nascent HDC molecule. Most of the 74-kDa form in RBL-2H3 cells leaked out upon treatment of SLO, indicating that the 74-kDa form is localized primarily in the cytosol. Furthermore, [35S]methionine-labeled 74-kDa HDC is a short half-life protein as shown by its rapid degradation in the pulse-chase experiment. Since the 74-kDa form lacks an amino-terminal signal sequence that is cleaved after the translocation across the ER membrane (20Yamamoto J. Fukui T. Suzuki K. Tanaka S. Yatsunami K. Ichikawa A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it may be synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol as a nonsecreted protein. Regarding the degradation of the 74-kDa form of HDC, very recently we demonstrated the involvement of the proteasome system by the finding that the degradation of the 74-kDa form is inhibited by proteasome inhibitors, such as carboxybenzyl-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal,n-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, and lactacystin (39Tanaka S. Nemoto K. Yamamura E. Ohmura S. Ichikawa A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of the cytosolic 74-kDa form of HDC may be regulated through post-translational steps including the proteasome system. It is notable that some of the 74-kDa form was also present in the particulate fraction, which has been revealed to exist in the ER, as judged from the distribution of the 74-kDa HDC and the PDI. The membrane topology of the 74-kDa form in the particulate fraction of RBL-2H3 cells was also analyzed by the technique of trypsin digestion of the permeabilized cells. Membrane-associated 74-kDa HDC was discharged upon Triton X-100 treatment and vanished upon trypsin treatment of the digitonin-permeabilized cells (Fig. 6). From these results, it is inferred that the 74-kDa form localizes on the surface of the ER. Regarding membrane-associated HDC activity, Snyder et al. (24Snyder S.H. Brown B. Kuhar M.J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2032058295,"A cDNA clone for pumpkin acyl-CoA oxidase (EC1.3.3.6; ACOX) was isolated from a λgt11 cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from etiolated cotyledons. The inserted cDNA clone contains 2313 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 690 amino acids. Analysis of the amino-terminal sequence of the protein indicates that the pumpkin acyl-CoA oxidase protein is synthesized as a larger precursor containing a cleavable amino-terminal presequence of 45 amino acids. This presequence shows high similarity to the typical peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2). Western blot analysis following cell fractionation in a sucrose gradient revealed that ACOX is localized in glyoxysomes. A partial purification of ACOX from etiolated pumpkin cotyledons indicated that the ACOX cDNA codes for a long chain acyl-CoA oxidase. The amount of ACOX increased and reached to the maximum activity by day 5 of germination but decreased about 4-fold on the following days during the subsequent microbody transition from glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes. By contrast, the amount of mRNA was already high at day 1 of germination, increased by about 30% at day 3, and faded completely by day 7. These data indicated that the expression pattern of ACOX was very similar to that of the glyoxysomal enzyme 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, another marker enzyme of the β-oxidation spiral, during germination and suggested that the expression of each enzyme of β-oxidation is coordinately regulated.

There are at least three types of microbodies in higher plants (glyoxysomes, leaf peroxisomes, and unspecialized microbodies) that are distinguishable by their enzyme complements (1Beevers H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1979; 30: 159-193Crossref Google Scholar, 2Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore T.S. Plant Peroxisome. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar). During the postgerminative growth of pumpkin seedlings and upon exposure to light, etiolated cotyledons turn green; at the same time, a functional transition from glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes occurs (3Titus D.E. Becker W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1288-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Nishimura M. Yamaguchi J. Mori H. Akazawa T. Yokota S. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 313-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fat-storing seeds of plants such as pumpkin, lipid bodies are present in seed cells that store triacylglycerols, which are subsequently converted to fatty acids by lipase. Fatty acids represent the main energy and carbon sources for germinating seedlings. In glyoxysomes, fatty acids are degraded to acetyl-CoA via the β-oxidation pathway, and acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the glyoxylate cycle bypassing the decarboxylating steps of the Krebs cycle. We have shown previously that the expression of glyoxysomal enzymes and leaf peroxisomal enzymes are regulated not only at the transcriptional level but also at the posttranscriptional level during the microbody transition (5Mori H. Takeda-Yoshikawa Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Tsugeki R. Hara-Nishimura I. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). The gene expressions of the enzymes of the β-oxidation and glyoxylate cycles seem to be coordinately regulated. In a recent paper, we reported the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA for 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (7Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 843-852Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The time course for thiolase mRNA and thiolase levels during germination and postgerminative growth implied that the regulation of expression of this enzyme is similar to that of glyoxylate cycle enzymes, e.g. malate synthase (8Mori H. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 163-166Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (9Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The glyoxysomal β-oxidation spiral consists of three different proteins: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), 1The abbreviations used are: ACOX, acyl-CoA oxidase; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; thiolase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; PRISCOX, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ACOX, acyl-CoA oxidase; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; thiolase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; PRISCOX, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bifunctional protein), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase). ACOX converts acyl-CoA into trans-2-enoyl-CoA in the first step of the β-oxidation spiral and corresponds to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase present in mitochondria of mammalian cells. Both enzymes are flavoproteins. Some plant ACOXs have been purified and characterized (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and have been shown to have different substrate specificities (for long, medium, and short chain acyl-CoAs, respectively). To further investigate the β-oxidation enzymes at the molecular level, we cloned a cDNA coding for a long chain ACOX, which is localized in glyoxysomes. Here, we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA. Developmental changes in the level of mRNA and protein were also determined in pumpkin cotyledons during seed germination and subsequent postgerminative growth.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we report the cDNA sequence of a pumpkin glyoxysomal long chain ACOX in addition to the cDNA sequence of a previously reported Phalaenopsis ACOX (21Do Y.Y. Huang P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The present results clearly show that the protein encoded by this gene is a plant long chain ACOX. The deduced amino acid sequences of pumpkin and Phalaenopsis cDNA sequences have an identity of 76%, indicating that the Phalaenopsis cDNA also codes for a long chain ACOX. Comparing other ACOXs, the best identity (30%) is obtained for the rat pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, which acts on 2-methyl-branched CoA-esters and straight long chain acyl-CoAs (22Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy J.C.T. Fransen M. De Béthune B. Mannaerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mammalian peroxisomes contain three ACOX isozymes that are not capable of oxidizing acyl-chain CoA esters of less than 8 carbons. In mammalian cells, the β-oxidation of short chain fatty acids is accomplished in mitochondria, in which acyl-CoA dehydrogenases act instead of ACOXs. Three peroxisomal mammalian ACOXs have been identified: PRISCOX (30% identity), palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (28% identity), which reacts with CoA esters of very long, long, and medium chain fatty acids (28Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase (29% identity), which oxidizes the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates dihydroxycoprostanic acid and trihydroxycoprostanic acid (29Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhove G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20065-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, plant peroxisomes seem to contain ACOXs that are active on short, medium, and long chain acyl-CoAs (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and are able to perform a complete β-oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA (2Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore T.S. Plant Peroxisome. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar). Three plant ACOX isozymes have previously been purified and characterized. One is from cucumber cotyledons that is active on long and medium chain acyl-CoAs and that is a homodimer with subunits of 72 kDa (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other two are from maize and are active on medium and short chain acyl-CoAs, respectively (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The former is a monomeric enzyme of 62 kDa, and the latter is a homotetrameric enzyme of 15 kDa. Three different genes seem to code for the three ACOX isoforms, as they have different subunit molecular weights (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The report by Hooks et al. (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was the first to imply the presence of a short chain ACOX in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian ACOX isoforms, nevertheless, show slightly different substrate preferences and seem to have very similar subunit molecular weights of about 75 kDa. Therefore, only the plant long chain ACOX should share common ancestral genes with the mammalian ACOXs.In the present study, we were able to correlate the sequence of the isolated ACOX clone with a long chain specific ACOX by applying an antiserum against the expressed ACOX/histidine-tagged fusion protein. This antiserum recognized only long chain and medium chain ACOX activity and not short chain ACOX activity when pumpkin enzymes were separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Fig. 4). The immunoreactive band corresponded to a molecular mass of 73 kDa in accordance with the calculated molecular mass of mature pumpkin long chain ACOX (72,414 Da) and with the previous report of 72 kDa for the cucumber long chain ACOX (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The levels of ACOX mRNA do not seem to be greatly controlled by light. The ACOX protein that built up during the initial 5 days of germination disappeared during the transition from glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes upon exposure of the seedlings to light. Similar patterns have previously been observed for malate synthase (8Mori H. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 163-166Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (9Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The appearance and disappearance of the mRNAs preceded the change in the ACOX protein during the microbody transition. Thus, the ACOX levels seem to be determined at both the translational and posttranslational levels.It is worth noting that pumpkin glyoxysomal long chain ACOX proteins are synthesized as larger precursors containing a cleavable amino-terminal presequence, namely PTS2 (27Kato A. Hayashi M. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1601-1611PubMed Google Scholar, 30Subramani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32483-32486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as in the case for some other plant peroxisomal proteins, such as malate dehydrogenase (23Gietl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5773-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Kato A. Takeda-Yoshikawa Y. Hayashi M. Kondo M. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), citrate synthase (9Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and thiolase (7Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 843-852Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Preisig-Müller R. Kindle H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 22: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In all cloned mammalian ACOXs, a carboxyl-terminal signal (PTS1) is present, but there is no PTS2 signal (31Gould S.J. Keller G.-A.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This indicates that the plant ACOX import mechanism differs from the mammalian one. It has been suggested that ACOX is a key enzyme of β-oxidation because it can control and regulate the flux of acyl-CoAs at the first step of the β-oxidation spiral (32Kindl H. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 9. Academic Press, New York1987: 31-52Google Scholar). Particularly, the long chain acyl-CoA oxidase may represent a regulatory point considering the fact that most fatty acids of plant storage lipids are long chain molecules. In conclusion, this type of control mechanism could tightly regulate the long chain ACOX (as the first step of the β-oxidation cascade), or it could be involved in a coordinate or differential regulation of the expression of the three ACOX enzymes in plant tissues (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To verify such a hypothesis, the cloning and an expression analysis of the two other ACOXs will be necessary. There are at least three types of microbodies in higher plants (glyoxysomes, leaf peroxisomes, and unspecialized microbodies) that are distinguishable by their enzyme complements (1Beevers H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1979; 30: 159-193Crossref Google Scholar, 2Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore T.S. Plant Peroxisome. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar). During the postgerminative growth of pumpkin seedlings and upon exposure to light, etiolated cotyledons turn green; at the same time, a functional transition from glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes occurs (3Titus D.E. Becker W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1288-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Nishimura M. Yamaguchi J. Mori H. Akazawa T. Yokota S. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 313-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fat-storing seeds of plants such as pumpkin, lipid bodies are present in seed cells that store triacylglycerols, which are subsequently converted to fatty acids by lipase. Fatty acids represent the main energy and carbon sources for germinating seedlings. In glyoxysomes, fatty acids are degraded to acetyl-CoA via the β-oxidation pathway, and acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the glyoxylate cycle bypassing the decarboxylating steps of the Krebs cycle. We have shown previously that the expression of glyoxysomal enzymes and leaf peroxisomal enzymes are regulated not only at the transcriptional level but also at the posttranscriptional level during the microbody transition (5Mori H. Takeda-Yoshikawa Y. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Tsugeki R. Hara-Nishimura I. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). The gene expressions of the enzymes of the β-oxidation and glyoxylate cycles seem to be coordinately regulated. In a recent paper, we reported the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA for 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (7Kato A. Hayashi M. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 22: 843-852Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The time course for thiolase mRNA and thiolase levels during germination and postgerminative growth implied that the regulation of expression of this enzyme is similar to that of glyoxylate cycle enzymes, e.g. malate synthase (8Mori H. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 163-166Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (9Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The glyoxysomal β-oxidation spiral consists of three different proteins: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), 1The abbreviations used are: ACOX, acyl-CoA oxidase; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; thiolase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; PRISCOX, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: ACOX, acyl-CoA oxidase; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; thiolase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase; PRISCOX, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (bifunctional protein), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase). ACOX converts acyl-CoA into trans-2-enoyl-CoA in the first step of the β-oxidation spiral and corresponds to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase present in mitochondria of mammalian cells. Both enzymes are flavoproteins. Some plant ACOXs have been purified and characterized (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and have been shown to have different substrate specificities (for long, medium, and short chain acyl-CoAs, respectively). To further investigate the β-oxidation enzymes at the molecular level, we cloned a cDNA coding for a long chain ACOX, which is localized in glyoxysomes. Here, we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA. Developmental changes in the level of mRNA and protein were also determined in pumpkin cotyledons during seed germination and subsequent postgerminative growth. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we report the cDNA sequence of a pumpkin glyoxysomal long chain ACOX in addition to the cDNA sequence of a previously reported Phalaenopsis ACOX (21Do Y.Y. Huang P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The present results clearly show that the protein encoded by this gene is a plant long chain ACOX. The deduced amino acid sequences of pumpkin and Phalaenopsis cDNA sequences have an identity of 76%, indicating that the Phalaenopsis cDNA also codes for a long chain ACOX. Comparing other ACOXs, the best identity (30%) is obtained for the rat pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, which acts on 2-methyl-branched CoA-esters and straight long chain acyl-CoAs (22Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy J.C.T. Fransen M. De Béthune B. Mannaerts G.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mammalian peroxisomes contain three ACOX isozymes that are not capable of oxidizing acyl-chain CoA esters of less than 8 carbons. In mammalian cells, the β-oxidation of short chain fatty acids is accomplished in mitochondria, in which acyl-CoA dehydrogenases act instead of ACOXs. Three peroxisomal mammalian ACOXs have been identified: PRISCOX (30% identity), palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (28% identity), which reacts with CoA esters of very long, long, and medium chain fatty acids (28Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase (29% identity), which oxidizes the CoA esters of the bile acid intermediates dihydroxycoprostanic acid and trihydroxycoprostanic acid (29Van Veldhoven P.P. Vanhove G. Asselberghs S. Eyssen H.J. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20065-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, plant peroxisomes seem to contain ACOXs that are active on short, medium, and long chain acyl-CoAs (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and are able to perform a complete β-oxidation of fatty acids to acetyl-CoA (2Huang A.H.C. Trelease R.N. Moore T.S. Plant Peroxisome. Academic Press, New York1983Google Scholar). Three plant ACOX isozymes have previously been purified and characterized. One is from cucumber cotyledons that is active on long and medium chain acyl-CoAs and that is a homodimer with subunits of 72 kDa (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other two are from maize and are active on medium and short chain acyl-CoAs, respectively (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The former is a monomeric enzyme of 62 kDa, and the latter is a homotetrameric enzyme of 15 kDa. Three different genes seem to code for the three ACOX isoforms, as they have different subunit molecular weights (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The report by Hooks et al. (11Hooks M.A. Bode K. Couée I. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was the first to imply the presence of a short chain ACOX in eukaryotic cells. Mammalian ACOX isoforms, nevertheless, show slightly different substrate preferences and seem to have very similar subunit molecular weights of about 75 kDa. Therefore, only the plant long chain ACOX should share common ancestral genes with the mammalian ACOXs.In the present study, we were able to correlate the sequence of the isolated ACOX clone with a long chain specific ACOX by applying an antiserum against the expressed ACOX/histidine-tagged fusion protein. This antiserum recognized only long chain and medium chain ACOX activity and not short chain ACOX activity when pumpkin enzymes were separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Fig. 4). The immunoreactive band corresponded to a molecular mass of 73 kDa in accordance with the calculated molecular mass of mature pumpkin long chain ACOX (72,414 Da) and with the previous report of 72 kDa for the cucumber long chain ACOX (10Kirsch T. Löffler H.-G. Kindl H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8570-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The levels of ACOX mRNA do not seem to be greatly controlled by light. The ACOX protein that built up during the initial 5 days of germination disappeared during the transition from glyoxysomes to leaf peroxisomes upon exposure of the seedlings to light. Similar patterns have previously been observed for malate synthase (8Mori H. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 163-166Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and citrate synthase (9Kato A. Hayashi M. Mori H. Nishimura M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2079460837,"An open reading frame, ORF3, first identified adjacent to the mycocerosic acid synthase gene in Mycobacterium bovis BCG encodes a protein with acyl-CoA synthase (ACoAS) activity. Genes homologous to acoas are found adjacent to other multifunctional polyketide synthase genes in the mycobacterial genome. To test whether these gene products are necessary to esterify the fatty acids generated by the adjacent polyketide synthase gene products, the acoas gene was disrupted in M. bovis BCG using a suicide vector containing the acoas gene with an internal deletion and the hygromycin-resistant gene as selection marker. Allelic exchange at the acoas locus was confirmed by Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction amplification of both flanking regions expected from homologous recombination. Immunoblot analysis indicated that the 65-kDa ACoAS protein product was absent in the mutant. Chromatographic analysis of lipids derived from [1-14C]propionate showed that the mutant did not produce mycocerosyl lipids, although it produced normal levels of mycocerosic acid synthase. These results suggest that ACoAS is involved in the synthesis of mycocerosyl lipids of the mycobacterial cell wall.

Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, accounting for approximately 26% of all preventable adult deaths in the world. It is estimated that approximately 0.6 billion people are infected with the causative agent,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with 8–10 million new cases and 3 million deaths occurring annually (1Fenton M.J. Vermeulen M.W. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 683-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mycobacterial cell walls have a very high lipid content (50–60%), which constitutes an effective permeability barrier to antimycobacterial therapies and contributes to the survival of this pathogen within the host (2Collins F.M. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, conventional antimycobacterial treatments largely directed against cell wall lipids unique to pathogenic mycobacteria have been rendered less effective because of the increasing incidence of multidrug resistance. The increased incidence of tuberculosis associated with the AIDS pandemic has provided an added impetus to identify alternative targets that would allow for the development of novel therapeutic drugs (3Bloom B.R. Murray C. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar,4Young D.B. Cole S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other classes of cell wall lipids found solely in pathogenic mycobacteria include the phenolphthiocerols (mycosides) and the phthiocerols (5Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, NY1982: 95-184Google Scholar, 6Daffe M. Laneelle M.-A. Biochim. Biophys.

In each of these lipid classes, multimethyl-branched long chain fatty acids, known as mycocerosic acids, are esterified to two long chain diols, the phenolphthiocerols and the phthiocerols, respectively (5Minnikin D.E.

(11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes homologous to acoas have been identified adjacent to the mas gene in M. tuberculosis(GenBankTM accession number Z83858) and Mycobacterium leprae (GenBankTM accession number U00010), as well as 5′ to a polyketide synthase gene and 3′ to a mas-like gene in M. tuberculosis (GenBankTM accession numbersZ74697, U00024, and Z77826). Given the high degree of homology among these genes (54–99% identity; 69–99% similarity), it seems likely that all these genes play a role in acyl transfer. The multiplicity and relative location of these genes adjacent to large polyketide synthase-like enzymes lead us to speculate that their gene products may be involved in the selective transfer of the acyl products of the neighboring synthase genes either directly or indirectly to the ultimate biological acceptors (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified MAS fails to release mycocerosic acids, and mycocerosic acids are not found free in the cytosol but instead are esterified to the diols, which suggests the involvement of a separate transferase enzyme (12Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible interaction of the mas and acoas gene products may be facilitated by their co-localization on the cell wall; immunogold labeling experiments indicate that MAS is associated with the cell membrane (13Kolattukudy P.E. Fernandes N.D. Azad A.K. Fitzmaurice A.M. Sirakova T.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and recent results also suggest that the ACoAS protein may be loosely bound to the membrane (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies indicated that purified ACoAS protein catalyzed the activation of mycocerosic acids to their corresponding thioesters only at extremely low rates. Furthermore, ACoAS failed to stimulate MAS activity and did not cause measurable release of mycocerosic acids either in the free form or as phthiocerol derivatives when phenolphthiocerol or glycosylated phenolphthiocerol was provided as acceptor (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although such in vitro reconstitution experiments failed to reveal the function of ACoAS, additional factors may be necessary for this protein to function in the transfer of mycocerosic acids to the diol acceptors. The recent development and application of targeted gene disruption technology to slow growing mycobacterial species (10Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol.

In this paper, we report the targeted disruption of the acoas gene in M. bovis BCG and show that this mutant is incapable of producing mycocerosyl lipids, although it has normal levels of mycocerosic acid synthase activity. These results suggest that acoas-like genes function in the transfer of acyl groups, generated by the products of adjacent polyketide synthase genes, to their ultimate biological acceptors. Strain descriptions and cultivation conditions for all the mycobacterial and Escherichia coli strains used in this study have been presented previously (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pUC19-based plasmid, D2, which had previously been subcloned from a MAS-containing M. tuberculosis BCG cosmid (10Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16741-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), contained the entire 1.749-kb coding region of the acoas gene, 0.8-kb 5′-flanking region and 0.4-kb 3′-flanking region. A 181-base pairBglII fragment internal to the acoas gene was deleted and replaced with the hygromycin gene (hyg) fromStreptomyces hygroscopicus. The hyg gene was excised as a 1.8-kb BglII fragment from plasmid pIJ963 (donated by Dr. John Hopwood, John Innes Center, Norwich, United Kingdom) and ligated with BglII digested D2, creating plasmid pORF3C35. The structure of this construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion, Southern hybridization analysis, and sequencing of the ligation junctions. Mid-log phase BCG cultures were subjected to glycine treatment and electroporated with 2 μg of XbaI digested pORF3C35 using previously outlined transformation parameters (17Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant transformants were selected on Middlebrook 7H11 plates (Difco) supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose complex (Difco) and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) (Calbiochem) following incubation at 37 °C for 3–4 weeks. High molecular weight chromosomal DNA was isolated according to the method of Jacobs et al. (17Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). DNA samples were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran Plus, Schleicher and Schuell), and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes according to standard protocols (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To screen hygromycin resistant M. bovis BCG transformants for homologous recombination, PCR amplification was performed directly on crude lysate of boiled cells. PCR amplification using standard protocols (Perkin Elmer) and Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) was performed using the following primer pairs: 5′-CGCGTTTAATAGCGCCCAGTCTAG-3′ (A) and 5′-TTGAACTAGCGGCACGAAGAACAA-3′ (B); 5′-CGGCGACGTCGTCAAGGAACCCAC-3′ (C) and 5′GACACCGCCCCCGGCGCCTGACGC-3′ (H1); 5′ CGGCCAGCGTCCAAGAAAATACCG-3′ (D) and 5′-TGGACCTCGACGACCTGCAGGCAT-3′ (H2); 5′-TGATCCGACCGATGATGAAC-3′ (E) and 5′-ACGGCGACAACGTCGGTAAT-3′ (F). Na[1-14C]propionate (25 μCi, specific activity 55 Ci/mole) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, MO) was added to 100 ml of 12-day-old cultures and incubation was continued at 37 °C in roller bottles for a further 18 h. Cell pellets, collected following centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, were extracted with an excess of chloroform:methanol (2:1) at room temperature. Total lipids were extracted by the Folch method (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed for 14C in Scintiverse BD using a Beckman LS3801 liquid scintillation spectrometer. Total lipids were separated on silica gel G plates (20 × 20-cm, 0.5-mm depth) using either chloroform:methanol (95:5) or n-hexane:ethyl ether (90:10) as solvent systems. Lipids were visualized by spraying chromatograms with 5% K2Cr2O7 in 50% sulfuric acid and heating at 180 °C for 10 min. 14C-Labeled lipids were detected by scanning chromatograms in a Berthold Tracemaster 20 TLC linear analyzer and by autoradiography. Silica gel containing labeled phenolphthiocerol and phthiocerol compounds was removed and lipid material eluted with ethyl ether. These lipids were refluxed with 5% KOH in 2-methoxyethanol containing 12% H2O for 3 h, the mixture was acidified with HCl, extracted with chloroform and the organic solvent was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was refluxed with 14% BF3 in methanol for 2 h and the products, recovered by chloroform extraction after quenching the reaction mixture with the addition of water, were subjected to thin-layer chromatography on silica gel G plates with n-hexane:diethyl ether (90:10) as the solvent. Methyl esters were extracted and analyzed by radio-gas chromatography using a Varian model 3300 gas chromatograph and a Lablogic GC-RAM radioactivity monitor (INUS Systems) operated under previously described parameters (16Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells from 500 ml of 12-day-old cultures of the wild type and acoas mutant strains were harvested by centrifugation, disrupted in a French press, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. Proteins present in the high speed supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE on either a 3.5% stacking and 10% separating gel (ACoAS analysis) or a 3% stacking and 5% separating gel (MAS analysis) and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, electrophoresed proteins were transblotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAS and ACoAS antibodies were diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively, and 125I-labeled protein A was used as the secondary detection reagent. The cell-free extract was fractionated on a 1.8 × 12.5-cm DEAE-Sephadex (Sigma A25) column, and the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mmEDTA. Proteins were eluted with a 0.1–0.7 m potassium phosphate buffer gradient (5 bed volumes at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min) and the MAS-containing fractions were identified by slot-blot analysis using the MAS specific antibody and the Supersignal ULTRA chemiluminescent detection system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). MAS-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM30 membrane (Amicon, MA). MAS activity was quantified using labeled methylmalonyl-CoA as described previously (12Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activity is expressed as picomoles of methylmalonyl-CoA incorporated into hexane-extractable material per minute per milligram of protein. ACoAS activity was determined by quantifying the amount of fatty acyl-CoA in the aqueous phase following extraction of the reaction mixtures with organic solvents as described (21Kameda K. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5702-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACoAS activity is expressed in units of fatty acyl-CoA formed per milligram of protein. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme which forms 1 nmol of fatty acyl-CoA per minute. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. To examine the role of ACoAS in cell wall lipid metabolism, disruption of the acoas gene in M. bovis BCG was undertaken by allelic exchange. A pUC-based suicide plasmid, pORF3C35, was constructed containing the entire 1.749-kb acoas-coding region, 0.8-kb 5′-flanking region and 0.4-kb 3′-flanking region. An internal 181-base pair BglII fragment of acoaswas replaced with a 1.8-kb hygromycin gene (hyg) as the selectable marker. Hygromycin-resistant transformants, generated with the linearized plasmid, were screened by PCR using a set of primers flanking the deleted internal segment of acoas (Fig.1, primers A and B). This primer pair generates a single 0.7-kb PCR product from the wild type strain, 0.7-kb and 2.4-kb products in a mutant generated from a single crossover homologous recombination event, and a single 2.4-kb product in a mutant generated from double crossover homologous recombination. Analysis of approximately 500 hygromycin-resistant transformant colonies using this PCR screening strategy identified four mutants with single crossover events and two mutants with double crossover events. PCR amplification of representative single and double crossover mutants (RF3147 and RF320, respectively) using primers A and B is depicted in Fig.2.Figure 2Screening of M. bovis BCG hygromycin-resistant transformants for disruption of the acoas gene by homologous recombination.

The 1-kb ladder was used as size marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Disruption of acoas by allelic exchange was confirmed by further PCR analysis using two other sets of primers, each containing ahyg primer and a primer in the mycobacterial genome directly outside the acoas-flanking segments used to make the disruption construct (Fig. 1, primer pairs C and H1, and D and H2). In mutant RF320, these primer pairs generated 2.3- and 1.2-kb PCR products, respectively, sizes consistent with homologous recombination by double crossover, whereas in mutant RF3147 only the larger PCR product was obtained, indicating that integration of the disruption construct occurred at the 5′ end of the acoas gene (Fig.3 A). To confirm that the PCR products generated from either side of the hyg gene represent genuine acoas-flanking segments, regions representing the 5′ and 3′ ends of acoas were used to probe these PCR products. As anticipated, the 5′ probe hybridized only with the 2.3-kb PCR product and the 3′ probe hybridized only with the 1.2-kb product (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, primers specific for the internal deleted segment of acoas (Fig. 1,primers E and F) failed to amplify this region in mutant RF320, whereas a 167-base pair fragment was present in both the wild type and mutant RF3147 (Fig.4 A). The identities of these PCR products were confirmed by hybridization with the internalBglII fragment deleted from acoas (Fig.4 B).Figure 4A, PCR amplification of genomic DNA fromM. bovis BCG wild type and mutant strains with primers E and F.

The 123-base pair ladder was used as marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Southern hybridization analysis confirmed that replacement of the acoas gene had occurred by allelic exchange in mutant RF320. When genomic DNA from the wild type and mutant strains was digested with BamHI and SphI, which results in excision of the hygromycin element from RF320, the wild type produced a single hybridization band at approximately 3 kb; RF3147 yielded three hybridization bands at 3, 2.2, and 0.8 kb; and RF320 produced two bands at 2.2 and 0.8 kb. This result is consistent with integration of the hyg-disrupted acoas gene and replacement of the wild type allele in mutant RF320 (Fig.5). When total proteins from the wild type and mutant RF320 were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an ACoAS specific antibody, the wild type showed a specific cross-reacting band of approximately 65 kDa, whereas this hybridizing band was not visible in the acoas-disrupted mutant (Fig. 6). This mutant expressed ACoAS activity at approximately 20% of wild type levels (0.17 units/mg protein versus 0.85 units/mg protein in the wild type) when14C-labeled palmitic acid was used as the substrate. Therefore disruption of the acoas gene in mutant RF320 results in a failure to express a functional 65-kDa protein that encodes acyl-CoA synthase activity. To examine the effect of acoas gene disruption on the synthesis of mycocerosyl lipids in M. bovis BCG, incorporation of [1-14C]propionate into total lipids was examined in both the wild type and acoas-disrupted mutant. After 18 h of incubation, approximately 18 and 6% of the total administered 14C was incorporated into total lipids by the wild type and acoas-disrupted mutant, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography identified two major labeled lipid fractions in the wild type that corresponded to phenolphthiocerol esters (mycosides) and phthiocerol esters. However, in the acoas-disrupted mutant only the phthiocerol ester fraction was present (Fig. 7, left). Charring of chromatograms showed that only phthiocerol esters but not mycosides were present in the acoas-disrupted mutant, whereas the wild type contained both (Fig. 7, right). Approximately equal amounts of label were present in the mycosides and phthiocerol esters in the wild type (approximately 46 and 48%, respectively), whereas in the mutant the bulk of the label (approximately 75%) was in the phthiocerol esters. Following base hydrolysis, the majority of the label in both strains (in excess of 80%) was found in the acyl portion of the lipids. Radio-gas chromatographic analysis of the methyl esters from the mycosides in the wild type indicated that 14C-labeled propionate was predominantly incorporated into C29 and C32mycocerosic acids, whereas this fraction was missing from the acoas-disrupted mutant. The phthiocerol ester fraction of the wild type also contained significant quantities of the C29 and C32 mycocerosic acids, whereas only shorter chain fatty acids were present in the corresponding fraction from the acoas disruptant (Fig.8). Thus, mycocerosic acids generated by MAS were not found in the lipids of the acoas-disrupted mutant.Figure 8Radio gas-liquid chromatograms of methyl esters from the phthiocerol esters derived from [1-14C]propionate in M. bovis BCG wild type and the ACoAS disruptant RF320.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis indicated that a similar level of MAS protein was produced in both the wild type and the ACoAS-disrupted mutant (Fig. 9). In addition, MAS protein, partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose fractionation from the ACoAS disruptant, incorporated radiolabeled methylmalonyl-CoA into mycocerosic acids at a level similar to that observed with the wild type strain (approximately 34 pmol of methylmalonyl-CoA incorporated per min per mg protein) and radio-gas chromatographic analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters generated by both the wild type and mutant strains were identical (Fig.10).Figure 10Radio gas-liquid chromatograms of methyl esters synthesized from [methyl-14C] methylmalonyl-CoA by MAS protein partially purified by DEAE-Sepharose fractionation from M. bovis BCG wild type (A) and ACoAS disruptant RF320 (B).

Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) usingn-C20-CoA primer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The process by which pathogenic mycobacteria transfer multimethyl-branched mycocerosic acids onto the diol acceptors on the cell wall is poorly understood. Previous results indicate that the M. bovis BCG mas gene lacks a chain-terminating thioesterase domain (9Mathur M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that mycocerosic acids remain attached to the synthase (12Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mycocerosic acids are found exclusively as esters of phenolphthiocerol and phthiocerol (7Daffe M. Laneelle M.-A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of a separate transferase system that mediates direct transfer of the newly synthesized mycocerosic acids from the synthase to the diol acceptors. Recently, we identified a small open reading frame at the 5′ end of the mas gene, ORF3, which displays distinct homology to a number of ACoAS-like enzymes and purified ORF3 protein has ACoAS activity (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not demonstrate the involvement of ACoAS in the in vitro activation of mycocerosic acids, mycocerosic acid release from MAS, or transfer of mycocerosyl groups from MAS to the diols (11Fitzmaurice A.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we resorted to the in vivo disruption of acoas to determine the possible role played by this gene in mycocerosyl lipid synthesis. The recent successful application of allelic exchange technology to slow-growing mycobacterial species made such an approach feasible. To date, reciprocal recombination has been achieved using the masgene (16Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the pps gene cluster (10Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16741-16745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the ureC gene (14Reyrat J.-M. Berthet F.-X. Gicquel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8768-8772Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in M. bovis BCG, and the leuD gene in M. tuberculosis (15Balasubramanian V. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Bardarov S.S. Martin J. Weisbrod T.R. McAdam R.A. Bloom B.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 273-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the following evidence clearly showed that the M. bovis BCG acoas gene was disrupted by homologous recombination. Mutant RF320 lacks the internal segment deleted from the acoas gene, contains the hyg gene, and PCR amplification using a combination of hyg and flanking primers show that the disrupted allele has integrated into the correct region on the mycobacterial genome. Furthermore, the mutant fails to produce the 65-kDa protein encoded by acoas and has a drastically decreased ACoAS activity. Disruption of the acoas gene in M. bovis BCG results in the production of a mutant that lacks the ability to produce mycosides and mycocerosyl phthiocerol esters. Radiolabeling studies with [1-14C]propionate, used to specifically label mycocerosic acids, show that even though mycocerosylated phenolphthiocerol esters are abundant in the wild type, this fraction is absent in the acoas disruptant. In addition, an examination of charred chromatograms confirms the total absence of mycoside production in the mutant. Radio-gas chromatography indicates that mycocerosic acids are significant components of the phthiocerol wax esters in the wild type strain. However, in the ACoAS disruptant mycocerosyl phthiocerols were not present; only shorter chain fatty acids were esterified to the phthiocerols. Studies using the acoas mutant clearly show that this strain produces mycocerosic acid synthase. Partial purification of MAS by anion-exchange chromatography from the wild type and mutant strains yielded similar elution profiles. The purified proteins from both strains were discernible at similar levels following SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis, displayed comparable specific activities, and generated similar relative proportions of radiolabeled products from methylmalonyl-CoA. Therefore, it appears that while mycocerosic acid synthase is produced at wild type levels in the mutant, mycocerosic acids are not esterified onto the diol acceptors on the cell wall. This finding directly implicates ACoAS in the process by which mycocerosic acids are incorporated onto the diol acceptors in the cell wall of M. bovis BCG. With mandatory coupling of the synthesis and transfer, MAS would be unable to produce mycocerosic acids in the absence of a functional transfer mechanism. Alternatively, it is also possible that disruption of acoas affected the supply of the acyl-CoA primers required for the elongation of methylmalonyl-CoA by MAS and thus prevented mycocerosyl lipid synthesis. We consider this an unlikely possibility because highly homologous acoas genes are present near other polyketide synthase-like genes in the mycobacterial genome and these acoas genes are likely to encode acyl-CoA synthases that would have substituted for the disrupted one unless there is strict substrate specificity. Considering the composition of the long chain methyl-branched fatty acids present in the mycobacteria, C16, C18, and C20primers would be adequate for the synthesis of all of these acids. If the acyl-CoA synthases encoded by the multiple acoas genes produce any of these primers, mycocerosic acids or their homologues would have been produced by the mutant as MAS is known to be able to use any of these primers (12Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 616-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand it would appear more likely that the acoas products are specific for the transfer of the elongated acids generated by the synthases encoded by the gene adjacent to each acoas in the genome. Such a specificity may not only depend on the nature of the acyl chain but also on the interaction of this enzyme with a membrane bound partner that is probably involved in the acyl transfer to the final acceptor. The observed lack of mycocerosyl lipids in the acoasdisruptant is consistent with the participation of ACoAS in mycocerosyl transfer to the diols. Previous studies have shown that only mycocerosic acids are esterified to phenolphthiocerol and that shorter chain fatty acids cannot substitute in the acylation steps; amas mutant that lacks the ability to synthesize mycocerosic acids also fails to generate any mycosides or mycocerosic acid-containing phthiocerols (16Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that unlike MAS, a purified synthase that produces short chain branched acids releases its products directly as free fatty acids (23Fernandes N.F. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2823-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which can then be esterified directly to the acceptors without requiring a separate ACoAS transfer system. Therefore, in the absence of a coupling of shorter chain branched fatty acid synthase and ACoAS transferase activities, disruption of ACoAS still permits synthesis of shorter chain fatty acids and their subsequent incorporation into the phthiocerol esters. A possible explanation for the inability of ACoAS to cause mycocerosic acid transfer from MAS to the diols in vitro may be that this enzyme alone is not sufficient to effect transfer. In E. coli, ACoAS forms a transient membrane complex with a separate acyltransferase to promote the direct transfer of acyl moieties from enzyme bound fatty acyl-CoA to the transferase (24Greenway D.L.A.

At the C terminus of the mas gene, a short open reading frame has been identified which shares homology with polyketide synthase-type condensation enzymes that are involved in ester and amide bond synthesis (9Mathur M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25de Crécy-Lagard V. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. Pergamon Press, 1998Google Scholar). This enzyme may function with ACoAS in transferring mycocerosic acids from MAS to the diols without involving release of free acids and activation of such released acids as discrete separate steps. Genes displaying homology to the M. bovis BCGacoas gene have been identified adjacent to mas(GenBankTM accession number Z83858), mas-like genes (GenBankTM accession numbers Z77826 and Z97188) and polyketide synthase-like genes (GenBankTM accession numbersU00024, Z74697, and Z84725) in the M. tuberculosis genome. An acoas homologue is also present on the M. leprae genome adjacent to mas (GenBankTMaccession number U00010). Overall, acoas-like genes located adjacent to polyketide synthases display 45–99% identity. Despite this high degree of conservation, acoas-like genes do not appear to be functionally interchangeable. We succeeded in creating a stable M. bovis BCG mutant with an altered pattern of lipid metabolism even though the other acoas-like genes were presumably intact in this mutant. The presence of additionalacoas-like genes in the vicinity of large multifunctional polyketide synthases further supports our suggestion that the product of each acoas-like gene functions specifically with the products of the neighboring synthase gene to directly transfer their products to the appropriate acceptors on the mycobacterial cell wall. Termination of a biosynthetic process, catalyzed by the product of a multifunctional synthase gene, by a small protein encoded by an adjacent open reading frame appears to be a commonly used mechanism not only in the synthesis and assembly of complex polyketides but also in the synthesis of other natural products. A coupling of multifunctional synthase and transferase activities is believed to occur during gramicidin biosynthesis; a thioesterase-like domain, located at the 5′ end of the gramicidin synthase gene and displaying homology to fatty acid thioesterases, has been suggested to function as a transacylase in the chain termination step (26Kratzschmar J.

Similar mechanisms also appear to be involved in the synthesis of nonribosomal peptide synthases such as δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthase, which is involved in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis (28MacCabe A.P. van Liempt H.

Thompson C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4454-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mycobacteria each acoas-like gene, located adjacent to each of the many multifunctional polyketide synthases, probably functions at the terminal step to channel the product of the synthase to the appropriate acceptor in the cell wall as demonstrated in this paper for mycocerosyl lipid synthesis.

Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) encodes proteins in addition to Gag, Pol, and Env that are packaged into virus particles. One such retroviral-incorporated protein is Vpr, which is present in all primate lentiviruses. Vpr has been implicated in different roles within the HIV-1 life cycle. In testing a new hypothesis in which viral proteins are utilized as docking sites to incorporate protein moieties into virions, we used the peptide phage display approach to search for Vpr-specific binding peptides. In the present studies, we demonstrate that most of the peptides that bind to Vpr have a common motif, WXXF. More importantly, we demonstrate that the WXXF motif of uracil DNA glycosylase is implicated in the interaction of uracil DNA glycosylase with Vpr intracellularly. Finally, a dimer of the WXXF motif was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene, and it was demonstrated that the WXXF dimer-CAT fusion protein construct produces CAT activity within virions in the presence of Vpr as a docking protein. This study provides a novel potential strategy in the targeting of anti-viral agents to interfere with HIV-1 replication.

HIV-1 has a complex viral life cycle and utilizes multiple cellular and virally encoded regulatory proteins to tightly control its replication (1Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The essential retroviral enzymes, reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, protease (PR), and integrase, lack cellular counterparts and have been used as targets for developing agents that inhibit virus replication (2Debouck C. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 3Ridky T. Leis J. J. Biol.

Despite considerable advances in anti-reverse transcriptase and PR therapy, it is obvious that ongoing genetic changes of the virus can confer drug resistance (5Richman D.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 21: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This problem has led to proposals for alternative therapeutic strategies.Specific cellular compartment localization of therapeutic moieties influences their desired functions. Cytoplasmically localized anti-HIV-1 integrase single chain variable fragments inhibit HIV-1 infection of T-lymphocytes more potently than anti-integrase single chain variable fragments that are concentrated in nuclei (6Levy-Mintz P. Duan L. Zhang H. Hu B. Dornadula G. Zhu M. Kulkosky J. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A.M. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8821-8832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As well, functional ribozymes have also been tested by targeting these moieties into murine leukemia virus virions in comparison with cytoplasmically localized ribozymes (7Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The concept of incorporation of foreign proteins into retrovirus particles has previously been reported, utilizing fusion with HIV-1 Gag and Vpr (8Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Kim J. Seshaiah P. Natsoulis G.

Sorting of most cellular proteins into specific cellular compartments is determined by protein-protein interactions through specific domains (7Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Membrane protein docking with target protein signal domains can incorporate target proteins into either the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria (7Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Applying this target protein docking model for further molecular analyses is now possible due to the development of the phage display system. 2Y. Xue, B. Hu, Z. Yu, W. Li, R. J. Pomerantz, and L-X. Duan, manuscript in preparation. 2Y. Xue, B. Hu, Z. Yu, W. Li, R. J. Pomerantz, and L-X. Duan, manuscript in preparation. Short peptide libraries can be generated, and panning against any target protein for searching specific binding peptides can be accomplished. By engineering the target protein binding peptide into specific protein moieties, it should be possible to deliver the binding peptide protein fusion moieties into specific cellular or viral compartments.HIV-1 encodes proteins in addition to Gag, Pol, and Env that are packaged into virus particles. These include Vpr, which is present in all primate lentiviruses (14Tristem M. Marshall C. Karpas A. Hill F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3405-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The virion-associated protein, Vpr, has been studied extensively with respect to understanding its role in lentivirus infection. Vpr is expressed relatively late in the viral life cycle and encodes a 14-kDa protein (15Wong-Staal F. Chanda P.K. Ghrayeb J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that is predominantly localized in the nucleus of infected cells (16Lu Y.L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpr has been reported to be incorporated into viral particles at molar quantities (16Lu Y.L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (p6 region) of the Gag polyprotein precursor, p55, plays a role in the packaging of Vpr into virions (18Lavallee C. Yao X.J. Ladha A. Gottlinger H. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kondo E. Gottlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lu Y.L. Bennett R.P. Wills J.W.

None of these publications have shown evidence for a direct interaction between Vpr and p6 proteins. Recently, several groups have shown a direct interaction between Vpr and the nucleocapsid protein, p7 (22Lim Tung H.Y. De Rocquigny H. Zhao L.J. Cayla X. Roques B.P. Ozon R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23De Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) show that the interaction between Ncp7 and Vpr occurs in vitro by a recognition mechanism requiring the zinc fingers of Ncp7 and the last 16 amino acids of Vpr (23De Rocquigny H.

The authors suggest that Ncp7 cooperates, possibly with p6, to induce Vpr encapsidation in mature HIV-1 particles (23De Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several biological functions of Vpr have been defined. It has been shown that Vpr is essential for optimal infection of macrophages (24Balliet J.W. Kolson D.L. Eiger G. Kim F.M. McGann K.A. Srinivasan A. Collman R.

Virol. 1992; 66: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vpr has been reported to influence the nuclear transport of the viral preintegration complex (27Heinzinger N.K. Bukinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar).

Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Vpr is capable of inducing apoptosis after cell cycle arrest. Other recent studies indicate that the Vpr protein can also associate with cellular proteins, such as glucocorticoid receptors (39Refaeli Y. Levy D.N. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3621-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the transcription factors Sp1 and TFIIB (28Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Rey F. BouHamdan M. Spire B. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Mol.

Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Since the highly conserved HIV-1 Vpr protein can be packaged in quantities within virions similar to those of the major structural proteins, this accessory protein may be used as a docking target to deliver anti-viral agents or other foreign proteins to progeny virus. In an attempt to understand how Vpr can interact with different viral and cellular proteins that are implicated in diverse virological and cell biological pathways, we used the “peptide phage-display” methodology to determine whether any common binding motif is shared among those proteins. We demonstrate that most of the peptides that bind to Vpr contain a common motif, WXXF. In this report, the domain-specific intracellular interactions of the WXXF with Vpr were further confirmed by utilizing a variety of complementary systems. Finally, to evaluate the feasibility of this peptide-based docking strategy, we have constructed a WXXF-CAT fusion protein and analyzed the ability of this fusion construct to be packaged into HIV-1 particles through interaction with Vpr. Our results show that the WXXF-CAT fusion protein is incorporated into HIV-1 particles through a Vpr-dependent docking mechanism. This study represents a new approach in the targeting of anti-viral agents with the ability to potentially interfere with HIV-1 replication.DISCUSSIONThe highly conserved HIV-1 Vpr protein expressed in the late stage of viral production (15Wong-Staal F. Chanda P.K. Ghrayeb J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and incorporated into virions (16Lu Y.L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was an ideal target for testing the docking protein model for intravirion protein delivery. HIV-1 Vpr functional studies also show that this protein has a diverse phenotype via interactions with multiple cellular or viral structural proteins (22Lim Tung H.Y. De Rocquigny H. Zhao L.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These multiple interactions indicate the possibility of Vpr-protein binding through specific domains, which may be carried in the different target proteins.To identify such potential Vpr-specific binding domains, random peptide libraries constructed in a phage-display system were used for initial screening. Subsequently, each of the identified Vpr-binding peptides were further confirmed by using the yeast two-hybrid system for intracellular interactions of Vpr and peptides. More than 32 different Vpr binding phages were identified after a third round of panning using both denatured His-Vpr or native GST-Vpr fusion proteins in different panning systems.2 Interestingly, the great majority of the peptides binding to Vpr revealed by these assays contained a consensus motif, WXXF. Intracellular binding of Vpr and peptides was subsequently confirmed from 10 selected Vpr-binding phage-displayed peptides by using the yeast two-hybrid system. Computer searching with the WXXF motif against protein data bases revealed several cellular proteins containing the WXXF motif. One of these, UDG, the major uracil DNA glycosylase in human cells (47Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), has been reported in our recent work and has demonstrated that UDG specifically binds to Vpr (40BouHamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, we now demonstrate that the WXXF motif of UDG is implicated in the interaction of UDG with the Vpr protein, as mutants of the UDG motif bind differentially to Vpr. The mutant F225G lost its ability to interact with Vpr, and the mutant W222G lost more than 60% of the binding with Vpr. However, we could not exclude the participation of the first or second Xof the WXXF motif in the interaction, since an appropriate conformation of the WXXF motif may be important. It is unclear at present why Vpr interacts with UDG, a DNA repair enzyme. A recent report excludes the involvement of UDG in contributing to G2 arrest of cells. Mutational analysis of Vpr showed that binding to UDG is neither necessary nor sufficient for its effect on the cell cycle (52Selig L. Benichou S. Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Vodicka M.A. Sire J. Benarous R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4842-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).UDGs and deoxyuraciltriphosphate pyrophosphatases (dUTPases) are thought to prevent the misincorporation of deoxyuracil into DNA during DNA synthesis. Since UDG is not involved in the G2checkpoint, the hypothesis that association of Vpr and UDG may perform a role similar to that played by the dUTPases of non-primate lentiviruses is quite possible, i.e. the reduction of uracil misincorporation into proviral DNA. Recently, Turelli et al.(53Turelli P. Guiguen F. Mornex J.F. Vigne R. Querat G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4522-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that dUTPase minus caprine arthritis encephalitis virus accumulates G-to-A substitutions in vivo (53Turelli P. Guiguen F. Mornex J.F. Vigne R. Querat G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4522-4530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mansky (54Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that the vpr gene partially accounts for the lower than predicted in vivo mutation rate of HIV-1. Avpr-negative shuttle vector had an overall mutation rate as much as 4-fold higher than that of the parental vector (54Mansky L.M. Virology. 1996; 222: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).We recently reported that TFIIB, a basal transcription factor, binds to Vpr (28Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Rey F. BouHamdan M. Spire B. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The portion of Vpr that interacts specifically with TFIIB ranges from amino acids 15 to 77. Also, it was indicated that the NH2-terminal domain of TFIIB is required for this interaction. Interestingly, we located the WXXF motif in the NH2-terminal domain of TFIIB. Preliminary data indicate that mutants of TFIIB, which have a point mutation in the WXXF motif, lose their ability to interact with Vpr (data not illustrated).Vpr has many different potential roles in HIV-1 expression. Vpr is able to transactivate several heterologous viral promoters lacking a common DNA sequence element (29Cohen E.A. Terwilliger E.F. Jalinoos Y. Proulx J. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1990; 3: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the addition of exogenous Vpr can reactivate HIV-1 replication in latently infected cell lines, indicating that Vpr could play a role in increasing HIV-1 expression through transcriptional or translational events (32Levy D.N. Refaeli Y. MacGregor R.R. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10873-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 33Levy D.N. Refaeli Y. Weiner D.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Vpr has been reported to influence the regulation of some cellular functions. Vpr induces terminal differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells (31Levy D.N. Fernandes L.S. Williams W.V. Weiner D.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and causes arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (34He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R.

Virol. 1995; 69: 882-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently this viral protein has been shown to be capable of inducing apoptosis after cell cycle arrest (38Stewart S.A. Poon B. Jowett J.B. Chen I.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5579-5592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these effects by Vpr are probably mediated by interactions with cellular proteins. Our findings could assist in the screening of proteins that are implicated in these functions and have the motif WXXF. We have already demonstrated the potential implications of this motif (WXXF) for UDG and TFIIB in their interactions with Vpr. Because of the strict conformation of UDG, it is formally possible that other regions are important for the interaction with Vpr. UDG is an enzyme that is extraordinarily specific in its function and so must have a very strict and defined three-dimensional conformation (48Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).Recently, Chen and co-workers (55Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B.M. Stewart S.A. Xie Y. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a weak interaction between Vpr and the cellular DNA repair protein, HH23A. The authors show that the carboxyl-terminal 45-amino acid region of HH23A interacts with Vpr. Interestingly, this carboxyl-terminal region has 2 Phe residues that are conserved between different species. This may explain the weak interaction of this protein with Vpr (55Withers-Ward E.S. Jowett J.B.M. Stewart S.A. Xie Y. Garfinkel A. Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. Shah N. Hanaoka F. Sawitz D.G. Armstrong R.W. Souza L.M. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9732-9742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of interest, we show in Fig. 3 that the UDG mutant, W222G, lost 60% of its interaction with Vpr.Since the Vpr protein can be packaged into virions in quantities similar to those of the major structural proteins (16Lu Y.L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cohen E.A. Dehni G. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3097-3099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this protein has be used to target fusion proteins to progeny virus. Serioet al. (56Serio D. Rizvi T.A. Cartas M. Kalyanaraman V.S.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7704-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have generated chimeric proteins based on HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2 Vpx, utilizing CAT, staphylococcal nuclease, wild-type and mutated HIV-1 protease, integrase, and reverse transcriptase. All of these reports use Vpr or Vpx as partners for chimeric proteins. As HIV-1 Vpr may functionally block the cell cycle, possibly involving the cellular apoptosis pathways, fusion proteins with Vpr for therapeutic purposes will be difficult to utilize, as this retroviral protein may (i) perturb viral replication, (ii) lead to difficulties in delivering a fusion protein in vivo because of competition with wild-type Vpr (or natural Vpr) and thus lead to viral escape, and (iii) interfere in cellular functions. In this study, a new strategy is proposed. HIV-1 Vpr was targeted as a docking protein, by which one could target anti-viral agents or any foreign proteins fused to the WXXF motif into HIV-1 virions. This is based on our demonstration that the WXXF motif in fusion with CAT is (i) capable of delivering the CAT protein into the HIV-1 virion by interaction with Vpr, and (ii) the CAT protein retains its enzymatic activity upon fusion with WXXF.Our choice in utilizing two copies instead of one of the WXXF domain was based on our CAT assay comparison between the dWF and WF motif of UDG. Virions from 293T cells co-transfected with HIV-1WT/WFUDG demonstrated differences in CAT activity compared with the virions from 293T cells co-transfected with HIV-1ΔVPR/WFUDG but significantly less than with dWF (data not shown).Development of target protein-specific docking delivery systems have broad potential applications for viral or cellular functional studies. Rapid generation of target protein-specific-binding peptide motifs using the phage-display system will provide critical peptides in different proteins. In this report, HIV-1 intravirion delivery was used as an example, but the same principle can be used for a variety of viral diseases. Utilizing combination protein-based intracellular immunization strategies, intracellular docking, and intravirion docking systems may dramatically enhance efficiency and specificity of these approaches.These data indicate that Vpr binds to the WXXF motif, and by interaction with this motif, one can deliver a fusion protein into the HIV-1 virion through a new docking strategy. The interesting features of the chimeric proteins generated here are the minimal addition of residues (22 amino acids) and the use of Vpr not as a partner for the fusion protein but as a receptor for docking to deliver this fusion protein into virions. This study illustrates a potential new strategy in the targeting of anti-viral agents into virions that may permit a feasible avenue to interfere with HIV-1 replication in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1970143054,"When the unicellular eukaryoteDictyostelium discoideum starves, it senses the local density of other starving cells by simultaneously secreting and sensing a glycoprotein called conditioned medium factor (CMF). When the density of starving cells is high, the corresponding high density of CMF permits signal transduction through cAR1, the chemoattractant cAMP receptor. cAR1 activates a heterotrimeric G protein whose α-subunit is Gα2. CMF regulates cAMP signal transduction in part by regulating the lifetime of the cAMP-stimulated Gα2-GTP configuration. We find here that guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) inhibits the binding of CMF to membranes, suggesting that the putative CMF receptor is coupled to a G protein. Cells lacking Gα1 (Gα1 null) do not exhibit GTPγS inhibition of CMF binding and do not exhibit CMF regulation of cAMP signal transduction, suggesting that the putative CMF receptor interacts with Gα1. Work by others has suggested that Gα1 inhibits phospholipase C (PLC), yet when cells lacking either Gα1 or PLC were starved at high cell densities (and thus in the presence of CMF), they developed normally and had normal cAMP signal transduction. We find that CMF activates PLC. Gα1 null cells starved in the absence or presence of CMF behave in a manner similar to control cells starved in the presence of CMF in that they extend pseudopods, have an activated PLC, have a low cAMP-stimulated GTPase, permit cAMP signal transduction, and aggregate. Cells lacking Gβ have a low PLC activity that cannot be stimulated by CMF. Cells lacking PLC exhibit IP3 levels and cAMP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis rates intermediate to what is observed in wild-type cells starved in the absence or in the presence of an optimal amount of CMF. We hypothesize that CMF binds to its receptor, releasing Gβγ from Gα1. This activates PLC, which causes the Gα2 GTPase to be inhibited, prolonging the lifetime of the cAMP-activated Gα2-GTP configuration. This, in turn, allows cAR1-mediated cAMP signal transduction to take place.

This, in turn, allows cAR1-mediated cAMP signal transduction to take place. A general premise of developmental biology is that mechanisms exist that sense the density of cells of a particular type. These mechanisms all use a signal molecule, which is secreted by the specific cell type. Examples of cell density sensing mechanisms can be seen in bacteria (for a review, see Ref. 1Gomer R.H. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 734-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Dictyostelium (for a review, see Ref. 2Clarke M. Gomer R.H. Experientia. 1995; 51: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and mammals (3Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar). We have been usingDictyostelium to study cell density sensing, because the simplicity of this eukaryote greatly facilitates examining the physics and biochemistry of a cell density sensing mechanism.Dictyostelium normally exists as amebas that eat bacteria. When they overgrow their food supply and starve, they cease dividing and aggregate using pulses of cyclic AMP as a chemoattractant. The aggregated cells develop into a fruiting body consisting of spores supported on a column of stalk cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar and 5Loomis W.F. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1993; 28: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When a Dictyostelium cell starving in the presence of a high density of other starving cells receives a pulse of cAMP, it releases a burst of cAMP to relay the signal, moves toward the source of cAMP, and expresses specific classes of genes (4Loomis W.F.

Rev. 1994; 58: 330-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incoming cAMP pulse is sensed by cAR1 cell surface cAMP receptors, which in turn activate their associated G proteins (14Theibert A. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Van Haastert P.J.M. De Vries M.J. Penning L.C. Roovers F. van der Kaay J. Erneux C.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunits, along with a cytosolic protein called CRAC, transiently activate adenylyl cyclase, while the Gα2 subunits activate guanylyl cyclase (for review, see Refs. 8Peters D.J.M. Cammans M. Smit S. Spek W. Campagne M.M.V. Schaap P. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and 9Dottin R.P. Bodduluri S.R. Doody J.F. Haribabu B. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Activation of cAR1 also causes a transient influx of Ca2+, which is G protein-independent (17Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The aggregation and development of starving cells requires the presence of an extracellular molecule, the conditioned media factor (CMF) 1The abbreviations used are: CMF, conditioned medium factor; rCMF, recombinant CMF; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; 3′NH-cAMP, 3′-deoxy-3′-aminoadenosine 3′,5′-phosphate; CM, conditioned medium; PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. (18Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). CMF is an 80-kDa protein with no similarity to any known protein (20Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). CMF is both secreted and sensed by starving cells. When starved, CMF antisense cells do not aggregate unless they are allowed to develop in the presence of exogenous CMF or recombinant CMF (rCMF) (20Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This suggests that the function of CMF is to coordinate the development of large fruiting bodies by triggering aggregation only when most of the cells in an area have starved, as signaled by a high level of CMF. Without such a mechanism that senses the density of starved cells, cohorts of cells that starved at the same time might each form a small, ineffective fruiting body. To determine whether CMF might be able to mediate density sensing in the wild, we calculated the diffusion of CMF from a cell sitting on a soil surface or submerged in water (21Yuen I.S. Gomer R.H. J. Theor. Bio. 1994; 167: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Knowing that the CMF secretion rate is 12 molecules/cell/min, we showed that the concentration of CMF in the immediate vicinity of an isolated starved cell remains below 0.3 ng/ml, the half-maximal activity of CMF, by a factor of at least 10 even after 10 h of continuous secretion and correcting for the presence of CMF receptors. Similar calculations with an array of 2046 cells showed that a CMF concentration adjacent to the cells of 0.3 ng/ml can be reached after 2 h of secretion. Interestingly, for aggregates of fewer than roughly 45 cells, the CMF concentration can never rise to 0.3 ng/ml, indicating that CMF could be used to sense whether there are more than 45 cells in an aggregate (2Clarke M. Gomer R.H. Experientia. 1995; 51: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also found that the solutions are not unique: many combinations of secretion rate, diffusion coefficient, and threshold sensitivity will allow density sensing. These calculations illustrate that as a general principle cells can sense their local density by simultaneously secreting and recognizing a molecule. Such a mechanism could also be used for determining the total number of cells in a tissue. CMF regulates several aspects of cAMP signal transduction (22Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The activations of Ca2+ influx, adenylyl cyclase, and guanylyl cyclase in response to a pulse of cAMP are strongly inhibited in cells lacking CMF but are restored by a 10-s exposure of cells to CMF. These cells retain normal levels of the cAMP receptor and cAMP-induced binding of GTP to membranes, suggesting that the interaction of the cAMP receptor with G proteins in vitro is not measurably affected by CMF. However, the activation of adenylyl cyclase by GTPγS requires cells to have been exposed to CMF. CMF thus appears to control aggregation by regulating cAMP signal transduction at a step after cAMP induces Gα2 to exchange GDP for GTP, but before Gα2-GTP can activate adenylyl cyclase. CMF appears to regulate cAMP signal transduction by regulating the lifetime of the Gα2-GTP conformation. We found that in lysates, approximately 250 molecules of GTP bind to a cell's membrane in response to a pulse of cAMP in the presence or absence of CMF (22Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Brazill D.T. Gundersen R. Gomer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After cAMP stimulation, the hydrolysis rate of GTP to GDP is approximately 240 molecules in 3 min in the absence of CMF but roughly 51 molecules in 3 min in the presence of CMF. The cAMP-activated GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis are abolished in cells lacking Gα2 (23Brazill D.T. Gundersen R. Gomer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that CMF, and thus cell density, controls cAMP-stimulated Gα2-GTPase activity. At the developmental stage when Gα2 is mediating cAMP signal transduction, Gα1 is also being expressed and potentially mediating other signal transduction pathways. However, cells lacking Gα1 have essentially normal cAMP-stimulated Ca2+ influx and development through aggregation, although they exhibit a slight delay in the rate of cGMP accumulation in response to a pulse of cAMP (17Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,24Kumagai A. Hadwiger J.A. Pupillo M. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1220-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Gα1 appears to be superfluous for early development. In cells lacking Gα1, 3′NH-cAMP no longer inhibits phospholipase C (25Bominaar A.A. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). During late development, the absence of Gα1 causes fruiting bodies to have abnormally thin stalks (24Kumagai A. Hadwiger J.A. Pupillo M. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1220-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dharmawardhane S. Cubitt A.B. Clark A.M. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3549-3561PubMed Google Scholar) and causes decreased 1,2-diacylglycerol accumulation (27Cubitt A.B. Dharmawardhane S. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17431-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing Gα1 or containing a constitutively active form of Gα1 have roughly normal aggregation and form normal looking slugs but then form very abnormal fruiting bodies with thick basal disks, which are accompanied by increased 1,2-diacylglycerol accumulation (26Dharmawardhane S. Cubitt A.B. Clark A.M. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3549-3561PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cubitt A.B. Dharmawardhane S. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17431-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that CMF regulates cAMP signal transduction by releasing Gβγ from Gα1; the released Gβγ then activates PLC, which in turn causes an inhibition of the Gα2 GTPase. Ax4 wild-type or transformant cells were grown in shaking culture in HL5 medium as described by Gomer et al. (19Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lacking the G α-subunits Gα1 (26Dharmawardhane S. Cubitt A.B. Clark A.M. Firtel R.A. Development. 1994; 120: 3549-3561PubMed Google Scholar) or Gα2 (28Kumagai A. Pupillo M. Gundersen R.

Cell. 1989; 57: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Rick Firtel (University of California at San Diego), and cells lacking the Gβ subunit (29Lilly P. Wu L.J. Welker D.L. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Peter Devreotes (Johns Hopkins University). Conditioned medium (CM) was prepared by starving Ax4 cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml in PBM (20 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.1 with KOH) in shaking culture for 20 h and then clarifying the conditioned medium as described by Gomer et al. (19Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). The production of CMF by cells was assayed following the procedure of Gomer et al. (19Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of conditioned medium or recombinant CMF on cell aggregation, cells were starved in submerged monolayer as described previously (19Gomer R.H. Yuen I.S. Firtel R.A. Development. 1991; 112: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar) at surface densities of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 × 103cells/cm2 in PBM, PBM supplemented with 10% conditioned medium, or PBM supplemented with 1 ng/ml recombinant CMF. U-73122 and U-73343 (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and added to cells upon starvation. For photography and videotaping, a hole was punched in the bottom of a plastic Petri dish with a heated test tube. The burr was sanded off, and a glass coverslip was glued with RTV (Dow Corning, Midland MI) on the underside of the dish over the hole. Cells were starved in monolayer culture in the dish at a surface density of 3 × 104cells/cm2 under 2 mm of buffer. Cells on the coverslip were examined in situ with a Nikon (Melville, NY) 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion phase contrast objective on a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with an 8008 camera back for photography and an Ikegami ITC-400 TV camera for video. Photographs were taken on Kodak T-Max p3200 film, which was then developed with Kodak D76, and videotaping was done with a Sony Watchcorder recording at 1 frame/s, which was then played back at 4 frames/s. To generate a deletion mutant of CMF, we replaced 526 nucleotides coding for the active region of the protein with the blasticidin resistance marker under control of the actin 15 promotor (30Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A genomic clone of CMF was digested with HindIII and XbaI to remove part of the CMF coding region. The plasmid carrying the blasticidin cassette (pBsr2ΔBam) was digested with HindIII and XbaI to remove the cassette. The blasticidin cassette was then ligated into the modified genomic clone. The resulting plasmid contains 1 kilobase pair of genomic DNA from the CMF gene, the Blasticidin cassette replacing 526 nucleotides of CMF coding sequence, followed by 1.2 kilobase pairs of CMF genomic sequence. For transformation, the plasmid was cleaved with PvuII, and 20 μg of the fragment containing the construct was gel-purified using Geneclean (Bio 101, Vista, CA). The fragment was then used to transform DH1 cells, following the procedure of Shaulsky (31Shaulsky G. Escalante R. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15260-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of GTPγS on the binding of CMF to membranes, cells were starved in PBM at 1 × 107 cells/ml in shaking culture. At 6 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min and resuspended in ice-cold PBM; recentrifuged; and resuspended in ice-cold PBM, 2 mmdithiothreitol to 1 × 107 cells/ml. All subsequent operations were done on ice in a cold room. 2 ml of the cells were immediately mixed with 15 μl of either water or 10 mmfreshly dissolved GTPγS (Sigma) and were then lysed by passage through two Cameo 25N 5-μm pore size syringe filters (MSI, Westboro, MA). For both homogenates, a 0.5-ml aliquot was mixed with 1 μl of 50 mm cAMP. Duplicate assay tubes contained 20 μl of 0.5 × PBM, 50 ng of 125I-rCMF, 0.35 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm KCl or the same mixture containing 600 ng of unlabeled rCMF. 80 μl of the cell homogenate was added and incubated on ice for 15 min. The mixes were centrifuged for 4 min in a 15,000 rpm microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were removed. The tubes were recentrifuged for 1 min, and the remaining supernatant was removed. The pellets were resuspended in 80 μl of 1 macetic acid and then mixed with 1.1 ml of Scintiverse II scintillation mixture (Fisher) and counted. The cAMP relay response was measured following the procedure of Van Haastert (32Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 2559-2564Google Scholar), with the modification that the cells were starved for 5 h at 5 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were washed and collected by centrifugation and then assayed immediately without an intervening incubation at high cell density. The low cell density starvation and rapid assays were done to prevent CMF from accumulating to its threshold concentration. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells in 0.1 ml were stimulated with 10 μm 2′-deoxy-cAMP (a functional cAMP analog) in the presence of 10 mmdithiothreitol. At 0 and 3 min after stimulation, the cells were lysed, and cAMP content was measured using an isotope dilution cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where indicated, 1 ng/ml of rCMF was added to the cells 90 s prior to the 2′-deoxy-cAMP pulse. The production of cGMP in response to 10−7mextracellular cAMP was determined in a similar manner following the procedure of Kesbeke et al. (33Kesbeke F. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using a cGMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amount of cGMP produced was measured at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 45 s after cAMP stimulation for cells exposed to no CMF or to 1 ng/ml rCMF for 30 s prior to cAMP stimulation. For all cell lines examined, the cGMP concentration peaked at 5–10 s after cAMP stimulation, and the ratio of cGMP levels at 5 s to the amount at 0 s was used for further analysis. The uptake of Ca2+ by cells in response to a pulse of cAMP was determined as described by Milne and Devreotes (17Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were starved for 6 h at low cell density (1 × 106 cells/ml) and were resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in H buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.0). The cell suspension was incubated in uptake medium for 90 s and then was stimulated with a 2 μm or a 100 μm pulse of cAMP and incubated for an additional 90 s. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 320 × g for 1 min. To measure Ca2+ uptake into cells in the presence of CMF, the uptake medium was supplemented with 1 ng/ml recombinant CMF (34Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard Ca2+ influx assay involves harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 11,600 × g for 4 s (35Milne J.L. Coukell M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that centrifugation under these conditions severely deformed the cells, and so did the Ca2+ influx assays using a much gentler centrifugation to harvest the cells. However, we obtained essentially similar results using the higher speed spin (data not shown). GTP binding to membranes and membrane-associated GTPase activities was assayed as described by Brazill et al. (23Brazill D.T. Gundersen R. Gomer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). IP3 production was determined following the procedure of Van Haastert (36Van Haastert P.J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), using a kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the IP3 assay, with the exception that the assay was performed using 100 μl of supernatant from the neutralized cell extract. The stimulus for the assay was 1 ng/ml rCMF in the presence of 5 μg/ml U-73122, 5 μg/ml U-73343, or no drug. We previously showed that disruption of the Gβ subunit abolishes the ability of CMF to down-regulate cAMP binding (37Van Haastert P.J.M. Bishop J.D. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggested that CMF binds to a receptor that interacts with a G protein. A common aspect of G protein-linked receptors is that the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS inhibits the binding of ligand to membranes. We developed an assay buffer that allows the specific binding of [125I]rCMF to membranes. In a typical 0.1-ml reaction containing 50 ng of free [125I]rCMF, 4 ng (2300 DPM) of [125I]rCMF bound to the membranes from 1.6 × 106 cells; typically, 1.2 ng of the bound [125I]rCMF was competed off by 6 μg/ml cold rCMF. GTPγS strongly inhibited the specific (i.e. competable) CMF binding (Fig. 1). Thus, the putative CMF receptor is most likely linked to a G protein. To determine if the CMF receptor couples to a known G protein, we examined the effect of GTPγS on the binding of [125I]rCMF to membranes from cells lacking specific G proteins. GTPγS caused a similar amount of inhibition of the binding of CMF to membranes from wild-type cells and cells lacking Gβ or Gα2 (Fig. 1). However, in cells lacking Gα1, GTPγS was unable to inhibit the binding of CMF to membranes (Fig. 1). The data thus suggest that the putative CMF receptor interacts with Gα1 more than it interacts with Gα2 and that the Gβ subunit is not necessary for the GTPγS inhibition of CMF binding. We have previously observed that extracellular CMF is necessary for wild-type cells to aggregate when starved at low cell density (20Jain R. Yuen I.S. Taphouse C.R. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if Gα1 is required for this sensitivity to CMF, we starved wild-type and Gα1 null cells at various densities in submerged culture in the presence or absence of rCMF. Wild-type cells starved in the absence of rCMF were able to aggregate in 24 h when starved at densities of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 or above (at a secretion rate of 12 molecules/cell/min, the CMF concentration in this culture reached the 0.3 ng/ml threshold at 16 h) (TableI). After longer periods of time, the cells did form aggregates at even lower densities. The same cells starved for 24 h in the presence of CM or rCMF formed aggregates when starved at 2 × 104 cells/cm2. As seen with the cells starved in the absence of exogenous CMF, the cells starved in the presence of CMF eventually formed aggregates at lower densities, typically at 2-fold lower density at any given time. The Gα1 null cells, when starved in the presence or absence of CM or recombinant CMF, formed aggregates at densities of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 or greater, and the appearance of the cells and of the aggregates was unaffected by the presence of CM (Table I). One possible explanation for the ability of Gα1 cells to aggregate at such low cell densities even in the absence of exogenous CMF is that they secrete very high levels of CMF. However, CMF production assays indicated that Gα1 null cells (as well as Gα2 and Gβ null cells) produce no more CMF than wild-type cells (TableII). Therefore, it appears that the aggregation of Gα1 null cells at very low density even in the absence of CMF is due to these cells responding to starvation as if they were in the presence of CMF.Table IAbility to aggregate at different cell densitiesCell Density (×103/cm2)160804020105Ax4+++−−−Ax4, CMF+++++/−−Gα1−+++++−Gα1−, CMF+++++−PLC−+++−−−PLC−, CMF+++−−−Ax4, inhibitor++/−−−−−Ax4, inhibitor, CMF++−−−−Ax4, mock+++−−−Ax4, mock, CMF++++/−−− Open table in a new tab Table IIThe effect of deleting specific proteins on pseudopod activity and CMF secretionCell linePseudopods/5 minCMF productionWithout CMFWith CMFunits/mlAx4 (wild type)5 ± 212 ± 24.0 ± 0Gα1 null9 ± 113 ± 34.0 ± 0Gα2 null3 ± 17 ± 22.7 ± 1.2Gβ null5 ± 17 ± 20.8 ± 0.4PLC null10 ± 311 ± 31.0 ± 0HD 10 control6 ± 216 ± 73.7 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Another effect of CMF is that it alters the morphology of starving cells (22Yuen I.S.

Wild-type cells starved in the absence of CMF tend to be smooth and round and do not aggregate, while cells exposed to CMF for more than 60 min tend to have large numbers of ruffles and pseudopods and do aggregate. When Ax4 wild-type, Gα1, and Gβ null cells were starved at low cell density in the absence of CMF, the Ax4 cells were rounded and did not aggregate, while the Gα1 null cells were ruffled and did aggregate (Fig. 2). In the presence of CMF, both cell lines were extensively ruffled and formed aggregates (data not shown). In addition, the rate of pseudopod extension in Gα1 null cells was insensitive to CMF, with the rate being equivalent to that of wild-type cells in the presence of CMF (Table II). The lack of Gβ also caused the pseudopod extension rate to be independent of CMF, with a rate similar to that of wild-type cells in the absence of CMF (Table II). The data thus indicate that Gα1 null cells starved in the absence or presence of CMF extend pseudopods and form aggregates as if they were in the presence of CMF, while Gβ null cells behave as if they were in the absence of CMF. Cells lacking Gα2 did increase their pseudopod extension rate in response to CMF, suggesting that Gα1 and Gβ but not Gα2 mediate this response of cells to CMF. CMF regulates the aggregation of cells by regulating cAMP activation of adenylyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, and Ca2+ influx (22Yuen I.S. Jain R. Bishop J.D. Lindsey D.F. Deery W.J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Gomer R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether Gα1 is necessary for CMF to regulate these cAMP-stimulated activities. As shown in TableIII, the cAMP analog 2′-deoxy-cAMP stimulates cAMP production in cells starved at low cell density, where the CMF concentration will be suboptimal. The addition of recombinant CMF for 90 s to wild-type cells then incre"
https://openalex.org/W2083489648,"Yeast plasma membrane contains an electron transport system that maintains ascorbate in its reduced form in the apoplast. Reduction of ascorbate free radical by this system is comprised of two activities, one of them dependent on coenzyme Q6 (CoQ6). Strains with defects in CoQ6 synthesis exhibit decreased capacity for ascorbate stabilization compared with wild type or with atp2 orcor1 respiratory-deficient mutant strains. Both CoQ6 content in plasma membranes and ascorbate stabilization were increased during log phase growth. The addition of exogenous CoQ6 to whole cells resulted in its incorporation in the plasma membrane, produced levels of CoQ6 in the coq3 mutant strain that were 2-fold higher than in the wild type, and increased ascorbate stabilization activity in both strains, although it was higher in the coq3 mutant than in wild type. Other antioxidants, such as benzoquinone or α-tocopherol, did not change ascorbate stabilization.The CoQ6-independent reduction of ascorbate free radical was not due to copper uptake, pH changes or to the presence of CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediates, but decreased to undetectable levels when coq3 mutant strains were cultured in media supplemented with ferric iron. Plasma membrane CoQ6 levels were unchanged by either the presence or absence of iron in wild type, atp2, or cor1strains. Ascorbate stabilization appears to be a function of the yeast plasma membrane, which is partially based on an electron transfer chain in which CoQ6 is the central electron carrier, whereas the remainder is independent of CoQ6 and other antioxidants but is dependent on the iron-regulated ferric reductase complex.

All aerobic organisms are exposed to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ6, coenzyme Q6. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ6, coenzyme Q6. These are produced during normal metabolism and can also be generated by exposure to pro-oxidant compounds, an increase in oxygen pressure, or exposure to ionizing radiation (1Moradasferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These ROS produce damage to many cellular components, affecting the function of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. However, in normal conditions, cells have a number of defense systems to avoid or minimize these problems. A good example isSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which has at least 14 proteins that participate in ROS protection (1Moradasferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Krems B. Charizanis C. Entian K.D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The majority of anti-ROS mechanisms act inside the cell; however, little is known about mechanisms that protect against oxidative reduction. Some metabolic reactions involved in metal uptake produce superoxide at the apoplast (3Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), such as iron reduction, which is regulated by the presence or absence of iron in the culture medium (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These ROS at the plasma membrane initiate lipid peroxidation and generate a wide array of oxidation products including shorter fatty-acyl chains. Such products impair membrane function and structural integrity and increase the membrane fluidity. The plasma membrane must have a defense system to scavenge free radicals and repair oxidative damage. A good candidate may be the redox couple ascorbate-ubiquinone. Ascorbate is a first order antioxidant and, because it scavenges free radicals in the aqueous phase of cells, is considered to be the terminal small molecule antioxidant in biological systems (5Buettner G.R. Jurkiewicz B.A. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 91-115Google Scholar). Although ascorbate is a very efficient inhibitor of the lipid peroxidation process, it cannot inactivate the free radical effects within the plasma membrane (6Beyer R.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that yeast cells have the ability to reduce ascorbate free radical by an enzymatic mechanism that depends on NADH as the electron donor and is inhibited by ubiquinone antagonists, such as chloroquine (7Santos-Ocaña C. Navas P. Crane F.L. Córdoba F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone is a hydrophobic redox molecule located in different membranes, including the plasma membrane in animal cells (8Kalen A. Norling B. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The redox chemistry of CoQ is crucial for its role in the plasma membrane electron transport system, where the ubiquinone acts as a carrier between an internal NADH-dehydrogenase and an external side final acceptor (9Sun I.L. Sun E.E. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Lindgren A. Löw H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This NADH deshydrogenase activity is attributed to a NADH-ubiquinone reductase in the plasma membrane of pig liver hepatocytes (10Navarro F. Villalba J.M. Crane F.L. McKellar W.C. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Villalba J.M. Navarro F. Córdoba F. Serrano A. Arroyo A. Crane F.L. Navas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ubiquinone present in S. cerevisiae is ubiquinone-30 (CoQ6), and yeast mutants with defects in the COQ genes are being used to characterize the enzymes involved in CoQ6 synthesis pathway (12Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol.

Marbois B.N. Faul K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, its importance as an antioxidant was illustrated by the hypersensitivity of CoQ6-deficient yeast mutants to oxidative stress induced by treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids (16Do T.Q. Schultz R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The present work employs yeast mutants deficient in CoQ6 synthesis to study the relationship between the extracellular ascorbate stabilization and CoQ6. The results of this study suggest that part of the ascorbate stabilization by whole cells depends on the CoQ6 content of the plasma membrane and can be increased by the external addition of CoQ6. Both ascorbate stabilization and CoQ6 content in plasma membrane can be also restored by transformation with plasmids containing the COQ3 or COQ7 genes. Ascorbate stabilization activity and plasma membrane CoQ6 content are regulated as a function of the growth phase. The CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization is not due to CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediates or other antioxidants but is apparently due to electron transport by the plasma membrane ferric reductase complex. The CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization is suppressed when the coq3 mutant strain is cultured in media supplemented with ferric iron. The results indicate that ascorbate stabilization is due to two electron transport systems in the yeast plasma membrane, one dependent on CoQ6 and the other dependent on the iron-regulated ferric reductase complex.DISCUSSIONExtracellular ascorbate stabilization is an activity present not only in yeast but in other animal and plant cells (26Alcaı́n F.J. Burón M.I. Villalba J.M. Navas P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27González-Reyes J.A. Alcaı́n F.J. Caler J.A. Serrano A. Córdoba F. Navas P. Plant Sci. 1994; 100: 23-29Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In animal cells, the function is clearly directed to the maintenance of an optimal redox state and may be related to effects on cell growth and differentiation (28Alcaı́n F.J. Burón M.I. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Villalba J.M. Navas P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5887-5891PubMed Google Scholar, 29González-Quevedo M. Alcaı́n F.J. González-Reyes J.A. Burón M.I. Navas P. Cancer J. 1991; 4: 262-266Google Scholar). In plants, extracellular ascorbate stabilization plays an important role in cell elongation through ascorbate peroxidases (30Córdoba-Pedregosa M.C. González-Reyes J.A. Cañadillas M.S. Navas P. Córdoba F. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In yeast, we recently showed that a plasma membrane electron transport system, which depends on the viability of intact cells or protoplasts, is responsible for ascorbate stabilization, indicating the possible participation of plasma membrane CoQ6 (7Santos-Ocaña C. Navas P. Crane F.L. Córdoba F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).To determine the functional requirement of CoQ6 in ascorbate stabilization, we have studied mutant strains with defects in CoQ6 synthesis. No CoQ6 was detected in the plasma membrane or whole cells of these strains, which also showed a lower activity of ascorbate stabilization. Wild type yeastatp2 and cor1 (respiratory-deficient strains) contained detectable CoQ6, although its distribution inside the cell was different. Thus, although wild type cells had a higher content of CoQ6 than did the atp2 mutant, the latter contained more CoQ6 at the plasma membrane. However, both the plasma membrane and whole cell CoQ6 content is higher in cor1 mutant strains than in wild type cells. These findings may account for the higher ascorbate stabilization activity in the atp2 and cor1 strains and indicate that ascorbate stabilization is not dependent on mitochondrial respiratory function. An explanation of this behavior derives from the observed increase of trans-plasma membrane electron transport in mitochondrial-deficient animal cells, which probably functions to regulate the ratio of cytosolic NAD+/NADH levels (31Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Martinus R.D. Linnane A.W. Nagley P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the establishment of a mitochondrial-deficient cell line produced increases in both plasma membrane CoQ content and the ascorbate stabilization activity (33Gómez-Dı́az C. Villalba J.M. Pérez-Vicente R. Crane F.L. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results are all consistent with the idea that the higher CoQ6 content in the cor1 and atp2strains may result from the imposed respiratory deficiency.In S. cerevisiae, plasma membrane protein represents 1–2% of total cell protein (34Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Considering this percentage, plasma membrane CoQ6 constitutes 8–16% of the total CoQ6 in the cell. This value was increased in both wild type and respiratory defective yeast strains after the incubation of cells in buffer with exogenous CoQ6 (Table IV).Yeast CoQ6 synthesis and CoQ6 content is increased during log phase growth and reaches a maximum at stationary phase (15Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faul K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, CoQ6 content in both plasma membrane and whole cells increased during log phase growth, but the accumulation of CoQ6 in plasma membrane increased dramatically as compared with whole cells. Ascorbate stabilization showed a similar increase but reached a plateau at the stationary phase. CoQ exerts its antioxidant function when it is reduced and requires an appropriate equilibrium with its reductase, such as cytochromeb5 reductase, at the plasma membrane (35Gómez-Dı́az C. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Barroso M.P. Villalba J.M. Navarro F. Crane F.L. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 253-259Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This behavior during growth is similar to that observed for other plasma membrane redox activities in yeast (36Crane F.L. Roberts H. Linnane A.W. Löw H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The coq3 mutant strain also showed a slight increase in ascorbate stabilization during the first hours of log phase growth, but instead of reaching a plateau, the ascorbate stabilization quickly returned to basal levels of activity. Thus, this activity may be due to another component that was increased during the growth.Exogenous CoQ6 was incorporated in the plasma membrane of both wild type and coq3 strains, although the latter showed a very high capacity to incorporate CoQ6. As a consequence of incubation with exogenous CoQ6, ascorbate stabilization was stimulated in wild type and was restored to wild type levels in the coq3 mutant. Exogenous CoQ stimulates the trans-plasma membrane electron transport (9Sun I.L. Sun E.E. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Lindgren A. Löw H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and significantly increases the ascorbate stabilization in animal cells (35Gómez-Dı́az C. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Barroso M.P. Villalba J.M. Navarro F. Crane F.L. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 253-259Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CoQ also acts through the plasma membrane redox system to replace pyruvate as an essential medium component required for the growth of mitochondria-deficient ρ° Namalwa cells (32Martinus R.D. Linnane A.W. Nagley P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar).The data presented here show that ascorbate stabilization was not absent in the CoQ6 mutant yeast strains and thus cannot depend exclusively on CoQ6. This CoQ6-independent activity is not due to changes in pH or copper uptake, because FTRUNB1 strain lacking the copper transporter (25Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) shows the same ascorbate stabilization activity as the wild type strain. The contribution of CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediates to the CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization can be excluded by the examination of the coq2 yeast mutant strain. Such mutants are defective in transferring the polyprenyl group to p-hydroxybenzoic acid (the aromatic ring precursor of CoQ) and hence are incapable of generating any prenylated CoQ biosynthetic intermediates (12Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other phenolic compounds display antioxidant properties and may be able to reduce peroxidation damage (37Kaneko K. Kaji K. Matsuo M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Santiago L.A. Mori A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, 1,4-benzoquinone is a plasma membrane redox system component thought to provide a defense against free radicals produced by the mycelial fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium during lignin peroxidase-mediated mineralization (39Stahl J.D. Rasmussen S.J. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But the absence of an effect produced by either 1,4-benzoquinone or the antioxidant α-tocopherol tend to argue against the role of other antioxidants in the ascorbate stabilization.It seems more likely that the remaining activity is due to another plasma membrane electron transport system in which CoQ6 is not involved. A possible candidate is the system responsible for the reduction of ferric iron, a necessary step in iron assimilation (40Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar,41Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), this system is modulated by the presence or absence of iron in the culture medium (Fig.5 B). The ascorbate stabilization is also modulated by iron in all strains examined (Fig. 5 A) in a manner that is independent of the CoQ6 content (Table V). The most pronounced effect was displayed in the coq3 strain, in which the ascorbate stabilization was abolished when cells were cultured in iron-supplemented media. In this situation, the lack of CoQ6 at the plasma membrane, combined with the repression of iron reduction, results in the absence of ascorbate stabilization. The data indicate that ascorbate stabilization depends on two redox systems at the plasma membrane, one that is CoQ6-dependent and the ferrireductase complex. The contribution of the ferrireductase complex accounts for the increase in ascorbate stabilization observed in the coq3stain during log phase growth, because iron reduction was also increased during this phase. Thus, the high level of iron reduction in the coq3 mutant strain accounts for the stabilization of ascorbate despite the absence of the CoQ6-dependent system.In conclusion, ascorbate stabilization at the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae is in part dependent on CoQ6, whereas the remaining activity is due to the action of the plasma membrane iron reductase system. Both of these systems cooperate to maintain a reduced environment, based on ascorbate, at the apoplast. All aerobic organisms are exposed to the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ6, coenzyme Q6. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ6, coenzyme Q6. These are produced during normal metabolism and can also be generated by exposure to pro-oxidant compounds, an increase in oxygen pressure, or exposure to ionizing radiation (1Moradasferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These ROS produce damage to many cellular components, affecting the function of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. However, in normal conditions, cells have a number of defense systems to avoid or minimize these problems. A good example isSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which has at least 14 proteins that participate in ROS protection (1Moradasferreira P. Costa V. Piper P. Mager W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 2Krems B. Charizanis C. Entian K.D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The majority of anti-ROS mechanisms act inside the cell; however, little is known about mechanisms that protect against oxidative reduction. Some metabolic reactions involved in metal uptake produce superoxide at the apoplast (3Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), such as iron reduction, which is regulated by the presence or absence of iron in the culture medium (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These ROS at the plasma membrane initiate lipid peroxidation and generate a wide array of oxidation products including shorter fatty-acyl chains. Such products impair membrane function and structural integrity and increase the membrane fluidity. The plasma membrane must have a defense system to scavenge free radicals and repair oxidative damage. A good candidate may be the redox couple ascorbate-ubiquinone. Ascorbate is a first order antioxidant and, because it scavenges free radicals in the aqueous phase of cells, is considered to be the terminal small molecule antioxidant in biological systems (5Buettner G.R. Jurkiewicz B.A. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 91-115Google Scholar). Although ascorbate is a very efficient inhibitor of the lipid peroxidation process, it cannot inactivate the free radical effects within the plasma membrane (6Beyer R.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that yeast cells have the ability to reduce ascorbate free radical by an enzymatic mechanism that depends on NADH as the electron donor and is inhibited by ubiquinone antagonists, such as chloroquine (7Santos-Ocaña C. Navas P. Crane F.L. Córdoba F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ubiquinone is a hydrophobic redox molecule located in different membranes, including the plasma membrane in animal cells (8Kalen A. Norling B. Appelkvist E.L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 926: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The redox chemistry of CoQ is crucial for its role in the plasma membrane electron transport system, where the ubiquinone acts as a carrier between an internal NADH-dehydrogenase and an external side final acceptor (9Sun I.L. Sun E.E. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Lindgren A. Löw H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This NADH deshydrogenase activity is attributed to a NADH-ubiquinone reductase in the plasma membrane of pig liver hepatocytes (10Navarro F. Villalba J.M. Crane F.L. McKellar W.C. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Villalba J.M. Navarro F. Córdoba F. Serrano A. Arroyo A. Crane F.L. Navas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ubiquinone present in S. cerevisiae is ubiquinone-30 (CoQ6), and yeast mutants with defects in the COQ genes are being used to characterize the enzymes involved in CoQ6 synthesis pathway (12Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol.

Marbois B.N. Faul K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, its importance as an antioxidant was illustrated by the hypersensitivity of CoQ6-deficient yeast mutants to oxidative stress induced by treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids (16Do T.Q. Schultz R. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The present work employs yeast mutants deficient in CoQ6 synthesis to study the relationship between the extracellular ascorbate stabilization and CoQ6. The results of this study suggest that part of the ascorbate stabilization by whole cells depends on the CoQ6 content of the plasma membrane and can be increased by the external addition of CoQ6. Both ascorbate stabilization and CoQ6 content in plasma membrane can be also restored by transformation with plasmids containing the COQ3 or COQ7 genes. Ascorbate stabilization activity and plasma membrane CoQ6 content are regulated as a function of the growth phase. The CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization is not due to CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediates or other antioxidants but is apparently due to electron transport by the plasma membrane ferric reductase complex. The CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization is suppressed when the coq3 mutant strain is cultured in media supplemented with ferric iron. The results indicate that ascorbate stabilization is due to two electron transport systems in the yeast plasma membrane, one dependent on CoQ6 and the other dependent on the iron-regulated ferric reductase complex. DISCUSSIONExtracellular ascorbate stabilization is an activity present not only in yeast but in other animal and plant cells (26Alcaı́n F.J. Burón M.I. Villalba J.M. Navas P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27González-Reyes J.A. Alcaı́n F.J. Caler J.A. Serrano A. Córdoba F. Navas P. Plant Sci. 1994; 100: 23-29Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In animal cells, the function is clearly directed to the maintenance of an optimal redox state and may be related to effects on cell growth and differentiation (28Alcaı́n F.J. Burón M.I. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Villalba J.M. Navas P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5887-5891PubMed Google Scholar, 29González-Quevedo M. Alcaı́n F.J. González-Reyes J.A. Burón M.I. Navas P. Cancer J. 1991; 4: 262-266Google Scholar). In plants, extracellular ascorbate stabilization plays an important role in cell elongation through ascorbate peroxidases (30Córdoba-Pedregosa M.C. González-Reyes J.A. Cañadillas M.S. Navas P. Córdoba F. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In yeast, we recently showed that a plasma membrane electron transport system, which depends on the viability of intact cells or protoplasts, is responsible for ascorbate stabilization, indicating the possible participation of plasma membrane CoQ6 (7Santos-Ocaña C. Navas P. Crane F.L. Córdoba F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).To determine the functional requirement of CoQ6 in ascorbate stabilization, we have studied mutant strains with defects in CoQ6 synthesis. No CoQ6 was detected in the plasma membrane or whole cells of these strains, which also showed a lower activity of ascorbate stabilization. Wild type yeastatp2 and cor1 (respiratory-deficient strains) contained detectable CoQ6, although its distribution inside the cell was different. Thus, although wild type cells had a higher content of CoQ6 than did the atp2 mutant, the latter contained more CoQ6 at the plasma membrane. However, both the plasma membrane and whole cell CoQ6 content is higher in cor1 mutant strains than in wild type cells. These findings may account for the higher ascorbate stabilization activity in the atp2 and cor1 strains and indicate that ascorbate stabilization is not dependent on mitochondrial respiratory function. An explanation of this behavior derives from the observed increase of trans-plasma membrane electron transport in mitochondrial-deficient animal cells, which probably functions to regulate the ratio of cytosolic NAD+/NADH levels (31Larm J.A. Vaillant F. Linnane A.W. Lawen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30097-30100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Martinus R.D. Linnane A.W. Nagley P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the establishment of a mitochondrial-deficient cell line produced increases in both plasma membrane CoQ content and the ascorbate stabilization activity (33Gómez-Dı́az C. Villalba J.M. Pérez-Vicente R. Crane F.L. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results are all consistent with the idea that the higher CoQ6 content in the cor1 and atp2strains may result from the imposed respiratory deficiency.In S. cerevisiae, plasma membrane protein represents 1–2% of total cell protein (34Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Considering this percentage, plasma membrane CoQ6 constitutes 8–16% of the total CoQ6 in the cell. This value was increased in both wild type and respiratory defective yeast strains after the incubation of cells in buffer with exogenous CoQ6 (Table IV).Yeast CoQ6 synthesis and CoQ6 content is increased during log phase growth and reaches a maximum at stationary phase (15Poon W.W. Marbois B.N. Faul K.F. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Similarly, CoQ6 content in both plasma membrane and whole cells increased during log phase growth, but the accumulation of CoQ6 in plasma membrane increased dramatically as compared with whole cells. Ascorbate stabilization showed a similar increase but reached a plateau at the stationary phase. CoQ exerts its antioxidant function when it is reduced and requires an appropriate equilibrium with its reductase, such as cytochromeb5 reductase, at the plasma membrane (35Gómez-Dı́az C. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Barroso M.P. Villalba J.M. Navarro F. Crane F.L. Navas P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 253-259Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This behavior during growth is similar to that observed for other plasma membrane redox activities in yeast (36Crane F.L. Roberts H. Linnane A.W. Löw H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1982; 14: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The coq3 mutant strain also showed a slight increase in ascorbate stabilization during the first hours of log phase growth, but instead of reaching a plateau, the ascorbate stabilization quickly returned to basal levels of activity. Thus, this activity may be due to another component that was increased during the growth.Exogenous CoQ6 was incorporated in the plasma membrane of both wild type and coq3 strains, although the latter showed a very high capacity to incorporate CoQ6. As a consequence of incubation with exogenous CoQ6, ascorbate stabilization was stimulated in wild type and was restored to wild type levels in the coq3 mutant. Exogenous CoQ stimulates the trans-plasma membrane electron transport (9Sun I.L. Sun E.E. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Lindgren A. Löw H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11126-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and significantly increases the ascorbate stabilization in animal cells (35Gómez-Dı́az C. Rodrı́guez-Aguilera J.C. Barroso M.P.

This CoQ6-independent activity is not due to changes in pH or copper uptake, because FTRUNB1 strain lacking the copper transporter (25Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) shows the same ascorbate stabilization activity as the wild type strain. The contribution of CoQ6 biosynthetic intermediates to the CoQ6-independent ascorbate stabilization can be excluded by the examination of the coq2 yeast mutant strain. Such mutants are defective in transferring the polyprenyl group to p-hydroxybenzoic acid (the aromatic ring precursor of CoQ) and hence are incapable of generating any prenylated CoQ biosynthetic intermediates (12Ashby M.N. Kutsunai S.Y. Ackerman S. Tzagoloff A. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4128-4136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other phenolic compounds display antioxidant properties and may be able to reduce peroxidation damage (37Kaneko K. Kaji K. Matsuo M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 38Santiago L.A. Mori A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, 1,4-benzoquinone is a plasma membrane redox system component thought to provide a defense against free radicals produced by the mycelial fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium during lignin peroxidase-mediated mineralization (39Stahl J.D. Rasmussen S.J. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But the absence of an effect produced by either 1,4-benzoquinone or the antioxidant α-tocopherol tend to argue against the role of other antioxidants in the ascorbate stabilization. It seems more likely that the remaining activity is due to another plasma membrane electron transport system in which CoQ6 is not involved. A possible candidate is the system responsible for the reduction of ferric iron, a necessary step in iron assimilation (40Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar,41Eide D. Davis-Kaplan S. Jordan I. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20774-20781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous studies (4Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), this system is modulated by the presence or absence of iron in the culture medium (Fig.5 B). The ascorbate stabilization is also modulated by iron in all strains examined (Fig. 5 A) in a manner that is independent of the CoQ6 content (Table V). The most pronounced effect was displayed in the coq3 strain, in which the ascorbate stabilization was abolished when cells were cultured in iron-supplemented media. In this situation, the lack of CoQ6 at the plasma membrane, combined with the repression of iron reduction, results in the absence of ascorbate stabilization. The data indicate that ascorbate stabilization depends on two redox systems at the plasma membrane, one that is CoQ6-dependent and the ferrireductase complex. The contribution of the ferrireductase complex accounts for the increase in ascorbate stabilization observed in the coq3stain during log phase growth, because iron reduction was also increased during this phase. Thus, the high level of iron reduction in the coq3 mutant strain accounts for the stabilization of ascorbate despite the absence of the CoQ6-dependent system. In conclusion, ascorbate stabilization at the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae is in part dependent on CoQ6, whereas the remaining activity is due to the action of the plasma membrane iron reductase system. Both of these systems cooperate to maintain a reduced environment, based on ascorbate, at the apoplast. We are grateful to Rosa Rodrı́guez for excellent assistance and patience."
https://openalex.org/W1989404198,"Previous studies described a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, PyrR100, resistant to lipid-soluble antifolates due to the loss of an energy-coupled folate exporter resulting in a marked increase in intracellular folate cofactor accumulation. There was, in addition, an unexplained increase in folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells which is shown in this paper to be mediated by a transporter with a low pH optimum. The pH profile for folic acid influx in parental Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells indicated peak activity at pH 6; this was increased >3-fold in PyrR100 cells. In contrast, methotrexate (MTX) influx in AA8 cells showed two peaks of comparable activities at pH 6 and 7.5; in PyrR100 cells, the component at pH 6 was increased 2-fold. Folic acid was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX or [3H]folic acid influx (1 μm) via the low pH route with IC50 values of ∼1 μm. Prostaglandin A1 was a potent inhibitor of [3H]MTX influx via the reduced folate carrier 1 at pH 7.5 with only a small inhibitory effect on the low pH route. The addition of 10 μm folic acid to PyrR100 cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile identical to that of AA8 cells, consistent with suppression of the low pH route. In contrast, addition of 25 μm prostaglandin A1 to PyrR100cells resulted in a MTX influx pH profile comparable to that of folic acid, consistent with the loss of the reduced folate carrier-mediated component. Inhibition (∼70%) of [3H]folic acid influx by ∼10 μm unlabeled folic acid at pH 7.5 indicated that the low pH transporter accounts for the majority of folic acid transport at physiological pH.This study demonstrates the functional importance of a low pH folate transporter that is increased when enhanced folic acid entry into cells is required as an adaptive response to antifolate selective pressure. This may represent a mechanism of resistance to new antifolate inhibitors of folate cofactor-dependent enzymes in which cytotoxic activity is limited by expanded cellular folate pools.

Previous studies from this laboratory described a novel form of resistance to lipid soluble antifolates in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; RFC1, reduced folate carrier; MTX, methotrexate; TMQ, trimetrexate; 5-CH3THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; 5-CHOTHF, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate; PGA1, prostaglandin A1; PyrR100, pyrimethamine-resistant cell line; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. cell line, PyrR100 (1Assaraf Y.G.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This augmentation of net folate transport was primarily due to the loss of function of an energy-dependent folate exporter. In addition, there was an unexplained increase in folic acid influx in the resistant cells; this paper explores the mechanism by which this occurs. Folic acid is the folate source in virtually every mammalian cell culture medium. Transport of this folate is therefore critical to maintaining one-carbon dependent biosynthetic processes and the methylation state of nucleic acids. However, the mechanism by which folic acid is transported into cells under usual growth conditions remains a subject of some controversy (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1639-1643PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the reduced folate cofactor, 5-CH3THF is the major folate in the blood of man and rodents and there is a considerable understanding of the mechanism of transport for this and other folate cofactors and 4-amino antifolates. The major route of transport for 5-CH3THF and 5-CHOTHF is the reduced folate carrier, RFC1 (5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Sirotnak F.M. Goldman I.D. Membrane Transport of Antineoplastic Agents.

Folates and Pterins: Nutritional, Pharmacological and Physiological Aspects. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 207-250Google Scholar). Folic acid transport by this pathway is very slow because of its very low affinity for RFC1 and can account for only a small component of uptake at the usual concentration of folic acid in most media (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M.

Consistent with this is the observation that cell lines, in which RFC1 function is lost with the acquisition of MTX resistance, have only a small increase in their folic acid growth requirement (9Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7842-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Folic acid has a very high affinity (Kd = 1 nm) for the folate receptor which mediates entry via an endocytic process (10Henderson G.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 319-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Kamen B.A. Wang M.T. Streckfuss A.J. Peryea X. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). But expression of folate receptor is minimal, or not detected at all, in most cultured cell lines. Recently, another transport process, with a low pH optimum, has been identified with an affinity for folic acid in the micromolar range, but the contribution of this pathway to folate transport at physiological pH has not been established (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This paper provides new insights into the mechanism of folic acid transport in CHO cells at low and physiological pH. Enhanced folic acid influx into lipophilic antifolate-resistant PyrR100 CHO cells is shown to be due, to a large extent, to increased transport via the low pH route. Furthermore, the data supports the conclusion that it is the activity of this process that mediates a major component of folic acid entry into CHO cells at physiological pH. This is the first demonstration of the importance of the low pH route to folic acid delivery into cells under normal growth conditions in vitro. [3′,5′,7′,9′-3H]folic acid, [3′,5′,7′-3H]MTX, and (6S)[3H]5-CH3THF were obtained from Amersham. Folic acid and (6R,6S)-5-CHOTHF were from Lederle, Carolina, Puerto Rico. Folate and antifolate compounds were purified by high performance liquid chromatography prior to use (15Matherly L.H. Barlowe C.K. Phillips V.M. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 710-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trimetrexate (TMQ) glucuronate was kindly provided by Warner-Lambert, Ann Arbor, MI. Prostaglandin A1(PGA1) was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI. Stock solutions (20 mm) of PGA1 were prepared before use in ethanol and stored at −20 °C; the final content of ethanol did not exceed 0.25% in all transport experiments, a level that did not have any effect on folate transport in AA8 or PyrR100 cells. PyrR100 cells were obtained by multiple step selection of parental CHO AA8 cells in gradually increasing concentrations of the lipid-soluble antifolate pyrimethamine (1Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This stepwise selection was initiated at 100 nm pyrimethamine (the 50% lethal dose, LD50) and terminated at 100 μm. The resultant 1000-fold pyrimethamine-resistant cells, termed PyrR100, retained wild-type dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene copy number and mRNA levels, as well as parental levels of DHFR enzyme activity (1Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of DHFR for various antifolates was preserved in PyrR100 cells, along with parental sensitivity to MTX but these cells were cross-resistant to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate and piritrexim (1Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sprecher H. Barr H.M. Slotky J.I. Tzukerman M. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20668-20676Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). AA8 cells and their PyrR100 subline were maintained in monolayer or suspension culture conditions in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μmfolic acid (HyClone, Logan, UT), supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, Gemini (Bio-Laboratories Inc., Calabasas, CA), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The growth medium of PyrR100 monolayers was supplemented with 100 μm pyrimethamine. Prior to transport experiments, cells were grown in suspension culture in drug-free medium. Transport of tritiated folates was measured as described previously (2Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells from suspension cultures (1–3-liter spinner flasks, Wheaton) in drug-free growth medium were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold unbuffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.9 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 7 mm glucose). Transport experiments at pH 5.0–6.5 were performed in MES-buffered saline (20 mm MES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm glucose) (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and those at pH 7.0–8.0 in Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm glucose). Prior to influx determinations, cells were suspended to a density of 4–8 × 107/ml in the desired buffer including 1 mmpyruvic acid and then equilibrated at 37 °C for 20 min. In folic acid uptake experiments 5 μm TMQ was routinely included to ensure complete blockade of DHFR activity (17Assaraf Y.G. Molina A. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18326-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TMQ and pyrimethamine at concentrations of 10 and 100 μm, respectively, did not alter folic acid influx in either parental AA8 or PyrR100 cells. Uptake was initiated by addition of the radiolabeled folate, and terminated by injecting 0.5–1-ml portions of the cell suspension into 9 ml of 0 °C Hepes-buffered saline at pH 7.4. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline, and processed for determination of cellular radiolabel as described previously (18Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All transport studies were performed at 1 μm [3H]folic acid or 1 μm [3H]MTX unless otherwise indicated. Influx was always measured over an interval that assured initial rates for each folate substrate. Specific binding of [3H]folic acid to membrane folate receptors was determined with viable cells at 0 °C as described previously (9Spinella M.J. Brigle K.E. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7842-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 2–4 × 107 cells, which were acid-washed three times with MES-buffered saline at pH 4.5 to strip off folic acid bound to folate receptors. Following a 10-min incubation with 100 nm [3H]folic acid (high performance liquid chromatography purified immediately prior to use) at 0 °C, cells were sedimented (12,000 × g for 15 s at 0 °C), the supernatant was aspirated, and the residual fluid removed by a second centrifugation and aspiration. Triplicate samples of cell pellets were processed and radioactivity determined as described previously (18Fry D.W. Goldman I.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 66: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Specific binding was the difference between [3H]folic acid bound in the absence or presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled folic acid. As reported previously, folic acid influx is increased by a factor of ∼ two in PyrR100 cells at pH 7.4 (2Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, as indicated in Table I, there is only a minimal increase in 5-CH3-THF (10%) and MTX (20%) influx in PyrR100 relative to parental AA8 cells. These observations suggested that the bulk of the change in folic acid influx is mediated by a process distinct from RFC1. Since there is no evidence for folate receptor-mediated transport in these cells (see below), studies were undertaken to determine whether augmented transport via the low pH route might be the mechanism by which folic acid influx is enhanced under these conditions.Table IAnalysis of MTX, 5-CH3THF, and folic acid Influx in AA8 and PyrR100 cells at pH 7.4FolateAA8PyrR100PyrR100/AA8nmol/g dry wt/minMTX0.376 ± 0.0260.452 ± 0.0281.25-CH3THF0.919 ± 0.0550.994 ± 0.0331.1Folic acid0.084 ± 0.0090.156 ± 0.0091.9 Open table in a new tab Folic acid influx in AA8 cells was optimal at pH 6.0; the pattern was symmetrical, yet broad (Fig.1 A). This profile narrowed in PyrR100 cells; here the pH optimum was essentially unchanged but maximum influx at pH 6.0 was increased more than 3-fold relative to AA8 cells (Fig. 1 A). Further evidence for increased activity of the low pH transporter was the observation that folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells at pH 6.0 was nearly 4-fold higher than at pH 7.4, while there is only a 2-fold difference in folic acid influx at the two pH levels in parental AA8 cells. The profile of pH dependence for MTX influx was different (Fig.1 B). There was a gradual increase in influx in AA8 cells as the pH was increased from 5.0 to 8.0 with a small peak at pH 6.0 and maximal activity at physiological pH. In contrast to other mammalian cell lines in which maximal MTX influx was always observed at physiological pH (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in PyrR100 cells influx at pH 6.0 exceeded that at pH 7.4 and was 2-fold greater than that in AA8 cells at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1 B). Hence, transport of folic acid and MTX is mediated by two processes with different pH optima and the activity of the transporter that is optimal at low pH is substantially increased in PyrR100 cells. Further studies were undertaken to better discriminate between transport mediated by the low pH pathway and RFC1. Folic acid is a very poor substrate for RFC1 (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1639-1643PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), but a very good substrate for the low pH route in murine leukemia cells and hence has properties that should permit the separation of these processes (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, when influx of [3H]folic acid (1 μm) was monitored in PyrR100 cells as a function of increasing concentrations of unlabeled folic acid at pH 6.0, about 80% of influx was blocked by ≤10 μm folic acid. The remaining 20% was not inhibited by concentrations of folic acid in excess of 100 μm. The IC50 for the folic acid inhibitable component was ∼1 μm. This established that the major component of influx at pH 6.0 was mediated by a process with a high affinity for folic acid, clearly different from RFC1 which has an affinity for this folate which is 2 orders of magnitude lower (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1639-1643PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Similarly, at physiological pH (Fig. 2 B), the component of [3H]folic acid influx inhibited by low concentrations of folic acid (IC50 ∼ 2 μm) in PyrR100 cells was ∼70% and the residual influx (∼30%) was not inhibited by folic acid concentrations of up to 200 μm. Hence, the major component of folic acid influx at physiological pH appears to be mediated by the low pH transporter. The components of [3H]MTX influx mediated by RFC1 and the low pH transporter were further distinguished by studies in which folic acid inhibition was evaluated over a broad pH range in PyrR100 and AA8 cells. It can be seen in Fig.3 that in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled folic acid, the pH profiles of [3H]MTX influx in both PyrR100 (Fig.3 A) and AA8 cells (Fig. 3 B) become essentially identical with a single pH optimum at physiological pH. Hence, the contribution of the low pH transporter is abolished and the remaining RFC1 component is retained. The small decline in MTX influx at pH 7.4 likely represents the loss of residual activity of the low pH transporter. Another approach was utilized in an attempt to achieve selective blockade of RFC1 activity while minimizing inhibition of the low pH transporter. An agent that appears to have desirable properties in this regard is PGA1. As illustrated in Fig.4 A, PGA1 inhibits MTX influx at pH 7.4 by ∼90% at concentrations of ∼50 μm, consistent with near complete suppression of transport activity via RFC1 in PyrR100 cells. This is further illustrated in the pH profile for MTX influx in PyrR100 cells in Fig. 5. In the presence of 25 μm PGA1, the RFC1-mediated component is lost and the profile of [3H]MTX influx approximates that of [3H]folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells. In contrast, PGA1 (100 μm) inhibition of folic acid influx at pH 6.0 in PyrR100 cells did not exceed ∼25%, consistent with the major portion of folate transport mediated by the low pH route (Fig.4 B). The small inhibitory effect might be related to a small RFC1-mediated component and/or some inhibition of the low pH route by high PGA1 levels. In AA8 cells, the portion of [3H]folic acid influx inhibited by PGA1 at pH 6.0 and 7.5 is even smaller (15–20%, data not shown).Figure 5Effect of PGA1 on the pH-dependent influx of [3H]MTX in PyrR100 cells. MTX influx at pH 5.0–8.0 was measured in the absence (solid squares) or presence of 25 μm PGA1 (open squares) added simultaneously with 1 μm [3H]MTX to PyrR100 cells at time 0. In the absence of PGA1, the pH profiles for [3H]MTX influx (solid squares) and [3H]folic acid (solid triangles with dashed line) in PyrR100cells are those depicted in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A variety of experimental approaches exclude the possibility that influx of folates is mediated by the folate receptor, endocytic process in these cells. (a) Northern blot analysis with poly(A)+ mRNA from wild-type and PyrR100cells showed no detectable folate receptor transcript in either cell line (data not shown). (b) Using a sensitive, high-affinity [3H]folic acid (high performance liquid chromatography purified immediately prior to use) binding assay in the presence or absence of competing unlabeled folic acid, no folate receptor expression was detected. (c) Binding of [3H]folic acid via the folate receptor is typically accompanied by a “high intercept” when folic acid uptake is analyzed as a function of time. This was not observed in PyrR100 cells. (d) Monensin, a potent vesicular transport inhibitor which blocks folate receptor-mediated endocytosis, enhanced rather than inhibited influx of folic acid. To evaluate whether the pH dependence of folate influx is accompanied by changes in net concentrations achieved within the cell, studies evaluated the full time course of uptake and steady-state levels for folic acid and MTX. As indicated in Fig.6, a clear increase in the steady-state levels of folic acid was observed in both AA8 (Fig. 6 A) and PyrR100 cells (Fig. 6 B) at pH 6.0 relative to pH 7.5 under conditions in which folic acid reduction was blocked with TMQ. While the percentage increase was greater in AA8 cells, it should be noted that the absolute levels of folic acid accumulation in PyrR100 cells were 10-fold higher. Steady-state levels of MTX accumulation were comparable in AA8 cells (Fig. 6 C) with a small increase in PyrR100 cells (Fig. 6 D). Hence, enhanced influx of folic acid and MTX is accompanied by steady-state levels that are the same or greater at pH 6.0 than at pH 7.4. Since the activity of a low pH transporter was augmented in PyrR100 cells during selection with pyrimethamine in the presence of folic acid (2Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), studies were undertaken to evaluate the extent of acidification of the medium during growth of CHO cell monolayers under similar conditions. It can be seen in Fig.7 that after plating, the pH of the growth medium falls steadily to a value of 7.0 by day 4. When AA8 and PyrR100 cells begin to reach confluence at days 6 and 7, respectively, the culture medium reaches a pH of 6.8 and 6.7, respectively. In contrast, the pH of the cell-free growth medium, alone, was stable at about pH 7.3. In a prior report (2Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), resistance to the lipid-soluble antifolate pyrimethamine was associated with a marked decrease in folate growth requirement in a CHO cell line, PyrR100. Resistance was shown to be due primarily to the loss of an energy-dependent efflux pump resulting in marked augmentation of folate accumulation (2Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There was a smaller increase (2-fold) in folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells. This paper clarifies the basis for this increase in folic acid influx within the context of the known routes of transport for folate compounds: RFC1, folate receptor-mediated endocytosis, and a process that functions optimally at low pH. The data indicate that the major change in folic acid influx in PyrR100 cells can be attributed to a substantial increase in transport mediated by the low pH route and that the increase in folic acid influx observed at physiological pH is due largely to the residual activity of this process. Beyond this, the findings represent the first demonstration of the functional overexpression of a low pH transporter as the result of suppression of DHFR activity by a lipophilic antifolate. This is apparently one of several stable functional alterations which take place to meet the need for high intracellular folate levels to overcome the pharmacologic activity of this class of antifolates in the PyrR100 cell line (16Sprecher H. Barr H.M. Slotky J.I. Tzukerman M. Eytan G.D. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20668-20676Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence exclude the possibility that the overexpressed folate transporter in PyrR100 cells is a mutated RFC1 with increased affinity for folic acid and an optimal activity at pH 6.0. (i) The pH optimum of a single transporter with an altered RFC1 cannot be acidic for one substrate, folic acid, but with an unchanged physiological pH optimum for another cognate substrate such as MTX. Furthermore, as with AA8 cells, PyrR100 cells displayed a single low pH optimum for folic acid transport but two pH optima for MTX transport, consistent with two distinct transport entities. (ii) The low pH folic acid transport activity is increased 3-fold in PyrR100 cells, whereas wild-type MTX transport activity is retained at physiological pH. A single transport entity (i.e. even a mutated RFC1) cannot at the same time be overexpressed for one substrate (folic acid) without a change in its cognate substrate (MTX). (iii) Folic acid blocks [3H]MTX influx via the overexpressed low pH transport route but leaves the RFC-mediated component of transport unchanged at physiological pH at the same level as in parental AA8 cells. IV PGA1 which was found here to be a potent and selective inhibitor of RFC1 in both parental AA8 and PyrR100 cells, did not suppress the low pH folic acid transporter. These observations further support the conclusion that the low pH folate transporter is independent of, and distinct from, RFC1. Finally, (v) structural alterations (i.e. mutations) of RFC1 are most frequently associated with altered transport of MTX resulting in resistance to this antifolate but PyrR100 cells retain wild-type sensitivity to MTX. As indicated above, the data show that the low pH route makes an important contribution to folic acid transport at physiological pH under usual growth conditions in CHO cells. This clarifies, for this cell line at least, the mechanism of folic acid transport and its relationship to RFC1, an issue that has been quite controversial (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1639-1643PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, as the growth medium of monolayer cultures gradually acidifies, RFC1 activity falls and the cells depend increasingly on the low pH route for delivery of folic acid. Folic acid is a favored substrate for this route; in contrast to the very low affinity of RFC1 for folic acid (3Yang C. Dembo M. Sirotnak F.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 75: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Henderson G.B. Suresh M.R. Vitols K.S. Huennekens F.M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1639-1643PubMed Google Scholar, 5Goldman I.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1971; 186: 400-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the affinity of the low pH transporter for this folate is orders of magnitude higher (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An important corollary of this difference in influx is the steady-state levels of folic acid achieved at low pH, the parameter of transport that determines the availability of folates for biosynthetic processes (19Zhao R. Seither R.L. Brigle K.E. Sharina I.G. Wang P.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21207-21212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Steady-state levels are not only sustained, but are increased by the low pH transporter. Finally, folate influx at low pH is more prominent than at physiological pH in CHO cells as compared with L1210 cells. MTX influx at pH 6.0 is comparable to that at physiological pH in AA8 cells; however, in murine L1210 leukemia cells, MTX influx at pH 6.0 was one-third of that at physiological pH (13Henderson G.B. Strauss B.P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1709-1714PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sierra E.E. Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Goldman I.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus there is high basal activity of the low pH transporter in CHO cells. Taken together, these factors favor stable overexpression of the low pH route as a mechanism by which CHO cells adapt to the requirement for increased folate accumulation. PyrR100 cells are 1000-fold resistant to pyrimethamine, 37-fold and 28-fold cross-resistant to TMQ and piritrexim, respectively, all of which are lipid-soluble antifolates that inhibit mammalian DHFR (1Assaraf Y.G. Slotky J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4556-4566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PyrR100 cells were shown to have a 3-fold higher folate pool size than AA8 cells (20Jansen G. Barr H.M. Kathmann I. Peter G.H. Noordhuis P. Bunni M. Priest D.G. Assaraf Y.G. Pteridines. 1997; 8: 116-117Google Scholar). This expanded pool of cellular folates in PyrR100 represents a very useful adaptation to DHFR inhibition, particularly by lipid-soluble antifolates that have a relatively low affinity for this enzyme. Hence, increased pools of reduced folates result in the build-up of high levels of dihydrofolate, as antifolate associates with DHFR and tetrahydrofolates are oxidized, which then compete with the antifolate for the small percentage of enzyme sites that are sufficient to sustain tetrahydrofolate synthesis within the cell (21Seither R.L. Trent D.F. Mikulecky D.C. Rape T.J. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17016-17023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies lipophilic antifolate-resistant clonal variants exposed to nanomolar concentrations of the lipid-soluble antifolate TMQ displayed marked resistance to the selecting agent and prominent cross-resistance to other lipophilic antifolates, but retained wild-type sensitivity to MTX without quantitative or qualitative changes in DHFR. This resistance was genetically stable and the frequency of emergence of resistant clones was enhanced 100-fold when cells were treated with a mutagen such as γ-irradiation prior to drug selection (17Assaraf Y.G. Molina A. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18326-18334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sharma R.C. Assaraf Y.G. Schimke R.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2949-2959PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that during the early stages of exposure to low concentrations of lipophilic antifolates such as trimetrexate or pyrimethamine, stable mutations occur which abolish folate exporter function, while other mutations may increase the expression of a low pH folate transporter. PyrR100 cells also display 31-fold cross-resistance to the folate-based glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase inhibitor, 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid, and 27-fold cross-resistance to the lipid-soluble thymidylate synthase inhibitor AG377 data not shown. High folate cofactor pools would be a basis for resistance to these agents by competition at the tetrahydrofolate cofactor-dependent enzyme sites. Alternatively, high folate pools could inhibit antifolate polyglutamylation at the level of folylpoly-γ-glutamyl synthetase thereby blocking the formation of the active polyglutamate congeners. For instance, an antifolate-resistant CCRF-CEM cell line with high tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools and wild-type folylpoly-γ-glutamyl synthetase activity, has very low levels of antifolate polyglutamylation (23Mauritz R. Assaraf Y.G. Drori S. Schornagel J.H. Priest D.G. Bunni M. Pinedo H.M. Peters G.J. Jansen G. Pteridines. 1997; 8: 92-93Google Scholar). This mechanism of resistance to antifolates that require polyglutamylation for activity also has features similar to what was recently reported for 5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid-resistant L1210 cells in which folate cofactor accumulation was markedly enhanced (24Tse A. Brigle K. Moran R.G. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38 (abstr.): 162Google Scholar). In this case, however, augmented cellular folate levels were due to mutations in RFC1 that resulted in a marked increase in the affinity of carrier for folic acid with resultant enhanced transport. Folate transport systems that operate optimally at acidic pH have been identified in rat and human small intestine (25Selhub J. Rosenberg I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4489-4493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith M.E. Matty A.J. Blair J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 964-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and in rat kidney brush-border membrane vesicles (28Bhandari S.D. Joshi S.K. McMartin K.E. Biochim.

Med. 1991; 196: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The driving force for intestinal and kidney folate transport in membrane vesicles is the transmembrane proton gradient and not the acidic extracellular pH alone (29Bhandari S.D. Fortney T. McMartin K.E. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Schron C.M. Washington C. Blitzer B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Folate uptake mediated by the mammalian low pH intestinal transporter has been attributed to either a OH−/folate exchange or H+/folate cotransport (30Schron C.M. Washington C. Blitzer B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2030-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Schron C.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 120: 192-200Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The H+ transmembrane gradient is also the driving force for intestinal and renal PEPT1 and PEPT2 H+-coupled peptide transporters (32Fei Y.J. Liu W. Prasad P.D. Kekuda R. Oblak T.G. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 99-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The basis for enhanced influx and increased transmembrane gradients for folic acid at low pH in CHO cells is not clear. This could be due to a proton-driven folate cotransport energized by a transmembrane H+ gradient. Alternatively, the low pH folate transporter could have maximal activity at acidic pH without H+/folate cotransport. The acidic pH optimum of the low pH transport route cannot be attributed to the protonation state of the α- and γ-carboxyl residues of folates that have pKa values of 3.1–3.5 and 4.6–4.8, respectively (34Poe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3724-3728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since protonation would not change significantly over the pH range of 6.0–8.0 studied. Nor, for the same reason, could the ionization of the N-1 nitrogen of the pteridine ring (pKa = 2.4) be relevant to the pH dependence of transport (34Poe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3724-3728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Temple C. Montgomery J.A. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Folates. Wiley, New York1984: 61-120Google Scholar). In summary, this paper provides evidence, for the first time, of the functional importance of a folic acid transport route distinct from RFC1 and the folate receptors, that has a low pH optimum. This route accounts for the majority of folic acid transport at physiological pH in CHO cells and is concentrative; the low pH mechanism generates higher transmembrane gradients for folic acid than are achieved by RFC1. While RFC1 is thought to be an anion exchanger the mechanism by which the low pH route achieves uphill transport is not clear and is currently under study. The relationship between this transporter and other low pH folate transport processes in kidney and intestine remains to be clarified."

Although earlier studies have suggested that the functional properties of these receptors are similar, mounting evidence suggests that these receptors are capable of inducing distinct functional responses. Accordingly, we have examined the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ transients induced by each of these receptors alone (homotypic receptor cross-linking) and together (heterotypic receptor cross-linking). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored FcγRIIIb induces a rise in [Ca2+] after homotypic cross-linking that is independent of ligand-mediated engagement of the transmembrane FcγRIIa. Both receptors were sensitive to the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate, but FcγRIIa-induced signaling was uniquely sensitive to the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. FcγRIIa but not FcγRIIIb engages a cAMP-sensitive and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent pathway(s) that results in the Ca2+-transient. When these receptors are cross-linked into heterotypic clusters, a synergistic rise in [Ca2+] is observed that is accompanied by synergistic increases in the phospholipase Cγ-breakdown products inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diglyceride.

The cluster of eight genes for human FcγR on chromosome 1q encode a diverse group of receptors that display similar extracellular domains yet remarkably diverse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (1Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 2Kimberly R.P. Salmon J.E. Edberg J.C.

Human neutrophils constitutively express two distinct FcγR: FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb. FcγRIIa is a transmembrane receptor that can initiate many neutrophil inflammatory responses including degranulation and the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates. FcγRIIIb is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein that can also initiate a number of neutrophil inflammatory responses. Tyrosine phosphorylation events are essential for the early intracellular signals initiated by FcγR. FcγRIIa has an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif in the cytoplasmic domain (4Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar), and mutational analysis has shown the importance of the tyrosine residues in this motif for the functional capacity of this receptor (5Edberg J.C.

Cross-linking of FcγRIIa results in the association of the receptor with src-family tyrosine kinases (fgr in PMN,lyn and hck in THP-1 cells) and Syk (p72syk) (8Hamada F. Aoki M. Akiyama T.

In myeloid cell lines, FcγRIIa-induced activation of PLCγ by Syk results in a rapid IP3-mediated [Ca2+] transient (11Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanisms for early tyrosine phosphorylation events triggered after cross-linking of FcγRIIIb are less clear. Most likely the result of preferential partitioning of GPI-anchored proteins and palmitylated src-family kinases in lipid domains in the plasma membrane (13Maxfield F.R. Mayor S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), FcγRIIIb, like many GPI-anchored proteins (14Brown D. Curr. Opin.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An early view that FcγRIIIb is simply a binding molecule without signaling capacity (16Huizinga T.W. van Kemenade F. Koenderman L. Dolman K.M. von dem Borne A.E. Tetteroo P.A. Roos D. J.

Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although some FcγRIIIb functions may overlap with FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIb does have a distinct repertoire of cell programs that it initiates. Unlike FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIb does induce a unique proinflammatory phenotype in neutrophils (21Kocher M. Siegel M.E. Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3940-3948PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not a phagocytic receptor (17Anderson C.L. Shen L. Eicher D.M. Wewers M.D. Gill J.K. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1333-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 22Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J.

Therefore, using changes in the intracellular [Ca2+]i levels, which are induced by FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb and which are required for many receptor functions (5Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 4333-4343PubMed Google Scholar), we have explored the possibility of differential regulation of signaling by FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb. Both receptors elicit a brisk increase in [Ca2+]i derived primarily from intracellular stores. Unlike FcγRIIa, which engages a cAMP-sensitive IP3-dependent pathway for generation of [Ca2+]i transients, FcγRIIIb engages a cAMP-insensitive pathway that is also resistant to the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These two distinct pathways can interact synergistically at the level of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate breakdown to lead to enhanced transients in [Ca2+]i, reflecting both intracellular and extracellular stores. Engagement of these two distinct pathways may provide the basis for different cell programs initiated by these receptors. All buffers and solutions were made with ultra-purified endotoxin-free water (Millipore). Glassware was rendered endotoxin-free by either washing in chromic acid/nitric acid or by baking at 190 °C for 4 h. A modified PBS solution was prepared with 5 mm KCl and 5 mm glucose. Modified PBS plus Ca2+ and Mg2+ included 1.0 mm CaCl2 and 1.65 mmMgCl2. Solutions were confirmed to have <0.05 endotoxin units/ml by the limulus lysate assay (Associates of Cape Cod).

Goat F(ab′)2 fragments specific for murine IgG gamma and light chains (GAM) (TAGO Immunologicals, Burlingame, CA and Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were obtained in both unconjugated and phycoerythrin-conjugated forms. Ab Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments contained no detectable intact IgG or heavy chains as judged by silver stain SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate, tyrophostin, lavendustin A, 2-hydroxy-5-(2,5-dihydroxybenzyl)aminobenzoic acid and staurosporine) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.. All other kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were from Calbiochem. Misoprostol (MP) was the kind gift of Dr. Barbara Struthers (G. D. Searle). Remaining reagents were from Sigma. Fresh heparinized blood from healthy donors was diluted with an equal volume of modified PBS at 25 °C, and PMN were separated from the diluted blood by a two-step discontinuous density gradient consisting of ficoll-hypaque (density = 1.075 and 1.125 g/ml) (28Edberg J.C. Redecha P.B. Salmon J.E. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1642-1649PubMed Google Scholar). After two washes with modified PBS, the cells were treated with distilled water for 15 s to lyse contaminating erythrocytes, followed by an equal volume of 1.8% saline solution to restore isotonicity. The remaining PMN were resuspended in modified PBS at 1 × 107 cells/ml. By microscopic examination >95% of the cells were PMN. Separations were completed within 2 h, and all experimental procedures were completed within 5–6 h of phlebotomy. Donors were typed for the FcγRIIa-H131/R131 polymorphism by a combination of mAb reactivity (using mAbs 41H16 and IV.3 exactly as described (27Gosselin E.J. Brown M.F. Anderson C.L. Zipf T.F. Guyre P.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1817-1822PubMed Google Scholar)) and/or by DNA genotyping using allele-specific PCR reactions (29Edberg J.C. Wainstein E. Wu J. Csernok E. Sneller M.C. Hoffman G.S. Keystone E.C. Gross W.L. Kimberly R.P. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 1997; 14: 183-195PubMed Google Scholar). There is complete concordance between these two assays. Indo-1, a fluorescent dye with spectral properties that change with the binding of free Ca2+, was used to measure changes in intracellular calcium concentrations as we have described (5Edberg J.C.

Med. 1990; 171: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PMN were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 5 μm indo-1 AM. After loading, the cells were washed once with modified PBS and maintained at 25 °C in the dark. In most experiments, an aliquot of cells (at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml) was opsonized with anti-FcγR mAb for 5 min at 37 °C followed by one wash at room temperature. The cells were then resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in modified PBS, and an aliquot was removed to quantitate mAb opsonization levels by indirect immunofluorescence (see below). The cells were then warmed to 37 °C for 5 min in modified PBS plus 1.1 mmCa2+ and 1.6 mm Mg2+ before analysis. Cells were loaded in an identical manner with fura-2 AM (2 μm) for single-cell Ca2+ analysis (see below). Indo-1 fluorescence analysis was performed on an SLM 8000C Spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). Excitation at 355 nm was provided by a xenon arc lamp and a monochromator, whereas emission at 405 and 490 nm were simultaneously monitored with two monochromators and photomultiplier tubes. A corresponding stimulus was injected into each cuvette at 60 s without interruption of acquisition. Constant temperature (37 °C) and stirring was maintained throughout each experiment. Each sample was individually calibrated for both maximal and minimum indo-1 fluorescence by the sequential addition of Triton X-100 and EDTA, and the 405/490 nm ratio was converted to [Ca2+] as described previously (5Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Kimberly R.P. Ahlstrom J.W. Click M.E. Edberg J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For analysis of intracellular Ca2+ transients induced by the opsonized E, 100 μl of fura-2-loaded PMN (1.5 × 106cell/ml) were added to a 25-mm-diameter round glass coverslip and allowed to settle for 15 min at 37 °C. During the last 5 min, 1.1 mm Ca2+ and 1.6 mmMg2+ was added. The coverslips were then transferred to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot (Nikon), and the ratio of fluorescence emission of fura-2 was monitored. After the establishment of a base line, E-IV.3 or E-3G8 F(ab′)2 were added. Analysis was continued for an additional 5 min. To quantitate stimulus-induced changes in [IP3], isolated PMN (pre-equilibrated with Ca2+/Mg2+ as described above) were mixed with mAb 3G8 IgG, fMLP, or opsonized E (see above) for various periods of time followed by rapid addition of ice-cold 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Alternatively, cells were pre-opsonized with anti-FcγR mAb Fab or F(ab′)2 fragments for 5 min at 37 °C. After one wash, cells were re-equilibrated with Ca2+/Mg2+ and then stimulated with F(ab′)2 GAM and incubated for various periods of time followed by the rapid addition of ice-cold 15% trichloroacetic acid. In both cases, the precipitates were pelleted in a microfuge for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were extracted three times with 10 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether and neutralized to pH 7.5 with NaHCO3. IP3 levels were quantitated by competitive receptor binding assay with [3H]IP3 and IP3-binding protein (30Gerwins P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) exactly according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Diglyceride mass in total lipid extracts was determined by conversion to [32P]phosphatidic acid with [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) and diglyceride kinase (Calbiochem) following the method of Preiss et al. (31Preiss J.E. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. Niedel J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were prepared and stimulated exactly as described above for quantitation of IP3 levels except that 5 μg/ml cytochalsin B was included during the final 5-min equilibration with Ca2+/Mg2+. After various periods of time, cells were rapidly lysed with 50 volumes of iced 2:1 methanol:chloroform. Extracts were processed as described previously (32Rapuano B.E. Bockman R.S. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Biotinylated mAb IV.3 Fab, mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2, and bovine erythrocytes (E) were prepared as we have previously described (33Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Biotinylated E were saturated with streptavidin and washed. The resulting E were coated with biotinylated mAb, and the level of mAb binding was verified by flow cytometry. For E-IV.3 Fab or E-3G8 F(ab′)2-induced stimulation of IP3 and diglyceride production, E were added to PMN suspensions at a ratio of 25:1 (E:PMN) and gently pelleted for 15 s followed by incubation at 37 °C for various periods of time. Aliquots of PMN at 5 × 106 cell/ml were incubated with saturating concentrations of primary mAb for 30 min at 4 °C. After two washes, the cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 at 4 °C for another 30 min. In addition, cells obtained from each [Ca2+]i measurement test cuvette were directly stained with saturating amounts of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG F(ab′)2 at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, the cells were analyzed immediately for immunofluorescence using a Cytofluorograf IIS flow cytometer and a 2151 computer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Westwood, MA). FcγR-mediated neutrophil stimulation activates the respiratory burst, which is dependent on receptor-induced elevations in the intracellular [Ca2+]. Since FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb associate with different tyrosine kinases (15Zhou M. Lublin D.M. Link D.C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13553-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the rise in intracellular Ca2+ induced by these structurally distinct receptors might be differentially regulated. Accordingly, using anti-receptor mAb Fab and F(ab′)2fragments, we developed an experimental system to cross-link these receptors in a receptor-specific manner involving one type (homotypic) or both types (heterotypic) of receptors. When either neutrophil FcγRIIa or FcγRIIIb are cross-linked with anti-receptor mAb Fab or F(ab′)2 fragments (homotypic cross-linking), a brisk rise in [Ca2+] is observed (Fig.1 A). Indeed, the rise in [Ca2+] is similar in magnitude to the flux observed in response to the potent neutrophil-activating peptide fMLP (Fig.1 A). This rise in [Ca2+] is due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. When either EDTA or EGTA is added to the extracellular media, the FcγR and fMLP-mediated [Ca2+] fluxes are intact (results not shown) (18Kimberly R.P. Ahlstrom J.W. Click M.E. Edberg J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Watson F. Gasmi L. Edwards S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17944-17951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The quantitative level of the FcγR-induced Ca2+ flux is dependent on the concentration of the stimulating anti-receptor mAb. Over a subsaturating range of mAb concentrations, a dose response in the quantitative rise in [Ca2+] was observed (Fig.1 B), and at saturating concentrations of anti-receptor mAb, the rise in [Ca2+] induced by cross-linking FcγRIIIb is consistently higher in peak magnitude than the rise induced by cross-linking FcγRIIa (1417 ± 183 versus 846 ± 82 nm peak rise in [Ca2+], FcγRIIaversus FcγRIIIb respectively, p < 0.005,n = 20). The FcγRIIa-induced rise in [Ca2+] is dependent on the integrity of the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif in the cytoplasmic domain (5Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6Odin J.A. Edberg J.C. Painter C.J. Kimberly R.P. Unkeless J.C. Science. 1991; 254: 1785-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Indik Z.K. Park J.G. Hunter S. Schreiber A.D. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the GPI-anchored FcγRIIIb induces functional responses (such as the rise in [Ca2+]) is less clear. One possible explanation for the mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2 + F(ab′)2 GAM-induced rise in [Ca2+] is through ligand-dependent engagement of FcγRIIa. This could occur if either the anti-FcγRIIIb mAb F(ab′)2 or the cross-linking GAM F(ab′)2contained intact IgG molecules. Although SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis did not indicate the presence of any intact IgG under nonreducing conditions or of undigested heavy chain under reducing conditions in our Fab or F(ab′)2 preparations, we prepared biotinylated anti-FcγRIIa Fab and FcγRIIIb F(ab′)2 fragments, and when neutrophils were opsonized with either biotinylated mAb, a rise in [Ca2+] was observed upon addition of streptavidin (Fig.2 A). These data exclude the possibility that the homotypic FcγRIIIb-induced rise in Ca2+ is the result of contaminating IgG in the F(ab′)2 GAM preparation. To exclude the possibility that the mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2preparation contained residual IgG that could engage FcγRIIa, PMN were first saturated with unlabeled mAb IV.3 Fab. To confirm that any IgG remaining in our 3G8 F(ab′)2 preparation could be blocked from engaging FcγRIIa by IV.3 Fab, we first examined the mAb 3G8 IgG-induced rise in Ca2+. This mAb induces formation of heterotypic FcγRIIa + FcγRIIIb clusters (5Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and as expected, the magnitude of this response is sensitive to the FcγRIIa-H131/R131 polymorphism; the IgG1 mAb 3G8 binds FcγRIIa-H131 poorly and induces a diminished Ca2+ transient relative to that observed in FcγRIIa-R131/R131 donors (Fig. 2 B). Preincubation with mAb IV.3 Fab completely blocks this mAb 3G8 IgG-induced Ca2+transient, demonstrating that heterotypic cross-linking of both receptors is required for this response (Fig. 2 B). mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2 alone (resulting in mono- or bivalent engagement of FcγRIIIb) does not elicit a Ca2+ transient (Fig.2 B). When neutrophils were preincubated mAb IV.3 Fab (to block the ligand binding site of FcγRIIa), the streptavidin-induced 3G8 F(ab′)2-biotin Ca2+ transient was unaltered (Fig. 2 C). Additional controls included the complete blockade of the biotinylated IV.3-Fab + streptavidin-induced Ca2+ transient by preincubation with IV.3 Fab. Also, preincubation of PMN with unlabeled mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2 did not alter the biotinylated IV.3-Fab + streptavidin-induced rise in [Ca2+] but did block the mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2-biotin-induced [Ca2+] transient (Fig.2 C). These results categorically demonstrate that homotypic cross-linking of FcγRIIIb results in a rise in [Ca2+] that is independent of ligand-mediated interactions with the transmembrane FcγRIIa. Cross-linking of neutrophil FcγR results in tyrosine kinase activity (3Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 15Zhou M. Lublin D.M. Link D.C.

The dependence of the FcγRIIIb-induced Ca2+ transient on protein-tyrosine kinase activity was shown with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate (100 μm), a stable erbstatin analog; the FcγRIIa- and FcγRIIIb-mediated rise in [Ca2+] was completely blocked by pretreatment with this protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fig.3). Cell viability was unaltered by the brief exposure (5 min) to this tyrosine kinase inhibitor as determined by exclusion of trypan blue (control, 90% cells viable; treated cells, 85% cells viable). Comparable results were obtained with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors tyrophostin (40 μg/ml, n = 3), lavendustin A (50 μg/ml, n = 2), 2-hydroxy-5-(2,5-dihydroxybenzyl)aminobenzoic acid (1 μg/ml,n = 3), and staurosporine, which inhibits both tyrosine and ser/thr kinases (0.5 μg/ml, n = 3). However, differential sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was observed for the FcγRII- and FcγRIII-mediated [Ca2+] transients. When neutrophils were incubated with 100 μmgenistein for 5 min, the rise in [Ca2+] induced by cross-linking FcγRIIa (Fig. 3) and by fMLP (results not shown) was completely abolished. Surprisingly, the FcγRIIIb-induced rise in [Ca2+] was not abrogated by 100 μmgenistein (Fig. 3). In four independent paired experiments, the ability of FcγRIIa but not FcγRIIIb to initiate a rise in [Ca2+] was abrogated by 100 μm genistein (FcγRIIa/FcγRIIIb % control, 5 ± 4%/52 ± 6%;n = 4, p < 0.001). The differential sensitivity to genistein was also observed at 50 μmgenistein (FcγRIIa/FcγRIIIb % control, 26 ± 3%/63 ± 2%, n = 3, p < 0.001). These concentrations of genistein have been shown to completely inhibit neutrophil FcγRIIa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and phagocytosis (37Liang L. Huang C.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Kobayashi K. Takahashi K. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to block neutrophil degranulation and superoxide production in response to cross-linking of FcαR and L-selectin (35Zhang W. Lachmann P.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2599-2606PubMed Google Scholar,36Waddell T.K. Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Kishimoto T.K. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15403-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Little or no sensitivity of the FcγRIIa- or FcγRIIIb-induced Ca2+ transient to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced carboxamidomethylated and maleylated-lysozyme (100 μg/ml,n = 2) or the ser/thr kinase inhibitors calphostin C, H-7, H-8, and H-1004 was observed. These results demonstrate that both FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIb initiate Ca2+ transients in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. Despite this similarity, the differential sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein suggests that these receptors are engaging distinct intracellular activation pathways. It has been shown that neutrophil FcγR-induced superoxide production and phagocytosis are inhibited by occupancy of the adenosine A2 receptor (39Salmon J.E. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2235-2240PubMed Google Scholar, 40Zalavary S. Stendahl O. Bengtsson T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41Cronstein B.N. Daguma L. Nichols D. Hutchison A.J. Williams M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1150-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because these responses are dependent on a rise in [Ca2+], we tested the susceptibility of FcγR-specific [Ca2+] transients to the potent adenosine A2 receptor agonist NECA. Neutrophils were treated with varying concentrations of NECA for 5 min at 37 °C before FcγR cross-linking. In the presence of 10−6m NECA (the same concentration required for inhibition of FcγR phagocytosis (39Salmon J.E. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2235-2240PubMed Google Scholar)), the rise in [Ca2+] induced by cross-linking of FcγRIIa was significantly inhibited (38.0 ± 4.3% of control,n = 4, p < 0.01) (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the FcγRIIIb-mediated rise in [Ca2+] was unaltered by the same concentrations of NECA (98.1 ± 21.5% of control,n = 4, p > 0.05), demonstrating differential regulation of FcγRII and FcγRIII signaling by this adenosine A2 agonist (FcγRIIa versusFcγRIIIb, n = 4, p < 0.01). Engagement of adenosine A2 receptors has been shown to lead to transient increases in intracellular levels of cAMP, increases in intracellular [Ca2+] in mast cells, and to activation of a membrane-associated serine/threonine protein phosphatase (42Cronstein B.N.

https://openalex.org/W1970611209,"The 75-kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase II) hydrolyzes various signaling molecules including the following: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Although studied extensively, a demonstrably full-length cDNA encoding 5-phosphatase II has yet to be isolated. In this study we used a human partial 2.3-kilobase pair (kb) cDNA to screen mouse brain and kidney cDNA libraries, resulting in the isolation of a 3.7-kb cDNA (M5), which by multiple criteria represents a full-length cDNA encoding a 115-kDa 5-phosphatase II. We also isolated a smaller cDNA (M22) with a unique N terminus that encodes a 104-kDa polypeptide. Analysis of these cDNAs suggests a further 87-kDa isoform may arise from differential splicing resulting in translation at methionine 234 in M5. RNA analysis of tissues demonstrates expression of two mRNA species of approximately 4.0 or 3.0 kb, respectively. Probes unique to the 5′ end of M5 or M22 hybridized to the 4.0- or 3.0-kb transcripts, respectively. RNA analysis using probes derived from sequence 3′ to the potential splice site in M5 and M22 hybridized to both transcripts. Expression of the recombinant 115-kDa protein, or a smaller recombinant protein lacking the N terminus transiently in COS-7 cells, showed localization of enzyme activity to the membrane. Removal of the C-terminal CAAX motif resulted in a significant translocation of the protein lacking the N terminus but not the 115-kDa 5-phosphatase to the cytosol. Western blot analysis of membrane and cytosolic fractions of multiple mouse tissues confirmed the 115-kDa 5-phosphatase II was located in the membrane, whereas the 104- and 87-kDa isoforms were prominent in the cytosol. Collectively these studies demonstrate the widespread expression of at least three isoforms of 5-phosphatase II derived from RNA splicing events. This allows differential distribution of the 5-phosphatase II activity between the membrane and cytosol of the cell and thereby may regulate enzyme access to phosphoinositide-derived signaling molecules.

This allows differential distribution of the 5-phosphatase II activity between the membrane and cytosol of the cell and thereby may regulate enzyme access to phosphoinositide-derived signaling molecules. The phosphoinositide-derived signaling cascade is initiated following cellular activation by many agonists including growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 5-phosphatase II, polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; Ins(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; aa, amino acid(s). can be phosphorylated by a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase generating PtdIns(4)-P and PtdIns(4, 5)P2, respectively. Phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 leads to the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and diacylglycerol, which mobilize intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C, respectively (1Majerus P.W.

An alternative signaling pathway involving phosphoinositides results from phosphoinositide 3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PtdIns-P, PtdIns(4)-P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the D3 position of the inositol ring, forming PtdIns(3)-P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, respectively. The 3-position phosphoinositides are not hydrolyzed by phospholipase C but represent signaling molecules in their own right, with proposed roles in activating various protein kinase C isoforms and the serine-threonine kinase Akt (reviewed in Ref. 3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). Many of the signaling molecules derived from the metabolism of phosphoinositides are regulated by removal of the 5-position phosphate of the inositol ring, which is carried out by a family of enzymes known as inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases (5-phosphatases). Nine family members have been cloned to date and all contain a common “5-phosphatase domain” (4Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Mitchell C.A.

Recent studies using an antisense strategy have shown that decreased cellular levels of this enzyme in the unstimulated cell are associated with increased Ins(1,4,5)P3, intracellular calcium levels, and a transformed phenotype (15Speed C.J.

The 75-kDa 5-phosphatase shares substantial sequence homology even outside the 5-phosphatase domain with the 5-phosphatase mutated in Lowe's syndrome which is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by mental and growth retardation, cataracts, and renal tubular abnormalities leading to metabolic bone disease (22Attree O.

In addition this novel 5-phosphatase participates in cytokine and growth factor-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways via a number of structural motifs including an N-terminal SH2 domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (reviewed in Refs. 4Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 28Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 961-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The 5-phosphatase II was originally purified from human platelet cytosol as a 75-kDa polypeptide (16Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial human cDNA encoding the enzyme was initially obtained by screening for β-galactosidase fusion proteins that bind to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. As RNA analysis demonstrated a 4.4-kb transcript in human megakaryocytes, the 2.3-kb human cDNA did not represent a full-length clone (29Ross T.S. Jefferson A.B. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20283-20289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently Jefferson and Majerus (6Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) isolated another human cDNA encoding 5-phosphatase II and corrected the previous sequence, thereby revealing a C-terminal CAAX motif in the enzyme which may mediate membrane association. Mutation of the CAAX motif did not affect Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolysis but resulted in an approximately 30% decrease in PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis and a translocation of the enzyme from the membrane to the cytosol. The second human cDNA probably also does not represent a full-length clone, as there was no 5′-untranslated region and at 3.0 kb the cDNA is much smaller than the 4.4-kb mRNA transcript. RNA analysis of 5-phosphatase II expression suggests that more than one transcript is expressed in a variety of different tissues, indicating tissue-specific differential splicing may occur (30Speed C.J. Matzaris M. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we describe cDNA clones encoding several isoforms of mouse 5-phosphatase II, and we show these isoforms have a discrete tissue expression. The larger 115-kDa isoform appears to be associated with the membrane, whereas the 104-kDa isoform is more prominently expressed in the cytosol. These isoforms do not arise from proteolytic cleavage but rather result from RNA splicing events. Finally we show that membrane association of 5-phosphatase II is mediated not only by farnesylation of the CAAX motif but also by the N-terminal region of the 115-kDa 5-phosphatase II. [ortho-32P]Phosphoric acid, [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2, [α-32P] dCTP, and [35S]methionine were from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega or New England Biolabs. Sequenase II kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Bresatec, Australia. The mouse kidney λgt10 and mouse brain λZAP cDNA libraries were from Stratagene and were a kind donation by Ora Bernard, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia. All reagents unless otherwise stated were from Sigma. A 2384-bp human cDNA clone originally isolated by Ross et al. (29Ross T.S. Jefferson A.B. Mitchell C.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20283-20289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to clone a mouse 5-phosphatase II cDNA. A λgt10 mouse cDNA library (1 × 106 recombinants) was screened using the human 2.3-kb cDNA as a probe, resulting in the isolation of two clones M6 and M22, whose identity was verified as mouse homologues of the human 5-phosphatase II by DNA sequencing. As neither of these mouse cDNAs represented full-length clones, M6 was used to screen a mouse brain λZap II cDNA library (Stratagene). Seven positive clones were identified, plaque-purified, and subcloned into the vector Bluescript II KS− (pBlueSKII/m-5ptase). The longest cDNA (3.7 kb), designated M5, was sequenced on both strands by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method using an “oligo walk” strategy (Sequenase). The full-length mouse 5-phosphatase II (M5) was excised from pBlueSKII/m-5-phosphatase by digestion with the restriction enzymes NotI/DraI, which digest in the Bluescript vector immediately prior to the 5′ end of the cDNA and at nucleotide 3464 in the M5 sequence, respectively, and blunt end-ligated into the pSVTf expression vector (construct A) (31Madison E.L. Bird P.I. Gene (Amst .). 1992; 121: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A smaller form of 5-phosphatase II, lacking the N-terminal and insert sequences, was derived by XhoI/DraI restriction digestion, which cuts M5 at nucleotides 913 and 3464, respectively, and blunt end-ligated into pSVTf (construct B). The CAAX motif and additional 3′ sequences were removed from the full-length cDNA (M5) by digestion with XbaI/DraI, which removes 3′ nucleotides (2788–3464), followed by ligation into pSVTf (construct C). Finally, construct D was obtained by XhoI/XbaI digestion, at nucleotides 913 and 2788 in M5, followed by ligation of the excised 1875-bp fragment into pSVTf. Each of the constructs were expressed in COS-7 cells and also translated in vitro as described below. Each of the four constructs (A–D) in the pSVTf vector was linearized by digestion with SalI, mRNA produced by T7 RNA polymerase using the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega), and was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translated products were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, containing 2 mm glutamine. The cells were transfected with the various constructs using a DEAE-dextran procedure and were allowed to grow for 2 days (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.79Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 60 h after transfection and assayed for expression of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity (17Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed using at least three protein concentrations, so that linearity of enzyme activity per μg of protein in the assay was achieved, and less than 30% of the substrate, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or Ins(1,4,5)P3 was consumed. Cells were scraped from the plate and washed three times, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, containing 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated 3 × for 15 s on ice (LABSONIC 1510). The lysate was centrifuged briefly at 1,000 × g to remove intact cells, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant from this centrifugation represents the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100, and detergent-soluble membrane proteins were extracted at 4 °C, with gentle agitation overnight. The solution was centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant from this step represents the detergent-soluble membrane fraction. Ins(1,[32P]4,[32P]5)P3 was isolated from erythrocyte ghosts as described previously (33Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolysis was measured by extraction of released 32PO4 as described previously, using as substrate concentration 30 μm and representing the mean of three separate enzyme assays (10Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P25-phosphatase assays were performed as described previously using 250 μm [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (3500 cpm/nmol) and representing the mean of three assays, using three linear protein concentrations (17Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A membrane containing mRNA from various mouse tissues was purchased (Mouse Multi-Tissue Northern blot,CLONTECH). Using standard procedures (described below), the membrane was hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled full-length cDNA (M5) probe at 42 °C. All Northern blots were prehybridized in 0.05 mNaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.005 mNa2EDTA, 0.75 m NaCl, 10× Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide, 2% SDS at 42 °C for 2 h with continuous agitation. The labeled probe was then added and further incubated for 18 h at the same temperature. The membranes were then washed at room temperature three times with 2× standard saline citrate (0.03 m sodium tri-citrate, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl), 0.05% SDS over 40 min. The membranes were subsequently washed twice in 0.1× standard citrate saline, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 30 min. The multi-tissue Northern membrane was subsequently probed with an actin probe supplied with the membrane. RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells and was transferred to a nylon membrane as described (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.3-7.79Google Scholar), so that each lane contained 15 μg of mRNA. The probes used for analysis were derived as follows. The full-length cDNA encoding the mouse 5-phosphatase II (clone M5, probe A) was excised from pBlueSKII/m-5-phosphatase II by restriction digestion with NotI/DraI. Probe B, representing a 446-bp fragment from the 5′ end of clone M5, was isolated by NotI/HindIII digestion which digests at the 5′ end of the clone and at nucleotide 446. Probe C, a 300-bp fragment encompassing nucleotides 613–913 of M5, was isolated by EcoRI/XhoI digestion of pBlueSKII/m-5-phosphatase II. Probe D, a fragment from nucleotides 913 to 1117 bp, was derived by XhoI/DraIII digestion of pBlueSKII/m-5-phosphatase II. Probe E (530 bp) was isolated by EcoRI/NsiI digestion of clone M22. All DNA fragments were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified (Bresaclean, Bresatec, Australia). Membranes containing mRNA were incubated with α-32P-labeled probe (A–E) at 42 °C, using standard conditions. After autoradiography the membranes were allowed to decay for 2 months and then reprobed with an actin probe. Mouse kidney, spleen, testis, liver, lung, heart, and brain were isolated from 25 mice immediately after death. Tissues were homogenized in 5× (v/w) 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.83 mmbenzamidine and then sonicated 3 × for 15 s on ice (LABSONIC 1510). Intact cells were removed from the cell lysate by brief centrifugation at 1000 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, with supernatant from this step representing the cytosol. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100 and gently rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The sample was recentrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant represents the Triton-soluble membrane fraction, and the pellet represents the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction. For Western analysis 100 μg of protein from each subcellular fraction from various tissues was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed as described (34Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with antibody to the recombinant 5-phosphatase II (antiserum 732–916) antisera that had been affinity purified as described (30Speed C.J. Matzaris M. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Polyclonal antipeptide antibodies to the N-terminal sequence commencing at amino acid 53 (THRRMPITGDDVSLD) or to C-terminal amino acid sequence commencing at amino acid 1000 (EKKKGQEFIHQFLC) were coupled to diphtheria toxin. Affinity purified antibodies were obtained by chromatography of immune serum on a peptide coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B column and elution with 0.3 m glycine, pH 2.5. The full-length cDNA (M5) encoding 5-phosphatase II in the pYES vector (Invitrogen) was translated in vitro using the TNT T7 coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The translated products were incubated with 10 μg of detergent-soluble, resting, or thrombin-stimulated platelet lysate, in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EGTA, 4 mm leupeptin, 0.2 mmvanadate, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for up to 30 min at 37 °C. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm where indicated. Reaction products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, fixed, and then analyzed by fluorography. A 2.3-kb human cDNA was used as a probe to screen a mouse kidney λgt11 cDNA library resulting in the isolation of 1.6-kb (M6) and 1.5-kb (M22) cDNAs, both of which contained sequences highly homologous to the human 3.0-kb cDNA (6Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To obtain a full-length mouse clone the 1.6-kb cDNA (M6) was used to screen a mouse brain λgt11 cDNA library. Seven positive clones were obtained following screening 1 × 106 plaques, and the largest of these contained a 3.7-kb (M5) insert, as determined by Southern blot and restriction analysis. Sequence analysis of the 1.6- (M6) and 3.7-kb (M5) clones demonstrated that the 3687-bp cDNA (M5) has 2 kb further 3′ sequence than the 1.6-kb (M6) cDNA (Fig.1 a).Figure 15-Phosphatase II cDNAs. a, maps of the mouse cDNAs encoding the 5-phosphatase II.

We report here the use of Met methyl groups as site-specific structural markers to identify drug binding sites for trifluoperazine and bepridil on cTnC. Drug dependent changes in the NMR heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra of [methyl-13C]Met-labeled cTnC indicate that bepridil and trifluoperazine bind to similar sites but only in the presence of Ca2+. There are 3–4 drug binding sites in the N- and C-terminal domains of intact cTnC that exhibit fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Use of a novel spin-labeled phenothiazine and detection of isotope-filtered nuclear Overhauser effects allowed identification of drug binding sites in the shallow hydrophobic cup in the C-terminal domain and on two hydrophobic surfaces on the N-terminal regulatory domain. The data presented here, coupled with our previous study using covalent blocking groups, support a model in which the Ca2+-sensitizing binding site includes Met-45 in helix B of site I, and Met-60 and -80 in helices B and C of the regulatory site II.

The ability to sensitize cardiac muscle to Ca2+ would have promising therapeutic potential for the treatment for Ca2+ desensitization that is associated with congestive heart failure due to acute myocardial infarction and associated ischemia (1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ideally, the mechanism of sensitization would not involve altering Ca2+ transients in myocardial cells that are already metabolically challenged. Regulatory proteins located on the thin filament of cardiac muscle are logical targets for such therapeutic compounds since they respond to cellular Ca2+levels but are not involved in modulation of Ca2+transients. Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) 1The abbreviations used are: cTnC, cardiac troponin C; cTnC(A-Cys), recombinant cTnC(des M1, D2A, C35S, C84S); cTnC(C35S), recombinant cTnC(des M1, D2A, C35S); sTnC, skeletal troponin C; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; TFP, trifluoperazine; TEMPO-TFP, N-(3-(4-Amino- TEMPO)propyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine. is the EF-hand Ca2+ binding receptor on the thin filament of slow skeletal and cardiac striated muscle. Cardiac muscle contraction is initiated when Ca2+ binds to the N-terminal regulatory metal binding site II in cTnC. Muscle relaxation occurs upon release of Ca2+ from this regulatory site. This central role for cTnC makes it an attractive target for putative Ca2+-sensitizing compounds designed to modify the Ca2+ dependence of cardiac muscle contraction. Indeed, precedents have been established for both desensitization and sensitization of cardiac muscle to Ca2+via mechanisms that involve cTnC. Phosphorylation of Ser-22 and -23 cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which is constitutively associated with cTnC in the troponin complex, leads to a decrease in the Ca2+sensitivity of cardiac muscle fibers and myofibrils (2Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and to a decrease in the affinity of site II in cTnC (3Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J.

In contrast, a variety of small hydrophobic compounds including the calmodulin antagonists bepridil (4Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 403: 407-424Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have the opposite effect of increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac muscle preparations. Bepridil has been shown to increase the affinity of cTnC for Ca2+ by decreasing the Ca2+ off-rate (5MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Such reports have led to a search for new generations of Ca2+-sensitizing compounds with greater specificity for cTnC (1Endoh M. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the structure of cTnC and identification of potential drug binding sites on this protein would help facilitate the design or selection of Ca2+-sensitizing compounds with desired pharmacological effects. Until recently, high resolution structural information was only available for the fast skeletal isoform of TnC (sTnC) (10Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 11Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Structural models for Ca2+-bound cTnC have been proposed based on the structures of sTnC and calmodulin. Not surprisingly, these models predict an open N-terminal regulatory domain of Ca2+-bound cTnC, with an exposed hydrophobic surface similar to the structure of sTnC and calmodulin. Existing models for drug binding to cTnC propose that these compounds bind to this exposed N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (5MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ovaska M. Taskinen J. Proteins. 1991; 11: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Pollesello P. Ovaska M.

Recently, the NMR solution structures of Ca2+-bound intact cTnC (14Sia S. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and the apo and Ca2+-saturated N-terminal regulatory fragment (15Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S. Gagne S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were reported. The most striking feature of these structures is that the Ca2+-bound N-terminal regulatory domain is partially closed, resulting in significantly less exposed hydrophobic surface than found in Ca2+-bound sTnC. These structures have significant implications with respect to drug binding sites in cTnC. The goal of the current study was to generate structural information on the binding of bepridil and TFP to full-length cTnC and to correlate these data with the solution structure of this critical Ca2+-regulatory protein. We chose both drugs based on their known Ca2+-sensitizing affects on cTnC. The data presented here, coupled with our previous study using covalent blocking groups (16Lin X. Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), support a model in which bepridil and TFP bind to multiple sites on cTnC, including two hydrophobic surfaces in the N-terminal domain. The Ca2+-sensitizing binding site is predicted to be a hydrophobic patch that includes Met-45 in helix B of site I and Met-60 and -80 in helices B and C of the regulatory site II. This subregion in cTnC makes a likely target against which to design new and selective Ca2+-sensitizing compounds. Bepridil, and 4-amino-TEMPO were purchased from Sigma. TFP, 2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,3-dibromopropane were obtained from Aldrich.l-Methionine-methyl-13C,l-phenylalanine (D8), Tris-d11, deuterium oxide, dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, and methanol-d were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Labs.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its labeling with [methyl-13C]Met (18Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the purification of recombinant cTnC proteins (19Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were reported previously. To eliminate the possibility of NOEs being detected between the Phe residues and [methyl-13C]Met residues in the drug-protein complexes, the protein was labeled with l-Phe (D8). The NMR samples varied in protein concentration from 0.2 to 3.5 mm in 20 mmTris-d11, 200 mm KCl, and D2O at pH 7.0. All spectra were collected at 40 °C using Bruker AMX500 or GN500 NMR spectrometers. HSQC (20Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar) spectra were collected with 1024 complex data points in the t2 domain and 72 increments in t1 at 40 °C. The 1H and13C spectra widths were 6012 and 600 Hz, respectively.1H and 13C chemical shifts were reported relative to the HDO signal at 4.563 ppm and the [methyl-13C]Met signal at 14.86 ppm, respectively. All spectra were processed using the FELIX software package (Biosyms Technologies, Inc.). The1H-13C correlations for [methyl-13C]cTnC(A-Cys) were assigned by comparison to known assignments for cTnC (C35S) (18Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NOEs between bepridil and cTnC(A-Cys) were obtained from a 2D NOESY experiment using 13C(ω1,ω2)-double-half-filter (21Otting G. Wuthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 586-594Google Scholar, 22Otting G. Wuthrich K. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 39-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A mixing time of 310 ms was used for the complex. The 1H spectra widths were 6012 and 5000 Hz, respectively. N-(3-(4-Amino-TEMPO)propyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine was synthesized by a two-step procedure. 2-(Trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine (2.67 g, 10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) was added to a suspension of NaH (0.48 g, 20 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran. The stirred suspension was heated to 50 °C for 1 h then cooled to room temperature. 1,3-Dibromopropane (1.22 ml, 12.0 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) was then added over 10 min. The resulting slurry was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The residue was subjected to flash silica gel chromatography (2% ether/hexanes to 50% ether/hexanes). After collection of the high Rf N-allyl compound (1.0 g, 39%), the desiredN-(3-bromopropyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine (0.14 g, 3.6%) was obtained as a viscous oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ 2.25–2.31 (m), 3.52 (t, J = 9.0), 4.11 (t, J = 6.5), 6.90–7.25 (m). The primary bromide was combined with 4-amino-TEMPO (25 mg, 0.15 mmol) and NaHCO3 (32 mg, 0.30 mmol) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (2 ml). The mixture was established under nitrogen and heated at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was partitioned between water and diethyl ether. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4and concentrated in vacuo. The desired product was isolated from the residue by flash silica gel chromatography (5% methanol/chloroform) to provide 35 mg (45%) of a red/brown oil. The fast atom bombardment mass spectrum for this compound of 479.4 (MH+) was consistent with that calculated for the desired product (C25H31F3N3OS, M = 478.6). This product was taken on without further characterization to the hydrobromide salt (HBr in acetic acid) which was obtained as a solid from diethyl ether. An ESR spectrum was collected for the final bromide salt of N-(3-(4-amino-TEMPO) propyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenothiazine. Stock solutions of each drug were prepared initially before use. Bepridil was prepared in a 80% D2O, 20% methanol-d4 solution and a stock solution of TFP was prepared in D20. TEMPO-TFP was prepared in methanol-d4. The stock solutions of TFP that are light sensitive were stored in the dark. For each drug titration, the sample pH was adjusted when necessary. To reduce the nitroxide radical on the spin-label, TEMPO-TFP, a 2-fold molar excess of ascorbic acid was added to the NMR sample. In previous studies, we assigned the 10 methionyl methyl 1H-13C correlations (18Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in recombinant cTnC and used them as general markers to monitor Ca2+ and cTnI binding to cTnC (23Howarth J. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Kleerekoper Q. Howarth J.W. Guo X. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution structure of cTnC allows these assignments to be used as positional markers for drug binding. Fig. 1 shows the location methionyl methyl carbons in a ribbon rendering of intact cTnC (Fig. 1 A), and solvent accessible surfaces in the N-terminal (Fig. 1, B and C) and C-terminal (Fig.1 D) domains. Hydrophobic residues are shown in blue, all other residues are in white, and the methionyl methyl groups are shown in red. Fig. 1 Eshows the structures of the compounds used in this study. Both bepridil and TFP have a positively charged nitrogen at pH 7.0. The spin-labeled phenothiazine, which we will call TEMPO-TFP, was designed to mimic the primary structural features of TFP including the intact phenothiazine rings and a positively charged amine. Synthesis of this compound is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initial experiments involved titration of [methyl-13C]Met-labeled cTnC with bepridil or TFP to assign chemical shifts in the presence of the drugs, and to identify similarities or differences in patterns of chemical shift changes. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed using recombinant cTnC(A-Cys) (17Putkey J.A. Dotson D.G. Mouawad P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein has both Cys-35 and -84 converted to Ser to prevent formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bonds during NMR analysis that can affect the hydrophobic surfaces and functional characteristics of cTnC. cTnC(A-Cys) is active and was used in determining the solution structure of Ca2+-bound full-length cTnC (14Sia S. Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Liu W. Putkey J.A. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18216-18221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The methionyl methyl 1H-13C correlations observed for free cTnC(A-Cys) in the presence Ca2+ were essentially identical to those previously reported for cTnC(C35S) (18Lin X. Krudy G.A. Howarth J. Brito R.M.M. Rosevear P.R. Putkey J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14434-14442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The HSQC spectra in Fig. 2, panel A, shows the effect of bepridil on the methionyl methyl1H-13C correlations in cTnC(A-Cys) in the absence of Ca2+. The addition of drug in molar excess over protein resulted in small chemical shift changes for all the Met residues. The apparent binding constant for association of bepridil with 3Ca2+-cTnC is approximately 10–20 μm(4Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 502-507PubMed Google Scholar, 5MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not attribute the small chemical shift changes seen in Fig. 2 to high affinity binding of bepridil to specific sites since 1) equilibrium dialysis at lower drug and protein concentrations (200 μm of cTnC(A-Cys)) showed no evidence of bepridil binding in the absence of Ca2+. Equilibrium dialysis in the presence of Ca2+ yielded an apparent binding constant of 20 μm (data not shown); 2) we were unable to detect NOEs between the N-terminal Met methyl groups of cTnC(A-Cys) and protons on the aromatic rings of bepridil in the absence of Ca2+ (see below); and 3) the magnitude of drug-induced chemical shift changes seen in the absence of Ca2+ were minor relative to those observed in the presence of Ca2+ (see below). These data suggest the minor chemical shift changes and line broadening seen for the Mets in the absence of Ca2+ are due to nonspecific weak binding of the drug at mm concentrations used in the NMR experiments. Fig. 2, panel B, shows that addition of bepridil to the 2Ca2+ form of cTnC(A-Cys), in which the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites III and IV are filled, induced large chemical shift changes for Met-120 and -157. Minor changes in the chemical shifts for N-terminal Met residues are of a magnitude seen in the absence of Ca2+. This suggests that binding of the drug is restricted to the C-terminal domain when Ca2+ is bound only to sites III and IV. Fig. 3 and Table I show chemical shift changes as the Ca2+-bound cTnC(A-Cys) is titrated with bepridil (Fig. 3, panels A and B) or TFP (panels C and D). Each panel shows the superimposition of spectra obtained at different ratios of drug:protein. The 1H-13C correlations attributed to Met groups located in the N-terminal domain (panels A and C) are shown separately from those in the C-terminal domain (panels B and D). The initial peaks in the absence of drugs are shown in green, whereas red indicates peaks at high concentration of drug. The arrows point in the direction of chemical shift change as the drug was added. The blue peaks correspond to intermediate drug:protein ratios and are shown only for Met-45 and -157, which experience the greatest drug-induced change.Table IDrug-induced changes in chemical shifts of methyl 1H and13C resonances in Ca2+-saturated cTnC(A-Cys)Chemical shifts (1H/13C ppm)Met-45Met-47Met-60Met-80Met-81Met-85Met-103Met-120Met-137Met-157Bepridil:cTnC ratio 01.83 /16.12.21 /15.41.95 /15.31.84 /15.81.38 /15.32.10 /15.11.91 /14.91.88 /15.71.92 /15.61.82 /14.3 0.51.72 /16.02.14 /15.41.97 /15.41.85 /15.71.42 /15.32.10 /15.11.91 /15.01.82 /15.61.92 /15.51.76 /14.4 1.01.59 /15.82.09 /15.31.98 /15.41.85 /15.71.45 /15.32.09 /15.11.90 /15.11.75 /15.41.92 /15.51.71 /14.5 1.51.45 /15.62.04 /15.31.99 /15.51.84 /15.61.45 /15.32.08 /15.21.88 /15.21.70 /15.31.92 /15.51.66 /14.6 2.01.35 /15.52.02 /15.31.99 /15.51.83 /15.51.45 /15.32.07 /15.21.86 /15.31.87 /15.21.92 /15.41.63 /14.7 2.51.26 /15.42.00 /15.21.99 /15.61.80 /15.41.44 /15.22.05 /15.21.83 /15.41.65 /15.11.92 /15.41.61 /14.8 3.01.19 /15.31.99 /15.21.98 /15.61.77 /15.31.41 /15.22.03 /15.21.78 /15.41.63 /15.11.92 /15.41.59 /15.0 3.51.15 /15.31.98 /15.21.97 /15.61.74 /15.31.40 /15.22.02 /15.21.76 /15.51.63 /15.11.92 /15.41.58 /15.0 4.01.13 /15.21.98 /15.21.96 /15.61.73 /15.31.40 /15.22.01 /15.21.75 /15.51.63 /15.11.92 /15.31.57 /15.0TFP:cTnC ratio 01.82 /16.22.22 /15.41.94 /15.31.84 /15.81.38 /15.32.11 /15.11.92 /14.91.89 /15.71.92 /15.61.82 /14.3 1.01.73 /16.02.14 /15.41.94 /15.41.80 /15.81.39 /15.52.09 /15.11.93 /15.11.63 /15.11.92 /15.41.63 /14.4 2.01.57 /15.62.0 /15.31.92 /15.51.76 /15.71.34 /15.52.06 /15.11.91 /15.21.56 /14.91.92 /15.31.49 /14.5 3.01.46 /15.42.03 /15.21.89 /15.51.71 /15.71.27 /15.42.03 /15.21.88 /15.31.54 /14.81.92 /15.31.40 /14.7 4.01.39 /15.32.00 /15.21.85 /15.51.68 /15.71.25 /15.42.01 /15.21.86 /15.41.53 /14.81.92 /15.21.38 /14.7 6.01.32 /15.21.97 /15.11.80 /15.51.66 /15.71.27 /15.51.98 /15.11.82 /15.31.52 /14.81.92 /15.21.40 /14.7 Open table in a new tab The data show that 1H chemical shift changes are observed for all groups except Met-137, which suggests binding sites in both the N- and C-terminal domains. The drug binding sites for both bepridil and TFP exhibit fast exchange characteristics relative to the chemical shift time scale as evidenced by single cross peaks in the HSQC spectra at a given drug:protein ratio, and the fact that these changes are seen for all affected Mets at drug to protein ratios below 1:1. Met-45 shows the greatest drug-induced change at increasing bepridil or TFP concentrations. The resonance for Met-45 broadens significantly at intermediate levels of drug, requiring a greater than 10-fold lower contour level to observe this peak, but then sharpens somewhat at saturating drug levels. This is indicative of intermediate exchange taking place for the methyl group of Met-45 between the free and drug-bound states of cTnC(A-Cys), possibly due to a localized slow conformational transition. Fig. 4 plots 1H chemical shift changes as a function of added bepridil for Met-45, -47, -120, and -157, which experience the greatest overall change. Drug-induced changes reach 90–100% of maximal at a drug to protein ratio of 3:1. Table I shows that 1H chemical shifts for the other Met residues reach a plateau at a bepridil:protein ratio of 3.5:1, and there is no significant difference in the 13C chemical shifts at bepridil:protein ratios of greater than 3:1. This suggests that 3–4 mol of bepridil bind per mol of protein. Additional drug molecules may bind but without altering the Met methyl groups. Binding of TFP to cTnC appears more complex. Although the major changes are seen upon the addition of 3 equivalents of TFP, additional but smaller changes in the 1H chemical shifts are induced upon the addition of 4 and 6 equivalents of TFP. Nevertheless, it is clear that both bepridil and TFP induce similar patterns in chemical shift changes and that the majority of these changes are achieved at a drug to protein ratio of 3. A number of the Mets reside in close proximity to the Phe residues in the protein and could be affected by local ring current fields. Thus, the chemical shifts changes seen in Fig. 3 and Table I could be attributed to either direct ring current effects from TFP and bepridil or from a secondary effect resulting from drug-induced protein conformational changes that alter the positions of the Met methyl groups relative to Phe side chains. The latter mechanism would be more likely for Met residues such as Met-81 and -157, which are within ∼3.4 Å of the Phe ring, rather than Met-45 and -60 which are no closer than ∼6.5 Å from the nearest Phe ring. To distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the drugs, we chose two lines of experiments. The first involved the use of a spin-labeled phenothiazine (TEMPO-TFP in Fig. 1 E), the second uses 13C-filtered NOESY NMR experiment to identify NOEs between drug and cTnC. The paramagnetic effect of spin labels on chemical shift line widths is a low resolution technique that can measure distances from between 10 and 15 Å (26Kosen P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 86-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We have used spin labels successfully in measuring solvent exposure of Met methyl groups as well as determining central helix flexibility in cTnC when free or bound to cTnI (23Howarth J. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Kleerekoper Q. Howarth J.W. Guo X. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13343-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). If the Met methyl groups participate in the formation of the drug binding sites, then TEMPO-TFP will result in line broadening of the 1H-13C correlations for those Mets. Thus, TEMPO-TFP is used here simply to identify which Met side chains are in the drug binding sites. The HSQC spectra in Fig. 5, panel A, compares the Met methyl chemical shifts of Ca2+-bound cTnC in the presence and absence of reduced diamagnetic TEMPO-TFP at a probe-to-protein ratio of 0.8. The reduced compound should not affect the chemical shift line width but should alter chemical shift positions if it binds in a manner similar to TFP. Indeed, TEMPO-TFP-induced chemical shift changes comparable in magnitude and nature to those induced by TFP at a similar probe to protein ratio. Fig. 5, panel B, shows the paramagnetic effect of oxidized TEMPO-TFP on Met methyl groups. All1H-13C correlations are broadened beyond detection at this contour level except that for Met-137. These data demonstrate that: 1) the paramagnetic effect of TEMPO-TFP is due to specific binding since a nonspecific effect of the soluble compound would likely result in broadening of all resonances including Met-137; 2) Met-137, which is on the opposite side of the C-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal hydrophobic surface, is not included in a drug binding site; and 3) all Met methyl groups except Met-137 are within about 10 Å from a bound drug. TEMPO-TFP will prove very useful for subsequent studies of drug binding sites on cTnC when associated with the cTnI or the intact troponin complex. Bepridil was chosen for additional experiments designed to identify NOEs between drug and Met residues in 3Ca2+-cTnC. cTnC(A-Cys) was labeled with both [methyl-13C]Met andl-Phe[D8] to eliminate intraprotein NOEs between the Met methyl groups and Phe side chains. Isotope editing allowed the select observation of NOEs between the Met methyl protons attached to 13C and aromatic protons on bepridil. Control 1D spectra confirmed the efficiency of labeling withl-Phe[D8] (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows the spectra from the13C-edited 2D NOESY experiment at drug:protein ratios of 1.5:1 (panels A, B, and C) and 3.5:1 (panels D, E, and F). Panels A and D show the 1H dimension of the 2D1H-13C HSQC, whereas panels B and E show the 1H-13C HSQC that were used to assign and determine the intensity of each resonance at the given drug concentration. NOEs between the aromatic protons in bepridil and protons attached to [methyl-13C]Met are shown in panels C and F. At the lower drug to protein ratio, strong NOEs are observed between the 3,5 aromatic protons on the drug and the methionyl protons of Met-60 and -80. Weaker NOEs are detected between the drug and the other Met residues. Due to resonance overlap with Met-81, the NOE to Met-45 cannot be observed, however at a drug:protein ratio below 1 a NOE to Met-45 was detected. At high drug:protein ratios, NOEs between bepridil and Met-60 and -80 persist, and NOEs between bepridil and other Met residues are strengthened in intensity. The NOE at 1.89 ppm in panel Ccannot be clearly assigned to Met-103 or -137 due to resonance overlap. However, we have tentatively assigned this NOE to Met-103 since: 1)panel F shows no apparent NOE to Met-137; 2) TEMPO-TFP has no effect on the chemical shift of Met-137; and 3) neither TFP nor bepridil have a significant effect on the 1H chemical shift of Met-137 (Table I). These filtered NOEs show that all methyl groups except 137 are likely within 5 Å of aromatic rings in bound bepridil molecules and that the hydrophobic surface that includes Met-60 and -80 appears to constitute a preferred binding site at lower concentrations of drug. The overall goal of the current study was to identify sites on cTnC that can bind cardiotonic compounds and potentially alter the Ca2+ binding affinity of site II. We chose bepridil and TFP as test compounds since previous reports show that they bind to sTnC (4Solaro R.J. Bousquet P. Johnson J.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

It was reasoned that identification of binding sites for these compounds and the unique opportunity to correlate structural drug binding data with the recent high resolution solution structure of cTnC (14Sia S.

In a previous study, MacLachlan et al. (5MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported binding of one bepridil molecule to the N-terminal domain of cTnC. The drug was proposed to make contact with Met-81, and a model for drug binding was presented based on tentative chemical shift assignments and a structure for Ca2+-bound cTnC that was based on the open conformation of sTnC. In contrast to MacLachlan's study, our data differ markedly in both the number and location of bepridil binding sites. Differences in the number of drug binding sites can be attributed to the experimental conditions used in each study. At pH 7.0 used here, bepridil is fairly soluble, whereas at a higher pH used in the previous study, bepridil precipitates at drug:protein ratio of greater than 1:1. Differences in locations of bound bepridil can be attributed to incorrect chemical shift assignments in the previous study. Met-81 was assigned a chemical shift of 2.15 ppm, whereas its correct assignment is 1.38 ppm. Confidence in the location of the drug binding sites reported here is based on the unambiguous assignments of methionyl Met chemical shifts, and the use of heteronuclear NMR to clearly monitor chemical shift changes and for the collection NOE distance constraints. Bepridil and TFP bind to cTnC only in the presence of Ca2+with rapid exchange of drug between multiple binding sites in the N- and C-terminal domains. The stoichiometry of binding either drug was roughly the same, and the observed patterns of Met methyl chemical shift changes were remarkably similar for both drugs. This suggests that bepridil and TFP bind similar sites on cTnC. The C-terminal drug binding sites appear to be restricted to the hydrophobic inside surface of a shallow cup formed by the C-domain upon Ca2+ binding to sites III and IV (see Fig. 1 D). This surface includes side chains for Met-103, -120, and -157, but not -137. This conclusion is based on: 1) the large chemical shift changes seen for the methyl groups of Met-120 and -157; 2) the paramagnetic effect of the oxidized TEMPO-TFP on the methyl 1H-13C correlations for Met-103, -120, and -157, but not -137; and 3) observed NOEs between bepridil and Met-103, -120, and -157. Pan and Johnson (33Pan B.-S. Johnson Jr., R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 817-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) recently showed that binding of EMD 57033 to cTnC, required the high affinity sites III and IV to be occupied with Ca2+. Thus, the hydrophobic surface in the C-terminal domain of free cTnC appears to present binding sites for calmodulin antagonists TFP and bepridil as well as EMD 57033. A pertinent question is whether binding of these compounds to the C-terminal domain can affect the characteristics of Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal domain. Intradomain communication in cTnC has been reported previously (34Grabarek Z. Leavis P.C. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 608-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the Ca2+ binding affinity of site II in cTnC is increased by inactivation of sites III and IV (35Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of sites III and IV in C-terminal fragments of both cTnC (35Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24067-24073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sTnC (36Li M.X. Chandra M. Pearlstone J.R. Racher K.I. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Borgford T. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) are increased relative to the intact protein. However, these observations should be interpreted cautiously with respect to an interdomain effect of drugs in the troponin complex. The cTnI inhibitory peptide was shown to shield Met-120 and -157 from solvent (23Howarth J. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and association of cTnC with cTnI causes significant change in the Met chemical shifts of Met-120 and -157 (24Kleerekoper Q. Howarth J.W. Guo X. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13343-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that association of cTnI may displace compounds bound to the C-terminal domain of cTnC. Drug binding to the N-terminal domain must be considered with respect to the pattern of N-terminal hydrophobic surfaces, distances between Met methyl groups and NOEs between protons in bepridil and the methionyl methyl groups. Fig. 1 shows the N-terminal domain of cTnC to contain discrete hydrophobic surfaces. One surface includes the side chains of Met-47, -81, and -85 (Fig. 1 B), whereas the other includes Met-45, -60, and -80 (Fig. 1 C). The methyl groups of Met-47 and -60 are 16.7 Å apart and on different surfaces of the N-terminal domain. Thus, it seems unlikely that they could participate in the same drug binding site. Even if bepridil were to induce a separation of helices A and B, to more fully open the N-terminal domain and generate a contiguous hydrophobic surface, the methyl groups of Met-47 and -60 would be separated by about 17 Å. Given these structural constraints and the fact that at least 3 mol of drug bind per mol of protein, it is more likely that the N-terminal domain has multiple drug binding sites. Modeling of bepridil binding to the hydrophobic surface seen in Fig. 1 B shows that NOEs could be generated between one aromatic ring in bepridil and Met-47 and between the other aromatic ring and Met-81 and -85. In addition, stabilizing electrostatic interactions could form between bepridil and Glu-19. The other binding site would include the hydrophobic patch seen in Fig.1 C. The methyl group of Met-60 is 5.5 and 7.5 Å from those of Met-45 and -80, respectively, and the methyl groups of Met-45 and -80 are separated by only a 3.5 Å distance. Thus a single drug molecule bound to this site could generate NOEs with the methyl groups of all three Mets. In a previous study we tested the functional consequence of covalently coupling a 9 amino acid peptide to single Cys residues in cTnC (16Lin X. Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These experiments were designed to mimic the steric blocking effects of noncovalently bound drugs. Our general conclusion was that the N-terminal regulatory domain had discrete hydrophobic surfaces with different functions. One surface, which includes Met-81, is important for activity since blocking groups attached to Cys at position 81 greatly inhibited the activity of cTnC. This surface appears to interact with cTnI since position 81 can be readily cross-linked to cTnI (16Lin X. Dotson D.G. Putkey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 244-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and since the methyl 1H-13C correlation of Met-81 is significantly affected by association of cTnC with cTnI or cTnI peptides (25Krudy G.A. Kleerekoper Q. Guo X. Howarth J. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23731-23735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant functional effect was seen when blocking groups were attached to Cys at position 45, and the methyl 1H-13C correlation of Met-45 is not affected by cTnI. Together these data suggest that drugs that are noncovalently bound to the region of Met-81 would either be displaced by cTnI or that the nature of binding would be altered such that cTnC activity is not inhibited. Drug binding to a region that includes Met-45 as well as Met-60 and -80 could persist in the presence of cTnI and not inhibit activity. Drug binding to this site may sensitize cTnC to Ca2+ since Met-60 and -80 are in the helices C and D of the regulatory Ca2+ binding site II. This provides potential structural basis for the bepridil-induced decrease in Ca2+ off rate at site II (5MacLachlan L.K. Reid D.G. Mitchell R.C. Salter C.J. Smith S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2076903491,"We report the identification and cloning of a nuclear matrix protein termed matrin cyclophilin or matrin CYP. The derived sequence of matrin cyp encodes a protein of 752 amino acids with a predicted mass of 88 kDa. A 172-residue stretch at the amino terminus shows high identity with the ubiquitous family of cyclophilins. Clustered throughout the carboxyl half of the protein are a series of serine-arginine (SR) repeats that are a characteristic feature of many RNA splicing factors. Antibodies raised against matrin CYP recognize a 106-kDa antigen that is detected in isolated nuclei and quantitatively subfractionates in the nuclear matrix. Laser scanning confocal microscopy localizes most of the anti-matrin CYP-specific antigen within the nucleus in a pattern of large bright speckles that co-localize with splicing factors and diffuse nucleoplasmic staining. A strikingly similar pattern of staining is observed in cells extracted for in situ nuclear matrices. A fusion protein containing the cyclophilin domain of matrin CYP exhibits cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity that is characteristic of native cyclophilins. Although total rat liver nuclei contains predominantly CsA-resistant PPIase activity, the corresponding activity in the nuclear matrix is largely CsA-sensitive."

Within the mammalian hematopoietic organ, expression of the Id3 gene is restricted to the lymphoid cell compartment. We show here that in non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells, repression of transcription is correlated with hypermethylation of sequences in the vicinity of the upstream regulatory region of the Id3 gene, suggestive of a strict developmental control of expression of this gene in lymphoid versus non-lymphoid hematopoietic cells. Enforced ectopic expression of Id3 in K562 erythroid progenitor cells promotes erythroid differentiation and is correlated with a quantitative/qualitative shift in the profile of interacting TAL1 and E protein heterodimers that bind to a consensus E box sequence in in vitro band shift assays, consistent with selective targeting of E2A E protein(s) by Id3 and suggesting a possible mechanism involving TAL1-mediated differentiation. By using a Gal 4-VP16 two-hybrid competition assay and an E box-dependent reporter assay, we demonstrate directly that the E2A protein E47 preferentially associates with Id3 in vivo.

The bHLH subgroup itself is comprised of the ubiquitously expressed (class A) E proteins encoded by the E2A, E2-2, and HEB genes, together with a larger number of more diverse (class B) cell-type specific bHLH proteins (1Kadesch T.

In common with most other transcription factor families, bHLH proteins bind their target DNA recognition sequence (referred to as the E-box consensus sequence, CANNTG) in a dimer configuration, either as an E protein homo/heterodimer or, more commonly, as a heterodimer comprising one of several cell-type specific bHLH proteins together with an E protein family member (1Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 2Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile, Transcription Factors 2-Helix-loop-Helix. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding which is essential for the transcriptional activation (or repression) functions of bHLH proteins is facilitated by a short region of highly basic amino acids located immediately N-terminal to the H-1 amphipathic alpha helix (reviewed in Refs. 2Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile, Transcription Factors 2-Helix-loop-Helix. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar and 10Phillips S.E.V. Structure. 1994; 2: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A widely held view, yet to be rigorously verified, is that different combinatorial associations between bHLH dimer partners imparts diversity in functional modulation of distinct E-box transcriptional regulatory activities (1Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). This in turn is dependent on the relative abundance/activities of the cell's compliment of such bHLH proteins, and provides an elegant mechanism (at least in principle) for fine tune control of gene expression during cell lineage commitment and determination. An important mechanism through which the activities of bHLH proteins themselves are regulated is through heterodimerization with members of the Id class of HLH protein (1Kadesch T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 2Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile, Transcription Factors 2-Helix-loop-Helix. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar, 11Benezra R.

In addition, Id proteins inhibit bHLH functions at a further level since Id-bHLH heterodimerization results in destabilization of the target bHLH protein partner (24Deed R.W. Armitage S. Norton J.D.

As functional antagonists of bHLH transcription factors, Id proteins act at a general level as positive regulators of cell growth and negative regulators of cell differentiation (11Benezra R.

In several studies where the functional properties of different Id proteins have been evaluated either biochemically or biologically, they display a high level of similarity, implying at least some degree of functional redundancy as would be expected for a multigene family of this type (16Hara E.

Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a number of cell types express multiple Id genes both in vitro and in vivo (Refs. 16Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2139-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Atherton G.T. Travers H. Deed R.W. Norton J.D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar, and 32Nagata Y.

However, in other instances, expression of individual Id genes appears to be highly cell-type/lineage restricted. One example of this is provided by the hematopoietic system. The Id1 gene is widely expressed in both lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages (20Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 35Ishiguro A. Spirin K. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Norton J.D. Rigolet M. Shimbo T. Koeffler H.P.

Blood. 1996; 87: 5225-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and its enforced ectopic expression has been shown to arrest differentiation in monocyte-macrophage (28Kreider B.L. Benezra R. Rovera G. Kadesch T. Science. 1992; 255: 1700-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), erythroid (29Shoji W. Yamamoto T. Obinata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5078-5084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lister J. Forrester W.C. Baron M.H. J. Biol.

In the latter case, inhibition of B lymphopoiesis can be accounted for solely on the basis of Id1 interaction with E2A-encoded E protein (s) since functional ablation of this bHLH E protein gene by gene targeting in vivo results in an identical phenotype to that observed in Id1 transgenic mice (27Sun X.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 893-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Dorschkind K. Cell. 1994; 79: 751-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Id2 gene is similarly highly promiscuous in its hematopoietic expression pattern (20Sun X.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5603-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 35Ishiguro A. Spirin K. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Norton J.D. Rigolet M. Shimbo T. Koeffler H.P.

Blood. 1996; 87: 5225-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but Id3 appears to be expressed exclusively within the lymphoid compartment of hematopoietic cells (21Meyer K.P. Skogberg M. Margenfield C. Ireland J. Pettersson S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1770-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,35Ishiguro A. Spirin K. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Norton J.D. Rigolet M. Shimbo T. Koeffler H.P.

Norton J.D. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1353-1360PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit E box reporter gene activity at least in studies in other model cell types (14Deed R.W. Bianchi S.M. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Santibanez-Koref M. Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Onogene. 1993; 8: 599-607PubMed Google Scholar, 19Atherton G.T. Travers H. Deed R.W. Norton J.D.

In evaluating the functional significance of the restricted expression pattern of Id3 in hematopoiesis we report here that repression of transcription of the Id3 gene in myeloid cells is correlated with hypermethylation of the 5′ region of the gene, implying a strict developmental control of Id3 expression in lymphoid versusnon-lymphoid hematopoietic cells. Enforced ectopic expression of Id3 in K562 erythroid progenitor cells promotes erythroid differentiation and is correlated with a quantitative/qualitative shift in the profile of interacting TAL1 and E protein heterodimers that bind to a consensus E box sequence in in vitro band shift assays, consistent with selective targeting of the E2A E protein(s) by Id3 and suggesting a possible mechanism involving TAL1-mediated differentiation. By using a Gal4-VP16 competitive two-hybrid assay to compare Id3 and Id1, we demonstrate directly that the E2A protein, E47 preferentially associates with Id3 in vivo. These observations provide a paradigm for understanding how overlapping but distinct specificities of individual Id proteins may constitute a developmentally regulated program underlying cell determination in diverse lineages. All cell lines were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Retroviral transduction of K562 cells was carried out essentially as described previously (38Baker B.W. Boettiger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The vector pBabepuro Id3, (19Atherton G.T. Travers H. Deed R.W. Norton J.D.

Following selection with puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) for 10 days, individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution and subjected to further characterization. Differentiation of K562 cells was induced by treatment of cells for 4–5 days with cytosine arabinoside (2 × 10−8m) and monitored by staining for hemoglobin-positive cells essentially as described previously (40Kaiho S-I. Mizuno K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines by SDS lysis, proteinase K digestion, and phenol extraction as described previously (14Deed R.W. Bianchi S.M. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Santibanez-Koref M. Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Onogene. 1993; 8: 599-607PubMed Google Scholar). 5–10-μg samples of total DNA were digested to completion by using a 5-fold excess of MspI or HpaII using conditions recommended by the suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim). Digested DNA was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by capillary blotting. A 375-base pair Id3 fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1–375 (12Deed R.W. Hirose T. Mitchell E.L.D. Santibanez-Koref M.F. Norton J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primed reaction as described above. Hybridization, post-hybridization washing, and autoradiography was carried out as described by Murphy and Norton (15Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from cell lines using the RNAZol extraction technique (CinnaBiotech). RNA concentration was estimated by absorption at 260 nm. Samples of 10 μg of total cellular RNA were analyzed on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gels and stained with ethidium bromide to monitor the equivalence of loading by fluorescence intensity of rRNA bands. After blotting onto “GeneScreen Plus” nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), prehybridization and hybridization was carried out as described by Murphy and Norton (15Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm using a random primed labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim), with [α-32P]dATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, United Kingdom). Blots were washed at 65 °C for successive 30-min periods first in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Analysis of proteins by Western blotting was performed essentially as described by Harlow and Lane (41Harlow A.E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached by gentle scraping and were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. The resultant cell pellet was re-suspended in SDS sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Cellular proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking for 1 h at room temperature in 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% Tween 20 (containing 5% dried milk) and then incubating with either control sera or with anti-Id3 antibody RD1 (diluted 1–100 in the above buffer) for a further hour at room temperature, the membrane was washed extensively in the same buffer and bound antibody detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat, anti-rabbit (Dako, diluted 1–4,000) in conjunction with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). A rabbit polyclonal Id3 antiserum (RD1) was raised by a standard immunization regime using a synthetic C-terminal 15-amino acid Id3 peptide as immunogen. Immunopurified antibody cross-reacted with mouse and human Id3 proteins but did not detect Id2 or Id1 proteins in control experiments. A PCR product was generated using the primers, 5′-ATGGATCCATGAATGGCGCTGAGCCCGGTG-3′ and 5′-AGGTGTCAGGACACGGCCGAGTCA-3′ corresponding the nucleotides 368–388 and 727–748 in the human Id3 cDNA template (14Deed R.W. Bianchi S.M. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Santibanez-Koref M. Murphy J.J. Norton J.D. Onogene. 1993; 8: 599-607PubMed Google Scholar), which resulted in the addition of a BamHI site at the 5′ end of the Id3 coding sequence. PCR amplification was performed on plasmid DNA template (1 ng). Reaction conditions were 94 °C (1 min), 54 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1.5 min) for 30 cycles. PCR reactions comprised 100 μm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and TTP together with primers (1 μm), Taq polymerase (1 unit, Promega, Madison, WI) in reaction buffer (100 μl). PCR products were subcloned into the PCR II vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently as aBamHI-EcoRI fragment into the PGEX2T vector (Pharmacia), sequenced and expressed in the Escherichia colistrain INV αF′. Bacterial protein purification was carried out essentially as described by Kaelin et al. (42Kaelin W.G. Palass D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingstone D.M.

Equimolar concentrations of translated protein were generated usingl-[35S]methionine and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were preincubated with 1.0 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm, MgCl2, 150 mm, KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol supplemented with 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, at 20 °C for 10 min and protein interactions were assessed by the addition of each reticulocyte lysate mixture (10-μl aliquots) containing in vitro translated protein. This was incubated with constant mixing at 20 °C for 1 h and then washed 3 times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Radiolabeled proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were reconstituted with sample buffer (25 μl), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed.

Competition reactions with either wild type or mutant probe (above) established the specificity of the reaction. DNA mobility shift assays were carried out essentially as described by Murre et al.

Oligonucleotides were self-annealed, 5′ end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) with T4 polynucleotide kinase and were subsequently purified on an acrylamide gel. Equimolar equivalents of Id3, Id1, and E47s proteins were estimated by [35S]methionine incorporation and normalized with respect to methionine content of the translated protein.

https://openalex.org/W1996226077,"We have recently cloned the murine glucagon receptor (GR) gene and shown that it is expressed mainly in liver. In this organ, the glucagon-GR system is involved in the control of glucose metabolism as it initiates a cascade of events leading to release of glucose into the blood stream, which is a main feature in several physiological and pathological conditions. To better define the metabolic regulators of GR expression in liver we analyzed GR mRNA concentration in physiological conditions associating various glucose metabolic pathways in vivo and in vitro in the rat and in the mouse. First, we report that the concentration of the GR mRNA progressively increased from the first day of life to the adult stage. This effect was abolished when newborn rodents were fasted. Second, under conditions where intrahepatic glucose metabolism was active such as during fasting, diabetes, and hyperglycemic clamp, the concentration of GR mRNA increased independent of the origin of the pathway that generated the glucose flux. These effects were blunted when hyperglycemia was corrected by phlorizin treatment of diabetic rats or not sustained during euglycemic clamp.In accordance with these observations, we demonstrated that the glycolytic substrates glucose, mannose, and fructose, as well as the gluconeognic substrates glycerol and dihydroxyacetone, increased the concentration of GR mRNA in primary cultures of hepatocytes from fed rats. Glucagon blunted the effect of glucose without being dominant. The stimulatory effect of those substrates was not mimicked by the nonmetabolizable carbohydrate l-glucose or the glucokinase inhibitor glucosamine or when hepatocytes were isolated from starved rats. In addition, inhibitors of gluconeogenesis and lipolysis could decrease the concentration of GR mRNA from hepatocytes of starved rats. Combined, these data strongly suggest that glucose flux in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways at the level of triose intermediates could control expression of GR mRNA and participate in controlling its own metabolism.

Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Hepatic glucose production represents a major process in several physiological and pathological conditions. In newborns, glucagon is secreted within an hour of parturition and initiates several processes leading to hepatic glucose production (16Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B. Kervran A. Rieutort M. Assan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Then, during suckling glucagon stimulation ensures hepatic synthesis of glucose, which is otherwise poorly provided by mother's milk (18Girard J. Biol. Neonate. 1990; 1: 3-15Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, during starvation in adults glucose produced by the liver is the main energy source utilized by splanchnic tissues and brain (19Heath D.F. Frayn K.N. Rose J.G. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In pathological situations such as diabetes, elevated hepatic glucose production is one of the key features responsible for hyperglycemia (20Unger R.H. Orci L. Compr. Ther. 1982; 8: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar). The GR is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells where its stimulation potentiates insulin secretion (21Kofod H. Unson C.G. Merrifield R.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 32: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the GR plays a major role in regulation of glucose homeostasis. To more accurately understand its role(s) in regulation of glucose metabolism, we measured modulation of GR mRNA concentration in liver. We analyzed variations in hepatic GR mRNA concentration in mouse under physiological conditions and in rat under experimental conditions and primary cultures of hepatocytes to further define the in vivo conclusions. Mice (CBA) bred in our laboratory were housed at 24 °C with light from 0700 to 1900 h and free access to water and chow (72% carbohydrate, 1% fat, 27% protein; in percent of energy). To follow GR mRNA concentration during development 16-, 17-, 18-, and 19-day-old fetuses and 1-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 28-day-old mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the livers were removed and frozen (n = 2–6/group). To study the influence of nutritional variations on GR mRNA concentration in liver, mice (n = 18) were weaned either with a high fat diet (n = 6) (18% carbohydrate, 58% fat, 24% protein; in percent of energy) or a high carbohydrate diet (n = 6) (63% carbohydrate, 11% fat, 26% protein; in percent of energy) (22Decaux J.F. Ferre P. Girard J. Biol. Neonate. 1986; 50: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or a regular chow pellets (n = 6) for 2 weeks. At completion of the assay periods, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and livers were removed and frozen. In addition, mice (n = 6) were sacrificed during the dark period of their daily light cycle to ensure a fed state, and they are referred to as controls. Mice were sacrificed following a 2-day fast (n = 6) or fasted for 2 days and refed for 1 day (n = 5) and sacrificed in the postprandial state. One-day-old Wistar rats were fasted for 16 h (n = 9), and livers from these and 1-day suckling rats were removed and frozen. Diabetes was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg of body weight of streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 m ice-cold sodium citrate (23Burcelin R. Printz R.L. Kande J. Assan R. Granner D.K. Girard J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E392-E401PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boileau P. Mrejen C. Girard J. Hauguel-de Mouzon S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To avoid the lethaliy of hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia characteristic of long term insulin-dependent diabetes, female Wistar rats were mated at 9 weeks of age prior to injection of STZ. Indeed, development of insulin resistance during pregnancy may protect the mother from the deleterious effect of a lack of insulin (25Ramos P. Herrera E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E858-E863PubMed Google Scholar, 26Boden G. Obstet. Gynecol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 23: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated ketones are redistributed to the fetus to be used as fuel, which may be less deleterious to the mother (27Tanigawa K. Ohguni S. Masaki Y. Tsuchiyama S. Kawaguchi M. Kato Y. Endocrinol. Jpn. 1989; 36: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,28Shambaugh G.E. d. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 2347-2351PubMed Google Scholar). The mating day was considered as day 1 of gestation and STZ injection. On day 3 post-STZ injection, blood was sampled from the tail vein, and diabetes was diagnosed when plasma glucose levels were higher than 16 mm. Diabetic rats (n = 9) were randomly chosen to receive a continuous subcutaneous infusion of phlorizin, an inhibitor of renal tubular glucose reabsorption (STZ, Sigma). Phlorizin, dissolved in a 40% (w/v) propylene glycol solution, was delivered at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg/day, via implantable osmotic pumps (Alzet, Charles River St. Aubin les Ebeuf, France), from the 14th day to the 19th day post-STZ, then livers were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Indwelling catheters were inserted into the left jugular vein and right carotid artery under light ether anesthesia so six 1-day pregnant female Wistar rats could recover rapidly from surgery and be studied conscious. Clamps were performed on day 19 of pregnancy for 12 h as described previously (29Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pegorier J.P. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Blood samples were withdrawn from the carotid artery and glucose concentration checked with a glucose reflectance meter (One Touch II, Lifescan, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Milpitas, USA). Upon completion, rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, livers immediately removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All rats were sacrificed in the postprandial state and referred to as controls. Hepatocytes were isolated from Wistar rats weighing 200 g at 0900 h, i.e. postabsorptive period or after a 24-h food removal, as described previously (29Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pegorier J.P. Loizeau M. Girard J. Leturque A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cell viability, estimated by trypan blue exclusion, was greater than 90%. Hepatocytes were isolated from fed rats and suspended in Medium 199 containing Earle's salt, 2.2 mg/liter NaHCO3 (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France) with penicillin (10 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and supplemented with 2% Ultroser (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France). Hepatocytes were plated 8 × 106 cells/100-mm2 dish. After cell attachment (4 h), the medium was replaced by fresh Medium 199 containing hormones and nutrients as described in the figure legends. The inhibitors of gluconeogenesis mercaptopicolinate (MPA, dissolved in 150 mm HEPES and used at 1 mm) and lipolysis tetradecylglycidate (dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and used at 40 μm) were added as indicated. Total RNAs were isolated using a guanidine thiocyanate method and stored at −80 °C until use (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNAs (20 μg) were denatured, size-fractionated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon. The GLUT2 cDNA probe (31Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. B. Thorens. Probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Multiprime labeling system (Amersham, Bucks, UK). Hybridizations were performed in solutions containing 42% deionized formamide, 7.5% dextran sulfate, 8× Denhardt's solution, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS at 42 °C overnight. Membranes were washed twice (30 min) with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, at 42 °C and twice (30 min) with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C and exposed for 4–72 h at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Membranes were exposed to and quantitated by a PhosphorImager or by densitometric analysis. To verify the integrity and equal loading of RNA, Northern blots were stained with methylene blue or hybridized with an oligonucleotide probe representing the sequence 1047–1070 of rat 18 S ribosomal RNA (32Chan Y.L. Gutell R. Noller H.F. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with [32P]ATP. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis were performed by Student's t test for unpaired data. Statistical significance was reached for p < 0.05. Traces of GR mRNA could be detected as early as 16 days of fetal life (Fig.1 A). The concentration of a 1.9-kilobase pair GR mRNA increased from the first day of postnatal life to adulthood (Fig. 1 B). Some variability in the concentration of GR mRNA is observed at birth. When the mice were either weaned onto a high fat or high carbohydrate diet the concentration of GR mRNA was 210 and 250%, respectively, of mice weaned onto normal lab chow (Fig. 1 C). In addition, a 450% increase in GR mRNA was observed following a 2-day fast compared with fed controls and 1 day of refeeding partly reversed this overexpression (Fig. 1 D). Results from the above studies on mouse liver demonstrated that expression of the GR in liver was mainly initiated at the newborn stage and was under the control of various nutritional stimuli. To accurately dissect apart the respective role of these factors, in vivo experiments were performed on rat liver. First, 1-day-old newborn rats were fasted for 16 h. This treatment induced a dramatic decrease in GR mRNA concentration when compared with suckling rats (Fig. 2 A). To analyze the effect of glycemic variations on liver GR mRNA concentration, STZ was injected to female rats to achieve hyperglycemia and induce hypoinsulinemia. Nineteen days after STZ injection plasma glucose level rose from 5.0 ± 0.1 mm to 27.0 ± 1.2 mm and insulin level dropped from 224 ± 18 pm to 42 ± 66 pm. Diabetes increased the concentration of GR mRNA by 250% in rat liver (Fig.2 B). When hyperglycemia was reduced from 27 to 12 mm by phlorizin treatment GR mRNA concentration decreased to reach a level similar to the control nondiabetic rats (Fig. 2 B). The effect of hyperinsulinemia (4.5 nm) in the presence or absence of hyperglycemia (26 mm) was tested at the end of 12 h of hyperinsulinemic euglycemic or hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemic clamp conditions. Hyperglycemia was necessary to maintain elevated GR mRNA concentration in rat liver after 12 h of hyperinsulinemia (Fig. 2 C). To further dissect apart the effect of carbohydrate metabolism on the concentration of GR mRNA, primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were prepared. In hepatocytes cultured for 24 h the concentration of GR mRNA rose proportionally to increasing concentrations of glucose in the medium (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained when hepatocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of 10% fetal bovine serum (data not shown). Fructose and mannose induced the same stimulatory effect on GR mRNA concentration when present at 5 mm but not 25 mm (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, the concentration of GLUT2 mRNA further increased under these conditions, suggesting that these two genes are differentially regulated (Fig. 3 B). Incubation of hepatocytes with glucosamine, which inhibits glucokinase activity, was associated with a decrease in GR and GLUT2 mRNA concentrations. But, increasing the intracellular concentration of carbohydrate 6-phosphate by adding 2-deoxyglucose to the medium did not further increase the concentration of GR or GLUT2 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). Similarly,l-glucose which is not metabolized did not influence the concentrations of GR or GLUT2 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). The presence of 25 mm glucose progressively increased the concentration of GR mRNA within 24 h (Fig.4). Such an increase was not observed when hepatocytes were cultured in the absence of glucose (Fig. 4). The effect of insulin was assessed after 24 h of culture in the presence of several glucose concentrations and no changes were observed (Fig. 5).Figure 5Dose response of GR and GLUT2 mRNAs to glucose in the presence of insulin in rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from fed rats were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 10−7 insulin and increasing concentrations of glucose. 18 S rRNA is shown to correct for loading differences between lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When hepatocytes were isolated from fed rats and cultured in the absence of glucose but in the presence of the gluconeogenic substrates alanine dihydroxyacetone or glycerol, the concentration of GR mRNA increased (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in hepatocytes isolated from starved rats suggesting that the basal concentration of the GR mRNA, being already elevated due to the fasting state, could not be further increased under such conditions. Conversely, the concentration of GR mRNA was decreased when a gluconeogenic inhibitor MPA was added to the hepatocytes isolated from starved rats (Fig.6 B). The same results were obtained in the presence of tetradecylglycidate, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, which reduces the oxidation of long chain acyl-CoA (Fig.6 B). In addition, when glucagon was added to hepatocytes isolated from fed rats it blunted the stimulatory effect of glucose without being dominant (Fig. 6 C). The stimulatory effect of glucose was further analyzed in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit the translation process. In the presence of 20 mm glucose, when cycloheximide was added to the medium the concentration of GR mRNA further increased and a secondary signal of approximately 2.2 kilobase pairs was detected suggestive of alternative splicing of nontranslated exons (Fig.7). We report an analysis of the regulation of GR mRNA concentration in vivo in liver and in vitro in primary cultures of hepatocytes under various metabolic conditions which more accurately define the regulation of the glucagon-GR system. GR mRNA was detected in liver from the first day of postnatal life and its concentration reached a maximum at the adult stage (Fig. 1). The perinatal period is associated with dramatic changes in hormonal and metabolic factors (16Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B. Kervran A. Rieutort M. Assan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the newborn, after a brief period of starvation, a drop in circulating glucose and insulin levels and an abrupt secretion of glucagon occur (16Girard J.R. Cuendet G.S. Marliss E.B. Kervran A. Rieutort M. Assan R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Then the newborn pup feeds on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet of mother's milk. These hormones stimulate the synthesis and release of glucose by liver, initially from the breakdown of glycogen stores and then from neosynthesis of glucose using glycerol and amino acids as a carbon source provided by mother's milk (17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In addition, to meet energy needs of the newborn, the capacity for fatty acid oxidation develops rapidly after birth by many tissues including liver where it results in a high rate of ketone body production (17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Liver GR mRNA increased markedly in 16 h milk fed newborns, whereas the increase was prevented when pups were fasted from birth (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, after a 16-h fasting period the concentration of GR mRNA dramatically decreased (Fig.3 A). In this condition glycogen stores were depleted and plasma free fatty acids and the rate of lipid oxidation were very low (17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The carbon substrates, in the form of low circulating concentrations of glycerol and amino acids necessary to fuel the gluconeogenesis pathway, were no longer supplied by mother's milk (17Girard J. Ferre P. Pegorier J.P. Duee P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). As a main consequence blood glucose levels remained low. This important finding suggests that impairment of the increase in GR mRNA concentration could be due to low circulating blood glucose and free fatty acid concentrations. Stimulation of glucose and free fatty acid metabolism in liver could trigger and progressively increase the concentration of GR mRNA. This switch is important as it could mediate the characteristic gluconeogenic effect of glucagon during the suckling period by initiating GR mRNA expression at birth. Conversely, in adult mice, the fasting state induced an opposite effect by increasing GR mRNA concentration in liver (Fig. 1 D). Under these conditions lactate and gluconeogenic amino acid substrates are adequately available. As a consequence, gluconeogenesis is very active and GR mRNA concentration is elevated compared with mice studied in the post-prandial state despite low blood glucose concentrations (33Randle P.J. Kerbey A.L. Espinal J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This suggests that flux of glucose and its metabolism in liver, rather than the glucose level per se, could regulate expression of the GR gene. Similarly, increasing liver gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism using a high fat, low carbohydrate diet further increased the concentration of GR mRNA (Fig.1 C). The same observation was made in STZ-treated diabetic rats (Fig. 2 B), a situation where gluconeogenesis and lipolysis are indeed dramatically stimulated (34Rossetti L. Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, partial correction of hyperglycemia with the glucosuric agent phlorizin restored to normal the concentration of GR mRNA (Fig.2 B). In the condition of long term phlorizin infusion, the concentration of circulating glucagon decreased and GLUT2, glucokinase, glucose 6-phosphatase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA levels were partially or fully normalized as a consequence of gluconeogenesis (35Brichard S.M. Henquin J.C. Girard J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 36Burcelin R. Eddouks M. Kande J. Assan R. Girard J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Massillon D. Barzilai N. Chen W. Hu M. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9871-9874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly liver function, as measured by glucose production, was corrected (38Rossetti L. Smith D. Shulman G.I. Papachristou D. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). These in vivoresults suggest that an intermediary metabolite or a factor involved in the gluconeogenic/glycolytic pathways could mediate the increase in GR mRNA concentration in liver. It has recently been demonstrated that elevated plasma free fatty acid levels could stimulate expression of genes such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (39Chatelain F. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine if this increase was indeed linked to the gluconeogenic pathway, rats were studied under conditions where gluconeogenesis was totally inhibited such as during insulin infusion (40Myers S.R. Diamond M.P. Adkins-Marshall B.A. Williams P.E. Stinsen R. Cherrington A.D. Metabolism. 1991; 40: 66-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 41Cherrington A.D. Pagliassotti M.J. Myers S.R. Adkins-Marshall B. McGuinness O.P. J. Parenter. Enteral. Nutr. 1991; 15: 71S-73SCrossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 42Adkins-Marshall B.A. Myers S.R. Hendrick G.K. Williams P.E. Triebwasser K. Floyd B. Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 87-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 12 h of hyperinsulinemia hepatic glucose production was totally inhibited and the concentration of GR mRNA remained normal or slightly lower than in control post-prandial rats. Simultaneous infusion of glucose to induce hyperglycemia and stimulation of glucose metabolism in liver was necessary to maintain a high concentration of GR mRNA (Fig. 2 C). Most of the data reported here show that GR mRNAs increase in vivo under gluconeogenic conditions (i.e. suckling newborns, fasting, diabetes). The above results further emphasize that glucose, beside its role as a nutrient, could regulate, through some intermediates of its metabolism, GR gene expression (43Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 44Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This observation is reinforced by our in vitro results and data from others (45Abrahamsen N. Lundgren K. Nishimura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15853-15857Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which showed that glucose increased GR mRNA concentration in primary cultures of hepatocytes (Fig. 3). Glucose in liver is mainly metabolized by the rate-limiting enzyme glucokinase (46Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mannose and fructose, which do not need glucokinase to be metabolized, increased glucose 6-phosphate concentration (Fig.8) (47Van Schaftingen E. Davies D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Van Schaftingen E. Vandercammen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and gave similar results with lower concentration of the carbohydrate (Fig. 3 A). It is noteworthy that these carbohydrates at high concentration decreased GR mRNA concentration. This could be associated with a depletion of ATP content (49Younus M.J. Jouhal K. Butterworth P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and an inhibition of glucokinase activity (47Van Schaftingen E. Davies D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,50Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 51Davies D.R. Detheux M. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 52Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This effect was not observed for GLUT2 expression, stressing the differential regulation of the two genes (Fig. 3 A). The increase in GR mRNA concentration could not be mimicked by the nonmetabolizable sugar l-glucose or by glucosamine which inhibits glucokinase (Figs. 3, A and B). The effect of glucose was not observed when hepatocytes were isolated from 48-h fasted rats, i.e. when glucokinase activity was very low (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of glucose could also be observed over time as the concentration of GR mRNA increased when hepatocytes were cultured for 24 h in the presence of a high glucose concentration (Fig. 4). No effect was observed in the absence of glucose or when insulin was combined with glucose (Fig. 5). These results could suggest that glucokinase activity and the accumulation of its product glucose 6-phosphate contributed to the increase in concentration of GR mRNA. However, addition of 2-deoxyglucose to the medium that mainly accumulated as 2-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate did not increase the concentration of GR mRNA in primary cultures of hepatocytes. A metabolite further down the glycolytic pathway from glucose 6-phosphate and common to the gluconeogenic pathway could be responsible (Fig. 8). Indeed, when gluconeogenic substrates dihydroxyacetone or glycerol were added to primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from fed rats the concentration of GR mRNA increased (Fig. 6 A). In hepatocytes isolated from fed rats, dihydroxyacetone and glycerol are minimally converted into glucose but mainly converted into lactate and pyruvate (Fig. 8) (53Pilkis S.J. Riou J.P. Claus T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7841-7852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same results were obtained with alanine, which further reinforces the hypothesis that a metabolite distal to glucose 6-phosphate and the flux of carbohydrate intermediates, possibly a triose, could regulate the concentration of GR mRNA. Indeed, when gluconeogenesis was inhibited at the level of PEPCK by MPA the concentration of GR mRNA was reduced (Fig. 6 B) (54Agius L. Tosh D. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, tetradecylglycidate, which inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 activity and oxidation of long chain fatty acyl-CoA, reduced the concentration of GR mRNA (Fig. 6 B). This is consistent with metabolic scenarios in which lipolysis is enhanced (i.e. diabetes, fasting, and birth). The ratios of NADH/NAD+ and ATP/ADP are increased in livers of diabetic and fasted animals due to increased lipolysis generating elevated amounts of citrate, acetyl-CoA and ketones (55Sochor M. Ball M.R. Baquer N.Z. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 15-23PubMed Google Scholar, 56Ferraz M. Brunaldi K Oliveira C.E. Bazotte R.B. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1997; 95: 147-155PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lepine A.J. Watford M. Boyd R.D. Whitehead D.M. Br. J. Nutr. 1993; 70: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the redox state could control expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism (58Lane R.H. Flozak A.S. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and therefore it is possible that nicotinamide nucleotides and products of lipolysis could be involved in regulation of GR mRNA concentration. Ourin vivo and in vitro results suggest that lipolysis, in addition to glucose metabolism, could be involved in regulation of GR mRNA. Current experiments are ongoing to further dissect apart the regulatory role of fatty acid metabolism. This effect of glucose on gene expression has been proposed for several hepatic genes such as L-pyruvate kinase, S14, fatty acid synthase, GLUT2 (29Postic C. Burcelin R. Rencurel F. Pegorier J.P.

We report here that in the absence of glucokinase activity such as during STZ-diabetes or fasting state (36Burcelin R. Eddouks M. Kande J. Assan R. Girard J. Biochem.

In conclusion, analysis of the regulation of GR mRNA concentrationin vivo and in vitro strongly suggest that variations in glucose flux in liver, rather than a specific metabolic pathway, controls expression of the GR gene. Our results provide references for future determination of the metabolites and secondary messengers common between the gluconeogenic and glycolytic pathways that are involved in these regulations.

Infection of microglial cells and astrocytes in the brain promotes the release of HIV-1 Tat and other candidate neurotoxins that may be associated with the widespread neuropathology. To examine the contribution of HIV-1 Tat to the interplay between virus and CNS cells, the human astrocytic cell line, U-87MG, was treated with recombinant Tat protein. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that Tat induces a G1 arrest in these cells. Consistent with this observation, lower levels of cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity and phosphorylated Rb were detected in the Tat-treated cells compared with the control cells. Interestingly, our observations indicate that the underphosphorylated form of Rb that is prevalent in Tat-treated cells promotes HIV-1 transcription by a mechanism involving the NF-κB enhancer region. Taken together, the data presented here provide the first evidence that the HIV-1 regulatory protein, Tat, may manipulate the host cell cycle to promote viral gene expression. The significance of these findings relates to the current hypothesis that indirect effects of HIV-1 infection of the CNS may contribute to the neurological complications associated with AIDS dementia complex.

The magnitude of the clinical dysfunction and CNS pathology associated with HIV-1 infection is difficult to reconcile with the small number of HIV-1-infected macrophages and microglia in the brain (4Merrill J.E.

This apparent paradox has led to the hypothesis that indirect effects of HIV-1 infection including the release of neurotoxic viral proteins and cytokines may mediate some of the pathobiological alterations observed in CNS cells. Tat, a viral regulatory protein, may be produced by HIV-1-infected macrophages and resident microglia, as well as infected astrocytes in the brain (7Budka H.

Astrocytes secrete many supporting growth factors and are involved in neurotransmitter uptake and in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Thus, biological agents that alter the proliferation and activation state of these cells may lead to a broad spectrum of abnormalities and dysfunction (26Oldstone M.B.A. Sinha Y.N. Blount P. Tishon A. Rodriguez M. von Wedel R. Lampert P.W. Science. 1982; 218: 1125-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Earlier observations showed that overexpression of Tat in astrocytic cells and treatment of cells with extracellular Tat can stimulate expression of several important cellular genes, including cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins (27Cupp C.

These observations led us to the hypothesis that Tat may alter the activation and proliferation state of astrocytes and contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS-associated dementia.The reciprocal nature of the interaction between virus and host is expected, since HIV-1 is susceptible to regulation by cellular factors and therefore by the state of the host cell. There is evidence to suggest that cellular factors, including B-myb, E2F-1, and p53, which are involved in the control of cellular proliferation, may play a role in modulation of HIV-1 gene expression (31Duan L. Ozaki I. Oakes J.W. Taylor J.P. Khalili K. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4302-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kundu M. Srinivasan A. Pomerantz R.J. Khalili K. J.

Normal cellular proliferation occurs through an orderly progression of positive and negative regulatory events and is orchestrated by the activity of complexes consisting of cyclins and their associated catalytic partners, the cyclin-dependent kinases (34Hunt T. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 2: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 36Pines J. Trends Biochem.

During the G0/G1 phase, the decision of cells to commit to the cell cycle is partly dependent on the appropriate activation of G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes by extracellular stimuli. One of the most well characterized targets of these G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes is the retinoblastoma protein, Rb (38Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 39Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A.

Early in the G1 phase, Rb exists primarily in an underphosphorylated state, at which time it interacts with the transcription factor, E2F-1, and inhibits its growth-promoting function (41Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 42Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylation of Rb in late G1 by the G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes results in the release of free E2F-1, which activates transcription of several genes involved in S phase (45Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).In this study, we sought to further examine the interplay between virus and host cell cycle progression. We demonstrate that the viral transactivator protein, Tat, is able to arrest human astrocytic cells, U-87MG, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by dysregulating the expression and activity of cyclin E and Cdk2. This results in accumulation of Rb in its underphosphorylated form, which in turn augments transcription directed by the HIV-1 LTR. We propose that in addition to its ability to directly transactivate the HIV-1 LTR, Tat alters the proliferation state of astrocytes and facilitates expression and replication of the HIV-1 genome.DISCUSSIONAIDS dementia complex is one of the most prevalent neurological complications of HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system. ADC affects almost 10% of AIDS patients (73Bacellar H. Munoz A. Miller E.N. Cohen B.A. Besley D. Selnes O.A. Becker J.T. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1994; 44: 1892-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Productive infection in the CNS occurs primarily in macrophages and resident microglia (74Lipton S.A. Gendelman H.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 75Simpson D.M. Tagliati M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121 (Correction (1995) Ann. Intern. Med. 122, 317): 769-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence of a “restricted” infection in astrocytes (76Blumberg B.M. Gelbard H.A. Epstein L.G. Virus Res. 1994; 32: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The term “restricted” is used to describe the restriction of viral gene expression to the regulatory proteins, Tat, Rev, and Nef, which are derived from the multiply spliced viral mRNA species commonly found in infected astrocytes (62Tornatore C. Meyers K. Atwood W. Conant K. Major E.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 93-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To account for the discrepancy between the small infected cell population and the widespread pathology, the current models regarding the neuropathogenesis of ADC propose a major role for indirect effects of HIV-1 infection (77Dewhurst S. Gelbard H.A. Fine S.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 16-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this respect, the infection of astrocytes may play a central role in the pathogenesis of ADC. Infected astrocytes and microglial cells can release the viral protein Tat. Tat can be taken up by neighboring cells in a biologically active form that can stimulate the expression of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β and several extracellular matrix proteins in the CNS (25Zauli G.

Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S. Haughey N. Geiger J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 80Strijbos P.J. Zamani M.R. Rothwell N.J. Arbuthnott G. Harkiss G.

Res. 1995; 42: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When injected into the brains of mice, Tat can stimulate edema and gliosis (82Philippon V. Vellutini C. Gambarelli D. Harkiss G. Arbuthnott G. Metzger D. Roubin R. Filippi P. Virology. 1994; 205: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first evidence that Tat inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells, which are similar in many respects to activated astrocytes. By altering the cellular pathways involved in regulating astrocyte proliferation, Tat has the potential to disrupt the supportive function of astrocytes and contribute to the neuronal loss associated with ADC.Cellular proliferation is regulated by a series of positive and negative phosphorylation events, many of which involve cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. The progression of cells from G1 to S phase relies primarily on the cyclin D-Cdk4, cyclin D-Cdk6, and cyclin E-Cdk2 complex subunits (34Hunt T. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1991; 2: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1071-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 36Pines J. Trends Biochem.

In this study, we demonstrate that Tat may block cells in the G1 phase by inhibiting the kinase activity of Cdk2 in astrocytic cells. The dissociation between the cyclin E- and Cdk2-associated kinase activity may also contribute to the disruption in the cell cycle. Other groups have demonstrated that Tat may inhibit the proliferative response of T-lymphocytes to antigenic and mitogenic stimuli (16Chirmule N. Than S. Khan S.A. Pahwa S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 492-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lachgar A. Bernard J. Bizzini B. Astgen A. Le Coq H. Fouchard M. Chams V. Feldman M. Burny A. Zagury J.F. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1996; 50: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 20Patki A.H. Lederman M.M. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 169: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This negative response is associated with decreased IL-2 production (21Puri R.K. Leland P. Aggarwal B.B. Aids Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IL-2 decreases the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27 that inactivates the kinase activity of the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (83Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Tat targets the same cellular pathway in cells of astrocytic and lymphocytic origin to inhibit cell growth. It should be noted that Tat has been associated with increased cellular proliferation in T cells (78Zauli G. La Placa M. Vignoli M. Re M.C. Gibellini D. Furlini G. Milani D. Marchisio M. Mazzoni M. Capitani S. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndrome Hum. Retrovirol. 1995; 10: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for this discrepancy have not been elucidated, it is possible that it may depend on the culture conditions and amount of Tat used in the assays.The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product is one of the targets of the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex (39Hatakeyama M. Brill J.A. Fink G.R. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The decrease in phosphorylated Rb detected in Tat-treated glioblastoma cells is therefore likely to be associated with the diminished cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity in these cells. The decreased phosphorylation of Rb in Tat-treated cells has implications for HIV-1 gene expression, since the underphosphorylated form of Rb stimulates HIV-1 transcription. When Rb exists in this form, it can interact with E2F-1 and prevent it from modulating transcription (41Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 42Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 43Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 44Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Earlier studies demonstrated that the cell cycle regulatory protein, E2F-1, represses the activity of the HIV-1 promoter by binding to a site within the HIV-1 enhancer region and interacting with the 50-kDa subunit of NF-κB (p50) (32Kundu M. Srinivasan A. Pomerantz R.J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6940-6946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4Kundu, M., Guermah, M., Roeder, R. G., Amini, S., and Khalili, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 27229468–29474. Since the same region of the promoter is targeted by Rb, it is possible that Rb modulates HIV-1 transcription by binding to E2F-1 and inhibiting its repressive activity. It appears that by arresting cells in the G1 phase, Tat is able to maintain cells in a state that is favorable for HIV-1 transcription (Fig. 6).The observations presented in this study provide the first evidence that HIV-1, akin to the DNA tumor viruses, encodes regulatory proteins that manipulate host cell proliferation to promote viral advantage. Both HIV-1 and the DNA tumor viruses encode proteins that target the activity of the retinoblastoma protein, although to different ends. By preventing Rb phosphorylation, Tat blocks cellular proliferation at the G1 phase. By contrast, E1A, T-antigen, and E7 bind Rb and disrupt its interaction with E2F-1, which promotes entry of cells into the S phase (84Levine A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The phase of the cell cycle favored by HIV-1versus the DNA tumor viruses reflects one of the fundamental differences between these viruses: the nature of the genome. HIV-1 relies on the host cell transcription machinery for replication, because its genome consists of RNA. The genomes of the adenovirus, Simian virus 40, and human papilloma virus consist of DNA, so these viruses rely on the host cell DNA synthesis machinery for replication. Another interesting parallel is that both HIV-1 and adenovirus modulate the function of E2F-1 on their respective promoters to promote viral transcription. E1A promotes the release of E2F-1, which activates transcription of the adenovirus E2 promoter (44Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar, 85Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tat, on the other hand, promotes sequestration of E2F-1, a negative regulator of HIV-1 transcription (32Kundu M. Srinivasan A. Pomerantz R.J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6940-6946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4Kundu, M., Guermah, M., Roeder, R. G., Amini, S., and Khalili, K. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 27229468–29474.Taken together, our data suggest that the complex interplay between virus and host, with respect to host cell cycle and HIV-1 replication, may promote HIV-1 gene expression in astrocytic cells. Furthermore, these interactions, by altering the state of astrocytes and stimulating the production of neurotoxic factors, could contribute to the pathogenesis of ADC.

Neurol. 1991; 29: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the clinical dysfunction and CNS pathology associated with HIV-1 infection is difficult to reconcile with the small number of HIV-1-infected macrophages and microglia in the brain (4Merrill J.E.

This apparent paradox has led to the hypothesis that indirect effects of HIV-1 infection including the release of neurotoxic viral proteins and cytokines may mediate some of the pathobiological alterations observed in CNS cells. Tat, a viral regulatory protein, may be produced by HIV-1-infected macrophages and resident microglia, as well as infected astrocytes in the brain (7Budka H.

https://openalex.org/W2074313791,"By using cells overexpressing diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor and a novel method of permeabilizing the plasma membrane with a bacterial pore-forming toxin, specific translocation of fragment A to the cytosol was observed, whereas full-size DT and other minor species of DT-derived fragments were left in intracellular vesicles. The translocation competence of DT proteins with mutations in the transmembrane domain is consistent with their cytotoxicities. The charge-reversal mutants E349K and D352K do not translocate their fragment A to the cytosol, whereas D352N is partially competent. ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of fragment A is not required for translocation. Novel fragments of DT with apparent molecular masses of 28 and 35 kDa were detected in endocytic vesicles. The 28-kDa fragment consists of fragment A and an N-terminal piece of fragment B, whereas the 35-kDa fragment contains part of fragment B and may be complementary to the 28-kDa fragment. Time course studies show that the 28-kDa fragment appears in endocytic vesicles prior to translocation of fragment A to the cytosol, raising the possibility that the 28-kDa fragment is an intermediate in translocation. We present a model for translocation of fragment A that incorporates the observations made using the novel permeabilization method."

B19 parvovirus is the only member of the Parvoviridae family that is pathogenic for humans (1Berns K.I. Bergoin M. Lederman M. Muzyczka N. Siegl G. Tal J. Tattersall P. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 10: 166-178Google Scholar). It has been associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms and is responsible for erythema infectiosum in children and arthropathy in adults. B19 infections can be particularly severe, leading to hydrops fetalis during pregnancy, transient aplastic crisis in patients with underlying hemolytic diseases, or chronic bone marrow infection in immunocompromised patients (2Brown K.E. Young N.S. Liu J.M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1994; 16: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro, the infection of human bone marrow cells leads to the depletion of the immature erythroid progenitor cells,i.e. burst-forming unit erythroid and cluster-forming unit erythroid (3Mortimer P.P. Humphries R.K. Moore J.G. Purcell R.H. Young N.S. Nature. 1983; 302: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Takahashi T. Ozawa K. Takahashi K. Asano S. Takaku F. Blood. 1990; 75: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter cells, replication occurs and results in cell cytotoxicity (5Ozawa K. Kurtzman G. Young N. Science. 1986; 233: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, despite such remarkable erythroid tropism, which is still unexplained, B19 infection can also impair megakaryocytopoiesis (6Pallier C. Greco A. Le Junter J. Saib A. Vassias I. Morinet F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9482-9489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Srivastava A. Bruno E. Briddell R. Cooper R. Srivastava C. van Besien K. Hoffman R. Blood. 1990; 76: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas virus replication is responsible for the disruption of erythropoiesis, only viral transcription occurs in megakaryocytes. In these cells, the accumulation of the nonstructural protein NS1 seems to be responsible for cell lysis (8Leruez M. Pallier C. Vassias I. Elouet J.F. Romeo P. Morinet F. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).B19 virus, like other parvoviruses, is a nonenveloped icosahedral virus with a single-stranded DNA linear genome composed of 5596 nucleotides that encode one nonstructural protein (NS1), two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2), and several small polypeptides of unknown function (9Luo W. Astell C.R. Virology. 1993; 195: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J.

Both ends of the genome are composed of identical inverted repeat sequences of 383 nucleotides (12Deiss V. Tratschin J.D. Weitz M. Siegl G. Virology. 1990; 175: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The distal 365 nucleotides are imperfect palindromes that can form a hairpin structure. The transcription map of the B19 parvovirus has been determined in infected human bone marrow cells (9Luo W. Astell C.R. Virology. 1993; 195: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its only known promoter, named P6 and located in the 5′-terminal region, directs the synthesis of up to nine viral transcripts (13Blundell M.C. Beard C. Astell C.R. Virology. 1987; 157: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Doerig C. Hirt B. Antonietti J.P. Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mRNAs encoding for the capsid proteins and the small polypeptides are spliced, the NS1 mRNA is not (10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The regulation of the P6 promoter by viral or cellular proteins has not been extensively studied. In erythroid-permissive cells, this regulation might be preponderant. Thus, a recombinant adeno-associated virus, a defective parvovirus in which the P5 promoter has been substituted for the B19 P6 promoter, is able to replicate specifically and autonomously in erythroid cells (15Wang X.S. Yoder M.C. Zhou S.Z. Srivastava A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12416-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, isolated in front of a reporter gene, the P6 promoter exhibits strong activity in many cell lines, as demonstrated after transfection (14Doerig C. Hirt B. Antonietti J.P. Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T.

Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leruez-ville M. Vassias I. Pallier C. Cecille A. Hazan U. Morinet F. J. Gen.

Virol. 1993; 74: 2011-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism of this up-regulation is not yet clear. The result of a recent study argues in favor of an indirect effect involving Sp1 and cAMP-response element binding proteins, as already demonstrated for other parvoviruses. 1Gareus, R., Gigler, A., Hemauer, A., Leruez-Ville, M., Morinet, F., Wolf, H., and Modrow, S. (1998) J. Virol. 72, 609–616. 1Gareus, R., Gigler, A., Hemauer, A., Leruez-Ville, M., Morinet, F., Wolf, H., and Modrow, S. (1998) J. Virol. 72, 609–616. The Sp1 transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of the P6 promoter (22Blundell M.C. Astell C.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4814-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, two GC box motifs located upstream of the TATA box have been implicated in the in vitro up-regulation of promoter transcription. The YY1 transcription factor also binds the P6 promoter to three different motifs (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which results in a positive P6 promoter regulation.In this investigation, we first studied the genetic diversity of the B19 P6 promoter. A highly conserved region was characterized after sequencing 17 B19 strains. Within this region, a large sequence protected by erythroid or nonerythroid nuclear proteins was observed using in vitro footprinting analysis. For the first time, as far as we know, we demonstrated the presence of an Ets binding site (EBS) 2The abbreviations used are: EBS, Ets binding site; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TK, thymidine kinase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nts, nucleotides. 2The abbreviations used are: EBS, Ets binding site; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TK, thymidine kinase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nts, nucleotides. in the conserved protected region using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). By supershift analysis, we characterized the binding of hGABP proteins, an Ets-related transcription factor so far not found to be involved in regulating a parvoviral promoter. In addition to the YY1 transcription factor described above, we demonstrated the fixation of the Sp1 factor to a GC box placed just downstream of the EBS. We then defined a 3-fold sequence composed of the YY1, Ets, and Sp1 binding sites. By transfection analysis of a Drosophila cell line, we studied the effect of the B19 P6 promoter regulation by YY1, hGABP, and Sp1 factors. We showed that Sp1 and hGABP activated transcription synergistically throughout this 3-fold sequence. This synergy was abolished by YY1. Of greater interest was the fact that we observed the same results with the P6 native promoter.DISCUSSIONContrary to other parvoviruses whose genetic expression is controlled by two functional promoters located on the left and the middle of the genome, only one promoter has been described for the human parvovirus B19. We therefore attempted to analyze its variability by PCR amplification and sequencing of the promoter region of 17 B19 virus strains. Our data show an average variation of 1.5%, in agreement with previous results.1 The mutations were clustered around the TATA box, and a highly conserved region was observed in the area proximal of the P6 promoter. This region was located between nucleotides 113 and 210. When it was deleted, there was a 90% loss in transcriptional activity.1 Therefore we decided to examine the cellular factors that interact with this region. By DNA footprinting assays on both strands, a part of the conserved region was seen to be protected by nuclear extracts from the nonerythroid HeLa cell line or the erythroid UT7/Epo cell line. Previous footprinting experiments showed that this region interacts with the proteins of HeLa and CEM cells (16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 185: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Blundell M.C. Astell C.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4814-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we noticed that an 8-nucleotide EBS site CCGGAAGT (−208/−201) is located between the binding sites YY1 (−220/−212) and Sp1 (−200/−195). An EBS was described earlier in the P4 promoter of the minute virus of mice and was also located immediately upstream from the GC box that binds the Sp1 transcription factor (37Fuks F. Deleu L. Dinsart C. Rommelaere J. Faisst S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using EMSA with synthetic oligonucleotidic probes and competition assays with the corresponding probes, we confirmed the binding of YY1 previously observed by Momoedaet al. (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was also detected at this site for Sp1, contrarily to the findings of Liu et al. (16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 185: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results were similar whether the extract used was from HeLa or UT7/Epo cells. Supershift analysis allowed us to establish that the Ets motif at nucleotides −208/−201 in the conserved B19 promoter region is recognized by hGAPBα, a ubiquitously expressed Ets protein. In addition, antibodies confirmed that HeLa and UT7/Epo binding complexes contain proteins that are immunologically related to both hGABPα and hGABPβ. The complexes produced by the hGABP proteins were specific, as evaluated by probe competition. hGABP (also named E4TF1) is indeed composed of three distinct polypeptides: hGABPα (60 kDa), hGABPβ1 (53 kDa), and hGABPβ2 (47 kDa), all of which are required for high affinity DNA binding (α subunit) and transcriptional activation (α and β subunits) (38Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). hGABP binds to a purine-rich cis-regulatory element required for the VP16-mediated activation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene and regulates adenovirus E4 gene transcription (39Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible involvement of hGABP in the regulation of the B19 promoter. hGABP was shown to activate a 3-fold sequence comprising YY1-GABP-Sp1 binding sites with the TK minimal promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells; this activation was also found with the P6 promoter. It is noteworthy that our GABP binding site was immediately adjacent to the SP1 site. Ets-related transcription factors such as hGABP are often found in large complexes with other transcription factors (41Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 activity is known to be modulated by factors that recognize the DNA elements flanking or overlapping a GC box (48Fischer K.D. Haese A. Nowock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23915-23923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In the present work, Sp1 transactivated the 3-fold sequence and the P6 promoter and displayed synergistic activation with hGABP. Similarly, by co-transfection experiments using also Drosophila SL2 cells, the P4 promoter of minute virus of mice was found to be transactivated synergistically by Ets-1, the prototype member of the Ets family of transcription factors, and the Sp1 factor that binds to a GC box flanking the EBS motif (37Fuks F. Deleu L. Dinsart C. Rommelaere J. Faisst S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, the mutations of the GABP and Sp1 sites suggest that the combined synergistic effect of the corresponding transcription factors seems to incriminate DNA binding but also protein interactions. Whatever the precise mechanism under investigation, this cooperation was partially inhibited by YY1 protein. In adeno-associated virus, YY1 was found to act as a repressor of transcription from the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter, which is relieved by EIA proteins (21Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). For B19 parvovirus, the positive effect of YY1 on transcription was described by Momoeda et al. in HeLa cells but was very weak, i.e. 1.3–1.9-fold above basal transcription (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not find that YY1 had any effect on the 3-fold sequence or the P6 promoter in SL2 cells. This difference may be due to the type of cells transfected.The present study demonstrated, for the first time as far as we know, that the specific DNA-binding proteins for the CCGGAAGT motif of the human B19 parvovirus promoter is very likely to be hGABP, as indicated by the following results. (i) The DNA protein complex detected in the gel shift assay was abolished by the competition assay, (ii) antibodies against GABPα and -β subunits supershifted this complex, and (iii) the combination of in vitro translated hGABPα and -β proteins produced a complex with essentially the same mobility as that produced by the HeLa or UT7/Epo cell extract. Lastly, our results clearly demonstrated that in nonerythroid cells, hGABP proteins, ubiquitously expressed Ets protein, stimulate the expression of the human B19 parvovirus promoter. The precise mechanism of the synergy exerted by hGABP and Sp1, which is diminished by YY1, is currently under investigation. B19 parvovirus is the only member of the Parvoviridae family that is pathogenic for humans (1Berns K.I. Bergoin M. Lederman M. Muzyczka N. Siegl G. Tal J. Tattersall P. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 10: 166-178Google Scholar). It has been associated with a wide range of clinical symptoms and is responsible for erythema infectiosum in children and arthropathy in adults. B19 infections can be particularly severe, leading to hydrops fetalis during pregnancy, transient aplastic crisis in patients with underlying hemolytic diseases, or chronic bone marrow infection in immunocompromised patients (2Brown K.E. Young N.S. Liu J.M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1994; 16: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro, the infection of human bone marrow cells leads to the depletion of the immature erythroid progenitor cells,i.e. burst-forming unit erythroid and cluster-forming unit erythroid (3Mortimer P.P. Humphries R.K. Moore J.G. Purcell R.H. Young N.S. Nature. 1983; 302: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Takahashi T. Ozawa K. Takahashi K. Asano S. Takaku F. Blood. 1990; 75: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter cells, replication occurs and results in cell cytotoxicity (5Ozawa K. Kurtzman G. Young N. Science. 1986; 233: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, despite such remarkable erythroid tropism, which is still unexplained, B19 infection can also impair megakaryocytopoiesis (6Pallier C. Greco A. Le Junter J. Saib A. Vassias I. Morinet F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9482-9489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Srivastava A. Bruno E. Briddell R. Cooper R. Srivastava C. van Besien K. Hoffman R. Blood. 1990; 76: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas virus replication is responsible for the disruption of erythropoiesis, only viral transcription occurs in megakaryocytes. In these cells, the accumulation of the nonstructural protein NS1 seems to be responsible for cell lysis (8Leruez M. Pallier C. Vassias I. Elouet J.F. Romeo P. Morinet F. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). B19 virus, like other parvoviruses, is a nonenveloped icosahedral virus with a single-stranded DNA linear genome composed of 5596 nucleotides that encode one nonstructural protein (NS1), two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2), and several small polypeptides of unknown function (9Luo W. Astell C.R. Virology. 1993; 195: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cotmore S.F. McKie V.C. Anderson L.J. Astell C.R. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 548-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both ends of the genome are composed of identical inverted repeat sequences of 383 nucleotides (12Deiss V. Tratschin J.D. Weitz M. Siegl G. Virology. 1990; 175: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The distal 365 nucleotides are imperfect palindromes that can form a hairpin structure. The transcription map of the B19 parvovirus has been determined in infected human bone marrow cells (9Luo W. Astell C.R. Virology. 1993; 195: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its only known promoter, named P6 and located in the 5′-terminal region, directs the synthesis of up to nine viral transcripts (13Blundell M.C. Beard C. Astell C.R. Virology. 1987; 157: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Doerig C. Hirt B. Antonietti J.P. Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mRNAs encoding for the capsid proteins and the small polypeptides are spliced, the NS1 mRNA is not (10Ozawa K. Ayub J. Hao Y.S. Kurtzman G. Shimada T. Young N. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2395-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of the P6 promoter by viral or cellular proteins has not been extensively studied. In erythroid-permissive cells, this regulation might be preponderant. Thus, a recombinant adeno-associated virus, a defective parvovirus in which the P5 promoter has been substituted for the B19 P6 promoter, is able to replicate specifically and autonomously in erythroid cells (15Wang X.S. Yoder M.C. Zhou S.Z. Srivastava A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12416-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, isolated in front of a reporter gene, the P6 promoter exhibits strong activity in many cell lines, as demonstrated after transfection (14Doerig C. Hirt B. Antonietti J.P. Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 185: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 17Liu J.M. Fujii H. Green S.W. Komatsu N. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 182: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like other parvoviruses, the nonstructural protein NS1 can up-regulate the P6 promoter (14Doerig C. Hirt B. Antonietti J.P. Beard P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leruez-ville M. Vassias I. Pallier C. Cecille A. Hazan U. Morinet F. J. Gen.

Virol. 1993; 74: 2011-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism of this up-regulation is not yet clear. The result of a recent study argues in favor of an indirect effect involving Sp1 and cAMP-response element binding proteins, as already demonstrated for other parvoviruses. 1Gareus, R., Gigler, A., Hemauer, A., Leruez-Ville, M., Morinet, F., Wolf, H., and Modrow, S. (1998) J. Virol. 72, 609–616. 1Gareus, R., Gigler, A., Hemauer, A., Leruez-Ville, M., Morinet, F., Wolf, H., and Modrow, S. (1998) J. Virol. 72, 609–616. The Sp1 transcription factor has been implicated in the regulation of the P6 promoter (22Blundell M.C. Astell C.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4814-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, two GC box motifs located upstream of the TATA box have been implicated in the in vitro up-regulation of promoter transcription. The YY1 transcription factor also binds the P6 promoter to three different motifs (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which results in a positive P6 promoter regulation. In this investigation, we first studied the genetic diversity of the B19 P6 promoter. A highly conserved region was characterized after sequencing 17 B19 strains. Within this region, a large sequence protected by erythroid or nonerythroid nuclear proteins was observed using in vitro footprinting analysis. For the first time, as far as we know, we demonstrated the presence of an Ets binding site (EBS) 2The abbreviations used are: EBS, Ets binding site; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TK, thymidine kinase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nts, nucleotides. 2The abbreviations used are: EBS, Ets binding site; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TK, thymidine kinase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nts, nucleotides. in the conserved protected region using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). By supershift analysis, we characterized the binding of hGABP proteins, an Ets-related transcription factor so far not found to be involved in regulating a parvoviral promoter. In addition to the YY1 transcription factor described above, we demonstrated the fixation of the Sp1 factor to a GC box placed just downstream of the EBS. We then defined a 3-fold sequence composed of the YY1, Ets, and Sp1 binding sites. By transfection analysis of a Drosophila cell line, we studied the effect of the B19 P6 promoter regulation by YY1, hGABP, and Sp1 factors. We showed that Sp1 and hGABP activated transcription synergistically throughout this 3-fold sequence. This synergy was abolished by YY1. Of greater interest was the fact that we observed the same results with the P6 native promoter. DISCUSSIONContrary to other parvoviruses whose genetic expression is controlled by two functional promoters located on the left and the middle of the genome, only one promoter has been described for the human parvovirus B19. We therefore attempted to analyze its variability by PCR amplification and sequencing of the promoter region of 17 B19 virus strains. Our data show an average variation of 1.5%, in agreement with previous results.1 The mutations were clustered around the TATA box, and a highly conserved region was observed in the area proximal of the P6 promoter. This region was located between nucleotides 113 and 210. When it was deleted, there was a 90% loss in transcriptional activity.1 Therefore we decided to examine the cellular factors that interact with this region. By DNA footprinting assays on both strands, a part of the conserved region was seen to be protected by nuclear extracts from the nonerythroid HeLa cell line or the erythroid UT7/Epo cell line. Previous footprinting experiments showed that this region interacts with the proteins of HeLa and CEM cells (16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 185: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Blundell M.C. Astell C.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4814-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we noticed that an 8-nucleotide EBS site CCGGAAGT (−208/−201) is located between the binding sites YY1 (−220/−212) and Sp1 (−200/−195). An EBS was described earlier in the P4 promoter of the minute virus of mice and was also located immediately upstream from the GC box that binds the Sp1 transcription factor (37Fuks F. Deleu L. Dinsart C. Rommelaere J. Faisst S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using EMSA with synthetic oligonucleotidic probes and competition assays with the corresponding probes, we confirmed the binding of YY1 previously observed by Momoedaet al. (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was also detected at this site for Sp1, contrarily to the findings of Liu et al. (16Liu J.M. Green S.W. Hao Y.S. McDonagh K.T. Young N.S. Shimada T. Virology. 1991; 185: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results were similar whether the extract used was from HeLa or UT7/Epo cells. Supershift analysis allowed us to establish that the Ets motif at nucleotides −208/−201 in the conserved B19 promoter region is recognized by hGAPBα, a ubiquitously expressed Ets protein. In addition, antibodies confirmed that HeLa and UT7/Epo binding complexes contain proteins that are immunologically related to both hGABPα and hGABPβ. The complexes produced by the hGABP proteins were specific, as evaluated by probe competition. hGABP (also named E4TF1) is indeed composed of three distinct polypeptides: hGABPα (60 kDa), hGABPβ1 (53 kDa), and hGABPβ2 (47 kDa), all of which are required for high affinity DNA binding (α subunit) and transcriptional activation (α and β subunits) (38Sawada J. Goto M. Sawa C. Watanabe H. Handa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). hGABP binds to a purine-rich cis-regulatory element required for the VP16-mediated activation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene and regulates adenovirus E4 gene transcription (39Watanabe H. Sawada J. Yano K. Yamaguchi K. Goto M. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the possible involvement of hGABP in the regulation of the B19 promoter. hGABP was shown to activate a 3-fold sequence comprising YY1-GABP-Sp1 binding sites with the TK minimal promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells; this activation was also found with the P6 promoter. It is noteworthy that our GABP binding site was immediately adjacent to the SP1 site. Ets-related transcription factors such as hGABP are often found in large complexes with other transcription factors (41Wotton D. Ghysdael J. Wang S. Speck N.A. Owen M.J. Mol. Cell.

For example, Ets-1 and Sp1 interact to activate synergistically the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus long terminal repeat (29Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R.A. Ghysdael J.

In the present work, Sp1 transactivated the 3-fold sequence and the P6 promoter and displayed synergistic activation with hGABP. Similarly, by co-transfection experiments using also Drosophila SL2 cells, the P4 promoter of minute virus of mice was found to be transactivated synergistically by Ets-1, the prototype member of the Ets family of transcription factors, and the Sp1 factor that binds to a GC box flanking the EBS motif (37Fuks F. Deleu L. Dinsart C. Rommelaere J. Faisst S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, the mutations of the GABP and Sp1 sites suggest that the combined synergistic effect of the corresponding transcription factors seems to incriminate DNA binding but also protein interactions. Whatever the precise mechanism under investigation, this cooperation was partially inhibited by YY1 protein. In adeno-associated virus, YY1 was found to act as a repressor of transcription from the adeno-associated virus P5 promoter, which is relieved by EIA proteins (21Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). For B19 parvovirus, the positive effect of YY1 on transcription was described by Momoeda et al. in HeLa cells but was very weak, i.e. 1.3–1.9-fold above basal transcription (23Momoeda M. Kawase M. Jane S.M. Miyamura K. Young N.S. Kajigaya S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not find that YY1 had any effect on the 3-fold sequence or the P6 promoter in SL2 cells. This difference may be due to the type of cells transfected. The present study demonstrated, for the first time as far as we know, that the specific DNA-binding proteins for the CCGGAAGT motif of the human B19 parvovirus promoter is very likely to be hGABP, as indicated by the following results. (i) The DNA protein complex detected in the gel shift assay was abolished by the competition assay, (ii) antibodies against GABPα and -β subunits supershifted this complex, and (iii) the combination of in vitro translated hGABPα and -β proteins produced a complex with essentially the same mobility as that produced by the HeLa or UT7/Epo cell extract. Lastly, our results clearly demonstrated that in nonerythroid cells, hGABP proteins, ubiquitously expressed Ets protein, stimulate the expression of the human B19 parvovirus promoter. The precise mechanism of the synergy exerted by hGABP and Sp1, which is diminished by YY1, is currently under investigation. We would like to thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2015165157,"To investigate the B-cell autoimmune epitopes on human thyroid peroxidase (TPO), we generated proteolytic peptides by enzymatic hydrolysis of TPO in nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions. The hydrolysate was chromatographed on a reverse phase column. We eluted a material immunoreactive with both a TPO monoclonal antibody recognizing a linear epitope (mAb47, amino acid 713–721) and TPO autoantibodies (aAb) from patients. The aAb immunoreactivity, but not that of mAb47, was lost after reduction. Western blots after electrophoresis without reduction showed that the aAb and mAb47 were immunoreactive with a 66-kDa band and that aAb identified a doublet at 20 kDa. For electrophoresis under reducing conditions, the 66-kDa band resolved into two peptides of 40 and 26 kDa, whereas the doublet at 20 kDa remained unchanged. None of these reduced peptides was immunoreactive with aAb, whereas the 40-kDa peptide was immunoreactive with mAb47. The 40-kDa peptide extends from amino acid 549 to 933 of TPO, and its last 192 amino acids overlap the autoimmune 20-kDa peptide. After iodine labeling, the 20-kDa peptide lost its immunoreactivity. We conclude that the C-terminal end of the extracellular part of TPO, which includes all the tyrosine residues of the 20-kDa peptide, contains at least one conformational B-cell epitope involved in autoimmune thyroid diseases.

TPO catalyzes the iodination of thyroglobulin and the coupling of some iodotyrosine residues to form thyroid hormone residues. This catalysis is under thyrotropin control through its specific receptor (1Nunez J. De Visscher M. The Thyroid Gland. Raven Press, New York1980: 39-59Google Scholar, 2Taurog A. Ingbar S. Braverman L. Werner's: The Thyroid. Lippincott, Philadelphia1986: 53-97Google Scholar). Like thyroglobulin and the thyrotropin receptor, TPO is one of the main autoantigens (aAg) in autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). However, the immune response to this sequestered aAg is not clear (for review, see Ref. 3Weetman A.P. McGregor A.M. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 788-830PubMed Google Scholar). After TPO was identified as microsomal aAg (4Czarnocka B. Ruf J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 5Portmann L. Hamada N. Heinrich G. De Groot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1985; 61: 1001-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), many studies investigated the human immune response to this enzyme. We showed there were two autoimmune domains on the surface of the molecule (6Ruf, J., Toubert, M. E., Czarnocka, B., Durand-Gorde, J-M., Ferrand, M., and Carayon, P. Endocrinology, 125,1211–1218.Google Scholar); this was confirmed by another group (7Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S. Russo D. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Chazenbalk G.D. Costante G. Portolano S. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1715-1718PubMed Google Scholar). Disappointingly, no difference was observed in autoantibody (aAb) response to TPO for patients with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the two well defined AITD (9Alami-Harchali A. Montagne P. Ruf J. Cuillière M.L. Bene M.C. Faure G. Duheille J. Clin Chem. 1994; 40: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). One of the major tasks in AITD is to identify the immunodominant B-cell epitopes of the main aAg. This may help explain the mechanisms causing immunopathological states and, consequently, may provide targets for diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. TPO is a valuable model for such studies, given the preponderance of its corresponding aAb in AITD. Moreover, TPO is implicated in the physiological function of the thyroid, and aAb binding to TPO might impair thyroid hormone synthesis through cytotoxic processes (10Rodien P. Madec A.M. Ruf J. Rajas F. Bornet H. Carayon P. Orgiazzi J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2595-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), thus leading to hypothyroidism. Some authors (11Kohno Y.

Metab. 1991; 72: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) claimed that TPO aAb inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme at the iodine and the aromatic sites. However, aAb from patients with thyroiditis may block the enzyme function by binding to epitopes different from the enzymatic sites, as speculated for bispecific thyroglobulin and TPO aAb (16Ruf J. Feldt-Rasmussen U. Hegedüs L. Ferrand M. Carayon P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1404-1409PubMed Google Scholar). Many attempted to localize and identify the main TPO B-cell autoepitopes forming the immunodominant regions targeted by the pathologic aAb from patients with AITD. Various linear TPO epitopes were identified through cDNA sublibraries or recombinant bacterial proteins. Others, however, using a eukaryotic expression system to preserve the three-dimensional structure of the protein, claimed that TPO B-cell autoepitopes are conformational (for review, see Refs.17Banga J.P. Barnett P.S. McGregor A.M. Autoimmunity. 1991; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 192-206PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Res. 1994; 3: 96-102Google Scholar). Since molecular biology techniques identify only minimum peptides not truly representative of the conformational B-cell epitopes, we mapped the immunodominant region of TPO by an alternative approach: proteolytic peptides generated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the native immunopurified human TPO. Through pilot experiments, we selected endopeptidase Lys-C, which can cleave at 26 lysine residues along the amino acid sequence of TPO. We found an extracellular conformational B-cell epitope susceptible to reduction and iodination near the membrane anchorage and the spanning region of TPO. We used eight TPO mAb, previously produced and characterized, directed to epitopes from two immunodominant antigenic regions of TPO (6Ruf, J., Toubert, M. E., Czarnocka, B., Durand-Gorde, J-M., Ferrand, M., and Carayon, P. Endocrinology, 125,1211–1218.Google Scholar). The TPO aAb were immunopurified as described (20Ruf J. Ferrand M. Durand-Gorde J-M. Carayon P. Autoimmunity. 1992; 11: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) from sera of 40 adult patients thought to have AITD on the basis of clinical examination and selected for their high titer in TPO aAb as assessed by Dynotest (BRAHMS diagnostica, Berlin, Germany). The TPO mAb and aAb were titered for their TPO reactivity in ELISA and used at saturating dilution in this work. TPO was immunopurified from sodium deoxycholate-solubilized microsomes from Graves' thyroid tissue (4Czarnocka B. Ruf J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Native, purified TPO (at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml) was treated with endoproteinase Lys-C (EC 3.4.21.50 sequencing grade from Lysobacter enzymogenes (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in 50 mmNH4HCO3 with 10% acetonitrile for 18 h at 37 °C. Enzymatic digestion was stopped by freeze-drying the hydrolysate. The lyophilized hydrolysate of TPO was restored with ultrapure water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 20% acetonitrile (starting buffer). For each run, 250 μg of material was loaded onto a C-18 reverse phase 3.9 × 150 mm column (Waters, Millipore, Milford, MA) equilibrated in the starting buffer. Five min after starting, a linear gradient of 20–90% acetonitrile was applied for 60 min at 0.5 ml/min. The column was then reequilibrated with the starting buffer for 30 min. Elution of the peptides was monitored by absorbance reading at 215 nm. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected in silicone-coated glass tubes. The fractions from runs corresponding to the same peak were pooled and freeze-dried. ELISA was used to detect the immunoreactive peptides from HPLC fractions recognized by TPO mAb and aAb. Briefly, wells of Immulon II microtiter plates (Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were filled with 100 μl of HPLC fractions adjusted to 5 μg/ml in PBS, pH 7.3, overnight at 4 °C under humidified atmosphere. The wells were then washed, overcoated with BSA, washed again, and filled with a saturating amount of TPO mAb or aAb in PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA. After 2 h at 37 °C, unbound antibodies were removed by extensive washing. mAb and aAb bindings were detected by an antimouse or antihuman second antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase; p-nitrophenyl phosphate was the substrate. Absorbance was read at 405 nm. HPLC fraction 3+4 and native TPO were also tested in ELISA after chemical treatments. For reduction and alkylation, the antigenic material was coated, the wells were filled with 100 μl of PBS containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, the wells were filled with 100 μl of PBS containing 40 mmiodoacetamide, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and washed again. For iodination, the antigenic material was treated before coating as for the radiolabeling procedure (see below) but with or without nonradioactive iodide. After the various treatments, ELISA was done as above. The peptide content of the HPLC fractions was analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE according to Schäggeret al. (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The lyophilized samples (10 μg/lane) were restored in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 0.02% G-250 Coomasie Brillant Blue, heated for 4 min with 2% β-mercaptoethanol for reducing conditions, and loaded onto a 16.5% acrylamide, 80 × 100-mm minigel, 0.5 mm thick. Peptides were stained with the G-250 Coomassie Brillant Blue or directly electrotransferred onto a 0.2-μm Trans-blot polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Western blots were done by incubating the TPO mAb47 or aAb diluted in PBS, 3% BSA for 2 h at room temperature with constant shaking after saturation of the membrane with PBS containing 3% non-fat dried milk. The membrane was then washed three times for 15 min in PBS. The antimouse or antihuman second antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase was incubated for 2 h in PBS, 3% BSA at room temperature under shaking. After additional washes, the blots were developed with 4-chloro 1-naphthol as substrate. The peptides of interest were electroeluted from the stained bands in the gel by the Bio-Rad model 422 electroeluter according to the manufacturer instructions. Eluted peptides were then electrodialyzed against 50 mmNH4HCO3, 0.001% SDS by the same apparatus. Next, they were concentrated and dialyzed against methanol and ultrapure water by a centrifuge concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The salt-free isolated peptides were placed in PicoTag hydrolysis tubes (Waters, Millipore) and freeze-dried. The peptides were hydrolyzed in vapor phase with 6 m HCl, under vacuum, at 110 °C for 24 h. Amino acid compositions were determined from phenylisothiocyanate-derived amino acids by reverse phase-HPLC separation (Waters, Millipore). Amino acid sequences were determined by a computer program (22Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Cordier S. Russo-Marie F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 276-278Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) that identifies a proteolytic peptide of a protein through the sequence of the protein and the amino acid composition of the peptide. We used the TPO sequence reported by Magnusson et al. (23Magnusson R.P. Chazenbalk G.D. Gestautas J. Seto P. Filetti S. DeGroot L.J. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 856-86115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We also entered the apparent molecular weight of the peptides, estimated from the tricine SDS-PAGE, to calculate the amino acid percentages and to compare them with the experimental results. The program kept the best fitted peptide on the basis of a least squares method. The amino acid sequence of the 20-kDa peptide was determined on material electroeluted from tricine SDS-PAGE as above and then blotted on a PVDF membrane in a Prospin cartridge (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The NH2-terminal sequence was analyzed in an Applied Biosystem Procise Sequencer at the Pasteur Institute (Paris, France). Peptides from HPLC fraction 3+4 were labeled with 125I-Na by the chloramine-T method. Briefly, 10 μg of material was mixed with 5 μl of 125I-Na (500 μCi) and 10 μg of chloramine T in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2. After 1 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 20 μg of Na2S2O5. The labeled peptides were separated by gel filtration through a Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% BSA and 0.02% NaN3. The fractions collected from the column were analyzed for their125I-peptide content by Tricine SDS-PAGE in nonreducing condition (5,000 cpm/fraction). The gel was then scanned with a phosphoimager (FujixBass1000, Japan) equipped with a Tina 2.09 computer program (Raytest, Courbevoie, France). The column fractions were tested for immunoreactivity by a solid phase radioimmunoassay (6Ruf, J., Toubert, M. E., Czarnocka, B., Durand-Gorde, J-M., Ferrand, M., and Carayon, P. Endocrinology, 125,1211–1218.Google Scholar). Briefly, Startubes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with purified TPO aAb or mAb47, overcoated with BSA, and incubated with 100,000 cpm of125I-peptides. After extensive washing, the radioactive material bound to the tube was counted. The protein contents of the native TPO preparation and of the HPLC fractions of hydrolyzed TPO were estimated by PicoTag amino acid analysis (Waters, Millipore) as above. To obtain relevant peptides, we cleaved native TPO with endoproteinase Lys-C. The hydrolysis products were submitted to reverse phase-HPLC. The elution profile resolved into seven major peaks and many minor ones, with a total protein recovery of 50% (Fig. 1). Peak 0 was free of protein; it was due to an air bubble entrapped during the injection. For convenience, fractions corresponding to peaks 3 and 4 were pooled and named fraction 3+4. Nonhydrolyzed, native TPO eluted as one major peak corresponding to fraction 7 at the end of the acetonitrile gradient (data not shown). The peptides in the HPLC fractions were further analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. In native conditions, various bands were obtained from fractions 2 to 6 (Fig.2 A). The most heterogeneous fraction was fraction 3+4, yielding bands from 3.5 to 66 kDa. Fraction 1 showed no band, suggesting that its peptides were less than 3.5 kDa. Fraction 7 and, to a minor extent, fraction 6 showed a major band at 110 kDa, corresponding to poorly hydrolyzed TPO. Submitted to reduction, most of the bands from the fractions remained unchanged (Fig. 2 B). A few were modified, thus yielding bands with lower molecular mass, e.g. the 66-kDa band in fraction 3+4 yielded a 40- and a 26-kDa band. These modifications resulted from the presence, in native conditions, of TPO peptides linked by disulfide bridges.Figure 2Tricine SDS-PAGE of the HPLC fractions.The fractions were electrophoresed in native conditions (A) or after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (B). Eachlane was loaded with 10 μg of protein. After the run, the gel was stained with G-250 Coomassie Brillant Blue. The numbers of the HPLC fractions are at the top of the figure. The molecular masses of peptide standards are on the left. The positions of bands of interest are shown by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By ELISA, we searched for relevant peptides containing TPO epitopes in the HPLC fractions. Fractions were tested in native conditions with mAb and aAb directed to potential TPO autoepitopes. Native, nondegraded TPO served as control to ensure all TPO antibodies were in saturating conditions (Fig. 3). Fractions 6 and 7 were the most frequently recognized by the panel of antibodies. Among the remaining fractions, fraction 3+4 was the most immunoreactive with TPO mAb47 and aAb. To identify the immunoreactive peptides, we tested the HPLC fractions by Western blot with mAb47 and aAb as specific reagents. From native Tricine SDS-PAGE, mAb47 (Fig.4 A) and aAb (Fig.4 B) both identified a broad band at 66 kDa in fraction 3+4, and aAb identified a doublet at 20 kDa. Both reagents revealed a band at 110 kDa in fractions 6 and 7. The mAb47 and aAb immunoreactive band at 66 kDa shifted to 40 and 26 kDa when fraction 3+4 was separated in Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (see Fig. 2), and only the 40-kDa bands remained reactive with mAb47 (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, these bands and the aAb immunoreactive doublet from fraction 3+4 were no longer revealed by aAb in reducing conditions (Fig.4 D). The 110-kDa band of TPO was revealed by mAb47 in reduced fractions 6 and 7, whereas only the 110-kDa band of fraction 7 was revealed by aAb. To confirm that recognition of aAb depends on the antigenic conformation, we tested fraction 3+4 in ELISA after reduction and alkylation of the coated material. As a control, native TPO was tested in the same way. After treatment, fraction 3+4 was not recognized by aAb (Fig. 5 A), whereas the autoreactivity of the native TPO decreased slightly (Fig.5 B). In contrast, mAb47 was slightly more reactive on treated than untreated materials.Figure 4Western blot patterns of TPO mAb47 and aAb reactivities with the peptides from the HPLC fractions. The TPO peptides electrophoresed on Tricine SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane and tested with TPO mAb47 (A and C) and aAb (B and D). Western blots were done with samples used in native conditions (A and B) or after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol (C and D). The numbers of the HPLC fractions and the molecular mass standards are the same as in Fig. 2. Arrows indicate the immunoreactive bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Role of the dissulfide bridges in aAb recognition of TPO epitopes.

The results are expressed as absorbance reading at 405 nm (duplicate experiments, mean ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 40- and 20-kDa bands reactive with the mAb47 and the aAb, respectively, were electroeluted from fraction 3+4 after they were run in Tricine SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The amino acid composition was determined for these peptides, and a computer program localized the best fitted fragments in the entire TPO amino acid sequence. TableI shows the experimental and calculated amino acid percentages for the two TPO peptides. The optimized errors were 1.97 and 2.35% for the 40- and 20-kDa peptides, respectively. The two peptides were within the 550–923 and 744–922 C-terminal amino acid sequences of the TPO, respectively (Fig.6). Taking into account the localization of the theoretical lysine peptides, we deduced that the 40-kDa peptide encompassed 12 noncleaved lysine peptides from amino acid 549 to 933 at the C-terminal end of the TPO and that the last five lysine peptides from amino acid 742 to 933 overlapped the 20-kDa peptide.Table IAmino acid composition of the 40- and 20-kDa peptides from TPOAmino acid1-2001In parentheses are the single amino acid codes.

Open table in a new tab The 20-kDa peptide encompassed an extracellular part of the molecule followed by the transmembrane region and an intracytoplasmic region. Consequently, the autoimmune epitopes could be situated inside and/or outside the thyrocyte. Considering that the 20-kDa peptide contained three tyrosine residues in the extracellular part of the TPO molecule, we tested the immunoreactivity of TPO aAb for the peptide after modification of the tyrosine residues by iodination. After 125I labeling and gel fitration of the peptides from HPLC fraction 3+4, the 66- and 20-kDa labeled peptides were in fractions 4 and 10, respectively (Fig.7 B). The mAb47 recognized the 66-kDa 125I-labeled peptide. In contrast, TPO aAb recognized none of the peptides modified by iodination (Fig.7 A). To ascertain that the loss of TPO aAb reactivity to the iodinated 66- and 20-kDa peptides resulted from the modification of the tyrosine residues and not the oxidative stress of the chloramine-T method, we tested by ELISA the TPO aAb and mAb47 immunoreactivity of the HPLC fraction 3+4 after treatment by the chloramine-T method with and without iodide. The TPO aAb immunoreactivity for the HPLC fraction 3+4 decreased only when the peptides were iodinated (Fig.8 A). In the absence of iodide, the oxidative stress of chloramine-T did not abolish the autoimmune epitopes on the peptides. As expected, the linear epitope recognized by the mAb47 containing no tyrosine residue was not affected by the iodination procedure. The treatment of native TPO by the chloramine-T method, with or without iodide, slightly affected the immunoreactivity of TPO aAb but not that of mAb47 (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Role of iodination in aAb recognition of TPO epitopes. The ELISA was done with TPO aAb and mAb47 (as a control) to test HPLC fraction 3+4 (A) and native TPO (B) after treatment by the chloramine-T method with or without iodide. The results are expressed as percent of immunoreactivity of treated as compared with nontreated antigenic material (duplicate experiments, mean ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We localized a new immunodominant region within amino acids 742–848 at the C-terminal end of the extracellular part of TPO. This region is deprived of potential sites of glycosylation and contains 11 cysteine residues, some of which form disulfide bridges implicated in the three-dimensional structure of the evidenced autoepitopes. TPO was previously used to map the interaction of a panel of 13 mouse mAbs to 4 antigenic regions of TPO; TPO aAb from patients with Graves' or Hashimoto's disease were directed predominantly against two of the 4 regions (6Ruf, J., Toubert, M. E., Czarnocka, B., Durand-Gorde, J-M., Ferrand, M., and Carayon, P. Endocrinology, 125,1211–1218.Google Scholar). Interestingly, all but one of the epitopes in these two regions were conformational. The linear epitope (recognized by mAb47) was resistant to denaturation, and further studies localized the corresponding sequence at amino acids 713–721 (24Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Human mAb were produced to conformational epitopes in two overlapping regions on the surface of native TPO that were recognized by about 80% of TPO aAb in individual patient's sera (25Portolano S. Chazenbalk G.D. Seto P. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We reported that treatment of TPO by denaturing agents inactivated most of the aAb reactivity whereas treatment with a reducing agent completely abolished the autoimmune recognition (20Ruf J. Ferrand M. Durand-Gorde J-M. Carayon P. Autoimmunity. 1992; 11: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore generated peptides from our conventional preparation of native TPO. Enzymatic hydrolysis, peptide separation, and antibody binding were done without heating and reducing agents to maintain the native conformation of the generated peptides. The most interesting peptides were recovered from HPLC fraction 3+4, which eluted with a 41–43% acetonitrile gradient. This percent of acetonitrile does not change antibody recognition since fraction 7, eluted with 52% acetonitrile, retained almost all the native TPO autoreactivity in ELISA. The 26-kDa peptide, which is linked to the 40-kDa peptide by one or more disulfide bridges, showed no TPO antibody reactivity per se and, consequently, was not further investigated. We chose to localize on the TPO amino acid sequence, the 40- and the 20-kDa peptides, which reacted with the mAb47 and aAb, respectively. A computer program (22Cordier-Ochsenbein F. Cordier S. Russo-Marie F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 276-278Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) revealed they were in the C-terminal end of the known TPO sequence (23Magnusson R.P. Chazenbalk G.D. Gestautas J. Seto P. Filetti S. DeGroot L.J. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 856-86115Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa peptide extends from amino acid 549 to 933 and overlaps the 20-kDa peptide by its last 192 amino acids. This overlapping probably explains why these two peptides displayed similar hydrophobicity and, consequently, eluted in the same HPLC fraction. The sequence of the 20-kDa peptide was confirmed by direct sequencing of the five NH2-terminal amino acids. The 40-kDa sequencing failed to provide reliable information, but the mAb47 reactivity revealed that the reported mAb47 linear sequence (24Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was in the deduced sequence. More precisely, the autoimmune epitopes was localized in the C-terminal part of the molecule immediately before the transmembrane region, i.e.from amino acid 742 to 848. Effectively, the three tyrosine residues on the 20-kDa peptide were in this part of the molecule, and the iodination of the peptide abolished the conformational epitopes recognized by TPO aAb. Most attempts to identify and locate the B-cell epitopes on TPO were made on recombinant TPO fragments that obviously did not always adopt the same structure as their native counterparts in intact TPO (for review, see Refs. 17Banga J.P. Barnett P.S. McGregor A.M. Autoimmunity. 1991; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 192-206PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocr. Res. 1994; 3: 96-102Google Scholar). Identification of such linear epitopes was questioned because B-cell epitopes, unlike T-cell epitopes, are usually conformational i.e. highly dependent on the three-dimensional structure of the protein (26Laver W.G. Air G.M. Webster R.G. Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Thus, to explain the autoreactivity of linear epitopes, it was proposed that short peptide fragments of TPO may be part of larger discontinuous epitopes (27Libert F. Ludgate M. Dinsart C. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At variance with molecular biology studies (28Ludgate M. Mariotti S. Libert F. Dinsart C. Piccolo P.

Autoreactive bands were very scarce, and their immunoreactivity was very faint despite the large excess of aAb. Hydrolysis at lysine residues may have damaged some autoepitopes including C2 and C21, as described by Vassart (28Ludgate M. Mariotti S. Libert F. Dinsart C. Piccolo P. Santini F. Ruf J. Pinchera A.

Autoimmunity. 1990; 8: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which are within TPO amino acids 590–622 and 709–721, respectively, and which consequently map in the 40-kDa peptide region (549–933). However, as expected, the mAb47 epitope (713–721), which is virtually identical to the C21 epitope, was evidenced in the 40-kDa peptide but not in the 20-kDa peptide. This introduced an additional autoepitope of interest outside the C2 and C21/mAb47 epitopes at the C-terminal end of the TPO molecule. A region within amino acids 657–767 harbors a major and frequently used autoepitope (30Banga J.P. Barnett P.S. Ewins D.L. Page M.J. Mc Gregor A.M. Autoimmunity. 1990; 6: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The last 26 amino acids of this region overlap our 20-kDa peptide. An autoepitope is within residues 873–933 (33Frorath B. Abney C.C. Scanarini M. Berthold H. Hunt N. Northemann W. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and there are various autoepitopes along the TPO amino acid sequence, including the C-terminal amino acids 709–933 (34Tonacchera M. Cetani F. Costagliola S. Alcade L. Uibo R. Vassart G. Ludgate M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 132: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All these autoepitopes, however, are immunoreactive under denaturating and reducing conditions. On the other hand, limited tryptic digestion, as part of the purification procedure of TPO, generates various peptidic fragments (35Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Yokoyama N. Slaughter C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 278: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the trypsin cleavage sites is close to or on the luminal side of the apical membrane. The possible presence of a major autoepitope around this cleavage site precludes the use of trypsinized TPO or truncated recombinant TPO for aAb clinical testing. More recently, eight TPO mutants whose creation was guided by the crystal structure of myeloperoxidase, a closely related molecule, were used (36Nishikawa T. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These mutations were strategically located to alter the surface of the TPO molecule. Unfortunately, the eight mutageneses did not affect the aAb recognition of the molecule. The mutation nearest the C-terminal end of the molecule was within TPO amino acids 722–727,i.e. exactly 15 amino acids upstream from the 20-kDa peptide region. By default, this result adds to the validity of our determination and provides evidence for the involvement of this TPO region in autoimmune recognition. A large proportion of the epitopes recognized by aAb require the correct three-dimensional structure of TPO, but mapping these regions is a considerable challenge. This is the first report describing a TPO region that contains at least one conformational epitope recognized by aAb. Further investigations of this region should determine the aAb epitopes at the molecular level and evaluate the clinical significance of the corresponding aAb. We thank Profs. J.-F. Henry, B.

Coatomer, a complex of seven polypeptides, is the major component of the non-clathrin (COPI) membrane coat (1Pelham H.R.B.

ARF associates with PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich membranes and initiates budding by providing a binding site for coatomer (7Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J.M. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

In addition to phospholipase D, essential roles for phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, free diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C have been recently incorporated into models for the budding and vesicle scission processes (15Sabatini D.D.

Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The detailed roles of COPI polypeptides in the directional transport of membrane proteins require further investigation (17Schekman R. Mellman I. Cell. 1997; 90: 197-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). COPI proteins were first proposed to mediate non-selective transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Golgi complex to the cell surface (8Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 18Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Evidence in support of the anterograde role, in which COPI-coated vesicles, phospholipase D, and a novel p24 family protein are involved in moving newly translated proteins from the ER to the Golgi, was recently summarized (19Nickel W. Wieland F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an alternative model, COPI may be involved principally in selective retrograde transport of membrane proteins from the Golgi complex to the ER by selective association with a dilysine retrieval motif; a separate set of coat proteins, COPII, was identified that seems to function only in the anterograde vesicular transport of cargo from the ER to the Golgi (20Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.C. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that yeast COPII directs the formation of vesicles from the ER, and that these vesicles capture both cargo and necessary components of the molecular secretory apparatus further supports the importance of the COPII in anterograde traffic. The most recent data suggests that COPI may be involved in traffic in both directions, as two distinct populations of Golgi-associated COPI-coated vesicles were found in pancreatic cells, each with a different cargo implicating an intended transport direction for the vesicle population (21Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The polypeptide subunits of COPI have been characterized, and selected aspects of their individual roles are known. First, α-COP is the clathrin-like subunit. It is localized to coated transport vesicles and coated buds of Golgi membranes derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells (22Gerich B. Orci L. Tschochner H. Lottospeich F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Wieland F. Harter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3229-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gene for α-COP has been cloned and characterized (22Gerich B. Orci L. Tschochner H. Lottospeich F. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Wieland F. Harter C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3229-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Disruption of this gene in yeast has been found to be lethal. α-COP has also been shown to be required for ER localization of dilysine-tagged proteins (23Schroder S. Schimmoller F. Kruger-Singer B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A novel human gene, HEP-COP, has been isolated, the product of which is highly homologous to yeast α-COP (24Chow V.T. Quek H.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Quek H.H. Chow V.T.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). β-COP, which is homologous to the β′ subunit of assembly protein 2 (AP-2) (26Duden R. Griffiths G. Frank R. Argos P. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 649-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), has been reported to be essential for transport of protein from the ER to Golgi in vitro (27Peter F. Plutner H. Zhu H. Kreis T.E. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The binding of β-COP with Golgi membranes has been shown to be enhanced by non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs and AlF4−. β′-COP is homologous to β subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. γ-COP binds to dilysine motifs of membrane proteins (28Harter C.

Lottspeich F. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A single point mutation in ε-COP has been shown to result in temperature-sensitive lethal defects in membrane transport (30Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Kreiger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ζ-COP has sequence homology to AP-17 and AP-20 subunits (31Kuge O. Hara-Kuge S. Orci L. Ravazzola M.

The B complex (α-COP, β′-COP, and ε-COP) has been found to interact directly and bind to membranes (32Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), while γ-COP and ζ-COP form a second subcomplex (33Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Direct binding studies using purified coatomer isolated from bovine liver cytosol show that coatomer specifically binds both Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and InsP6 with affinities of 0.1 and 0.2 nm, respectively (34Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of phosphorylation of the inositol polyphosphates (InsPn) has been proposed to dictate the order of binding to coatomer (InsP6> InsP5 > InsP4) (35Ali N. Duden R. Bembenek M.E. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since dissociation of the COPI polypeptides can only be accomplished under conditions that would not permit measurement of InsPn binding, the affinities of individual COPI subunits for InsPn are unknown. Moreover, binding of coatomer complexes to phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates (PtdInsPns) remains unreported. To address the InsPnand PtdInsPn binding specificities of individual COPI subunits, and to obtain evidence to support the roles of these high affinity interactions in vesicular trafficking, we employed a photoaffinity labeling approach with benzophenone-containing InsPn and PtdInsPn analogs (36Mehrotra B.

The benzophenone photophore allows handling in ambient light, activation at wavelengths >320 nm, and covalent labeling of active site residues in hydrophobic regions of proteins with high efficiency (37Dormán G.

The specific activities of the [3H]BZDC-PtdInsPn and InsPn derivatives used were 42.5 Ci/mmol. d-myo-InsP4, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 were synthesized frommethyl-α-d-glucopyranoside as described previously (41Gu Q.-M.

PtdIns(3)P was prepared similarly. 2J. Chen, unpublished results. All phosphoinositides had sn-1,2-dipalmitoyl acyl chains in the diacylglycerol moiety. InsP6 was obtained from Sigma as the monopotassium salt. Anti-COP antisera were gifts from Dr. C. Harter (University of Heidelberg). All other chemicals were commercial products of reagent grade. Solutions were made in Nanopure® water. The [3H]BZDC analogs of PtdInsPn and InsPn were prepared for Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6, PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via synthesis of an ω-aminoalkyl ester of one of the phosphates followed by amidation using [3H]BZDC-NHS ester (40Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Each tritiated photoaffinity ligand was purified by ion exchange, and purified probes were obtained by elution with 0.4 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (for [3H]BZDC-InsPns) or 0.8–0.9 m triethylammonium bicarbonate (for [3H]BZDC-PtdInsPn). Thus, P-2-O-(6-aminopropyl)-InsP6 and its [3H]BZDC photoaffinity label were prepared as described earlier (36Mehrotra B. Elliott J.T. Chen J. Olszewski J.D. Profit A.A. Chaudhary A. Fukuda M.

Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). P-1-tethered [3H]BZDC-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was prepared by coupling the 1-O-(3-aminopropyl)-d-myo-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4(43Estevez V.A. Prestwich G.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 9885-9887Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with the [3H]BZDC-NHS ester. The synthesis of O-(3-aminopropyl)-tethered phosphotriester analogs of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4)P2 was accomplished using the coupling reagent 2-cyano-ethyl-N,N,N′,N′-tetra(isopropyl)phosphordiamidite (37Dormán G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 38Olszewski J.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Hong Y. Ahern D.G. Prestwich G.D.

This introduced a reactive aminopropyl group at the P-1 phosphate to which the [3H]BZDC moiety was then attached. Coatomer was purified from bovine liver cytosol as described (45Waters M.G. Beckers C.J.M. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to give material of about 60% purity after Mono Q chromatography. An aliquot of this partially purified Golgi coatomer (6 μg, 0.3 μm) was incubated with 30 μl of buffer A (150 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.9) and either [3H]BZDC-InsPn or [3H]BZDC-PtdInsPn (0.5 μCi, 0.28 μm). The specificity and affinity of binding were determined by adding an aliquot of an aqueous solution or suspension of the corresponding unlabeled PtdInsPn or InsPn (0.28 mm) directly into the incubation mixture. Samples were equilibrated at 4 °C for 10–15 min in a 96-well plate. The wells in the plate were then aligned with the axis of a UV light source with minimum distance maintained between the bottom of the wells and the bulb. The samples were photolysed for 45 min at 4 °C (360 nm at 1900 μW/cm2) (32Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Following irradiation, sample buffer (5 ×) was added to the samples and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% Laemmli gels), stained with Coomassie Blue; the gel was processed for fluorography as described (32Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film for 7–14 days at −80 °C. There was no covalent incorporation of the photolabel in the absence of UV irradiation. Fluorograms were digitized on a UMAX-UC 840 scanner using Adobe Photoshop (Macintosh version 2.0.1). The densities of the bands on the fluorogram were determined by NIH IMAGE 1.59 to calculate relative incorporation. Protein (30 μg, 0.05 μm) was incubated in 1 ml of buffer B (1 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100) and gently shaken and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. This mixture was applied to a gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography column (TSK-GEL, G3000SW, 7.5 mm inner diameter), flow rate 0.5 ml/min, 30-min run, isocratic elution using buffer C (25 mm Tris, pH 7.46, 0.4 m NaCl). The high performance liquid chromatography system was calibrated using molecular weight protein markers, and 1-min fractions were collected. The 16-min fraction, corresponding to mass 315 kDa, was photolabeled as described above. Coatomer (6 μg, 0.3 μm) was photoaffinity labeled with [3H]BZDC-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (0.5 μCi, 0.28 μm) as described above. The labeled mixture was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (3 and 4 μl of anti-α-COP antisera and 1 and 2 μl of anti-β-COP antisera, respectively) in 250 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). Protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl) (Pharmacia) were then added to the mixture and incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with IP buffer, and then incubated overnight in IP buffer containing 1m NaCl. Subsequent wash steps were performed in IP buffer (3 ×) and finally in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Sample buffer (5 ×) was added to the washed pellets and the immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE (10% Laemmli gels). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and processed for fluorography as described above. Five photoaffinity labels (Fig. 1) were used to study the coatomer subunit specificity and selectivity for different InsPn and PtdInsPn probes. Each InsPn and PtdInsPnphotoaffinity probe was prepared from the corresponding 1- or 2-O-(ω-aminoalkyl)-InsPn or -PtdInsPnderivative with the heterobifunctional reagent [3H]BZDC-NHS ester (38Olszewski J.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Hong Y. Ahern D.G. Prestwich G.D. Bioconjugate Chem. 1995; 6: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and had the same nominal specific activity of 42.5 Ci/mmol. This ensured that levels of radioactivity in each probe corresponded to equivalent concentrations, thereby allowing direct comparison of relative efficiencies of photoattachment. Selectivity of the probes for coatomer subunits was determined by photoaffinity labeling experiments employing [3H]BZDC-InsPn or [3H]BZDC-PtdInsPn probes. Specific binding was determined by competitive displacement of photocovalent modification in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled (Ptd)InsPn. The specificity could be approximated by the difference between the total binding (no competitor) and binding in the presence of the competing ligand. Since coatomer has been demonstrated to bind Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and InsP6 with subnanomolar affinities (0.1 and 0.2 nm, respectively (34Fleischer B. Xie J. Mayrleitner M. Shears S.B. Palmer D.J. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), we initially employed the [3H]BZDC-InsP4 and [3H]BZDC-InsP6 probes for photoaffinity labeling of the COPI subunits. Fig. 2 shows the photolabeling of coatomer polypeptides with the P-1-tethered [3H]BZDC-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 probe. This probe exhibited specific labeling of the 170-kDa subunit α-COP. Labeling was competitively displaced by a 1000-fold excess (0.28 mm) of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and InsP6. Thus, both unlabeled Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and InsP6 appeared to compete for the same binding site as [3H]BZDC-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Coatomer has also been shown to have high affinity binding interactions with InsP6. To study the polypeptides involved in this binding, we employed the P-2-tethered [3H]BZDC-InsP6 probe. Fig.3 shows the labeling obtained with this probe. [3H]BZDC-InsP6 exhibited intense labeling of most proteins in this partially purified preparation. Interestingly, addition of competitors InsP6 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (0.28 mm) competitively displaced the labeling from β-COP, β′-COP, δ-COP, and ε-COP, indicating specific labeling of these subunits. However, labeling of the α-COP and γ-COP resisted competitive displacement, suggesting that the soluble probe might not be sufficient to displace a combined electrostatic-hydrophobic interaction afforded by the photoaffinity analog. Evidence from our laboratories using photoaffinity labeling (39Prestwich G.D. Dormán G. Elliott J.T. Marecak D.M. Chaudhary A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) has implicated highly selective binding of PtdInsPn derivatives to a number of proteins important in the budding and fusion of lipid bilayers, as well as those known to be recruited to polyphosphoinositide-rich membranes. Thus, coatomer was labeled with a series of [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdInsPn(n = 2 or 3) probes (40Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that have diacylglycerol moieties for membrane anchoring, the correct phosphorylation pattern on the d-myo-inositol ring, and a photoactivatable group that can covalently modify proteins recruited to the membrane surface. Fig. 4 shows that each of the PtdInsPn probes, [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, -PtdIns(3,4)P2, and -PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1), labeled only α-COP with high subunit and PtdInsPnselectivity. Four main points should be emphasized in interpreting the results of the PtdInsPn photoaffinity labeling. First, the labeling profile obtained with the [3H]BZDC-triester-linked bis- and trisphosphoinositides was similar to that observed with the [3H]BZDC-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 probe. Only the α-COP subunit was labeled significantly with each of these probes. This is consistent with the previous observation that centaurin-α, a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding protein, was also selectively labeled by this soluble Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 photoaffinity probe (47Hammonds-Odie L.P. Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The three-carbon linker with the appended benzoyldihydrocinnamoyl amide group appears to act as a 2-desoxy-acylglycerol analog of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (40Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Second, the labeling intensities indicated that the relative affinities of the three triester polyphosphoinositide probes for α-COP are in the order [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3> -PtdIns(3,4)P2 > -PtdIns(4,5)P2. These data further support the hypothesis that this site is selective for binding to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Third, a 1000-fold molar excess of either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3or PtdIns(3,4)P2 completely displaced labeling of α-COP by [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, but the same excess of PtdIns(4,5)P2 showed only limited displacement. The observation that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as well as both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4)P2completely displaced the covalent modification of α-COP by either of the [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4)P2 or -PtdIns(4,5)P2 probes suggests a lack of head group discrimination for the labeling by the two bisphosphoinositide triester probes. This further supports the hypothesis that α-COP has a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-specific binding site. Fourth, a titration of the competitive displacement of the photoaffinity labeling of the 170-kDa α-COP band by three D-3 phosphoinositides was performed (Fig. 5), using the pure synthetic di-C16 polyphosphoinositides (40Prestwich G.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 503-513Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The monophosphate PtdIns(3)P showed less than 50% displacement at 1000-fold molar excess relative to the [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3probe, while PtdIns(3,4)P2 showed displacement only at the 1000-fold level. In contrast, even a modest 10-fold excess of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 showed >50% displacement of the labeling. Because the photoaffinity experiment is intrinsically a non-equilibrium process, “all-or-nothing” displacement is often observed for low affinity competitors. To verify that the labeled 170-kDa band was indeed α-COP and not an unrelated protein of molecular weight similar to α-COP, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the anti-α-COP and anti-β-COP subunit specific antibodies. Fig.6 shows the SDS-10% PAGE gel and corresponding fluorogram of the immunoprecipitation of the photoaffinity-labeled protein. The anti-β-COP antisera immunoprecipitated the β-subunit at 110 kDa, but no radiolabel was present. (The rigorous washing conditions used for the immunoprecipitated, protein A-Sepharose bound protein, including an overnight incubation in 1 m NaCl, effectively dissociates all the COPI subunits and would remove any cargo proteins.) In contrast, the anti-α-COP antibody immunoprecipitated the 170-kDa α-COP subunit (as seen on the SDS-PAGE gel). Moreover, this subunit contained the [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3label, providing conclusive evidence for the interaction of this subunit with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Negligible amounts of radioactivity were detected in the wash buffers, in contrast to the label recovered in the high salt washes of the anti-β-COP-precipitated proteins. Interestingly, the anti-α-COP antibody used was developed against the C terminus of the α-subunit, strongly suggesting that the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding site on α-COP is not contained within the epitope for antibody recognition on this subunit. To assess the role of other coatomer subunits in α-COP-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 interaction, coatomer subunits were partially dissociated using a high salt buffer (33Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After buffer exchange and gel filtration, the complex of α-COP, β′-COP, and ε-COP (B complex, about 316 kDa) was photoaffinity labeled with the [3H]BZDC-triester-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3probe. Surprisingly, no labeling was observed on this heterotrimeric complex (data not shown), which has been reported to bind to membranes (32Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 33Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89)"
https://openalex.org/W2114769826,"The Bm1P1 protein was previously proposed to act as a positive transcription factor involved in barbiturate-mediated induction of cytochrome P450BM-1 in Bacillus megaterium. We now report that the bm1P1 gene encodes a protein of 217 amino acids, rather than the 98 amino acids as reported previously. In vitro gel shift assays indicate that the Bm1P1 protein did not interact with probes comprising the regulatory regions of the P450BM-1 gene. Moreover, disruption of the bm1P1 gene did not markedly affect barbiturate induction of P450BM-1 expression. A multicopy plasmid harboring only the P450BM-1 promoter region could increase expression of the chromosome-encoded P450BM-1. The level of expression is comparable with that shown by a multicopy plasmid harboring the P450BM-1 promoter region along with the bm1P1 gene. These results strongly suggest that the Bm1P1 protein is unlikely to act as a positive regulator for barbiturate induction of P450BM-1 expression. Finally, deletion of the Barbie box did not markedly diminish the effect of pentobarbital on expression of a reporter gene transcriptionally fused to the P450BM-1 promoter.

This suggests that the Barbie box is unlikely to be a key element in barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1. At least three distinct cytochrome P450s, i.e.P450BM-1, P450BM-2, and P450BM-3, have been identified in Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581 (1Fulco A.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,2Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). P450BM-1 (CYP106), whose function is still relatively unclear, is moderately induced by barbiturates (3Schwalb H. Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 838: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). P450BM-3 (CYP102), a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid monooxygenase, is strongly induced by barbiturates (4Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2147-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bm3R1 gene, located immediately upstream of the P450BM-3 structural gene, has been demonstrated to encode a transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates expression of the P450BM-3 gene (5Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro inhibition by barbiturates on the interaction of Bm3R1 repressor with its operator near the P450BM-3 promoter has been correlated with their in vivo potency as inducers of P450BM-3 expression. This suggests that barbiturate inducers may function in vivo by releasing the binding of Bm3R1 repressor from its operator DNA (6Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Liang and Fulco (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) found that the Bm3R1 repressor could also negatively regulate expression of P450BM-1 in B. megaterium. This repression was proposed to be mediated through the binding of Bm3R1 to some putative regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region of P450BM-1 (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, gel mobility shift assays showed that barbiturates could not inhibit the binding of Bm3R1 to these regulatory elements (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), thus leaving open questions about how barbiturates can induce expression of P450BM-1. A Barbie box, located in the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM-1 gene, was also proposed by Liang et al.(8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to be a cis-acting element responsible for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1. In addition, the Bm1P1 protein, encoded by an open reading frame immediately upstream of the P450BM-1 gene and transcribed in the opposite direction, was proposed to function as a positive regulatory protein for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1. This was proposed to be a result of interference with the binding of Bm3R1 repressor to the Barbie box (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As an initial step toward understanding whether other adjacent genes are regulated by Bm1P1, we have cloned and sequenced the bm1P1 gene and its downstream DNA. We found some discrepancies between the sequence published by He et al.(9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and our sequencing data. In this report, we present the correct nucleotide sequence of the bm1P1 gene and provide evidence that the bm1P1 gene encodes a protein of 217 amino acids, rather than the 98 amino acids as reported by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, we provide evidence against Bm1P1 as a positive transcription factor involved in barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1 and evidence against the Barbie box as a key element responsible for induction of P450BM-1 by barbiturates.

Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for growing Escherichia coli and B. megateriumunless specified otherwise. Chromosomal DNA of B. megaterium ATCC14581 was isolated according to the procedure described by Miura (11Miura K.I. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12: 543-545Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and was partially digested with restriction enzyme Sau3AI to produce a majority of DNA fragments in sizes ranging from 3 to 6 kb. These fragments were ligated into the BamHI site of pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene).E. coli JM109 (12Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) was transformed with the ligated DNA to generate a genomic library. A 395-bp DNA fragment containing the N-terminal sequence of the P450BM-1 gene was amplified by PCR (13Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar) using B. megaterium genomic DNA as a template and two oligonucleotides as primers. PCR was carried out as described previously (5Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream primer (5′-AACAAAGAAGTCATTCCCGT-3′) contains the sequence corresponding to nucleotide positions 4 to 23 of the P450BM-1 coding region (14He J.-S. Ruettinger R.T. Liu H.-M. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The downstream primer (5′-TTTTGTATCGCTTCTACAAGG-3′) contains a sequence complementary to bases 378 to 398 of the P450BM-1 coding region. This PCR-generated DNA fragment was gel purified, labeled by a random priming method (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using Multiprime DNA labeling kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham), and used as a probe to screen the genomic library according to the method described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit and [α-35S]dATP. Alkaline-denatured double-stranded DNA (17Chen E.J. Seeburg P.H. DNA (New York). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) was used as the template. Synthesized oligonucleotides were used as specific primers to determine the sequences of bm1P1 and its downstream DNA. Various deletions were also made in the cloned DNA and its subcloned derivatives using a unidirectional nested deletion method with exonuclease III (18Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) to generate templates for sequencing reactions. DNA sequences were analyzed with the sequence analysis software package from Genetics Computer Group, Inc. For construction of various P450BM-1 promoter-cat transcriptional fusions, PCR was used to generate variable-length segments of the P450BM-1 regulatory region flanked by appropriate restriction sites. The upstream primers P85 (5′-GCGCGTCGACCGAAGTGTCTACGTATCC-3′), P86 (5′-GCGCGTCGACCCCTAAAATATCTAGCTGTT-3′), and P90 (5′-GCGCGTCGACCTGGTGCGTATGCCCTA-3′) contain aSalI site (underlined) at their 5′ ends, and the downstream primer P83 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTGATAAATAGTTACTTTGTCGA-3′) contains a HindIII site (underlined) at its 5′ end. After cleavage with HindIII and SalI, the PCR-generated DNA fragments were cloned between the SalI and HindIII sites of pUBCAT (19Wen L.P. Ruettinger R.T. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10996-11003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transformed into B. megaterium. The transformants were selected for kanamycin resistance. A 900-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the bm1P1 promoter region plus the bm1P1 gene was amplified by PCR to construct plasmid pGS132 used for in vivo titration experiment. The upstream primer P75 (5′-GCGGAATTCGAATTTACTAGCTACATAGC-3′) contains anEcoRI site (underlined) at its 5′ end, and the downstream primer P71 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTCATGTTACGGATCTGTCGA-3′) contains aHindIII site (underlined) at its 5′ end. Following digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, this fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites of vector pLC4 (22Ray C. Hay R.E. Carter H.L. Moran Jr., C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 610-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pGS148 was constructed to carry a sole copy of a 270-bp bm1P1 promoter region. This was accomplished by using an upstream primer P75 and a downstream primer P88 (5′-GCGCGAATTCCCCTAAAATATCTAGCTGTT-3′) that contains anEcoRI site (underlined) at its 5′ end. Two primers flanking the bm1P1 gene were used in PCR for the construction of a 6×His-tagged Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid. The upstream primer P66, 5′-GCGGAATTCAACAGAGGAGTAACAGCAAT-3′, contains anEcoRI site (underlined) at its 5′ end, and the downstream primer, 5′-GCGCAAGCTTAgtgatggtgatggtgatgCGGATCTGTCGAAAAATGAC-3′, contains a HindIII site (underlined) and sequence corresponding to 6×His (in lowercase). The PCR-amplified fragment was double digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into vector pKK223-3 (20Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pGS104. The wild-type bm1P1 gene of B. megaterium was synthesized by PCR using two primers flanking the bm1P1gene. Primers P66 and P71 were used as the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The 690-bp EcoRI- and HindIII-digested PCR fragment was cloned into vector pKK223-3 (20Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pGS99. E. coli JM109 was transformed with pGS99. Induction of Bm1P1 production by addition of IPTG to E. coli cell cultures was performed as described previously (5Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bm1P1 overproduction was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of whole cell extracts that were prepared as described previously (21Shaw G.C. Sun C.H. Chiang A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 1197-1205PubMed Google Scholar). A 310-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment carrying a partial N-terminal sequence of the bm1P1 gene was generated by PCR using two synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. The upstream primer (5′-GCGGAATTCAAAACAGCTAGATATTTTAGG-3′) contains anEcoRI site (underlined) at its 5′ end, and the downstream primer (5′-GCGCAAGCTTAAACGAGTGTACTTTCAATC-3′) contains aHindIII site (underlined) at its 5′ end. Following digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, this fragment was cloned into EcoRI- and HindIII-cut plasmid pJH101 (23Ferrari F.A. Nguyen A. Lang D. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1513-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pGS105 was transformed into E. coliJM109. Transformants were selected for chloramphenicol resistance. One clone was selected for Southern blot analysis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to confirm the disruption of the bm1P1 gene by using the 310-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment as a probe. Purification of Bm1P1(His)6protein by nickel ion-nitrilo-triacetic acid affinity column chromatography was carried out as described previously (21Shaw G.C. Sun C.H. Chiang A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 37: 1197-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed according to the method of Fried and Crothers (24Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared as described by Towbinet al. (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Transformation of B. megaterium was achieved by the protoplast method (27Chang S. Cohen S.N. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 168: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). CAT activity assays were performed by the colorimetric method of Shaw (26Shaw W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) with cell-free extracts of B. megaterium that were prepared by sonication as described previously (4Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2147-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides, corresponding to the published N-terminal nucleotide sequence of the P450BM-1 gene (14He J.-S. Ruettinger R.T. Liu H.-M. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were used in PCR with B. megaterium chromosomal DNA as the template to synthesize the probe. B. megaterium chromosomal DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI, ligated into BamHI-cut vector pBluescript KS(+), and transformed into E. coli JM109. The transformants carrying recombinant plasmids were screened for inserts that hybridized to the probe. One positive clone, which showed strong hybridization to the probe, was identified. DNA sequencing was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequencing strategy and restriction map are shown in Fig.1. The nucleotide sequence of the bm1P1 gene and its flanking DNA are shown in Fig. 2. PCR with various pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides as primers and genomic DNA of B. megaterium as the template confirmed that the clonedbm1P1 gene and its downstream 5.3-kb DNA represent a continuous fragment of chromosomal DNA (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the N-terminal 79 amino acids of the bm1P1 gene and its upstream region is consistent with that reported by He et al. (14He J.-S. Ruettinger R.T. Liu H.-M. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the rest of the coding region of the bm1P1 gene and its downstream 380-bp region is different from that reported in another publication by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in many positions. The size of the Bm1P1 protein reported by Heet al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was 98 amino acids, whereas our sequencing data indicated that the bm1P1 gene encodes a putative protein of 217 amino acids. The reading frame of the bm1P1 gene reported by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) seems to be incorrectly shifted after the 88th codon, resulting in premature termination of the open reading frame at the 99th codon. The Swiss protein data base was examined for homologous sequences using the programs FASTA and BLAST. A group of proteins that showed significant similarity to the N-terminal region of the Bm1P1 protein was identified. These proteins are known or putative transcriptional regulators of a similar size to Bm1P1 and belong to the TetR/AcrR family of transcriptional regulators. Some of them, including TetC (197 amino acids) (28Schollmeier K. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 499-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AcrR (215 amino acids) (29Ma D. Cook D.N. Alberti M. Pon N.G. Nikaido H. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6299-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TcmR (226 amino acids) (30Guilfoile P.G. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BetI (195 amino acids) (31Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. Falkenberg P. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), MtrR (210 amino acids) (32Pan W. Spratt B.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and Bm3R1 (192 amino acids) (5Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are shown in Fig.3. The N-terminal regions of these proteins were predicted to form a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif (33Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). A segment of 20 amino acids near the N terminus of Bm1P1 (residues 26–45) was also strongly predicted to be an HTH DNA-binding motif according to the method of Dodd and Egan (34Dodd I.B. Egan J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Sequence analysis of DNA within the 2.27-kb region downstream of bm1P1 revealed an open reading frame that can encode a putative protein of 539 amino acids (data not shown). This putative polypeptide showed distinct amino acid sequence similarity to a number of ATP-binding cassette transporters (35Fath M.J. Kolter R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 995-1017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Its complete nucleotide sequence will be reported elsewhere. To determine the size of the bm1P1 gene product, we constructed a Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid pGS99 by placing the bm1P1 gene under the control of the tac promoter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whole cell extracts prepared fromE. coli transformants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A protein band with an apparent molecular mass of about 26 kDa was observed only in extract from E. coli carrying plasmid pGS99 grown in the presence of IPTG (Fig. 4, lane 5). The same band was not observed in non-IPTG induced cells carrying plasmid pGS99 and was not observed in cells carrying plasmid pKK223-3 as a control (Fig. 4, lanes 2–4). The estimated size of the overproduced Bm1P1 is in good agreement with that predicted from the nucleotide sequence. It should be noted that an IPTG-induced protein band with an apparent molecular mass of about 11 kDa as reported by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) could not be detected in this study. To determine whether Bm1P1 can bind to the 5′-flanking region, including the Barbie box, of the P450BM-1 gene, we used an E. coli strain bearing Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid pGS99 for the preparation of cell-free extracts containing the overexpressed Bm1P1 protein. We also constructed a Bm1P1(His)6-overproducing plasmid pGS104 to facilitate purification of Bm1P1 with an nickel ion-nitrilo-triacetic acid affinity column. The 270-bp insert in plasmid pGS118 (Fig. 7) was used as a probe in gel mobility shift assays. The results indicated that neither purified Bm1P1 nor cell-free extracts containing the overexpressed Bm1P1 protein could form a specific complex with DNA fragments carrying the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM-1gene (data not shown). To disrupt the bm1P1gene in the chromosome of B. megaterium, we constructed an integrative plasmid pGS105 (Fig.5 A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B. megaterium cells transformed by pGS105 were selected for chloramphenicol resistance. Disruption of the bm1P1 gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis as shown in Fig. 5 B. To examine the role of bm1P1 in barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1, the wild-typeB. megaterium and bm1P1 mutant were grown in the absence or presence of pentobarbital to stationary phase. Cell-free extracts were prepared from these cultures and subjected to SDS-PAGE. This was followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-P450BM-1 antibodies as probes. As shown in Fig.5 C, the P450BM-1 level in the bm1P1mutant was still inducible by pentobarbital. The magnitude of induction of P450BM-1 by pentobarbital in the bm1P1 mutant was comparable with that observed in the wild-type B. megaterium. These results suggest that induction of P450BM-1 by pentobarbital is unlikely to be mediated by bm1P1 as previously proposed by He et al.(9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As previously reported by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), B. megaterium cells, transformed by a multicopy plasmid containing the bm1P1 gene under the control of its own promoter and grown in the absence of pentobarbital, showed a dramatic increase in expression of the chromosome-encoded P450BM-1. The expression could be further increased when grown in the presence of pentobarbital (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These observations led them to the proposition that Bm1P1 might function as a positive transcription factor to activate P450BM-1 gene expression. As our data from bm1P1 disruption indicated that Bm1P1 is unlikely to act as a positive regulator for P450BM-1 expression, those results obtained by He et al. may be open to other interpretations. We reexamined those results by construction of a multicopy plasmid containing the bm1P1 promoter alone (i.e. without the bm1P1 gene) in addition to a multicopy plasmid containing the bm1P1 promoter region plus the bm1P1 gene. As shown in Fig. 6, B. megateriumcells transformed by the multicopy plasmid pGS132 containing the bm1P1 promoter region plus the bm1P1 gene indeed exhibited a marked increase in P450BM-1 level as compared with cells transformed by the control vector alone. However, whenB. megaterium cells were transformed by pGS148 containing the bm1P1 promoter alone, a comparable increase in P450BM-1 level was also observed. These results suggest that the previously observed increase in P450BM-1 level may be due to derepression rather than activation by the Bm1P1 proteinper se. This derepression is presumably caused by competitive binding between the multicopy plasmid-encoded P450BM-1 promoter and the chromosome-encoded P450BM-1 promoter for a putative negative regulatory protein. Our data further support that Bm1P1 is not a positive transcription factor for P450BM-1 gene expression. To further test whether the Barbie box located in the coding region of bm1P1 was important for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1 as reported by Liang et al. (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we synthesized a series of deletion derivatives of the P450BM-1 regulatory region by PCR and ligated these fragments into a promoter probe vector pUBCATto generate various P450BM-1 promoter-cattranscriptional fusions. B. megaterium cells transformed with these constructs were selected for kanamycin resistance. At least two independent clones for each construct were chosen for CAT activity assays to obtain consistent results. As shown in Fig.7, deletion of part of the Barbie box did not result in a marked decrease in the observed induction of P450BM-1 by pentobarbital. Similar results were obtained when the complete Barbie box was deleted. These data suggest that the Barbie box is unlikely to be the key element responsible for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1. However, our results did confirm the previous observation (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that the sequence within the Barbie box was important for negative regulation of P450BM-1 gene expression in the absence of pentobarbital. In the present study, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the bm1P1 gene and its flanking region. The nucleotide sequence presented in this paper is different from that published by Heet al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in many positions. Our sequence analysis indicated that bm1P1 encodes a putative protein of 217 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 25,405, rather than the 98 amino acids as reported by He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As stated previously, sequencing errors may have resulted in a reading frameshift of bm1P1 after the 88th codon, resulting in premature termination of the open reading frame at the 99th codon. To examine the size of Bm1P1 protein, He et al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) constructed a Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid by using two PCR primers flanking the bm1P1 coding region to synthesize the bm1P1 gene. Although the estimated size of the overexpressed Bm1P1 (about 11 kDa) was in agreement with what they predicted, the overexpressed Bm1P1 was actually a truncated form of the full-length 217-amino acid Bm1P1. If He et al. had used a PCR primer complementary to a sequence further downstream of the truncated Bm1P1 to construct a Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid, they probably would have identified Bm1P1 as a protein with higher molecular weight. In fact, one of the PCR primers we used for construction of a Bm1P1-overproducing plasmid was complementary to the C terminus of the full-length Bm1P1. So, the IPTG-induced protein band was detected at a position corresponding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 26 kDa rather than 11 kDa. It is reasonable to question whether the coding region of bm1P1 we identified may still extend further into its downstream region. To resolve this question, we used PCR primers complementary to sequences about 150 or 500 bp further downstream of bm1P1 to construct Bm1P1-overproducing plasmids. The results indicated that the apparent molecular weight of the resulting Bm1P1 was identical to that of the 217-amino acid Bm1P1 (data not shown), suggesting that the size of Bm1P1 we determined is its full size. By using either purified 6×His-tagged Bm1P1 or cell-free extract containing overexpressed wild-type Bm1P1 in gel mobility shift assays, we did not detect any specific protein binding to the 5′-flanking region, including the Barbie box, of the P450BM-1 gene. Moreover, disruption of the bm1P1 gene did not markedly affect barbiturate induction of P450BM-1 expression. This further suggests that Bm1P1 is not required for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-1. The previous proposition by Heet al. (9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that Bm1P1 was a putative positive regulator of P450BM-1 gene expression was simply based on the following observations: (i) Bm1P1 was shown to interfere with the binding of Bm3R1 repressor to the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM-1gene in gel mobility shift assays; and (ii) B. megateriumcells transformed by a multicopy plasmid containing the bm1P1 gene and its promoter region showed a marked increase in chromosomal P450BM-1 level when compared with B. megaterium transformed by the vector alone. However, our data indicated that B. megaterium transformed by a multicopy plasmid containing the bm1P1 promoter region alone could still exhibit a comparable increase in chromosomal P450BM-1level. Alternative to the previously proposed positive regulatory role of the Bm1P1 protein, a mechanism involving competitive binding between plasmid- and chromosome-encoded promoters for a putative negative regulatory protein is suggested. This mechanism may lead to the observed derepression of the chromosome-encoded P450BM-1. Liang and Fulco (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that the Bm3R1 repressor could negatively regulate expressions of both P450BM-1 and P450BM-3 genes in B. megaterium coordinately. It should be noted that the underlying molecular mechanisms for negative regulation of P450BM-1 and P450BM-3 expressions may be somewhat different. It has been previously demonstrated that Bm3R1 repressor exerts repression on P450BM-3 gene expression by direct binding to a 20-bp palindromic operator near the transcription start site of the P450BM-3 gene (5Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Bm3R1 may regulate P450BM-1 gene expression in an indirect manner rather than by direct binding to the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM-1 gene. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. (i) When using purified Bm3R1 protein in gel mobility shift assays, Liang and Fulco (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) could not detect formation of the specific complex with the 5′-flanking sequence, including the Barbie box, of the P450BM-1 gene. When the E. coli cell-free extract containing the overexpressed Bm3R1 was used, they could detect formation of protein-DNA complexes. However, the footprints protected by Bm3R1 were barely visible (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays further showed that pentobarbital could not disrupt these protein-DNA complexes in vitro (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), thus casting some doubt on the identity of the protein component(s) in these complexes. (ii) No significant consensus sequence was identified among these putative Bm3R1 binding sites, especially when compared with the well established Bm3R1 operator sequence near the P450BM-3 promoter. (iii) An in vivo titration effect is exerted by the multicopy plasmid-encoded P450BM-1 promoter region on expression of the chromosome-encoded P450BM-1 but not on expression of the chromosome-encoded P450BM-3 (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 9He J.-S. Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18615-18625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This suggests that a putative negative regulator was titrated out by complexing to the multicopy plasmid-encoded P450BM-1promoter region and is unlikely to be the Bm3R1 repressor. Otherwise, the plasmid-borne P450BM-1 promoter region would have increased the chromosomal P450BM-3 level by titrating out Bm3R1 bound to the operator site near the P450BM-3promoter. These observations imply that Bm3R1 probably regulates P450BM-1 gene expression not by direct binding to the P450BM-1 regulatory region but in an indirect manner. The molecular mechanism(s) for induction of various mammalian cytochrome P450s by phenobarbital (PB) have been the subject of extensive studies. Padmanaban and co-worker (37Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3963-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) first identified by DNase I footprinting analysis a 32-bp region (−88 to −56) upstream of the CYP2B1/CYP2B2 genes critical for mediating PB transcriptional activation. Based on sequence comparisons and in vitro protein binding assays, Fulco and colleagues (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) then identified a sequence (so-called Barbie box) conserved among the B. megaterium P450 genes and the ratCYP2B1/CYB2B2 genes. However, it should be noted that PB treatment reduced binding of the bacterial protein(s) to the Barbie box but increased binding of the mammalian proteins to the same element. This suggests that barbiturate-mediated induction of B. megaterium P450BM-1 may be mechanistically different from induction of mammalian P450s. Although some reports supported the role of the Barbie box in PB responsiveness (39Fournier T. Mejdoubi N. Lapoumeroulie C. Hamelin J. Elion J. Durand G. Porquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27175-27178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), more data argued against a PB-inducible role for the Barbie box (41Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negish M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol.

These discrepancies suggest that the role of the Barbie box in PB-mediated regulation of mammalian P450s and other genes remains questionable. On the other hand, the main mechanism responsible for barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM-3 in B. megaterium has been previously elucidated (6Shaw G.C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Barbiturates can function as inducers to prevent binding of Bm3R1 repressor to its operator site, a 20-bp inverted repeat near the transcription start site of the P450BM-3 gene. The in vivo potency of barbiturates as inducers of P450BM-3 strongly correlates with their ability to inhibit interaction of Bm3R1 with its operator DNA in vitro. However, the mechanism by which barbiturates can moderately induce P450BM-1 remains unresolved. Liang et al. (8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) proposed a role of the Barbie box in the induction of P450BM-1 by pentobarbital. In contrast, our data indicated that deletion of the Barbie box did not markedly affect pentobarbital-mediated induction of P450BM-1. In fact, there are conflicting data presented in previous publications by Lianget al. (7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). They reported that mutation of the Barbie box upstream of the P450BM-1 promoter abolished pentobarbital-mediated induction of CAT activity in B. megaterium bearing a P450BM-1-cattranscription fusion vector (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, gel mobility shift assays showed that both wild-type and mutant Barbie boxes exhibited similar binding activity toward E. colicell-free extract containing overexpressed Bm3R1 (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 8Liang Q. He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholarand Fig. 2 in Ref. 7Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4438-4450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, deletion of a sequence further upstream of the Barbie box resulted in a lower level of induced CAT activity by pentobarbital compared with that after deletion of the Barbie box. These results suggest that the Barbie box located in the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM-1 gene may not be crucial for pentobarbital-mediated induction of P450BM-1. On the other hand, our data have confirmed that the sequence within the Barbie box is indeed important for negative regulation of P450BM-1 gene expression in the absence of pentobarbital. At least two cis-acting elements important for negative regulation of P450BM-1 gene expression have been identified. One is the sequence within the Barbie box upstream of the P450BM-1 gene as mentioned above. The other is the 53-bp inverted repeat located midway between the P450BM-1 gene and the bm1P1 gene (46Shaw G.C. Sung C.C. Liu C.H. Kao H.S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 280-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary data indicated that deletion of the 53-bp inverted repeat had no marked effect on induction of P450BM-1 by pentobarbital (data not shown). We thank Dr. James A. Hoch for providing the plasmid pJH101, and Dr. Charles P. Moran, Jr. for providing the plasmid pLC4. We are also grateful to Dr. Douglas J.

The enzyme normally functions during fermentative growth to regenerate NAD from NADH by reducing the metabolic intermediate l-lactaldehyde to propanediol which is excreted. During aerobic growth l-lactaldehyde is converted to l-lactate and thence to the central metabolite pyruvate. The wasteful excretion of propanediol is minimized by oxidative inactivation of the oxidoreductase, an Fe2+-dependent enzyme which is subject to metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO). Mutants acquiring the ability to grow aerobically on propanediol as sole carbon and energy source can be readily selected. These mutants express the fucO gene constitutively, as a result of an IS5 insertion in the promoter region. In this study we show that continued selection for aerobic growth on propanediol resulted in mutations in the oxidoreductase conferring increased resistance to MCO. In two independent mutants, the resistance of the protein was respectively conferred by an Ile7 → Leu and a Leu8 → Val substitution near the NAD-binding consensus amino acid sequence. A site-directed mutant protein with both substitutions showed an MCO resistance greater than either mutant protein with a single amino acid change. l-1,2-Propanediol:NAD+1-oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli is encoded by the fucO gene, a member of the regulon specifying dissimilation of l-fucose.

Oxidative damage to macromolecules is an inescapable price for the evolution of aerobic metabolism. The co-evolution of protective agents, both catalytic (enzymes such as superoxide dismutases and catalases) and stoichiometric (antioxidants such as glutathione and α-tocopherol), can at best reduce the magnitude of damage. Evolution of active mechanisms of repair apparently is limited only for DNA, probably because of chemical feasibility and strong selective pressure. For other kinds of damaged macromolecules clearing by turnover seems to be the only option. A possible exception is the repair of oxidized methionine residues on the surface of proteins by a specific sulfoxide reductase (1Levine R.L. Mosoni L. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15036-15040Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The replacement strategy seems satisfactory for the perpetuation of unicellular organisms, although it is not always available or adequate for multicellular organisms. For instance, accumulation of oxidatively damaged proteins is often associated with senescence and various disease states (2Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 3Stadtman E.R. Esser K. Martin G.M. Molecular Aspects of Aging.

A significant fraction of protein damages is thought to result from the metal-catalyzed oxidation system (MCO) 1The abbreviations used are: MCO, metal catalyzed oxidation; kb, kilobase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: MCO, metal catalyzed oxidation; kb, kilobase pair(s). mediated by reactive species such as hydrogen peroxide, as outlined in Reactions 1 (2Stadtman E.R.

Cationic iron is maintained in the ferrous state by reducing compounds, such as NADH or NADPH. The presence of H2O2 and Fe2+ generates, by the Fenton reaction, a highly reactive HO⋅ (hydroxyl radical) which can covalently attack an amino acid residue. When the iron is bound to a protein, the H2O2-dependent redox cycling of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is thought to proceed in a “cage,” thus allowing the hydroxyl radical to extract an H atom from a local amino acid residue, before diffusing into the surrounding medium (6Fucci L.

Such a model would account for the limited number of amino acid residues that are susceptible to the damage, with each protein exhibiting a distinctive target signature of residues. The model is also supported by the evidence of substrate protection against oxidative damage (6Fucci L. Oliver C.N. Coon M.J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 8Szweda L. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3096-3100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stadtman E.R.

Although Arg, Cys, His, Lys, Met, and Pro residues are most susceptible to metal-catalyzed destruction, only the oxidation of Arg, Pro, His, and Lys has been reported to result in the formation of a carbonyl derivative which provides a means for monitoring the protein oxidation process (2Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 11Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 307-342Google Scholar). This enzyme, inducible by either of the methyl pentoses, is inactivated during aerobic growth (9Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cabiscol E. Hidalgo E. Badia J. Baldoma L. Ros J. Aguilar J. J.

Acta. 1992; 1118: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study we tried to find out whether repeated selection of mutants that utilize this enzyme exclusively as a dehydrogenase for aerobic growth, on propanediol as the sole carbon and energy source, would result in an altered protein resistant to oxidative inactivation. The oligonucleotide primers 5′-CGGATCCGGCATTATCACATCAG and 5′-CGAATTCAAGAGTAATTTCGTAAAGC flanking the coding region of fucO (15Chen Y.-M. Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6097-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Conway T. Ingram L.O. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3754-3759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized and used to amplify by polymerase chain reaction the gene of each strain. A sample of each amplified product was digested with restriction enzymes to give five overlapping fragments that were then subcloned into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each of these fragments was sequenced for both strands with the T3 and T7 primers (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by the dideoxy method. Cells with deletions in the fuc locus were selected from strain ECL330 bearing a fuc::Mu d1-ampr insertion by growth at a nonpermissive temperature (42 °C) that allows the growth of only Mu dl− cells. Clones with a Mu dl− Amps Fuc−phenotype were identified by growth at 42 °C on MacConkey/fucose medium and then purified by growing at 37 °C on the same medium. The deletion ranges in these cells were screened by Southern blots probed with a set of fuc fragments spanning the entire region of the fuc regulon (17Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A strain completely deleted in the fuc regulon was thus identified and designated as ECL733. Cells of the Δfuc strain ECL733 were used as hosts for introducing by λ vectors single copies of the fuc regulon, each bearing a distinctive fucO allele. Detailed procedures are described below. the fucO Ile-7→Leu and fucO Leu-8→Val mutations were regenerated by site-directed mutagenesis (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) of the wild-type sequence. AfucO allele with the above two mutations combined,fucO Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val, was created in parallel. A 5-kb SalIo-BamHI fragment cut from pfuc16 (19Chen Y.-M. Zhu Y. Lin E.C.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) containing the wild-type fucO allele was subcloned into an M13 mp18 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the DNA was used to transfect CJ236 cells (Bio-Rad). Single-stranded M13 DNA was then prepared from the cells, hybridized to the oligonucleotide primers containing the desired point mutations (ordered from Oligos Etc., Inc., Guilford, CT), and used as template for synthesizing the second DNA strand. The duplex products were used to transfect XL1 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A plaque from each transfection was purified, and a fucO fragment in the phage DNA was sequenced to confirm the nucleotide substitution(s). The phage DNA containing the mutated fucO alleles was respectively designated φFM5/O Ile-7→Leu, φFM5/O Leu-8→Val, and φFM5/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val. As shown in Fig. 1, a modified pBluescript plasmid was used as an intermediary shuffling vector for carrying fuc sequences onto λ vector. The modification was made by inserting a cam r gene cut from a pBC KS+ plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) into the pBluescript polylinker region, to place the cloned fucsequence close to a selectable marker for subsequent insertion into the chromosome via λ vectors (see below). The resulting plasmid was designated pBB. The wild-type fuc regulon (about 9 kb) was cloned into pBB in a two-step procedure as follows: step 1, an approximately 8-kb fuc fragmentPvuII-SalI1 was cut from pfuc1 containing the entire fuc regulon (19Chen Y.-M. Zhu Y. Lin E.C.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 210: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and inserted into pBB; and step 2, the remaining 1-kb fuc fragment Sa1I1-Sa1I2 was appended to the insertion by substituting the EcoRI-SalI1 fragment in the first insertion with the EcoRI-SalI2 fragment cut from pfuc1. The resulting plasmid was designated pFB1. For the propagation of various plasmids, XL1 cells were used. The mutant fuc regulons were cloned into the shuffling vector by substituting the wild-type fucOsequence in pFB1 with the mutated counterparts. This procedure was carried out in eight steps, illustrated in a condensed manner in Fig.2. Step 1: a pBC KS+ plasmid was modified by destroying the single PvuI restriction site with the Klenow enzyme and ligase, resulting in a second shuffling vector pBC* (not shown). Step 2: a 7-kb fucfragment SalI0-EcoRI was cut from pfuc16 and inserted into pBC*, resulting in pFC1. Step 3: a 2.2-kb fragment BamHI-BamHIlinker was deleted from pFC1 to eliminate a PstI site in the pBC polylinker region, resulting in pFC2 (not shown). Step 4: the 0.5-kbfuc0 fragment PstI-PvuI in pFC2 was cut off and substituted with a corresponding fragment bearing one of the fucO mutations cut from φFM5/O Ile-7→Leu, φFM5/O Leu-8→Val, or φFM5/ O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val, resulting in pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, pFC2/O Leu-8→Val, or pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val (not shown). Step 5: the PstI-PvuI fragments in pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, pFC2/O Leu-8→Val, and pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val were sequenced to confirm the correct substitutions. Step 6: the BamHI-BamHIlinker fragment from pFC1 was inserted back into pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, pFC2/O Leu-8→Val, and pFC2/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val, resulting in plasmids pFC1/O Ile-7→Leu, pFC1/O Leu-8→Val, and pFC1/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val. Step 7: the 5-kb fuc fragment PstI-EcoRI in pFB1 was cut off and substituted with a corresponding fragment cut from pFC1/O Ile-7→Leu, pFC1/ O Leu-8→Val, or pFC1/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val, resulting in pFB1/O Ile-7→Leu, pFB1/O Leu-8→Val, or pFB1/O Ile7-→Leu, Leu-8→Val, plasmid bearing full-length fuc regulon. Step 8: the PstI-PvuI fragments in pFB1/O Ile-7→Leu, pFB1/O Leu-8→Val, and pFB1/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val were sequenced to confirm the correct fucO mutation status. The plasmids pFB1, pFB1/O Ile-7→Leu, pFB1/O Leu-8→Val, and pFB1/O Ile-7→Leu, Leu8→Val were digested with restriction enzymes ApaI and XbaI, yielding 11-kb fragments each containing a full-length fuc regulon and the cam r gene. These fragments were then ligated with wild-type λ DNA cut with the same enzymes. The ligation mixtures were packaged with the Gigapack Gold Lambda packaging extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and used to infect the Δfucstrain ECL733. Cells bearing the foreign sequences on the chromosome were selected as λ lysogens growing on chloramphenicol and MacConkey/fucose plates. Single copy fuc regulon insertions were confirmed by Southern blots probed with fuc fragments at both ends of the fuc sequence. The strains bearing the wild-type and mutant fuc regulons at the att site are designated ECL734, ECL735, ECL736, and ECL737. Cells were grown aerobically as described previously (20Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on Luria broth or 0.5% casein acid hydrolysate. Anaerobic cultures were grown as described previously (20Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 1% casein acid hydrolysate supplemented with 1 mm pyruvate. Where indicated, l-fucose was added as inducer at 10 mm concentration for aerobic growth and 20 mm for anaerobic growth. For enzyme assays, cells were harvested at the end of the exponential phase, and cell extracts were prepared as described previously (20Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. For enzyme purification, the extracts were prepared using a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 mm NAD. Propanediol oxidoreductase was purified from extracts of cells grown anaerobically in Luria broth plusl-fucose by the method of Cabiscol et al. (9Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme purity was assessed by electrophoresis performed according to Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) using 10% acrylamide as resolving gel. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Propanediol oxidoreductase was routinely assayed by its NADH-dependent glycolaldehyde reduction to ethylene glycol (22Boronat A. Caballero E. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 134-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolaldehyde, readily available commercially, was shown to be an alternative substrate for the enzyme (23Caballero E. Baldoma L. Ros J. Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7788-7792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments testing enzyme protection by NAD or propanediol, the enzyme was assayed by NAD-dependent propanediol dehydrogenation (20Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 320-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Immuno-quantification of propanediol oxidoreductase protein was carried out by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis (25Laurell C.B. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 15: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar) according to a calibration curve (not shown) derived by using the propanediol oxidoreductase purified from strain ECL1. Antibodies were obtained as described (26Boronat A. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 181-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of purified propanediol oxidoreductases (0.5 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 were kept at 4 °C. At time 0, 0.5 ml of each solution was transferred to tubes preincubated at different temperatures, with or without supplementation with 50 mmdl-1,2-propanediol or 1 mm NAD. Enzyme activities were assayed at various intervals. Thermal stability of the enzyme in crude extract (0.5-ml samples containing 8 mg/ml of total protein) was tested under similar conditions. Purified propanediol oxidoreductases (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at 20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 0.5 mm NADH. Enzyme activities were assayed at various intervals. Purified propanediol oxidoreductases (0.5 mg/ml) were preincubated at 20 °C for 5 min with 50 mm1,2-propanediol, followed by addition of 15 μmFeCl3 and 30 mm ascorbate according to Levineet al. (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were assayed at various intervals. Dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization of protein carbonyl groups resulting from oxidation was performed according to Levine et al. (28Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed using 10% acrylamide as resolving gel. After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by semi-dry blotting. Immuno-detection of protein-bound dinitrophenylhydrazones was performed according to Levine et al. (27Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). The primary antibody was a polyclonal rabbit preparation (Dako, V0401, Denmark). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Atomic absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted with a Jobin-Yvon spectrometer, JY-38. Samples were submitted to high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration in a Protein Pak 125 (Waters) prior to metal analysis to eliminate reagents and metals not bound to the enzyme. The eluent used was MilliQ water (resistivity greater that 18 MΩ). Fractions were collected in metal-free polypropylene tubes. Absorption spectra and their fourth derivative were taken on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer, using a derivative interval of 2.4 nm, a slit width of 2 nm, and a scan rate of 80 nm/min. Purified enzymes were dissolved in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Propanediol oxidoreductase is encoded by the fucO gene, a member of the fuc regulon specifying the utilization of l-fucose. The genes of the fuc regulon are organized in two divergent operons,fucPIK and fucAO (Fig.3). Induction of the operons requires the activator FucR (17Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Skjold A.C. Ezekiel D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 521-523PubMed Google Scholar) and its effector,l-fuculose-1-phosphate (30Bartkus J.M. Mortlock R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 710-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-1,2-Propanediol, a product of l-fucose fermentation, cannot serve aerobically as a sole carbon and energy source, because the 3-carbon compound fails to induce the fuc regulon expression. IffucO is expressed constitutively at an adequate level, the cell should be able to grow on propanediol by converting it to pyruvate via l-lactaldehyde and l-lactate (Fig. 3). Mutants as described above were actually isolated and previously reported. Strain ECL3 was isolated from wild-type strain ECL1 after 100 generations of selection on propanediol, attaining a doubling time of about 90 min (31Sridhara S. Wu T.T. Chused M. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 93: 87-95Crossref Google Scholar). Strain ECL421 was isolated from another wild-type clone after a similar selection for 140 doublings (32Hacking A.J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 832-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both mutants, an IS5 insertion occurred at precisely the same location in the region between the two diverging operons, causing constitutive activation of fucAO and noninducibility of fucPIK(15Chen Y.-M. Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6097-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hacking A.J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2Z. Lu, unpublished observations. Since strains ECL3 and ECL421 were isolated after prolonged selection on propanediol, mutations in the coding region of fucOconferring resistance to oxidative damage might also have taken place. Indeed, it was found that the ECL3 enzyme exhibited a decreased thermal stability (34Boronat A. Aguilar J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 672: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine the exact nature of the mutations and their phenotypic consequences, the fucO alleles of the wild-type and the two mutant strains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction for gene cloning and sequencing. For comparison, the fucO alleles of three other derivative strains were included in the procedure as follows: ECL430, selected from ECL3 for improved propanediol-scavenging power (35Hacking A.J. Aguilar J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 522-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); ECL56, a Fuc+ revertant of ECL3 generated by an unlinked mutation (33Hacking A.J. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhu Y. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2352-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and ECL459, the corresponding Fuc+ revertant of ECL421 (15Chen Y.-M. Lu Z. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6097-6105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single nucleotide substitution, an A to C change converting the N-terminal Ile7 to Leu7, was found in the fucOof strains ECL3, ECL56, and ECL430. Another single nucleotide substitution, a C to G change converting the N-terminal Leu8 to Val8, was found in the fucOof strains ECL421 and ECL459 (data not shown). To find out whether the two different singlefucO mutations conferred resistance of the enzyme to aerobic inactivation, we tested plasmid-borne wild-type and mutantfucO alleles in a standard wild-type background. Preliminary activity assays of the oxidoreductase were not satisfactorily reproducible. The difficulty seems to be attributable to variations in the plasmid copy number. To improve the reproducibility of enzyme activity assays, we decided to use strain ECL733 with a complete deletion of the fucregulon to host a λ-borne fuc regulon with one of the fucO alleles. First, each of the two fucOmutations was re-created by site-directed mutagenesis in a wild-typefuc sequence to ensure that the mutation detected was sufficient to account for any observable phenotypic difference. In addition, a double mutation, Ile7 → Leu and Leu8 → Val, was created in parallel to discover whether there is an additive effect of the single mutations. A completefuc regulon was then engineered to bear the wild-typefucO or one of the re-created mutant fucOalleles, inserted into λ DNA, and packaged in vitro to infect the Δfuc strain ECL733. The purified λ lysogens were used for further study. The λ lysogens ECL734 (fucO +), ECL735 (fucO Ile-7→Leu), ECL736 (fucO Leu-8→Val), and ECL737 (fucO Ile-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val) and the wild-type nonlysogen, ECL1, were grown aerobically or anaerobically on casein acid hydrolysate in the presence of l-fucose as inducer of the fuc regulon. Extracts from each culture were assayed for propanediol oxidoreductase activity (Table I). The specific activities of propanediol oxidoreductase (units/mg enzyme protein) in extracts of anaerobically grown cells were all about the same, irrespective of the nature of the fuc allele. In contrast, the specific activity of the enzyme in extracts of aerobically grown cells was dependent on the fucO allele: FucO+ < FucOIle-7→Leu < FucOLeu-8→Val < FucOIle-7→Leu, Leu-8→Val. It should be mentioned that if the inducer was not added, there was no detectable oxidoreductase activity in extracts prepared from the different strains, even when the cells were grown anaerobically (not shown), indicating that transcriptions were from the same fuc promoter. The data taken together indicate that a single amino acid substitution was sufficient to confer significant resistance of the protein to oxidative damage and that the double amino acid substitutions have an additive protective effect. On the other hand, the amino acid substitutions do not appear to have a significant effect on the catalytic property of the enzymes, at least when assayed by the reduction of the substrate analog glycolaldehyde (Table II).Table IBacterial strains, plasmids, and phages used in this studyCell or plasmidDerived fromRelevant property/genotypeRef./SourceStrains ECL1HfrCHfrC phoA8 relA1 tonA22 T2r (λ)76Lin E.C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2080905952,"Functional and structural significance of the “module” in proteins has been investigated for globin proteins. Our previous studies have revealed that some modules in globins are responsible for regulating the subunit association and heme environmental structures, whereas the module substitution often induces fatal structural destabilization, resulting in failure of functional regulation. In this paper, to gain further insight into functional and structural significance of the modular structure in globins, we focused upon the “pseudo-module” in globin structure where boundaries are located at the center of modules. Although the pseudo-module has been supposed not to retain a compactness, the βα(PM3)-subunit, in which one of the pseudo-modules, the F1-H6 region, of the α-subunit is implanted into the β-subunit, conserved stable globin structure, and its association property was converted into that of the α-subunit, as the case for the module substituted globin, the βα(M4)-subunit. These results suggest that modules are not unique structural and functional units for globins. Interestingly, however, the recent reconsideration of the module boundary indicates that the modules in globins can be further divided into two small modules, and one of the boundaries for the new small modules coincides with that of the pseudo-module we substituted in this study. Although it would be premature to conclude the significance of the modular structure in globins, it can be safely said that we have found new structural units in globin structure, probably new modules.

Although it would be premature to conclude the significance of the modular structure in globins, it can be safely said that we have found new structural units in globin structure, probably new modules. Recent structural studies of proteins have revealed that many protein structures are constructed by the compact structural unit, “modules,” which correspond to the exons on the gene structure (1Go M. Nature. 1981; 291: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar,2Go M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1964-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The gene of globin is made up of three exons interrupted by two introns, and exons 1–3 correspond to the modules M1, M2 + M3, and M4, respectively. The correlation of globin structure and function with its modular structure was exemplified by the observation that specific functions of globins are attributed to the specific modules (3Eaton W.A. Nature. 1980; 284: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As found in Fig. 1 A, the amino acid residues associated with the heme contacts and the α1–β2 contacts are concentrated in module M2 + M3, whereas the α1–β1 contact cluster is located in module M4. To gain insights into the structural and functional significance of the module in globins, we have prepared a variety of the module substituted globins (4Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Inaba K. Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Konno T. Kataoka M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30054-30060Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Wakasugi K. Inaba K. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 68: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The module M4 substituted hemoglobin β-subunit (βα(M4)-subunit), in which the module M4 was replaced by that of the α-subunit, exhibited the native β-subunit-like heme environmental structure, while it preferentially associated with the native β-subunit and not with the α-subunit (4Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the module substitution can convert the association property of the hemoglobin subunit without substantial structural changes in the heme vicinity, suggesting that the module is a structural and functional unit (4Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the counterpart chimeric globin, the αβ(M4)-subunit, of which module M4 was derived from that of the β-subunit, was quite unstable, and the association property was not affected by the module substitution (5Inaba K. Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Konno T. Kataoka M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30054-30060Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Such destabilization in globin structure was also encountered for other module substituted globins (6Wakasugi K. Inaba K. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 68: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which leads us to reconsider the structural and functional significance of the modular structures in globins and examine effects of “non-module substitution” on globin structure and function to compare with those of the module substitution. In the present study, we have focused upon the “pseudo-module” in globin structure. The pseudo-module is defined as a segment starting at the center of one module and ending at the center of the adjacent module (Fig. 1 A) and is supposed not to form a compact structural unit (7Noguti T. Sakakibara H. Go M. Proteins. 1993; 16: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since the pseudo-modules do not statistically coincide with exons (8Go M. Noguti T. Go M. Scimmel P. Tracing Biological Evolution in Protein and Gene Structures. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 229-235Google Scholar), they would have neither evolutionary nor functional meanings (9Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 271: 501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 10Blake C.C.F. Nature. 1979; 277: 598Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Herewith, we have prepared a pseudo-module substituted globin, the βα(PM3)-subunit, as illustrated in Fig.2 and compared its structural and functional properties with those of the corresponding stable module substituted globin, βα(M4)-subunit. We are concerned here with the effects of the pseudo-module substitution on the globin structure. Furthermore, we have paid attention to the association property of the chimeric globins, since the amino acid residues contributing to the α1–β1 contact are concentrated in the pseudo-module PM3 as well as in the module M4 (Fig. 1 A). The heme environmental structure and oxygen affinity for the chimeric globin have been also examined by using various spectroscopic methods to describe the functional and structural effects of the pseudo-module substitution in globins. The expression vectors of the βα(M4)- and βα(PM3)-subunits were constructed as illustrated in Fig. 2. The N-terminal valine residue was replaced by a methionine to initiate the peptide elongation for the module and pseudo-module substituted subunits. To obtain the genes of the βα(PM3)-subunit, KpnI (GGTACC) and MluI sites (ACGCGT) were introduced at the start and end of the PM3, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction with silent mutation. All of the module and pseudo-module substituted subunits were purified as previously reported for recombinant Hb (4Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nagai K. Thøgerson H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 12Nagai K. Perutz M.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We confirmed the correct expression of the desired subunits by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (data not shown) (14Wada Y. Fujita T. Hayashi A. Sakurai T. Matsuo T. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 563-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and no additional mutations were detected. We also synthesized “wild-type” β-subunit 1Wild-type subunit represents the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, and a methionine residue is located at the N-terminal. Native subunit corresponds to the protein purified from human red blood cells. In the wild-type β-subunit, we confirmed that the mutation of Val to Met does not seriously perturb the globular structure and heme environmental structure of the β-subunit. The CD and NMR spectra for the wild-type β-subunit were virtually the same as those of the native β-subunit. that has a methionine residue at the N-terminal instead of the valine residue as a reference and confirmed that the structural properties of the wild-type β-subunit are virtually the same as those of “native” β-subunit isolated from human red blood cells. CD spectra of the cyano-met subunits in far UV region were measured with Jasco J-760. Concentration of the samples was 5 μm, and the light path of the cell was 1 mm. The buffer used in the measurements was 20 mmsodium phosphate containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mmNaCN, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Reaction solutions contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm NaCN, and various concentrations of urea. Sample concentration was 5 μm. The ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored by Jasco J-760 CD spectrometer after ∼10 h equilibration at room temperature. Cyano-met derivatives are used for the measurements to avoid aggregation of heme and reduce the irreversible denaturation 2We have also tried to carry out the urea denaturation experiment in the absence of the heme group. However, the apo-chimeric βα(PM3)- and βα(M4)-subunits are extremely unstable to aggregate under the following conditions: pH 7.4, urea concentration of below 2 m, sample concentration of 5 μm. Therefore, we cannot exactly measure molar ellipticity at 222 nm and estimate equilibrium stability for the apo-globins. (15Konno T. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The fractional denatured population (fD) for various urea concentrations was estimated by Equation 1. fD=([θ]222N−[θ]222)/([θ]222N−[θ]222D)Equation 1 where [θ]222, N, [θ]222, D, and [θ]222 represent ellipticities at 222 nm in the native (N) and denatured (D) states and in each urea concentration, respectively. The free energy of denaturation, ΔG, was calculated by Equation 2 (15Konno T. Morishima I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). ΔG=−RT ln(fD/(1−fD))Equation 2 When ΔG varied linearly with urea concentration, [urea], ΔGH2O, extrapolated ΔG at [urea] = 0, can be estimated by the following equation: ΔG=ΔGH2O−murea[urea]Equation 3 where murea is the slope of the linear relation between ΔG and [urea]. Gel filtration measurements were performed by using a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (0.8 × 62 cm) at 4 °C. The buffer used for the chromatography was 50 mm Tris, in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mmNa2EDTA, pH 7.4, and the flow rate was 7 ml/h. The eluted fractions were monitored by absorption at the Soret band (16Ishimori K. Hashimoto M. Imai K. Fushitani K. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Wada Y. Morishima I.

Dimer-tetramer dissociation constant of the samples was determined by concentration dependence of the centroid elution volume over the range from 0.5 to 200 μm (16Ishimori K. Hashimoto M. Imai K.

Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following functional dependence of the elution volume (Ve)versus protein concentration (CT) allows us to determine the dimer-tetramer equilibrium constants for the samples (16Ishimori K. Hashimoto M. Imai K. Fushitani K. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Wada Y. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), see Equation 4. Ve=∑jVj(mj)/CTEquation 4 where Vj is the elution volume for the individual species pertaining to the various aggregates (j-mers), and the (mj) term represents molar concentrations for the respective species. 1H NMR spectra at 500 MHz were recorded on Bruker Avance DRX 500. We used a WaterGate pulse sequence for the diamagnetic region to minimize the water signal in the sample. For the measurements of the hyperfine-shifted proton resonances, we utilized a LOSAT pulse sequence. The probe temperature was controlled at 290 ± 0.5 K by a temperature control unit of the spectrometer. The volume of the NMR sample was 500 μl, and the concentration was 600 μm on the heme basis. Proton shifts were referenced with respect to the proton resonance of 2,2,-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Oxygen equilibrium curves were measured by using an improved version (18Imai K.

The temperature of the sample in the oxygenation cell was constant within ±0.05 °C. The hemoglobin reductase system (21Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys.

To minimize the autoxidation of the sample during the measurements, catalase and superoxide dismutase were added to the sample, and the concentration was 0.1 μm (22Lynch R.E. Lee R. Cartwright G.E.

The oxygenation data were acquired by use of a micro-computer (model PC-98XA, Nippon Electric Co., Tokyo), which was interfaced to the oxygenation apparatus (24Imai K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 559-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As reported by our previous studies (5Inaba K. Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Konno T. Kataoka M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30054-30060Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Wakasugi K. Inaba K. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 68: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the module substitutions often induced severe destabilization in globin structure, which is characterized by the prominent decrease of the negative ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm in the CD spectra (5Inaba K. Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Konno T. Kataoka M. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30054-30060Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, however, the pseudo-module substituted globin, βα(PM3)-subunit, exhibits two broad and large negative peaks around 222 and 208 nm characteristic of the α-helical structure. These negative peaks were also observed for the module substituted βα(M4)-subunit and native hemoglobin (25Beychok S. Tyuma I. Benesch R.E. Benesch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2460-2462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the secondary structure for the β-subunit is almost insensitive to the substitution of the pseudo-module PM3 as the case for the M4 substitution. Alterations in equilibrium stability upon the module and pseudo-module substitutions were quantified by the urea-induced denaturation experiment. As clearly delineated in Fig.4 A, the transition curve for the urea denaturation in the βα(PM3)-subunit is quite similar to that for the native β-subunit, indicating that the globular structure of the βα(PM3)-subunit is as stable as that of the native β-subunit. For the βα(M4)-subunit, the denaturation curve was shifted to the right side from that of the β-subunit and almost superimposed on that of tetrameric native hemoglobin. In Fig.4 B, the free energy of denaturation (ΔG) was plotted against urea concentrations, and a linear fitting procedure using Equation 3 determined the extrapolated ΔG in the absence of urea, ΔGH2O, and the slope of the linear relation (i.e. dΔG/d[urea]), murea (TableI). Although the substitution of the module M4 increases ΔGH2O by about 25 kJ/mol and murea by 2.3 kJ/mol per m(m, urea concentration), the corresponding parameters for the substitution of the pseudo-module PM3 are almost unchanged from those for the β-subunit. The effects of the pseudo-module PM3 substitution on the protein stability of the β-subunit are minimal, compared with those of the module M4.Table IParameters of urea denaturation for tetrameric Hb, isolated α-, β-, βα(PM3)-, and βα(M4)-subunitsΔGH2OmureakJ/molkJ/mol per mHb37.87.54α20.25.22β17.86.65βα(PM3)20.36.52βα(M4)43.18.91 Open table in a new tab However, the association property of the pseudo-module substituted globin, βα(PM3)-subunit, clearly differs from that of the wild-type β-subunit. Fig.5 A illustrates gel chromatogram of the carbonmonoxy chimeric globins in the presence and absence of the native subunits, and the centroid elution volumes of the samples as a function of protein concentration (16Ishimori K.

Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 5 B. Under the condition employed here, the mixture of native α- and β-subunits forms a tetramer, whereas the isolated α-subunit remains in a monomer (17Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type β-subunit is in the equilibrium between monomers and tetramers (17Valdes Jr., R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the elution peak for the βα(PM3)-subunit is also between those of a tetramer and a monomer, but the peak position at 22.5 ml was significantly deviated from that of the wild-type β-subunit at 22.0 ml. Since this elution peak was independent of the sample concentration from 5 to 80 μm (Fig. 5 B), the βα(PM3)-subunit forms a stable homodimer, not an equilibrium state between tetramers and dimers or monomers. In the chromatogram for the mixture of the βα(PM3)- and α-subunits, two peaks were observed, each of which coincides with the peak for the isolated βα(PM3)- and α-subunits, indicating no association of the βα(PM3)-subunit with the α-subunit. On the other hand, the peak for the mixture of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits showed a single broad peak, and the elution pattern for the mixture was not a simple addition of those of the corresponding isolated subunits. These elution patterns imply that the βα(PM3)-subunit preferentially binds to the β-subunit, not to the α-subunit, and the association property of the βα(PM3)-subunit corresponds to that of the α-subunit as the case for the βα(M4)-subunit (4Wakasugi K. Ishimori K. Imai K. Wada Y. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18750-18756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted here that the elution peak for the mixture was detected at the middle of those for tetrameric native Hb A and dimeric βα(PM3)-subunits, suggesting that the complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits is in the equilibrium between a heterodimer [βα(PM3)]β and a heterotetramer [βα(PM3)2]β2. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the elution peak for the mixture of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits depends on the protein concentration, and the fitting curve of the mixture shifts to the right side, compared with that of native hemoglobin tetramer, indicating that the dissociation into dimers was enhanced in the complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits. The tetramer-dimer dissociation constants, KD, were estimated as 1.4 (16Ishimori K. Hashimoto M. Imai K. Fushitani K. Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Wada Y. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and 11 μm for Hb A and the complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits, respectively. To gain further insights into the subunit interface structure for the pseudo-module substituted globins and its complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits, we have measured the 1H NMR spectra in the hydrogen-bonded proton region for the carbonmonoxy and deoxy forms (Fig.6, A and B). Although no exchangeable proton signals were observed in the downfield region from 10 to 15 ppm for the isolated carbonmonoxy β-subunits, a broad proton signal at 12.4 ppm was detected for the βα(PM3)-subunit. This peak disappeared in 100% D2O (data not shown). Such an exchangeable proton signal in the downfield region was also encountered for carbonmonoxy Hb A, which has been assigned to the hydrogen bonds in the subunit interface (26Asakura T. Adachi K.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, the resonance at 12.4 ppm can be assignable to the hydrogen bond at the subunit interfaces of the homodimer, [βα(PM3)]2. In the presence of the native β-subunit, another exchangeable proton resonance appeared at 10.4 ppm (Fig. 6 A), which would also originate from a hydrogen-bonded proton in the subunit interface of the complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits. Structural alterations in the subunit interface by the pseudo-module substitution are also evident in the NMR spectra of the deoxygenated state of the chimeric globin. By the dissociation of the ligands from Hb A, the rearrangements in the α1–β2 subunit interface are induced (29Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar), which is reflected in the NMR spectra in the downfield region. For deoxy-Hb A, the characteristic T-state marker resonances were observed at 13.9 and 11.0 ppm (Fig. 6 B) (27Fung L.W.M. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Ishimori K. Imai K. Miyazaki G. Kitagawa T. Wada Y. Morimoto H. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3256-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas in the βα(PM3)-subunit, these marker signals were not detected and a new peak appeared at 11.3 ppm by deoxygenation. Although the appearance of the resonance at 11.3 ppm by deoxygenation suggests the rearrangements in the hydrogen bonds at the subunit interface in the pseudo-module substituted globin, its spectral pattern is quite different from that of hemoglobin. In addition to the resonance peaks at 11.4 and 12.4 ppm, the complex of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits in the deoxy state exhibited an exchangeable proton signal at 10.7 ppm (Fig. 6 B), which was not observed for the isolated deoxygenated subunits. The spectral features for the complex are still quite different between the carbonmonoxy and deoxy states, but the resonance positions for the complex are not identical with those for hemoglobin. This implies that the quaternary structural changes accompanied by deoxygenation for the complex would not fully correspond to those for native Hb A. The structural perturbation was also manifested in the heme environmental structure, as revealed by1H NMR spectra of the carbonmonoxy and deoxy form of the chimeric globins (Figs. 7 and8). In the carbonmonoxy isolated subunits, a peak from the γ1-methyl proton of Val(E11) appeared at −2.0 and −2.2 ppm for the α- and β-subunit, respectively, which has served as a marker for the tertiary structure in the heme vicinity (31Lindstrom T.R. Nore I.B.E. Charashe S. Lehmann H. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Dalvit C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The corresponding signal for the βα(PM3)-subunit was detected at the same position as that of the native β-subunit, implying that the heme environmental structure near Val(E11) residue was not so perturbed by the pseudo-module substitution (33Shulman R.G. Wuthrich K. Yamane T. Patel D. Blumberg W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the resonance peak for the βα(PM3)-subunit is significantly broadened and asymmetric, 3We confirmed the homogeneity of the purified βα(PM3)-subunit by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thus, the spectral change would not be due to inhomogeneous preparation. suggesting conformational changes in the heme vicinity upon the pseudo-module substitution. Such conformational changes in the heme distal site are supported by the spectral changes in the spectrum between −0.5 and −1.4 ppm.Figure 8Proton NMR spectra (500 MHz) for deoxygenated subunits.

The association of the βα(PM3)- and β-subunits would not affect the heme distal structure of the counterpart subunit, which is in sharp contrast to the complex formation of the native α- and β-subunits. Fig. 8 shows the 1H NMR spectra for the deoxy state of the chimeric and native globins. In the NMR spectra of the isolated native α- and wild-type β-subunits, a hyperfine-shifted exchangeable proton resonance was observed at 78 and 88 ppm in the far downfield hyperfine-shifted region (Fig. 8 I), respectively, which had been assigned to the Nδ-H proton of the proximal histidine (F8) (34Takahashi S. Lin A.K.-L.C. Ho C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5196-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Nagai K. La Mar G.N. Jue T. Bunn H.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A couple of hyperfine-shifted resonances in the region between 12 and 28 ppm (Fig. 8 II) originated from the protons of heme peripheral groups including heme methyl groups (36Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By the substitution of the pseudo-module PM3 in the β-subunit, the resonance position of the proximal Nδ-H proton was obviously shifted to the position for the α-subunit. The spectral pattern for the resonances of the heme peripheral group is also highly perturbed by the substitution of the pseudo-module PM3. These prominent spectral changes suggest that the substitution of the pseudo-module PM3 alters the heme proximal structure of the β-subunit and converts the coordination structure of the β-subunit into that of the α-subunit. On the other hand, the substitution of the module M4 induced a much smaller upfield shift for the resonance of the proximal histidine Nδ-H, 4The line width for the resonance from the βα(M4)-subunit was broad compared with the one for other globins (51Johnson M.E. Fung L.W. Ho C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 1245-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such a line broadening was also observed for the native isolated subunit in high pH region due to the enhanced exchange rate of the Nδ-H of the proximal histidine (52La Mar G.N. Jue T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the reasons for the line broadening in the chimeric globin are not yet clear, some structural changes around the proximal histidine induced by the module substitution might affect the exchange rate of the Nδ-H of the proximal His. although the spectral pattern for the heme peripheral groups are rather close to that of the pseudo-module substituted subunit. In addition to the isolated native and chimeric subunits, we have measured the NMR spectra for the complex of the β"
