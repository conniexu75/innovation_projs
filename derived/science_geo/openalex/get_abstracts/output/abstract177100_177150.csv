https://openalex.org/W2088092325,"Many cortical structures have elevated firing rates during working memory, but it is not known how the activity is maintained. To investigate whether reverberating activity is important, we studied the temporal structure of local field potential (LFP) activity and spiking from area LIP in two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using spectral analysis, we found spatially tuned elevated power in the gamma band (25-90 Hz) in LFP and spiking activity during the memory period. Spiking and LFP activity were also coherent in the gamma band but not at lower frequencies. Finally, we decoded LFP activity on a single-trial basis and found that LFP activity in parietal cortex discriminated between preferred and anti-preferred direction with approximately the same accuracy as the spike rate and predicted the time of a planned movement with better accuracy than the spike rate. This finding could accelerate the development of a cortical neural prosthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1971318940,"Connective-tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein implicated in multiple cellular events including angiogenesis, skeletogenesis and wound healing. It is a member of the CCN family of secreted proteins, named after CTGF, cysteine-rich 61 (CYR61), and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) proteins. The molecular mechanism by which CTGF or other CCN proteins regulate cell signalling is not known. CTGF contains a cysteine-rich domain (CR) similar to those found in chordin and other secreted proteins, which in some cases have been reported to function as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-beta binding domains. Here we show that CTGF directly binds BMP4 and TGF-beta 1 through its CR domain. CTGF can antagonize BMP4 activity by preventing its binding to BMP receptors and has the opposite effect, enhancement of receptor binding, on TGF-beta 1. These results show that CTGF inhibits BMP and activates TGF-beta signals by direct binding in the extracellular space."

https://openalex.org/W1995028739,"We have used airborne laser altimetry to estimate volume changes of 67 glaciers in Alaska from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s. The average rate of thickness change of these glaciers was -0.52 m/year. Extrapolation to all glaciers in Alaska yields an estimated total annual volume change of -52 +/- 15 km3/year (water equivalent), equivalent to a rise in sea level (SLE) of 0.14 +/- 0.04 mm/year. Repeat measurements of 28 glaciers from the mid-1990s to 2000-2001 suggest an increased average rate of thinning, -1.8 m/year. This leads to an extrapolated annual volume loss from Alaska glaciers equal to -96 +/- 35 km3/year, or 0.27 +/- 0.10 mm/year SLE, during the past decade. These recent losses are nearly double the estimated annual loss from the entire Greenland Ice Sheet during the same time period and are much higher than previously published loss estimates for Alaska glaciers. They form the largest glaciological contribution to rising sea level yet measured."

https://openalex.org/W2020506534,"Transcription is a slow and expensive process: in eukaryotes, approximately 20 nucleotides can be transcribed per second at the expense of at least two ATP molecules per nucleotide. Thus, at least for highly expressed genes, transcription of long introns, which are particularly common in mammals, is costly. Using data on the expression of genes that encode proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens, we show that introns in highly expressed genes are substantially shorter than those in genes that are expressed at low levels. This difference is greater in humans, such that introns are, on average, 14 times shorter in highly expressed genes than in genes with low expression, whereas in C. elegans the difference in intron length is only twofold. In contrast, the density of introns in a gene does not strongly depend on the level of gene expression. Thus, natural selection appears to favor short introns in highly expressed genes to minimize the cost of transcription and other molecular processes, such as splicing."

https://openalex.org/W2063229662,"The mechanisms that control localization of marginal zone (MZ) B cells are poorly understood. Here we show that MZ B cells express elevated levels of the integrins LFA-1 (αLβ2) and α4β1 and that they bind to the ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. These ligands are expressed within the MZ in a lymphotoxin-dependent manner. Combined inhibition of LFA-1 and α4β1 causes a rapid and selective release of B cells from the MZ. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-triggered MZ B cell relocalization involves down-regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion. These studies identify key requirements for MZ B cell localization and establish a role for integrins in peripheral lymphoid tissue compartmentalization."

https://openalex.org/W2024312440,"Ocean measurements in the Ross Sea over the past four decades, one of the longest records near Antarctica, reveal marked decreases in shelf water salinity and the surface salinity within the Ross Gyre. These changes have been accompanied by atmospheric warming on Ross Island, ocean warming at depths of ∼300 meters north of the continental shelf, a more negative Southern Oscillation Index, and thinning of southeast Pacific ice shelves. The freshening appears to have resulted from a combination of factors, including increased precipitation, reduced sea ice production, and increased melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet."

https://openalex.org/W2045749216,"The mammalian protein MBD4 contains a methyl-CpG binding domain and can enzymatically remove thymine (T) or uracil (U) from a mismatched CpG site in vitro. These properties suggest that MBD4 might function in vivo to minimize the mutability of 5-methylcytosine by removing its deamination product from DNA. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing Mbd4 −/− mice and found that the frequency of of C → T transitions at CpG sites was increased by a factor of three. On a cancer-susceptible Apc Min/+ background, Mbd4 −/− mice showed accelerated tumor formation with CpG → TpG mutations in the Apc gene. Thus MBD4 suppresses CpG mutability and tumorigenesis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2144966784,"Cannabinoids, the active components of marijuana and their endogenous counterparts, exert many of their actions on the central nervous system by binding to the CB1cannabinoid receptor. Different studies have shown that cannabinoids can protect neural cells from different insults. However, those studies have been performed in neurons, whereas no attention has been focused on glial cells. Here we used the pro-apoptotic lipid ceramide to induce apoptosis in astrocytes, and we studied the protective effect exerted by cannabinoids. Results show the following: (i) cannabinoids rescue primary astrocytes from C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner; (ii) triggering of this anti-apoptotic signal depends on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway; (iii) ERK and its downstream target p90 ribosomal S6 kinase might be also involved in the protective effect of cannabinoids; and (iv) cannabinoids protect astrocytes from the cytotoxic effects of focal C2-ceramide administration in vivo. In summary, results show that cannabinoids protect astrocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis via stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway.

Cannabinoid receptors mediate cannabinoid effects by coupling to different signaling pathways. Both the CB1 and the CB2 receptor signal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (5Howlett A.C. Annu. Rev.

Neuroprotection by cannabinoids has been related to the CB1-mediated inhibition of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels to reduce Ca2+influx, glutamate release and excitotoxicity (12Piomelli D.

However, nothing is known about the possible protective effect of cannabinoids on the major cell population of the central nervous system, namely the astrocytes, despite the pivotal role played by these cells in brain homeostasis. In addition, although the CB1 receptor is coupled to PI3K/PKB (11Gómez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzmán M. Biochem.

Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), their possible involvement in the protection of neural cells by cannabinoids is as yet unknown. Ceramide, a sphingosine-based lipid, regulates a variety of cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (22Kolesnick R.N. Krönke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pro-apoptotic effect of ceramide may be due, at least partially, to its ability to inhibit PKB (23Salinas M.

In addition, it has been shown that accumulation of ceramide in astrocytes leads to apoptosis (25Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we employed a cell-permeable analog of ceramide to induce apoptosis in astrocytes, and we studied (i) the protective role of cannabinoids and (ii) the involvement of PI3K/PKB and ERK pathways in such effect.

Cortical astrocytes were prepared from 24- to 48-h Wistar rats as described previously (25Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral hemispheres were dissected in PBS supplemented with 0.33% glucose, treated with trypsin (5 mg/ml, 30 min at 37 °C), and after stopping the reaction by addition of 10% serum-containing medium, incubated with DNase I (10 μg/ml, 5 min at 37 °C). Subsequently cells were mechanically dissociated, centrifuged, and seeded (3 × 104 cells/cm2) on plastic plates previously coated with 5 μg/ml poly-l-ornithine and cultured in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 5 mg/ml streptomycin, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum. After 10–12 days, cells were trypsinized and reseeded until they reached confluency. Finally, cells were trypsinized, seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2, and 24 h before the experiment transferred to a chemically defined serum-free medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a characteristic biochemical feature of apoptotic cell death, was measured using a nucleosomal DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which quantitatively records histone-associated DNA fragments, according to manufacturer's instructions. TUNEL staining was performed as described previously (26Gómez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Sánchez C. Haro A. Guzmán M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PKB and RSK activities were determined as described (11Gómez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Guzmán M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKB or RSK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with 2 μg of anti-PKBα or anti-RSK antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose, and kinase activity was determined as the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into a specific peptide substrate (GRPRTSSFAEG). Western blot analyses were performed with antibodies that recognize ERK phosphorylated on Thr-202/Tyr-204, PKB-phosphorylated on Thr-308, and PKB-phosphorylated on Ser-473. Adenoviral vectors encoding HA-tagged dominant-negative and wild-type PKB were amplified as described (27Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were transferred to serum-free medium, infected for 3 h with the corresponding adenoviral vector at the multiplicity of infection indicated in the figures, washed with PBS, and transferred to a 10% fetal calf serum medium for 12 h to recover from the infection. Before performing the experiments, infected cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. Pilot experiments using adenoviruses encoding the green fluorescent protein showed that >95% were infected in our experimental conditions. Expression of HA-tagged wild-type and dominant-negative forms of PKB was confirmed in the infected astrocytes by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. Male Wistar rats (320–350 g) were anaesthetized with equitesin (3.5 ml/kg) and injected stereotactically with C2-ceramide (10 mg/ml in Me2SO) at two sites in the hippocampus. In preliminary experiments the volume and number of sites of C2-ceramide injection were established. Twenty μg were injected into the dorsal dentate gyrus and another 20 μg into the dorsal hippocampus (anteroposterior, bregma −3.8 mm; lateral −3.0 mm, and ventral to the surface of the brain −3.4 and −2.6 mm, respectively). C2-ceramide or vehicle were slowly injected (1 μl/min). The needle was left in place for 2 min before retraction to the more dorsal coordinate, and after injection at the second site left in place for a further 5 min before final retraction. WIN 55,212-2 (2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal in 1 ml/kg of 10% Me2SO in saline) was administered 10 min before anesthetic injection and 30 min before focal injection. All procedures were conducted according to the guidelines of the European Community (EC) and were approved by the ethical committee of the Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC). Two days post-injection animals were decapitated, the brains removed, and 4-mm coronal slabs around the injected area cut, fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer for 3 days, and cryoprotected with 15% sucrose for 24 h and then with 30% sucrose for a further 24 h at 4 °C. Finally, brain slabs were flash-frozen in hexane (−70 °C) and stored at −20 °C until sectioned at 45 μm in a cryostat. TUNEL staining of mounted tissue sections was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFAP immunostaining was performed on free-floating sections. Sections were washed 3 times in PBS, treated with 3% H2O2 for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase, and rinsed 3 times in PBS. After incubation with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, sections were incubated with anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 6 h at room temperature and overnight at 4 °C. Immunostaining was visualized using the ABC complex and diaminobenzidine oxidation (0.07% plus 0.05% H2O2) and analyzed on a Zeiss microscope by an observer unaware of the different treatments. Results shown represent means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance with apost hoc analysis by the Student-Neuman-Keuls test. We employed the pro-apoptotic lipid C2-ceramide to study the potential protective effect of cannabinoids in primary astrocyte cultures. As shown in Fig.1 A, ceramide-induced astrocyte death was notably reduced by incubation with THC or different synthetic cannabinoids. We employed the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 to characterize this effect further. Protection by WIN 55,212-2 was dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B) and reached a maximum at 18 h after the addition of the cannabinoid (Fig.1 C). Next, we investigated the nature of ceramide-induced cell death. Challenge with ceramide induced apoptosis as indicated by TUNEL (Fig. 2 A) and DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 2 B), whereas incubation with the cannabinoid agonist HU-210 prevented ceramide-induced apoptosis.Figure 2Cannabinoids prevent ceramide-induced apoptosis. A, astrocytes were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and treated with 15 μmC2-ceramide or vehicle (Control) for 90 min. Then, the medium was changed; vehicle (−) or 25 nm HU-210 (HU) was added, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation was determined. Results correspond to four different experiments. *, significantly different (p < 0.01) from the controls.B, cells were treated as in A, and TUNEL staining was performed. Representative micrographs (phase contrast and TUNEL-stained cells) from one experiment are shown. Similar data were obtained in two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We employed pharmacological inhibitors as a first approach to the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic action of cannabinoids in astrocytes. Thus, incubation with SR 141716 (a CB1 receptor antagonist), LY 294002 and wortmannin (two structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitors), PD 098059 (an ERK pathway inhibitor), and Ro 318220 (a protein kinase C inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit equally the ERK-downstream kinase RSK (28Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)) abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of cannabinoids (Fig.3), suggesting that this effect is dependent on the CB1 receptor and the PI3K and ERK pathways. It is well established that stimulation of the PI3K pathway leads to activation of the anti-apoptotic kinase PKB (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, incubation of astrocytes with HU-210 stimulated and incubation with ceramide inhibited PKB activity. Interestingly, incubation with HU-210 also prevented ceramide-induced inhibition of PKB activity (Fig4 A). Because activation of PKB depends on its phosphorylation on residues Thr-308 and Ser-473 (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), we monitored the phosphorylation status of PKB in astrocytes by using specific antibodies raised against the phosphorylated forms of the kinase. Fig.4 B shows that changes in PKB phosphorylation paralleled changes in enzyme activity. Thus, incubation of astrocytes with HU-210 increased and incubation with ceramide decreased PKB phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473. In addition, after ceramide challenge, incubation with cannabinoids led PKB phosphorylation to the control level. To confirm the involvement of PKB in the anti-apoptotic effect of cannabinoids, we expressed dominant-negative or wild-type forms of PKB (27Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) in astrocytes. Because primary cells are transfected with very low efficiency, we used adenoviral vectors to ensure that >95% of the cells express the exogenous proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 C, expression of a dominant-negative form of PKB abrogated the protective effect of cannabinoids. In addition, infection with the wild-type form of PKB led to a dose-dependent blockade of the apoptotic effect of ceramide (Fig. 4 D), supporting the notion that the pro-apoptotic effect of this lipid may be mediated, at least partially, by PKB inhibition. As data in Fig. 3 indicated that the protective effect of cannabinoids on astrocytes could also involve the ERK pathway, we determined the extent of ERK activation in the cells by using an antibody raised against the phosphorylated (active) form of this kinase. As shown in Fig.5 A, incubation with HU-210 increased the phosphorylation extent of ERK in the presence and in the absence of ceramide, whereas incubation with ceramide only slightly stimulated ERK. Incubation with SR 141716 or wortmannin partially prevented ERK activation after challenge to ceramide plus HU-210. We also determined the activity of the ERK downstream kinase RSK. As shown in Fig. 5 B, incubation with cannabinoids or ceramide alone induced a 60–80% stimulation of RSK, and treatment with both compounds led to an additive stimulation. The latter effect was prevented by both wortmannin and SR 141716. By contrast, ceramide stimulation of RSK was not affected by incubation with wortmannin or SR141716. We next examined the role of cannabinoids in protecting astrocytes in vivo. As shown in Fig. 6 A, treatment with WIN 55,212-2 prevented the toxic effects of focal administration of C2-ceramide in astrocytes. Thus, whereas administration of ceramide induced an area absolutely devoid of GFAP immunoreactivity coinciding with the site of injection (the ventral dentate gyrus), rats treated with WIN 55,212-2 showed a homogeneous GFAP staining throughout the whole hippocampus and did not present an injured area in the zone of injection. GFAP staining remained increased compared with normal rats or to the contralateral non-injected hemisphere of the brain in both cannabinoid- and vehicle-treated rats. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 B there was a high number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in ceramide-injected hippocampus that was significantly reduced by cannabinoid administration (number of TUNEL-positive nuclei/mm2: 994 ± 236 after C2-ceramide treatment, 624 ± 193 after WIN 55,212-2 plus C2-ceramide treatment, p < 0.01). No TUNEL-positive nuclei were observed in vehicle-injected controls. During the last few years, a number of reports have indicated that cannabinoids protect nervous cells from different insults (reviewed in Refs. 12Piomelli D. Giuffrida A. Calignano A. Rodrı́guez de Fonseca F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar and 17Mechoulam R. Panikashvili D. Sholami E. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 58-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In line with those observations, data presented here show that cannabinoids, via activation of the CB1 receptor, protect astrocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis in vitroand in vivo. Astrocytes have been traditionally considered as secondary players in the central nervous system scenario, and therefore all the previous studies on the protective role of cannabinoids on neural cells have involved neurons (see Refs. 18Shen M.

However, it is currently well established that astrocytes, the most abundant cells of the mammalian brain, are involved in numerous functions such as supply of nutrients to neurons (35Tsacopoulos M. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 877-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), establishment of synapses (36Ullian E.M. Sapperstein S.K. Christopherson K.S.

Cell. 1999; 97: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). In addition, in the context of the present study astrocytes are known to take up (38Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) and produce (39Walter L. Franklin A. Witting A. Moller T. Stella N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20869-20876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) endocannabinoids. Thus, most likely the complex mechanisms underlying defense against brain injury (and in particular the mechanisms mediated by cannabinoids) also involve protection of astrocytes. Several observations presented in this report indicate that cannabinoids protect primary astrocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis via CB1 receptor-mediated stimulation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. (i) Blockade of the CB1 receptor or inhibition of PI3K abolishes the protective effect of cannabinoids. (ii) Cannabinoid treatment leads to reactivation of PKB in parallel to prevention of apoptosis. (iii) Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of PKB abrogates the protective effect of cannabinoids. It is well established that challenge with ceramide leads to apoptosis in several experimental models, and this may be at least partially due to dephosphorylation and inactivation of PKB by a ceramide-activated phosphatase (23Salinas M. López-Valdaliso R. Martı́n D. Álvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Schubert K.M. Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13330-13335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that cannabinoids (via activation of the PI3K pathway) and ceramide (via phosphatase activation) may compete for the modulation of PKB activity in astrocytes. Supporting this notion, overexpression of ceramide-sensitive wild-type PKB abrogated the apoptotic effect of ceramide. Because activation of PKB triggers the phosphorylation of different targets involved in preventing apoptosis, including Bad, forkhead transcription factors, IκB kinase, and caspase 9 (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), ceramide inhibition of PKB could lead to suppression of the survival signal, whereas cannabinoid-dependent reactivation of the pathway would restore it. Expression of a dominant-negative form of PKB abolishes the protective effect of cannabinoids but does not induce apoptosis by itself, indicating that the apoptotic effect of ceramide and therefore the generation of a survival signal may also depend on the modulation of additional pathways. Thus, several data suggest that the ERK pathway may participate together with PKB activation in the anti-apoptotic effect of cannabinoids as follows: (i) inhibition of the ERK pathway also prevents the protective effect of cannabinoids, and (ii) astrocyte challenge with cannabinoids leads to activation of both ERK and RSK. One of the mechanisms whereby ERK prevents apoptosis in neural cells involves activation of its downstream kinase RSK as this kinase phosphorylates Bad and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (21Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Thus RSK may act synergistically with PKB to prevent apoptosis (40Nebreda A.R. Gavin A.-C. Science. 1999; 286: 1309-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In our model, triggering of the survival signal is accompanied by a consistent activation of ERK and RSK. Nevertheless, incubation with ceramide leads to apoptosis and activation of ERK and RSK, although to a lower extent than with cannabinoid co-treatment. Interestingly, blockade of PI3K prevents the effect of cannabinoids on ERK and RSK but not ceramide-induced activation of these kinases. These data are in line with recent results of our group 2I. Galve-Roperh, D. Rueda, T. Gómez del Pulgar, G. Velasco, and M. Guzmán, submitted for publication. showing that stimulation of ERK by cannabinoids depends on PI3K and suggest that the latter may be involved in the pro-survival effect of cannabinoids also via activation of the ERK/RSK pathway. It is worth noting that RSK activation also depends on phosphorylation by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 on its N-terminal domain (41Williams M.R. Arthur J.S.C. Balendran A. Van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although that phosphorylation site has been suggested to be constitutive (41Williams M.R. Arthur J.S.C. Balendran A. Van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances PI3K activation could lead to 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of RSK (42Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In short, data presented here indicate that cannabinoids protect primary astrocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. Our data also suggest that cannabinoids are involved in protecting astrocytes in vivo. Although the mechanisms of ceramide generation in astrocytes in vivo are still unknown, it is possible that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (43Singh I. Pahan K. Khan M. Singh A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20354-20362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or to saturated fatty acids (25Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) may increase ceramide production in astrocytes during situations of brain injury. It is curious that, unlike this protective effect on astrocytes, cannabinoids induce apoptosis of glioma cells (13Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M. Gómez del Pulgar T. Izquiedo M. Guzmán M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 14Sánchez C. de Ceballos M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Rueda D. Corbacho C. Velasco G. Galve-Roperh I. Huffman J.W.H.

J. 2002; 363: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This difference between transformed (glioma) and non-transformed cells (astrocytes) could be due to their ability to synthesize ceramide in response to cannabinoids. Thus, cannabinoids induce apoptosis on glioma cells via stimulation of ceramide synthesis de novo(26Gómez del Pulgar T. Velasco G. Sánchez C. Haro A. Guzmán M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), whereas challenge to cannabinoids does not induce ceramide synthesis de novo in astrocytes. 3T. Gómez del Pulgar, G. Velasco, and M. Guzmán, unpublished results. Taken together, these data suggest that cannabinoid receptors are coupled to different pathways and therefore lead to different responses in glioma cells and astrocytes. Accordingly, cannabinoids are being tested as potential antitumoral drugs in the treatment of malignant gliomas and, given the crucial role of astrocytes in brain homeostasis and neuroprotection, our results raise the suggestive although still speculative idea of their usage as therapeutic agents for the management of neurodegenerative disorders.

Whereas superfusion with glucose and other sugars produced a small inward current, the largest current was observed with myo-inositol. The expressed protein, which we have named SMIT2, cotransports myo-inositol with aK m of 120 μm and displays a current-voltage relationship similar to that seen with SMIT (now called SMIT1). The transport is Na+-dependent, with aK m of 13 mm. SMIT2 exhibits phlorizin-inhibitable presteady-state currents and substrate-independent “Na+ leak” currents similar to those of related cotransporters. The steady-state cotransport current is also phlorizin-inhibitable with a K i of 76 μm. SMIT2 exhibits stereospecific cotransport of bothd-glucose and d-xylose but does not transport fucose. In addition, SMIT2 (but not SMIT1) transportsd-chiro-inositol. Based on previous publications, the tissue distribution of SMIT2 is different from that of SMIT1, and the existence of this second cotransporter may explain much of the heterogeneity that has been reported for inositol transport. rkST1, an orphan cDNA of the SLC5 family (43% identical in sequence to the sodium myo-inositol cotransporter SMIT), was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes that were subsequently voltage-clamped and exposed to likely substrates.

The first members of the vertebrate cotransporter protein family SLC5, which includes the high affinity Na+/glucose cotransporter (SGLT1) and the Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter (SMIT), were isolated over a decade ago based on expression of the proteins in Xenopus laevisoocytes (1Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 2Kwon H.M. Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6297-6301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although substrates as diverse as proline, iodide, and vitamins (3Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F10-F18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are transported by this family of proteins, the best characterized transporters remain SGLT1 and SMIT. There are also several “orphan” transporters whose cDNA has been cloned either by using labeled cDNA from members of the SLC5 family as biochemical probes or by comparing SLC5 sequence information in silico to data stored in DNA data bases (3Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F10-F18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the newly discovered sequences are orphans in that they have no known function. Some of the orphan protein sequences are particularly similar to the protein sequences for SGLT1 and SMIT (4Hitomi K. Tsukagoshi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5Pajor A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and presumably transport substrates similar or identical to either glucose or its isomermyo-inositol. The SLC5 proteins with known functions have generally been studied by voltage-clamp experiments because these proteins are electrogenic. Also, presteady-state currents are associated with expression of these proteins at the cell surface, and some (but not all, e.g. xSGLT1L (6Nagata K. Hori N. Sato K. Ohta K. Tanaka H. Hiji Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1251-G1259PubMed Google Scholar)) SLC5 proteins also exhibit a substrate-independent Na+ current (“Na+ leak”). myo-Inositol (MI) 1The abbreviations used are: MI, myo-inositol; I-V, current-voltage. is the most biologically abundant stereoisomer of the inositols, cyclic polyols which serve as precursors to molecules involved in several important aspects of cell physiology, including cell signaling via the inositol phosphate pathways (7Downes C.P. Macphee C.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and the production of phospholipids involved in cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking (8Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). MI also serves as a “compatible osmolyte” used to control intracellular osmolarity in various tissues, including kidney, brain, and endothelium (9Nakanishi T. Balaban R.S. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C181-C191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wiese T.J. Dunlap J.A. Conner C.E. Grzybowski J.A. Lowe W.L. Yorek M.A. Am. J.

Although mammalian serum levels of MI are normally between 30 and 70 μm (12Ashizawa N. Yoshida M. Aotsuka T. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2000; 44: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13MacGregor L.C. Matschinsky F.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Dolhofer R. Wieland O.H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 733-736PubMed Google Scholar), the MI levels within mammalian cells can attain 30 mm (15Schmolke M. Bornemann A. Guder W.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There appear to be several transport mechanisms involved in the active uptake of MI into various types of cells (16Nakanishi T. Turner R.J. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6002-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Novak J.E. Turner R.S. Agranoff B.W. Fisher S.K. J.

Sci. 1992; 33: 3572-3580PubMed Google Scholar), and examples of tissues seeming to lack active transport of MI have also been described (20Sigal S.H. Yandrasitz J.R. Berry G.T. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Noh S.J. Kim M.J. Shim S. Han J.K. J. Cell.

In particular, one transporter that exhibits similar affinities for MI and for its epimer d-chiro-inositol has been demonstrated in the hepatic cell culture line HepG2 (18Ostlund Jr., R.E. Seemayer R. Gupta S. Kimmel R. Ostlund E.L. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10073-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); in contrast, transport of d-chiro-inositol is not observed with the SMIT transporter (18Ostlund Jr., R.E.

The proteins known to transport MI in mammals are SMIT and HMIT, a H+/MI cotransporter from a completely different protein family (23Uldry M. Ibberson M. Horisberger J.D. Chatton J.Y. Riederer B.M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4467-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this work, we have found that a novel Na+/MI cotransport activity is associated with expression of one of the orphan proteins of the SLC5 family (rkST1) (4Hitomi K. Tsukagoshi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocytes. The substrate specificities and transport kinetics of this protein exhibit both functional similarities to the previously cloned SMIT transporter as well as obvious differences, including the transport ofd-chiro-inositol. The existence of this second cotransporter may explain some of the heterogeneity that has been reported for Na+/MI uptake. Unless otherwise noted, all of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. d-glucose,d-xylose, and l-xylose were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (courtesy of Douglas Heimark, Insmed Inc., Glen Allen, VA); none of the three sugars contained detectable levels of MI (>0.1%). d-chiro-Inositol andl-chiro-inositol were from Industrial Research Ltd. (Lower Hutt, New Zealand). Phlorizin was diluted at least 1:1000 from a 500 mm solution in ethanol. For studies where the concentration of phlorizin was varied, phlorizin crystals were dissolved directly into the saline solution. The coding region of the rabbit cDNA rkST1 (4Hitomi K. Tsukagoshi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR on renal cDNA using the phosphorylated oligonucleotides GATCTCACCATGGAGAGCAGCACCAGCA and CTAGTCTAGGCGAAGTAGCCCCAGAGGAA (AlphaDNA, Montreal, Canada) and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The ends of the PCR product were digested with Exonuclease III to yield 5′ overhangs (24Kaluz S. Kolble K. Reid K.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4369-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Following this, the DNA product was ligated between theBglII and SpeI sites of pT7T3, a vector designed for strong expression of transcripts in oocytes (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Krieg, University of Texas at Austin). Following purification of the recombinant plasmid, an aliquot of the DNA was cleaved by digestion with EcoRI, followed by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (25Pokrovskaya I.D. Gurevich V.V. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The identity of the cloned PCR product was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. There were 8 base pairs that differed from the published rabbit rsKT1 cDNA sequence, resulting in one conservative alteration in the protein sequence (T173A)*. The oocytes were removed from gravid female X. laevis frogs (Connecticut Valley Biological Supply Co., Southampton, MA) under tricaine anesthesia. The individually dissected oocytes were placed into a Ca2+-free buffered saline solution (200 millosmolar) and defolliculated by collagenase digestion. The oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in Barth's solution (90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) supplemented with 5% horse serum (26Quick M.W. Naeve J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar) (except where described), 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. RNA (46 nl, 0.1 μg/μl unless otherwise noted) was injected into the oocytes 1 day after surgical isolation; the oocytes were assayed for transporter activity at 5–8 days after the injection. The oocyte currents were measured with a standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (27Coady M.J. Jalal F. Chen X. Lemay G. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, a commercial amplifier (oocyte clamp model OC-725, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and a data acquisition system (RC Electronics, Santa Barbara, CA) were used to send voltage pulses to the oocyte as well as to simultaneously record membrane current and voltage signals. The oocyte was superfused (∼1.5 ml/min) with a saline solution containing 90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgCl2, 0.74 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.6. After microelectrode impalement, a membrane potential stabilization period of 1–10 min was observed. Oocytes whose membrane potential was less negative than −35 mV were discarded. The membrane potential was then held at −50 mV, following which a voltage range from +75 mV to −175 mV was covered in 25-mV steps. The oocyte membrane potential was stepped to the new levels for 250-ms intervals, and traces were analyzed by averaging the signal in a window of 50 ms positioned after the decay of capacitive transient currents. The measurements are generally taken in the absence and in the presence of a particular substrate, and the substrate-specific current is determined by subtraction of one current from the other. When the concentration of NaCl was diminished, it was isotonically replaced withN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. All of the steady-state and presteady-state current experiments were performed at room temperature (24 °C). For the recording of presteady-state currents, the voltage pulse duration was reduced to 50 ms, and the sampling rate was increased to 0.1 ms/point. The membrane potential was stepped from +50 mV to −175 mV in 25-mV increments from a holding potential of −50 mV. The currents measured in the presence of 0.5 mm phlorizin were subtracted (point by point) from the total currents measured in a saline solution ([Na+]out = 30 mm). The displaced charge (Q) was obtained by integrating the transient portion of the presteady-state currents, and the Q versus V m curve was fitted to the following Boltzmann equation, Q=Qdep−Qhyp1+e(Vm−V0.5)zFRT+QhypEquation 1 where Q hyp andQ dep are the charges transferred at hyperpolarizing and depolarizing V m,z is the valence of the mobile charge,V 0.5 is the V m at which half of the charge is transferred, and F, R, andT are the usual constants. Fitting was done using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Origin 6.1, OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Expression of rkST1 in Xenopus oocytes was impeded by a lethal effect of the protein on the host cells. Injection of 46 nl of rkST1 mRNA at a concentration of 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 μg/μl resulted in the death of all oocytes by the third day following injection (as judged either visibly or by membrane potential measurement) when incubated in serum-free Barth's solution; injection of 0.1 μg/μl mRNA caused about half of the oocytes to die. The mortality rate was reduced by inclusion of 5% horse serum in the incubation medium (26Quick M.W. Naeve J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar), which resulted in survival of all oocytes injected with 0.1 μg/μl mRNA as well as half of those injected with 0.25 μg/μl mRNA. Inclusion of either 500 μmphlorizin or 5 mm MI in the Barth's solution did not affect the survival rate. Subsequent experiments were performed after injecting oocytes with 46 nl of 0.1 μg/μl mRNA and maintaining the oocytes in Barth's solution containing 5% serum. The initial indication that the rkST1 protein was expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane was provided by the presteady-state currents created by briefly stepping the membrane potential of oocytes from the holding potential of −50 mV to intermediate levels between −175 mV and +50 mV. As seen in Fig. 1, control (water-injected) oocytes display a capacitive current that decays within 1.5–2.5 ms. Oocytes injected with rkST1 mRNA display an additional current that continues to decay well after the membrane potential has stabilized at a new level. This is similar to the presteady-state currents observed with other cotransporter proteins (28Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

Biol. 1997; 160: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), confirming that an exogenous protein has been expressed at the plasma membrane. Although not all membrane proteins are likely to be characterized by presteady-state currents when expressed in ovo, this phenomenon holds true for all of the SLC5 family members that have been examined. The oocytes expressing rkST1 were then superfused with several substrates, including glucose and MI, while the oocyte membrane potential was held at −50 mV. A large, reversible, steady-state inward current was associated with exposure to 1 mm MI (Fig.2), whereas a much smaller current was associated with exposure to 1 mm glucose. Superfusion with 1 mm α-methylglucose, a specific substrate for SGLT1, did not cause any current flow through rkST1, whereas a small inward current was blocked by application of 0.5 mm phlorizin, similar to substrate-independent currents seen with other cotransporters (31Umbach J.A. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Forster I. Hernando N. Biber J. Murer H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because the protein evinced the greatest currents following exposure to MI, we have named it SMIT2, and we suggest that the first SMIT protein be renamed SMIT1, with the consent of the original authors. 2J. S. Handler, personal communication. A large current was also observed with superfusion ofd-chiro-inositol, but only a very small current was seen with l-chiro-inositol superfusion. None of these currents were seen in the absence of sodium. To better characterize the substrate specificity of this transporter, we superfused SMIT2-expressing oocytes with 50 mm of either MI or a variety of sugars to be able to compare SMIT2 transport with results similarly obtained by others with SGLT1 and SMIT1 (28Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The solutions contained 65 mm NaCl, and tonicity was maintained by the inclusion of 50 mm mannitol in the absence of MI or other sugars (mannitol did not induce measurable currents through SMIT2). To eliminate the variability caused by the different levels of SMIT2 expression in individual oocytes, the results from each oocyte are expressed as percentages of the current observed when 50 mm MI was applied to the same oocyte. There are several intriguing differences between the substrate specificities of SMIT1 and SMIT2. The most obvious is that SMIT2 has a greater affinity for d-glucose than does SMIT1, because 50 mmd-glucose produces a current through SMIT2 that is over half the size of the current seen with 50 mm MI but less than 25% of the MI current is seen when 50 mmd-glucose is applied to SMIT1 (28Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SMIT2 exhibits stereospecificity, transportingd-glucose and d-xylose but not theirl-stereoisomers. None of the other sugars tested with SMIT2 induced significant currents. SMIT1, in contrast, transportsl-fucose and l-xylose (but not theird-isomers) and does not distinguish between d- and l-glucose. Neither does SMIT1 distinguish between α-methylglucose and d-glucose, whereas SMIT2 displays far more transport of d-glucose than of α-methylglucose at 50 mm substrate. Although l-fucose has been shown to inhibit SMIT1 (33Yorek M.A. Stefani M.R. Dunlap J.A., Ro, K.S. Davidson E.P. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we found no inhibition of the SMIT2 current associated with 100 μm MI when 5 mml-fucose was added to the MI (data not shown). The current-voltage (I-V) relationship of SMIT2 was examined by subtracting the currents measured in the absence of MI from those observed in the presence of 1 mm MI; the difference between them represents the substrate-dependent current passing through SMIT2. No MI-dependent current was observed in control (water-injected) oocytes, whereas superfusion of MI causes a large inward current through SMIT2, which increased in magnitude as the membrane potential grew more negative (Fig.4). The current showed no evidence of having attained a maximal level at the most negative potential used (−175 mV), which is similar to the I-V curve seen with SMIT1 expression but unlike the shape of the I-V curve for SGLT1 (28Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The currents for the phlorizin-sensitive sodium leak associated with SMIT2 were also examined at different membrane potentials (Fig. 4). The magnitude of this current at highly negative potentials is on the order of 5% of the substrate-dependent current, similar to the size of the SGLT1 leak current (31Umbach J.A. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The outward sodium leak currents at positive potentials are negligible, unlike those seen with SGLT1 (31Umbach J.A. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have also examined the voltage sensitivity of the kinetic constants of SMIT2. The K m value for MI remains quite constant, near 120 μm, over the voltage range of −175 mV to −25 mV (Fig. 5 A); this is approximately twice as high as the K m for SMIT1 (which is also relatively voltage-independent). The kinetic parameters at membrane potentials more positive than −25 mV were found to be unreliable because of a vanishingly small steady-state MI-dependent current. Not surprisingly, the calculatedI max values found while varying MI or sodium concentrations both comprise curves that conform to the I-V curve seen in Fig. 4 at the relatively high MI concentration of 1 mmwith 90 mm sodium (Fig. 5 B). TheK m for sodium was lowest at the most negative potentials, rising quickly when the membrane potential approached zero. One noteworthy difference between the sodium affinities of the two SMIT proteins is that the SMIT2 K m reached an extremely low value (2.7 mm) at −175 mV, whereas theK m values seen with SMIT1 appears to attain a lower limit near 40 mm (28Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sodium K mvalue for SGLT1, by comparison, presents a voltage dependence that appears very similar to that seen with SMIT2 (31Umbach J.A. Coady M.J. Wright E.M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1217-1224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At −50 mV, our data was fit to the Hill equation and produced a Hill coefficient of 1.4 (data not shown), indicating significant cooperativity, which suggests a stoichiometry greater than 1:1. It should also be mentioned that, at −50 mV, the K m ford-chiro-inositol is 130 ± 10 μm, and the I max is identical to that seen with MI (Fig. 2). The K m ford-glucose is ∼30 mm at −50 mV, whereas theI max appears identical to that determined with MI. We turned to measurements of the reversal potential to further pursue the question of stoichiometry (34Chen X.Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.Y. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2405-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm MI, varying concentrations of phlorizin were used while recording the MI-dependent current (Fig.6). As analyzed by competitive inhibition, a K i of 76 μm was obtained. Analysis of the phlorizin-sensitive current showed very little outward current, and even conditions of preloading with MI or with lower external [Na] failed to induce a reliable reversal potential. Consequently, we were unable to use the reversal potential of the Na+/MI current to estimate the stoichiometry of the cotransport protein, as had been done for SGLT1 (34Chen X.Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.Y. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2405-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The presteady-state currents associated with SMIT2 expression inXenopus oocytes were examined by subtracting the currents measured in the presence of 0.5 mm phlorizin from those measured in the absence of phlorizin (Fig.7). No MI was present, and the sodium concentration was reduced to 30 mm to bring theV 0.5 toward more positive potentials. The presteady-state currents are present whenever the potential is clamped to a new value; there are also some steady-state currents caused by the substrate-independent current that passes through SMIT2. Integration of the presteady-state current produced a transferred chargeversus potential curve, which can be fitted with a Boltzmann relation described by a Q max value of 11.7 ± 0.5 nC, a V 0.5 of −11 ± 3 mV, and az value of 1.21 ± 0.05. Given these z andQ max values, the number of transporters/oocyte can be calculated at 5.8 × 1010. Assuming aI MI of 200 nA at −50 mV, the turnover rate must be either 23 s−1 (assuming a Na+:MI stoichiometry of 1:1) or 11.5 s−1 (assuming a Na+:MI stoichiometry of 2:1). The SMIT2 cDNA was first cloned in 1994 by Hitomi and Tsukagoshi (4Hitomi K. Tsukagoshi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using PCR with degenerate primers against a conserved sequence motif. Sequence analysis and comparison within the SLC5 family suggested a 12–14 TMS protein with 49 and 43% sequence identity to SGLT1 and SMIT1, respectively. SMIT2 RNA had been detected in brain, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, liver, placenta, lung, leukocytes, and neurons (4Hitomi K. Tsukagoshi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35Poppe R. Karbach U. Gambaryan S. Wiesinger H. Lutzenburg M. Kraemer M. Witte O.W. Koepsell H. J.

Psychiatry. 1996; 20: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the function of the protein had never been established. Identifying the function of an orphan cotransporter inXenopus oocytes can be greatly aided by first establishing that the protein is actually expressed at the cell membrane. A number of other orphan proteins have not displayed significant currents after exposure to a battery of possible substrates, and there are examples where this has occurred because the protein was not expressed at the cell surface during heterologous expression in oocytes (23Uldry M. Ibberson M. Horisberger J.D. Chatton J.Y. Riederer B.M. Thorens B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4467-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The presteady-state currents displayed by SMIT2 are large and long-lived, enabling us to easily observe them and giving us confidence that the orphan protein was correctly expressed at the cell surface. SMIT2, when expressed in oocytes, transports MI with aK m (120 μm) closely corresponding to the 70 μm human plasma concentration of MI (14Dolhofer R. Wieland O.H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 733-736PubMed Google Scholar) and well below the 470 μm concentration reported for cerebrospinal fluid (37Spector R. Lorenzo A.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1975; 228: 1510-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and has a substantial I max that compares well with other sodium-coupled cotransporters. Furthermore, the K m for glucose is well above normal serum glucose levels. It seems clear that MI is the physiological substrate for the protein; although d-chiro-inositol is transported as readily as MI, the average serum level ofd-chiro-inositol is less than 100 nm (38Ostlund Jr., R.E. McGill J.B. Herskowitz I. Kipnis D.M. Santiago J.V. Sherman W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9988-9992Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and thus d-chiro-inositol transport represents a minor physiological role for SMIT2. It should be noted that there has been one previous publication suggesting the names SMIT1, SMIT2, and SMIT3 for three alternate transcripts from the SLC5A3 gene (39Porcellati F. Hosaka Y. Hlaing T. Togawa M. Larkin D.D. Karihaloo A. Stevens M.J. Killen P.D. Greene D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1325-C1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); we suggest that these be named SMIT1a, SMIT1b, and SMIT1c, in which we have the consent of the authors of that work. 3M. J. Stevens, personal communication. SMIT2 displays properties that are similar to those of the best studied sodium-coupled transporter, SGLT1. Like SGLT1, SMIT2 is phlorizin-sensitive, has a sodium leak and presents presteady-state currents; the sodium activation is slightly cooperative, suggesting a stoichiometry of 2 sodium for 1 MI molecule; and its estimated turnover rate is of the order of 10. On the other hand, it also presents very noticeable differences versus SGLT1. The I-V relationship does not saturate at negative membrane potentials, indicating that, as seems to be the case for SMIT1, a voltage-dependent step remains rate-limiting throughout the voltage range studied. The sugar affinity remains approximately constant from −25 to −175 mV. One of the most striking differences between SMIT1 and SMIT2 is that SMIT2 displays specificity for the d-stereoisomers of the most prevalent biological substrates (chiro-inositol and glucose), whereas SMIT1 has no such preference. These differences in substrate selectivity may be useful for delineating the functional differences between the two proteins in vivo, where they are both expressed in kidney and brain (2Kwon H.M.

Belmaker R.H. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1996; 20: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lack of transport of galactose by SMIT2 conforms to a motif proposed recently in which proteins of the SLC5 family that have a threonine at the position homologous to residue 460 in human SGLT1 are able to transport galactose, whereas the other SLC5 proteins (such as SMIT2) do not transport galactose (40Diez-Sampedro A. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49188-49194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent publication described the human SMIT2 cDNA sequence and examined the distribution of SMIT2 expression by Northern blot analysis (41Roll P. Massacrier A. Pereira S. Robaglia-Schlupp A. Cau P. Szepetowski P. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SMIT2 appears to be quite widely distributed, although it is not present in small intestine and some other tissues. In particular, SMIT2 is well expressed in brain, heart, muscle, kidney, and liver. In other work, SMIT1 and SMIT2 have been detected in neurons, both in glial cells and in astrocytes (35Poppe R. Karbach U. Gambaryan S. Wiesinger H. Lutzenburg M. Kraemer M. Witte O.W. Koepsell H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the control of MI uptake into the cells of the central nervous system has been suggested to be related to the control of a variety of psychiatric illnesses (42Benjamin J. Levine J. Fux M. Aviv A. Levy D. Belmaker R.H. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1084-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Fux M. Levine J. Aviv A. Belmaker R.H. Am. J.

Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a better understanding of the roles for SMIT1 and SMIT2 in brain may aid the investigation of these maladies. The group that identified the human homologue of SMIT2 has also examined the possibility of a link between this gene and an inherited disorder of infantile convulsions that has been mapped to this region of the genome but found no link between carriers of the disease and specific polymorphisms within the cDNA. SMIT2 appears to be similar to a cotransporter from HepG2 cells that was previously shown to transport MI andd-chiro-inositol with similar affinities (18Ostlund Jr., R.E. Seemayer R. Gupta S. Kimmel R. Ostlund E.L. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10073-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As was seen for SMIT2, the novel transporter described in these cell cultures displayed similar K m values for the two inositols and exhibited competition from d-glucose but not from l-glucose. The same cell line also appeared to express SMIT1, indicating that the two proteins can coexist in the same cells. No information is yet available regarding the distribution of the two cotransporters between the different plasma membrane domains in these polarized cells. Lack of inhibition of SMIT2 by l-fucose suggests that SMIT2 is not involved in several transport phenomena involving competition between l-fucose and MI, including diabetic neuropathy (45Sima A.A. Dunlap J.A. Davidson E.P. Wiese T.J. Lightle R.L. Greene D.A. Yorek M.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that SMIT2 has a greater affinity for glucose than does SMIT1 and is thus more likely to be affected by increased glucose levels during untreated diabetes. The SMIT2 peptide sequence is most closely related to theXenopus SGLT1-like protein (xSGLT1L). They are 67% identical, whereas SMIT2 is only 43% identical to SMIT1 and 49% identical to SGLT1. It is difficult to firmly establish whether SMIT2 and xSGLT1L represent true orthologues; by comparison there is 75% identity between the human SGLT1 and SGLT3 peptide sequences. Functional comparison of the two proteins is also ambiguous; although xSGLT1L transports both MI and glucose, its affinity for MI is half that of SMIT2, whereas xSGLT1L has a lower K m for glucose (6.3 mm versus ∼30 mm for SMIT2). Furthermore, the K i for phlorizin interaction with xSGLT1L is 6.3 μm, whereas it inhibits SMIT2 with a K i of 76 μm. The current-voltage relationships for the two proteins are also somewhat different because xSGLT1L, like SGLT1, appears to reach a plateau in the current obtained as the potential becomes quite negative. SMIT2, on the other hand, generates increasingly large currents as the potential becomes more negative, similar to that seen with SMIT1. SMIT2 also displays sodium leak currents (substrate-independent, phlorizin-inhibitable), whereas xSGLT1L has no sodium leak currents. The strongest evidence that SMIT2 and xSGLT1L represent different proteins is that the distribution of SMIT2 is primarily in the kidney, liver, heart, and brain (but not intestine), whereas xSGLT1L is found primarily in the intestine and kidney (6Nagata K. Hori N. Sato K. Ohta K. Tanaka H. Hiji Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1251-G1259PubMed Google Scholar, 46Eid S.R. Terrettaz A. Nagata K. Brändli A.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that the two proteins are orthologous but that they serve somewhat different roles in mammals and amphibians. There have been a number of reports that indicate multiple MI transport activities in different tissues, and the identification of SMIT2 may illuminate some of these situations. Precise location of SMIT2 in vivo will require immunohistochemical techniques. The substrate specificity of SMIT2 does match that of a transporter that has been observed in renal proximal tubule apical membranes (47Silbernagl, S., Völker, K., and Dantzler, W. H. (2001)I.U.P.S. XXXIVth International Congress, Abstract number 853, CD-ROM for the 2001 meeting (iups.mcw.edu).Google Scholar). Because the RNAs coding for SMIT1, SMIT2, and HMIT appear to be absent from small intestine (2Kwon H.M. Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Handler J.S. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the identification of the intestinal MI transporter remains to be determined. The presence of three distinct MI cotransporters in brain tissues complicates the issue of MI metabolism in the central nervous system, which has gained prominence with the recent identification of MI depletion as the mechanism of action of three drugs commonly used to treat bipolar affective disorder (48Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2096837432,"Canonical activation of NF-κB is mediated via phosphorylation of the inhibitory IκB proteins by the IκB kinase complex (IKK). IKK is composed of a heterodimer of the catalytic IKKα and IKKβ subunits and a presumed regulatory protein termed NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) or IKKγ. NEMO/IKKγ is indispensable for activation of the IKKs in response to many signals, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we identify TANK (TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator) as a NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein via yeast two-hybrid analyses. This interaction is confirmed in mammalian cells, and the domains required are mapped. TANK was previously shown to assist NF-κB activation in a complex with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or IKKε, two kinases distantly related to IKKα/β, but the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. Here we show that TBK1 and IKKε synergize with TANK to promote interaction with the IKKs. The TANK binding domain within NEMO/IKKγ is required for proper functioning of this IKK subunit. These results indicate that TANK can synergize with IKKε or TBK1 to link them to IKK complexes, where the two kinases may modulate aspects of NF-κB activation.

These factors transcriptionally induce many genes whose products are critical to drive immune responses in general or to fight pathogens directly (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y.

In addition, NF-κB is also directly involved in growth and survival of cells relevant in stress and immune responses, due to its antiapoptotic and proliferation-promoting functions (4Karin M. Lin A.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that the IKK kinases target not only the so-called small IκB inhibitors, of which the IκBα is the prototype, but that they also similarly phosphorylate and regulate the p105/NF-κB1 and p100/NF-κB2 precursors, leading either to their proteolytic degradation or to their processing to p50 and p52, respectively (15Heissmeyer V.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition to these functions, IKK kinase activity may also modulate the transactivation potential of the NF-κB proteins liberated by the degradation of the inhibitors; activated IKK kinases have been shown to phosphorylate a transactivation domain of RelA, thereby promoting its ability to transcriptionally transactivate genes (19Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). NEMO/IKKγ is an essential component of the IKK complex, as evidenced for example by the inability of many signals, including TNF and interleukin-1, to induce NF-κB activity in NEMO/IKKγ-deficient cells (13Yamaoka S.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that NEMO/IKKγ may be required for the correct assembly of the IKK complex and/or for the recruitment of upstream activators of the IKK complex (12Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 13Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). However, the functions and mechanisms of NEMO/IKKγ remain to be determined. If this essential component does indeed connect to a variety of different upstream signaling mediators, these would be important to identify, since they may be signal-specific mediators of NF-κB activation and thus more specific potential targets for therapies intended to delimit NF-κB activation. We have used NEMO/IKKγ as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify potential mediators of select upstream signaling pathways. Previously, we reported on the identification of one NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein identified in this way and termed CIKS (connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK) (22Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (also known as Act-1 (23Li X. Commane M. Nie H. Hua X. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Wald D. Haag M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)). Here we describe the identification of an additional NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein, termed TANK (TRAF family member-associatedNF-κB activator). We show that TANK interacts with NEMO/IKKγ (and the IKKs) in mammalian cells. TANK had previously been shown to be potentially involved in both positive and negative regulation of NF-κB activity (24Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada N.J. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1996; 93: 8241-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Positive regulation reportedly occurs via an association of TANK with two kinases, termed inducible IκB kinase (also known as IKKε) and TBK1 (also known as T2K and NF-κB-activating kinase) (27Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M.

Acta. 2001; 1471: M57-M62PubMed Google Scholar), although the mechanisms involved remain unknown. We demonstrate here that TANK synergizes with IKKε and TBK1 to form a complex with NEMO/IKKγ and thus with the IKKs. This links IKKε and TBK1 with at least a subset of IKK complexes and suggests potentially direct effects on IKK-associated functions. We also provide evidence that the TANK-binding domain of NEMO may be important in transmitting signals. Human embryonic kidney 293 and HeLa cells were maintained as described (22Leonardi A.

NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells were a generous gift from Dr. Shao-Cong Sun, (Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine) and were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% penicillin/ streptomycin. Polyclonal anti-TANK rabbit antibodies were raised against the first 20 and the last 19 amino acids of human TANK. Anti-NEMO/IKKγ and anti-Myc antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), as were anti-HA and anti-IKKα beads. Anti-FLAG beads were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-IKKε and anti-IKKα antibodies were from Imgenex (San Diego, CA) and BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Mouse NEMO/IKKγ and human TANK were both cloned by PCR from a mouse or human liver cDNA library, respectively (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Truncation mutants of NEMO/IKKγ and TANK were generated by PCR. The FLAG-NEMO ΔTANK construct was made by first cloning a PCR-generated fragment encompassing the region from amino acid 250 to the stop codon into pcDNA3.1 FLAG; subsequently, a PCR-generated fragment harboring amino acids 2–200 was inserted in frame. The HA-NEMOΔTANK construct was made by subcloning the NEMOΔTANK coding sequence into pcDNA3.1 HA. The FLAG-TANK ΔIKKε construct was made by cloning a PCR-generated fragment encoding amino acids 2–110 into pcDNA3.1 FLAG ΔN169-TANK. Full-length CIKS, NEMO/IKKγ, IKKα, and IKKβ have been previously described (22Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TBK1 and IKKε were PCR-amplified from a liver cDNA library. cDNAs encoding TANK and IKKε were cloned into pcDNA3.1 FLAG (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells, and TBK1 and IKKε were cloned into pcDNA3.1 Myc. Both TBK1 and IKKε mutant (K38A) constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A construct encoding full-length NEMO/IKKγ fused to GST was generated by subcloning full-length NEMO/IKKγ into pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences). DNA encoding NEMO/IKKγ (amino acids 1–339) was cloned into the GAL4 DNA-binding vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and used as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeY190; positive clones were selected as described (22Leonardi A.

In vitro transcription and translation were carried out with 1 μg of HA-TANK, as described (22Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein-protein interactions were performed by incubating an aliquot of GST-NEMO/IKKγ or GST bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads with 5 μl of in vitrotranslated HA-TANK as described (31Chariot A.

Beads were washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton, protease inhibitors; resuspended into migrating buffer; and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel before autoradiography. For immunoprecipitations involving overexpressed proteins, 293 or HeLa cells (3 × 106) were transfected via LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with expression vectors as indicated in Figs. 2 (B, C, andD), 3 (B and D), and 4 (B,C, and D). 24 h after transfection, cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5% Triton lysis buffer. Ectopically expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated by using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies bound to agarose beads or by using anti-NEMO antibodies (as indicated). The immunoprecipitate was washed five times with 0.5% lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations of endogenous NEMO/IKKγ or endogenous IKKα were performed with 293 or HeLa cells (6 × 106) after cells had been transfected with expression vectors for various proteins as indicated in Figs. 5 and 6 B. Harvested cells were washed and lysed as described above. Anti-NEMO/IKKγ immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the total cell extracts with polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by an overnight incubation with protein A-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (see Figs.5, A and C, and 6), whereas anti-IKKα immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the cell extracts with monoclonal anti-IKKα beads overnight (see Fig.5 B).Figure 6IKK ε-promoted interaction of TANK with NEMO/IKKγ depends on the ability of TANK to interact with IKK ε.

The immunoprecipitate was washed five times with the lysis buffer and incubated overnight with the FLAG peptide (Sigma), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The supernatants were subsequently incubated with anti-NEMO antibodies and protein A-agarose conjugate overnight. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed with the lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitations, 293 cells (6 × 107) were left untreated or were stimulated with 40 ng/ml of PMA and 2 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for the indicated period of time and subsequently lysed in the lysis buffer. An anti-TANK immunoprecipitation was then performed with the polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation overnight with protein A-agarose conjugate. An immunoprecipitation with an aliquot of a prebleed rabbit serum was performed in parallel as a negative control. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to anti-IKKε and -IKKα Western blots. Jurkat NEMO-deficient cells (6 × 106) were transfected in 10-cm dishes using the DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of the Ig-κB-luciferase reporter (30Leonardi A. Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Franzoso G. Brown K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 271-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with or without 1 μg of the indicated FLAG-NEMO constructs. To gain insights into how NEMO/IKKγ may transmit signals to the IKKs, we screened for NEMO/IKKγ -interacting proteins via yeast two-hybrid assays. Mouse NEMO/IKKγ (aa 1–339) was used as bait in a fusion with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 to trap interacting proteins generated from a human liver expression library fused to the GAL4 activation domain. Positive clones isolated included portions of IKKα, IKKβ, and CIKS (22Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, three independent and overlapping clones encoded parts of TANK (also known as TRAF-interacting protein or I-TRAF). TANK had previously been identified as a potential regulator in NF-κB-activating pathways, although its precise role is controversial. TANK was originally discovered as a protein capable of binding to TRAF1, -2, and -3 (24Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Kaye K.M. Devergne O. Harada N.J. Izumi K.M. Yalamanchili R. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11085-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To delineate the region in NEMO/IKKγ that is required for interaction with TANK, we tested various truncation mutants of NEMO/IKKγ (fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain) for binding to the isolated TANK-GAL4 activation domain fusion protein in yeast (Fig.1 B). Among the C-terminal deletion mutants of the 412-amino acid-long NEMO/IKKγ protein, one lacking the last 100 amino acids and thus lacking the entire leucine zipper domain was still able to interact with TANK. Among the various N-terminal deletions of NEMO/IKKγ, those lacking any or all of the first 200 amino acids were still able to bind TANK, whereas one lacking the first 250 amino acids was not. Complementing this result, a NEMO/IKKγ construct composed of amino acids 150–250 was sufficient to mediate the interaction with TANK. Based on these findings, we conclude that the region between amino acids 200 and 250 of NEMO/IKKγ mediates binding to TANK. This domain of NEMO/IKKγ is distinct from the one required for interaction with the IKKs (amino acids 50–100) (32Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 33Ye J. Xie X. Tarassishin L. Horwitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9882-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2A. Leonardi and U. Siebenlist, unpublished data. The interaction between NEMO/IKKγ and TANK was also confirmed in vitro. AnEscherichia coli-produced recombinant GST-NEMO/IKKγ fusion protein (full-length) bound in vitro translated [35S]HA-TANK, whereas recombinant GST alone did not (Fig.2 A, top panel). Next we investigated the interaction of NEMO/IKKγ with TANK in mammalian cells. FLAG-TANK was transiently co-expressed in 293 cells together with HA-NEMO/IKKγ or a NEMO/IKKγ mutant lacking the first 250 amino acids (HA-NEMO/IKKγ ΔN250). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 2 B,top panel) and HA-NEMO/IKKγ was co-immunoprecipitated, but only if FLAG-TANK had also been co-transfected (lane 5). The specificity of the interaction between NEMO/IKKγ and TANK was confirmed by the fact that the NEMO/IKKγ deletion mutant lacking the first 250 amino acids (HA-NEMO/IKKγ ΔN250) was not co-immunoprecipitated with TANK (lane 6), in agreement with the data in yeast. Similar results were obtained when the NEMO/IKKγ was immunoprecipitated to look for TANK (data not shown). Note that when both NEMO/IKKγ and TANK were co-expressed, a shift in the migration of the TANK protein was detected by Western blot, even in the absence of any overexpressed kinases (middle panel,lane 5). To further confirm the interaction between TANK and NEMO/IKKγ, 293 cells were transfected with both HA-NEMO/IKKγ and FLAG-TANK, and extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (Fig. 2 C). TANK was co-immunoprecipitated with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 2 C, top panel,lane 2). A shift in the TANK protein was detected when co-expressed with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 2 C,middle panel; lane 2,FLAG-TANK*), most likely due to phosphorylation. Interestingly, it is this slower migrating form of TANK that preferentially co-immunoprecipitated with HA-NEMO/IKKγ (Fig.2 C, top panel, lane 2). Because FLAG-TANK could also be shown to co-immunoprecipitate with HA-IKKβ, especially if NEMO/IKKγ was cotransfected (data not shown), we asked whether these three proteins might be able to form a ternary complex. To test this, 293 cells were transfected either with HA-IKKβ or with FLAG-TANK or both (Fig. 2 D). Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations were carried out, and the immunoprecipitates were released from the beads by incubating them with a FLAG peptide. The released material was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the endogenous NEMO/IKKγ and an anti-HA Western analysis was performed, revealing the presence of IKKβ (lane 2). Therefore, a ternary complex of TANK, NEMO/IKKγ, and IKKβ must have been formed in 293 cells. Importantly, this complex was formed with endogenous NEMO/IKKγ, demonstrating that endogenous levels of NEMO/IKKγ were sufficient to mediate the interaction between transfected TANK and IKKβ. To delineate the domain in TANK required for interaction with NEMO/IKKγ in mammalian cells, various truncated TANK proteins were generated (Fig. 3,A and C) and tested for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with NEMO/IKKγ in 293 cells (Fig. 3,B and D). A TANK protein lacking the first N-terminal 30 aa (Fig. 3 A) was able to co-immunoprecipitate with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 3 B, lane 7), but TANK proteins lacking the first N-terminal 70 aa or more were not (lanes 3–5, 8, and 9). All C-terminal deletions of TANK tested (Fig. 3 C) failed to co-immunoprecipitate with NEMO/IKKγ (Fig. 3 D,lanes 3–8). This suggests that an N-terminal TANK domain (between aa 30 and 70) and a C-terminal TANK domain (between aa 248 and 425) are both required for interaction with the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex in mammalian cells. (The same results were obtained with a NEMO/IKKγ construct lacking the C-terminal 72 aa; data not shown). By contrast, the C-terminal domain of TANK was sufficient in yeast (see Fig. 1 A). The reason for this is not clear, but the assay for the interaction in yeast may be more sensitive than the one in mammalian cells. We next explored the possible relevance of the interaction of TANK with NEMO/IKKγ in mediating activation of NF-κB. A NEMO/IKKγ mutant was constructed in which the TANK-binding domain was specifically deleted (NEMOΔTANK) (Fig.4 A). When overexpressed in 293 cells, this NEMO mutant failed to interact with TANK (Fig.4 B, top panel, lane 6), as predicted by the results obtained in yeast (see Fig.1 B). However, this NEMO mutant still interacted with transfected IKKβ (Fig. 4 C, top panel, lane 3). Moreover, NEMOΔTANK also interacted with CIKS, another NEMO/IKKγ-interacting protein (22Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D, top panel, lane 3). NEMO/IKKγ thus interacts with TANK via a domain not required for interaction of NEMO/IKKγ with the IKKs or with CIKS. We then tested the ability of the NEMOΔTANK mutant to restore NF-κB activation in NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells (34Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in response to stimulation with P/I. Whereas transfection of wild-type NEMO/IKKγ led to significant P/I-induced κB reporter activity, the NEMOΔTANK mutant was largely unable to transmit this signal (Fig. 4 E). Although this does not prove that interaction with TANK is critical for the function of NEMO, given that as yet unknown functions of NEMO may have been impaired in this particular mutant, the data are nonetheless consistent with the notion that NEMO/IKKγ normally has to bind to proteins such as TANK to be fully functional.

Kawai T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 3: 191-202Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) capable of activating NF-κB in transfection experiments. Inducible IκB kinase and TBK1 were shown to interact with the N-terminal half of TANK and to cause TANK phosphorylation in cotransfection experiments in the C-terminal half (27Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nomura F. Kawai T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 3: 191-202Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mechanisms for activation of NF-κB by these kinases remained uncertain. We confirmed and extended the published work on the interaction and phosphorylation of TANK with IKKε and TBK1. Both kinases interacted with TANK in the region between amino acids 111 and 169 (just C-terminal to the first of two domains required for interaction with NEMO/IKKγ), and they phosphorylated TANK between amino acids 192 and 247, dependent on the interaction (data not shown). To investigate whether IKKε may be involved in regulating the ability of TANK to interact with NEMO/IKKγ, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged IKKε (Fig. 5 A,lane 1) or FLAG-TANK (lane 2) or combinations of both, using either wild type (lane 3) or a K38A kinase-dead (DN) muta"

We have identified the molecular lesion in ted3, a mutation that dominantly suppresses the phenotypes of det1-1. TED3 encodes a peroxisomal protein (AtPex2p) essential for Arabidopsis growth. Developmental defects and the abnormal expression of many genes in det1 are rescued by ted3. ted3 also partially suppresses another pleiotropic de-etiolated mutant cop1. Thus, peroxisomes, whose functions are still largely unexplored, play a key role in a photomorphogenetic pathway negatively regulated by the DET1 and COP proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2048735103,"Ro09-0198 (Ro) is a tetracyclic peptide antibiotic that binds specifically to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and causes cytolysis. To investigate the molecular basis of transbilayer movement of PE in biological membranes, we have isolated a series of budding yeast mutants that are hypersensitive to the Ro peptide. One of the most sensitive mutants, designated ros3(Ro-sensitive 3), showed no significant change in the cellular phospholipid composition or in the sensitivity to amphotericin B, a sterol-binding polyene macrolide antibiotic. These results suggest that the mutation of ros3affects the PE organization on the plasma membrane, rather than PE synthesis or overall organization of the membrane structures. By functional complementation screening, we identified the geneROS3 affected in the mutant, and we showed that the hypersensitive phenotype was caused by the defective expression of theROS3 gene product, Ros3p, an evolutionarily conserved protein with two putative transmembrane domains. Disruption of theROS3 gene resulted in a marked decrease in the internalization of fluorescence-labeled analogs of PE and phosphatidylcholine, whereas the uptake of fluorescence-labeled phosphatidylserine and endocytic markers was not affected. Neither expression levels nor activities of ATP-binding cassette transporters of the ros3Δ cells differed from those of wild type cells, suggesting that Ros3p is not related to the multidrug resistance activities. Immunochemical analyses of the structure and subcellular localization showed that Ros3p was a glycosylated membrane protein localized in both the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum, and that a part of Ros3p was associated with the detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes. These results indicate that Ros3p is a membrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in the phospholipid translocation across the plasma membrane.

In eukaryotic plasma membrane, aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)1 and phosphatidylserine (PS) reside predominantly in the inner leaflet, whereas phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingolipids are enriched in the outer leaflet (1Devaux P.F.

This transbilayer distribution of membrane lipids is not a static situation but is likely to be a result of the balance between the inward and outward translocation of phospholipids across the bilayer membranes (4Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The rapid translocation of phospholipids between the outer and the inner leaflets of plasma membranes has been detected in various mammalian and yeast cells by fluorescence-labeled or short-chain analogs of phospholipids (5Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5890-5898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Smith A.J. Timmermans-Hereijgers J.L. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W. van Blitterswijk W.J. Smit J.J.

In budding yeast, it is shown that the fluorescence-labeled analogs of phospholipids, including PC, PE, and PS, are translocated across the plasma membrane and that this translocation is not significantly prevented in the end and vps yeast mutants in which intracellular vesicular transport, including endocytosis, is impaired (8Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J.

Because the translocation reaction requires ATP and is sensitive to sulfhydryl-modifying reagents (8Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the movements of fluorescence-labeled phospholipids are likely to be facilitated by proteins. Several molecules have been suggested to mediate the transbilayer movements of phospholipids in yeast cells. Some members of yeast ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters, such as Ste6p (12Ruetz S. Brault M. Dalton W. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8180-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Pdr5p, and Yor1p (13Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), are shown to facilitate the ATP-dependent outward movement of phospholipid analogs as well as amphipathic drugs. For the inward-directed translocation, an integral membrane P-type ATPase, called Drs2p, was proposed to function as an aminophospholipid translocase, because disruption of yeastDRS2 gene resulted in a significant decrease of the internalization of fluorescence-labeled PS across the plasma membrane (14Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, several groups have failed to detect a difference between wild type and drs2Δ cells in the translocation of fluorescence-labeled phospholipids across the plasma membrane (10Marx U. Polakowski T. Pomorski T. Lang C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Herrmann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Siegmund A. Grant A. Angeletti C. Malone L.

Thus, at present, the molecular identity of the proteins involved in the inward-directed translocation of phospholipids still remains unknown. Ro is a 19-amino acid tetracyclic polypeptide that strictly recognizes the structure of PE and forms a tight equimolar complex with PE in biological membranes (16Wakamatsu K. Choung S.Y. Kobayashi T. Inoue K. Higashijima T. Miyazawa T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Umeda M. Emoto K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 101: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Ro peptide has become a useful tool in monitoring the transbilayer movement of PE in biological membranes (18Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Emoto K. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Karasuyama H. Inoue K. Umeda M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and in studying the functional role of PE in cytokinesis (20Emoto K. Kobayashi T. Yamaji A. Aizawa H. Yahara I. Inoue K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because Ro peptide specifically binds the cell surface PE and subsequently induces cytolysis (18Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the peptide is also useful for isolation of mutants with defective PE synthesis as variants that are resistant to the cytolytic activity of the peptide. We have previously isolated a peptide-resistant CHO-K1 cell mutant with specific decrease in cellular PE content, and we have shown that the mutant is defective in intramitochondrial transport of phosphatidylserine (23Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated a yeast mutant, designated asros3, that shows hypersensitivity to the Ro peptide. We found that the ros3 mutation was caused by defective expression of the ROS3 gene product, Ros3p, an evolutionarily conserved protein with two putative transmembrane domains. We have performed a detailed analysis of the structure, function, and subcellular localization of Ros3p, and we have shown that Ros3p is a unique transmembrane protein present in lipid rafts. Evidence that Ros3p plays an important role in regulating phospholipid translocation across the bilayer membranes is presented in this paper. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MHY501 (MATα his3 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3) was used for the construction of strains deleted for theROS3 gene. The media used are as follows: YPD, medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, and 2% glucose; SD, medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, and the required amino acids; SG, SD lacking glucose but containing 2% galactose; SC, SD lacking glucose but containing 2% sorbitol; SCNaN3, SC containing 20 mm sodium azide. Unless otherwise noted, the indicated strains were grown to early to mid-log phase at 30 °C. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method (24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate was carried out as described previously (25Lawrence C.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutagenized cells were plated for single colonies at 23 °C. Colonies were replicated onto YPD plates containing 10 μm Ro peptide and cultivated for 3 days at 30 °C. The negative colonies on the Ro-containing plate were isolated from the master YPD plates. For assays with lipid-binding toxins, mid-log phase cultures were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in YPD containing Ro peptide or amphotericin B (Sigma) at indicated concentrations. After 24 h incubation at 30 °C, sensitivity was determined by measuringA 600 of cultures. Sensitivity to other agents such as SDS, Triton X-100, and ethanol was also determined as described above. Mid-log phase cultures in YPD were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Phospholipids were extracted from the harvested cells (2–3 × 109 cells) and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography on silica plates. Solvent systems used for chromatography are as follows: first dimension, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid, 65:25:10 (v/v); and second dimension, chloroform/methanol/formic acid, 65:25:10 (v/v). The amounts of phospholipids were determined as described previously (26Satoh O. Umeda M. Imai H. Tunoo H. Inoue K. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1293-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ROS3 gene was identified by its ability to complement the sensitivity to Ro peptide of the ros3 mutant. The ros3 mutant was transformed with the yeast genomic library, YCp50, which contains the selection marker URA3 and the CEN element. Candidate ROS3 clones were identified based on their ability to recover growth in the presence of 10 μm Ro peptide. Only one plasmid was isolated, and it was designated pS3. The pS3 contained an ∼6.4-kb insert that was a portion of chromosome XIV spanning the upstream of the ORF YNL323W through approximately two-thirds of the ORF YNL320W. There are three full-length ORFs within this region, YNL323W (LEM3), YNL322W (KRE1), and an uncharacterized ORF YNL321W. To identify the complementary region of the ros3 mutant, the 6.4-kb insert was cut into two fragments. One was the 2.2-kb fragment containing the full-lengthLEM3 gene and half of the KRE1 gene by digestion with SalI and KpnI. Another was the 4.2-kb fragment containing the other half of the KRE1 gene, the full-length YNL321W, and a portion of the ORF YNL320W by digestion withKpnI and HindIII. The pS3-I carries theSalI/KpnI fragment from pS3 in the pRS416 (URA3 and CEN) vector. The pS3-II carries theKpnI/HindIII fragment from pS3 in the pRS416 vector. These plasmids were transformed into the ros3mutant, and the ability to restore the growth of the ros3mutant on the plates containing 10 μm Ro peptide was examined. Polyclonal antibodies against Ros3p were raised in New Zealand White female rabbits against the synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal sequence MVNFDLGQVGEVFRRKDKGC, according to the method described previously (27Harada A. Furuta B. Takeuchi K. Itakura M. Takahashi M. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36885-36891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Antibodies were isolated from the immune sera of the rabbits by affinity chromatography on a synthetic peptide-conjugated SulfoLink column (Pierce). TheSalI/KpnI fragment from pS3 was subcloned into a pUC119 vector. The HpaI fragment between nucleotides 210 and 740 was replaced with the HIS3 gene, which was digested withBamHI from pYAC3 vector and the end blunted with T4 polymerase. The resulting plasmid was cut with AccIII andNcoI, and then the digest was transformed into MHY501. The deletion of chromosomal ROS3 gene was confirmed by PCR analysis using oligonucleotides specific to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the open reading frame within ROS3 gene. The DNA amplification product from the ROS3-deleted strain (ros3Δstrain) was ∼1.2-kb pair larger than the product obtained from the parental strain. The PCR product from the ros3Δ strain was digested by HindIII into three fragments, whereas the product from the wild type was not digested (Fig. 4 A), confirming that the ROS3::HIS3 fragment was integrated into the predicted site of chromosome. 1-Myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl) phosphatidylethanolamine (C6-NBD-PE), 1-myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl) phosphatidylcholine (C6-NBD-PC), and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) were from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 1-Myristoyl-2-(6-NBD-aminocaproyl)phosphatidylserine (C6-NBD-PS) was synthesized from C6-NBD-PC by phospholipase D (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan)-catalyzed transphosphatidylation (28Kato S. Kokusho Y. Machida H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1984; 48: 2181-2188Google Scholar) and purified. To prepare vesicles, lipids were mixed in desired proportions (40 mol % C6-NBD-PE, PC, or PS, 60 mol % DOPC), and chloroform was removed by evaporation followed by vacuum desiccation. The resulting lipid film was solubilized in SC medium, and the mixture was passed seven times through a LiposoFast-Basic Stabilizer (Avestin, Inc., Ottawa, Canada) equipped with 0.1-μm filters to produce evenly sized vesicles. Total lipid concentration in the stock solution was 1 mm. Fluorescence-labeled phospholipids internalization experiments were performed as described by Kean et al. (9Kean L.S. Grant A.M. Angeletti C. Mahe Y. Kuchler K. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures in SD (A 600 = 0.3–0.8) were diluted to 107 cells/ml in fresh SD medium. Cells were then incubated with vesicles containing 40% C6-NBD-phospholipids and 60% DOPC (50 μmtotal lipid concentration) with shaking for 30 min at 30 °C. For ATP depletion experiments, cells were resuspended in SCNaN3containing required amino acids and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before addition of vesicles. After washing the cells three times with ice-cold SCNaN3 on ice, they were observed in a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with 100× Planneofluar oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd., Oberkochen, Germany). Micrographs were taken with Fuji NEOPAN 1600 film. Flow cytometric analyses of the internalization of C6-NBD-phospholipid into cells was performed with a FACScan cytometer and CellQuest software (BD PharMingen) as described previously (29Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). FM4-64 and Lucifer yellow carbohydrazide (LY-CH) were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cell staining with these dyes was examined following the methods by Vida and Emr (30Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) and Dulic and Riezman (31Dulic V. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar). A Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope using a 543-nm laser line for FM4-64 fluorescence and a 458-nm laser line for LY-CH was used for the observation. Images were analyzed with LSM510 version 2.02 (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptTM Choice System for cDNA Synthesis (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) with the supplied oligo(dT)12–18 primer. 25 ng of cDNA was used for each subsequent PCR. For drug resistance assay, cycloheximide, 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, miconazole, and ketoconazole were from Sigma. 10 mg/ml stock solutions were made by dissolving the drugs in dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol. In the case of liquid medium, drug sensitivity was determined as described above. Harvested cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in SDS buffer containing 1/20th volume of 2-mercaptoethanol, and glass beads were added. Disruption of cells was carried out with vortex mixer 7 times for 30 s, and solutions were kept on ice. Lysates were boiled for 5 min, centrifuged to clear the cell debris, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. Protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). For endoglycosidase H treatment, the total cell lysates were added to and equal volume of 0.15 mcitrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and 0.1 unit/ml endoglycosidase (Seikagaku Corp.). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C. To create a fusion protein of Ros3p with EGFP, EGFP was digested with BamHI andNotI from pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The 3′-uncoding region of theROS3 gene was amplified from pS3 plasmid by PCR using an upper primer added NotI site (5′-TAATCATTGCGGCCGCAAAAGGAGTGATGGTTTTCTTTAT-3′) and a lower primer T3 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′). TheNotI/KpnI-digested 3′-uncoding region was ligated with BamHI/NotI-digested EGFP fragment and subcloned to pRS416 vector (EGFP-3′-pRS416). The 5′ promoter region ofROS3 and the coding region, lacking stop codon (5′-ROS3*), was amplified from pS3 plasmid using an upper primer T7 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and a lower primer addedBamHI site (5′-GCTGGATCCGCTTTCATATTCCATGACAAACTTGA-3′). TheSalI/BamHI-digested 5′-ROS3* fragment was inserted into the SalI/BamHI site of the EGFP-3′-pRS416 plasmid. The resulting plasmid (5′-ROS3*-EGFP-3′ in pRS416) contained EGFP-fused Ros3p at its carboxyl terminus under the control of the ROS3 promoter, and it was transformed into the ros3Δ strain. For microscopy, Ros3p-EGFP strain was cultured to early log phase at 20 or 30 °C and observed with Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope using a 488-nm laser line. Images were analyzed with LSM510 version 2.02 (Carl Zeiss). The plasma membrane was isolated as described (32Serrano R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The isolation of detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs) was performed according to the method described by Bagnat et al. (33Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, mid-log phase cultures (equal to ∼1 × 109 cells) were disrupted with glass beads. The lysates were mixed with an equal volume of TNE buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min on ice. After removal of cell debris, the detergent-treated lysates were added with 50% Opti-Prep (Sigma), TNE, 1% Triton X-100, to adjust to 35% Opti-Prep, and overlaid with 30% Opti-Prep, TNE, 1% Triton X-100, and TNE, 1% Triton X-100. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 7.5 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. Nine fractions of equal volume were collected from the top, precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid, and resuspended in SDS buffer. Western blotting analysis was performed as described above. Rabbit anti-Pma1p was a gift from R. Serrano (Universidad Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain). Rabbit anti-Gas1p, -Wbp1, and -Emp47p were provided from H. Riezman (University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). Mouse anti-Por1p was purchased from Molecular Probes. Ro09-0198 is a tetracyclic peptide that binds specifically to PE in biological membranes and subsequently induces cytolysis (18Aoki Y. Uenaka T. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Emoto K. Kuge O. Nishijima M. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12400-12405Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To isolate mutants with an altered PE organization on the plasma membrane, we selected a series of S. cerevisiae mutants that were hypersensitive to the peptide-induced cytolysis. We screened ∼55,000 mutagenized colonies and identified 17ros (Rosensitive) mutants. One of the mutants, designated ros3, was most sensitive to the peptide-induced cytolysis, and the LD50 of the peptide for the ros3 mutant was approximately one-tenth compared with wild type cells (Fig. 1 A). There was no significant difference between the mutant and wild type cells in their cellular phospholipid compositions (TableI) or in the sensitivities to various agents such as amphotericin B, a polyene macrolide antibiotic that binds to membrane ergosterol and induces cellular leakage (34Brajtburg J. Powderly W.G. Kobayashi G.S. Medoff G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B), detergents (SDS and Triton X-100), and ethanol (data not shown). These results suggest that the hypersensitivity of theros3 mutant to the peptide resulted from an altered organization of PE on the plasma membrane and not from an increased cellular PE content nor from cell wall leakage caused by impaired cell wall integrity.Table IPhospholipid composition of ros3 mutant strains1-aros3 mutant strain.% total phospholipidsPEPCPIPSMHY50124.9 ± 1.237.9 ± 1.423.5 ± 0.513.6 ± 0.1ros3 1-aros3 mutant strain.21.1 ± 1.141.6 ± 3.423.4 ± 1.213.9 ± 1.1ros3Δ1-bROS3 deleted strain.23.2 ± 2.140.2 ± 2.520.6 ± 0.716.0 ± 1.3Numbers in table are expressed as percent of total phospholipids ± S.D. for three independent experiments.1-a ros3 mutant strain.1-b ROS3 deleted strain.

The gene affected in theros3 mutant was cloned by complementation of the peptide hypersensitive phenotype after transformation with a genomic library (35Rose M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment that complemented the ros3 mutant contains four ORFs (Fig. 2 A). Subcloning experiments indicated that the short fragment derived fromKpnI digestion was able to complement, but the other long fragment was not (Fig. 2 A). These results demonstrate that YNL323W (GenBankTM accession number, Z71599),which is also named as LEM3 (36Sitcheran R. Emter R. Kralli A. Yamamoto K.R. Genetics. 2000; 156: 963-972PubMed Google Scholar) and BRE3 (37Muren E. Oyen M. Barmark G. Ronne H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is the gene that complements the ros3 mutant. In this study, we refer to the gene as ROS3. ROS3 encodes a protein of 414 amino acids that contains two putative transmembrane domains (Fig.2 B). Data base search revealed two genes with high similarity to ROS3, CDC50 (GenBankTMaccession number, X59720, 40% identity in deduced amino acid sequence) and YNR048W (GenBankTM accession number, Z71663, 38% identity) in yeast genome (Fig. 2 C). In addition, theROS3 genes are conserved in various organisms including worm (GenBankTM accession number, U61953, 30% identity in deduced amino acid sequence), fly (GenBankTM accession number, AE003502, 33% identity), and mammals (GenBankTMaccession number, AA238841, 27% identity), suggesting thatROS3 homologs constitute a large gene family that has been well conserved during evolution. To examine further whether the ros3 mutant shows impaired expression of the ROS3 gene product, we produced a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal amino acids 1–19 of Ros3p. In immunoblotting, the affinity-purified anti-Ros3p antibody bound specifically to a 62-kDa protein in the wild type cells, whereas no protein band was detected in the ros3 mutant (Fig.3 A). The observed relative molecular mass was larger than that predicted by the primary structure (47.4-kDa), but the treatment of cell lysate with endoglycosidase H resulted in the reduction of molecular mass to 47.5-kDa which is fully compatible with the predicted mass (Fig. 3 B). Because the 62-kDa protein was not present in the lysate of theROS3-deleted strain (see below) (Fig. 3 A), these results clearly demonstrate that the 62-kDa protein is Ros3p and that the mutation of ros3 is caused by the defective expression of Ros3p. Ros3p was not extracted with 1 m NaCl, 2m urea, and 0.1 m NaCO3 (pH 11.0) but was partially extracted with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that Ros3p is a glycosylated transmembrane protein, which is consistent with the predicted structure of the protein that has two putative membrane-spanning domains and six possible glycosylation sites (Fig. 2 B). To examine the cellular function of Ros3p, we disrupted the ROS3 gene inS. cerevisiae by the replacement of a 531-bp internal HpaI fragment with 1,768-kb fragment encoding the yeast HIS3 gene as shown in Fig.4 A. The deletion of chromosomal ROS3 gene was confirmed by PCR analysis using oligonucleotides specific to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the open reading frame within ROS3. The ROS3-deleted strain (ros3Δ strain) could not grow on the YPD plate containing 10 μm Ro peptide, and the ROS3 gene on a single copy plasmid suppressed this sensitivity (Fig. 4 B). The ros3Δ strain also showed similar phospholipid composition (Table I) and amphotericin B sensitivity with those observed with the ros3 mutant (data not shown). To understand the role of Ros3p in PE organization in the plasma membrane, we examined the transport and localization of C6-NBD-PE, a fluorescence-labeled analog of PE molecule, in the ros3Δ strain. It was shown previously that yeast cells incubated with lipid vesicles containing C6-NBD-PE inte"
https://openalex.org/W1992439000,"We reported increased water permeability and a low urea reflection coefficient in Xenopus oocytes expressing urea transporter UT-B (former name UT3), suggesting that water and urea share a common aqueous pathway (Yang, B., and Verkman, A. S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 9369–9372). Although increased water permeability was confirmed in theXenopus oocyte expression system, it has been argued (Sidoux-Walter, F., Lucien, N., Olives, B., Gobin, R., Rousselet, G., Kamsteeg, E.

Chem. 274, 30228–30235) that UT-B does not transport water when expressed at normal levels in mammalian cells such as erythrocytes. To quantify UT-B-mediated water transport, we generated double knockout mice lacking UT-B and the major erythrocyte water channel, aquaporin-1 (AQP1). The mice had reduced survival, retarded growth, and defective urinary concentrating ability. However, erythrocyte size and morphology were not affected. Stopped-flow light scattering measurements indicated erythrocyte osmotic water permeabilities (in cm/s × 0.01, 10 °C): 2.1 ± 0.2 (wild-type mice), 2.1 ± 0.05 (UT-B null), 0.19 ± 0.02 (AQP1 null), and 0.045 ± 0.009 (AQP1/UT-B null). The low water permeability found in AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes was also seen after HgCl2 treatment of UT-B null erythrocytes or phloretin treatment of AQP1 null erythrocytes. The apparent activation energy for UT-B-mediated water transport was low, <2 kcal/mol. Estimating 14,000 UT-B molecules per mouse erythrocyte, the UT-B-dependent Pf of 0.15 × 10−4 cm/s indicated a substantial single channel water permeability of UT-B of 7.5 × 10−14cm3/s, similar to that of AQP1. These results provide direct functional evidence for UT-B-facilitated water transport in erythrocytes and suggest that urea traverses an aqueous pore in the UT-B protein.

Transgenic mice lacking UT-B also have very low erythrocyte urea permeability (45-fold lower than normal) and were found to have a urea-selective urinary concentrating defect (4Yang B. Bankir L.

Members of a related family of facilitated urea transporters (UT-A) are expressed primarily in kidney and are encoded by a different gene producing multiple protein isoforms by alternative splicing (10Nakayama Y. Naruse M. Karakashian A. Peng T. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1518: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Bagnasco S.M. Peng T. Janech M.G. Karakashian A.

Physiol. 2002; 282: F630-F638Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In screening membrane transporters for intrinsic water permeability, we found that UT-B (but not UT-A isoforms) increased osmotically driven water transport when expressed heterologously in Xenopusoocytes (13Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UT-B-facilitated water transport was blocked by urea transport inhibitors, and reflection coefficient measurements indicated a common water/urea pathway. Increased water permeability inXenopus oocytes expressing UT-B was subsequently confirmed by Sidoux-Walter et al. (14Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Olives B. Gobin R. Rousselet G. Kamsteeg E.J. Ripoche P. Deen P.M. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30228-30235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, they concluded that UT-B-facilitated water transport does not occur under physiological conditions. They reasoned, based on water versus urea permeability measurements in oocytes expressing different levels of UT-B, that UT-B-associated water permeability occurs only when UT-B expressed at non-physiological high levels. The issue has remained unsettled as to whether UT-B can transport water in natively UT-B expressing cells such as erythrocytes. The mechanism of water transport in erythrocytes has been a subject of long-standing interest. Although it is now established from measurements in AQP1 null erythrocytes that AQP1 provides the major pathway for water transport (15Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), there remains unsubstantiated older evidence that erythrocytes have significant protein-mediated mercurial-insensitive water permeability that is presumably AQP1-independent (18Dix J.A. Solomon A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There is also older conflicting data about whether some water and urea share a common pathway across the erythrocyte plasma membrane with a wide range of reported urea reflection coefficients (ςurea) from <0.5 to 1.0 (19Levitt D.G. Mlekoday H.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Mayrand R.R. Levitt D.G. J. Gen.

Acta. 1985; 821: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Technically, the high urea permeability in erythrocytes probably precludes an accurate biophysical determination of ςurea. The value of ςurea must be near 1.0 if water moves only through AQP1 and membrane lipids, because AQP1 has been shown to be urea-impermeable (23Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 24van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if some water moves through a common aqueous pathway through UT-B shared by urea, then ςurea might be less than 1.0. The purpose of this study was to resolve the question of whether UT-B transports water in erythrocytes and hence whether the UT-B protein contains an aqueous pore and whether erythrocyte ςurea must be near unity. We generated double knockout mice lacking UT-B and AQP1, reasoning that UT-B-mediated water transport might be measurable in erythrocytes lacking the principal erythrocyte water transporter, AQP1. We found significantly reduced water permeability in AQP1/UT-B-deficient erythrocytes compared with AQP1-deficient erythrocytes, providing quantitative information on the single channel water permeability of UT-B. A secondary purpose of this study was to investigate urinary concentrating ability in mice lacking AQP1 and UT-B together. As in erythrocytes, AQP1 and UT-B are coexpressed in microvascular endothelial cell membranes in descending renal vasa recta. We hypothesized that the double knockout mice may have a profound urinary concentrating defect because of extensive disruption of the countercurrent multiplication and exchange mechanisms. AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice were generated by intercross of the single AQP1 and UT-B knockouts. The breeding of F2 generation double heterozygous mice yielded 11 AQP1/UT-B knockout mice of 270 pups. Fresh erythrocytes obtained by tail bleeding (∼50 μl/bleed) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove plasma and the cellular buffy coat. Stopped-flow measurements were done on a Hi-Tech Sf-51 instrument. Suspensions of erythrocytes (∼0.5% hematocrit) in phosphate-buffered saline were subjected to a 250-mm inwardly directed gradient of sucrose. The kinetics of decreasing cell volume was measured from the time course of 90° scattered light intensity at 530 nm wavelength. Osmotic water permeability coefficients (Pf) were computed from the light scattering time course as described previously (24van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18267-18269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, 0.3 mm HgCl2 or 0.7 mm phloretin was added to the erythrocyte suspension before stopped-flow experiments. Erythrocyte number, hematocrit, and mean cell volume were measured by the Hematology Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital. For light microscopy, blood cells were smeared onto glass slides and stained with eosin y-methylene blue using the HEMA3 stain set (Biochemical Sciences Inc.). Red blood cell smears on glass slides were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1) and incubated for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then with anti-AQP1 (1:1000) or UT-B antiserum (1:500) for 1 h at 23 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Slides were rinsed with 2.7% NaCl followed by phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a secondary Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit F(ab)2 fragment (1:200, Sigma) for visualization by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis of ghost membranes from erythrocytes, prepared by hypotonic lysis and washing, was carried out by standard procedures as described (25Yang B. Fukuda N. van Hoek A. Matthay M.A., Ma, T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For analysis of urine osmolalities, urine samples were collected by gentle bladder massage. Urine osmolalities were measured by freezing point depression osmometry (Micro-osmometer, Precision Systems, Inc.). AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice were generated by intercross of AQP1 and UT-B null mice. The double knockout mice were grossly phenotypically normal just after birth. Of 270 mice born in 32 litters from breeding of double heterozygous mice, there were 11 double knockout mice, consistent with the predicted 1:16 Mendelian ratio. However, the growth and survival of the double knockout mice were impaired. Fig. 1 A shows that the double knockout mice were ∼30% smaller by body weight than wild-type littermates at age 11 days. Although >90% of living AQP1 and UT-B null mice that were genotyped at 5 days remained alive to adulthood, only 50% of the double knockout mice were alive at 10 days, and all double knockout mice died by 2 weeks. Urinary concentrating function was compared by measurement of urine osmolality. As shown in Fig. 1 B, urine osmolality in double knockout mice (553 ± 55 mosm) was similar to that in AQP1 knockout mice (604 ± 18 mosm) but significantly lower than in wild-type mice (816 ± 34 mosm). Because of the small size of the mice, detailed serum analyses were not done. Blood was analyzed for erythrocyte number, size, and AQP1 and UT-B expression. Table I summarizes peripheral blood analysis. Erythrocyte number and hematocrit were slightly greater in AQP1 and AQP1/UT-B null mice than wild-type and UT-B null mice, which may be a consequence of relative mild dehydration. The mean corpuscular size was not significantly different among the genotypes. Morphology was similar in erythrocytes from mice of the four genotypes as examined in stained smears by light microscopy (Fig.2 A, top panels).Table IHematological properties of erythrocytesGenotypeRBCHCTMCV× 106/μl%fLWild type8.0 ± 0.540.2 ± 2.650.6 ± 1.2AQP1 −/−8.9 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.46.3 ± 1.449.6 ± 1.4UT-B −/−8.4 ± 0.543.6 ± 2.152.4 ± 2.1AQP1/UT-B −/−9.2 ± 0.11-ap < 0.05 compared to wild-type.45.5 ± 1.152.3 ± 2.9Data are mean ± S.E.M. for five sets of measurements on erythrocytes from different mice.

Immunocytochemistry of the permeabilized erythrocytes showed a plasma membrane staining pattern for AQP1 protein in erythrocytes from wild-type and UT-B null mice (Fig. 2 A, middle panels). Examination of multiple smears showed similar AQP1 staining in the wild-type and UT-B null mice. No AQP1 staining was seen in AQP1 and AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes. Comparable UT-B immunostaining was seen in erythrocytes from wild-type and AQP1 null mice (Fig.2 A, bottom panels). The weaker UT-Bversus AQP1 staining is because of lower UT-B expression and differences in antibodies. No UT-B immunostaining was seen in UT-B and AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes. Immunoblot analysis confirmed these findings (Fig. 2 B). AQP1 protein was seen in erythrocyte membranes from wild-type and UT-B null mice as a band at ∼28 kDa, representing non-glycosylated protein and a more diffuse band at 34–40 kDa representing the glycosylated protein. UT-B protein was seen as a band of 40–46 kDa in erythrocytes from wild-type and AQP1 null mice. An ∼90-kDa nonspecific band was seen in erythrocytes of all genotypes. Osmotic water permeability was measured by stopped-flow light scattering from the time course of scattered light intensity in response to a 250-mm inwardly directed osmotic gradient of sucrose. The light scattering signal amplitude is inversely related to erythrocyte cell volume. Representative original light scattering data are shown for erythrocytes from mice of the four genotypes in Fig.3 A under control conditions and after brief incubation with the AQP1 inhibitor, HgCl2, and the UT-B inhibitor, phloretin. Experiments were done initially at a low temperature (10 °C) where the strongly temperature-dependent lipid-mediated water permeability should be minimized. The data are presented on two contiguous time scales to show clearly the initial rate of decreasing cell volume as well as the maximal signal change after full osmotic equilibration. Osmotic equilibration was rapid (∼250 ms) in wild-type and UT-B null mice. Water permeability was reduced ∼11-fold in AQP1-deficient erythrocytes and further reduced ∼4.2-fold in AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes. The AQP1 inhibitor HgCl2 reduced water permeability strongly in wild-type and UT-B null erythrocytes but had no effect on water permeability in AQP1 and AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes. Notably, water permeability was similar in UT-B and AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes after HgCl2 inhibition. The urea transport inhibitor, phloretin, had little effect on water transport in erythrocytes from wild-type, UT-B, and AQP1/UT-B null mice; however, there was partial inhibition of water permeability in AQP1 null erythrocytes. The decrease in scattered light intensity at late times probably represents slow sucrose (and water) influx due to perturbation of the membrane by phloretin. There was less of a decrease at late times using 0.1 mm phloretin (instead of 0.7 mm) but similar inhibition of water permeability in AQP1 null erythrocytes. Averaged data are summarized in Fig. 3 B. Erythrocytes from wild-type and UT-B null mice had high water permeability (Pf ∼ 0.02 cm/s) that was not inhibited significantly by phloretin. Water permeability in AQP1 null erythrocytes (Pf ∼0.0019 cm/s) was similar to that in wild-type erythrocytes after HgCl2. Water permeability in AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes was quite low (Pf ∼0.00045 cm/s), insensitive to inhibitors, and similar to that in UT-B null erythrocytes after HgCl2and in AQP1 null erythrocytes after phloretin. Together these data provide strong evidence for UT-B-facilitated water transport in erythrocytes. Temperature dependence measurements were done to further investigate the mechanisms of erythrocyte water transport and the nature of UT-B-facilitated water transport. Fig.4 A shows representative original light scattering data for erythrocyte water permeability at four temperatures. Water transport was fast in erythrocytes from wild-type and UT-B null mice and weakly temperature-dependent. The lower water permeability in AQP1 null erythrocytes was more strongly temperature-dependent, increasing ∼3-fold from 10 to 35 °C. Water permeability in AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes was even more strongly temperature-dependent, increasing ∼9-fold from 10 to 35 °C. Fig. 4 B (top) summarizes the data as an Arrhenius plot of ln Pf versusreciprocal absolute temperature, where the slope is proportional to the activation energy Ea. Pfwas weakly temperature-dependent for wild-type and UT-B null erythrocytes. Stronger temperature dependence was observed in AQP1 null erythrocytes (apparent Ea 7.3 kcal/mol) and AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes (Ea 19 kcal/mol). The high Ea of 19 kcal/mol strongly suggests water diffusion through the lipid bilayer. Fig. 4 B (bottom) shows an Arrhenius plot in which the temperature dependence of the UT-B-mediated component of erythrocyte water permeability (Pf UT-B) was computed from the difference in Pf measured in AQP1 nullversus AQP1/UT-B null erythrocytes.Ea for the UT-B-mediated water permeability was <2 kcal/mol, providing biophysical evidence for a water passage through a UT-B-associated aqueous channel. This study reports direct functional evidence that UT-B in mammalian erythrocytes is able to transport water. We found that osmotic water permeability in erythrocytes from mice lacking both AQP1 and UT-B was 4.2-fold lower than that in erythrocytes from mice lacking AQP1 alone. A similar low water permeability was found in erythrocytes from AQP1 null mice after UT-B inhibition by phloretin and in erythrocytes from UT-B null mice after inhibition of AQP1 by HgCl2. UT-B-facilitated water transport was weakly temperature-dependent, as found in Xenopusoocytes expressing UT-B (13Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results explain why the activation energy of erythrocyte water transport after mercurial inhibition or AQP1 deletion is substantially lower than expected for lipid-mediated water transport (26Macey R.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C195-C203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also provide a molecular basis for the conclusion of Dix and Solomon (18Dix J.A. Solomon A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), based on studies of membrane perturbing agents, that the mercurial-insensitive water permeability in erythrocytes involves in large part a protein pathway. Based on the quantitative data here, Fig.5 summarizes the contributions of protein and lipid pathways for water and urea transport in mouse erythrocytes. At 10 °C, ∼90% of water is transported through AQP1, 8% through UT-B, and the remainder through the lipid membrane. The vast majority of urea is transported through UT-B. At 37 °C, ∼79% of water is transported through AQP1, 6% through UT-B, and the remainder through the lipid membrane. The results obtained here using a genetic approach permit computation of a lower limit for erythrocyte ςurea. Using the data in Fig. 5 and assuming a ςurea of zero for UT-B-mediated water transport, erythrocyte ςurea is predicted to be 0.92. This is probably a significant underestimate of erythrocyte ςurea because ςurea for UT-B-mediated water transport is at least 0.3 based on oocyte data (13Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), giving erythrocyte ςurea ∼0.95. These values are consistent with the data of Levitt and Mllekoday (19Levitt D.G. Mlekoday H.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), reporting a ςurea of near unity, but disagree with low ςurea values of 0.5–0.7 reported in a series of studies by Solomon and colleagues (18Dix J.A. Solomon A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 773: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Chasan B. Solomon A.K. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1996; 153: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), where ςurea was probably underestimated because of the confounding effect of rapid diffusional urea transport. Urine osmolalities in AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice and AQP1 null mice were similar, indicating that impairment of vasa recta water and urea transport together does not produce a profound nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with hypotonic urine as found in mice lacking AQP3 (17Yang B., Ma, T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J Verkman A.S. Proc.

However, the limited survival of the double knockout mice precluded studies of urinary concentrating ability in adult mice after maximal urinary concentrating function has developed.

Exp. Nephrol. 2002; 10: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The urea-selective urinary concentrating defect in UT-B null mice appears to result from impairment of urea recycling from the renal medullary interstitium to the descending vasa recta (4Yang B. Bankir L. Gillespie A. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10633-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recognizing the caveat that adult double knockout mice could not be studied, our finding that the urinary concentrating defect in AQP1/UT-B is similar to that in AQP1 null mice suggests that little urea recycling occurs after disruption of the medullary concentration gradients of NaCl and urea. It is interesting to compare the intrinsic (single channel) water permeabilities of AQP1 versus UT-B. We measured similar osmotic water and urea permeabilities in mouse and human erythrocytes (not shown). Assuming, as in human erythrocytes, that there are 14,000 copies of UT-B and 200,000 copies of AQP1 (9Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Roudier N. Ripoche P. Huet M. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Cartron J.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34101-34108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) per mouse erythrocyte plasma membrane, then there is ∼1 UT-B molecule per 14 AQP1 molecules. From the data in Fig. 3, AQP1 contributes 13 times more than UT-B to erythrocyte water permeability. Thus, the single channel (per molecule) water permeability of UT-B in erythrocytes is very similar to that of AQP1 (7.5 × 10−14 cm3/s). The presence of a continuous aqueous pathway through UT-B that efficiently facilitates osmosis is an interesting observation that may account for the exceptionally high transport turnover rate of UT-B (2–6 × 106 s−1, Ref. 34Mannuzzu L.M. Moronne M.M. Macey R.I. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 133: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as high as that of ion channels and >2–3 orders of magnitude greater than that of classic carriers and active transporters. Atomic resolution structural analysis of UT-B, as recently completed for AQP1 (35Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), should define the aqueous pore traversing the UT-B protein. The AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice generated for the experiments here had significant impairment in their growth compared with single knockout mice deficient in AQP1 or UT-B. The AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice died in their first 2 weeks of life. The reason(s) for the impaired growth and survival of AQP1/UT-B null mice were not established from the data presented here. AQP1 is expressed in erythrocytes, as well as in epithelial cells in kidney, choroid plexus, ciliary body, and in multiple endothelial capillaries including renal vasa recta. UT-B is expressed in erythrocytes, urinary bladder epithelium, brain astrocytes, renal vasa recta endothelia, and as yet unidentified sites in colon, heart, liver, and testis (1Olives B. Neau P.

With no evidence of hemolysis (normal hematocrit, reticulocyte count, serum haptoglobin, and lactate dehydrogenase), it seems unlikely that defective erythrocyte function is responsible for impaired mouse growth and survival. Defective urinary concentrating ability may be responsible for failure of the double knockout mice to thrive, based on the observation that mouse kidneys readily develop obstructive renal failure after polyuria, as found in transgenic mice lacking functional aquaporins 2 and 3 (17Yang B., Ma, T.

We did not investigate in detail the cause of impaired survival in AQP1/UT-B double knockout mice, given the focus of this study on erythrocyte UT-B function. In summary, the data here indicate that erythrocyte UT-B functions as an efficient water transporter, although the absolute contribution of UT-B to total water transport in normal erythrocytes is small because of the fewer copies of UT-B than AQP1. Although we believe that water movement through UT-B is unlikely to be physiologically important in erythrocytes, kidney, or other tissues in which UT-B is expressed, we propose that the aqueous pore through UT-B is important in its highly efficient urea transport function. Mutagenesis and structural studies should be informative in this regard. We thank Dr. L. Vetrivel for help in computations and Liman Qian for mouse breeding."

Here we show that NGF treatment rapidly translocates RhoA from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and simultaneously decreases RhoA affinity to its target Rho-associated kinase (ROK), a key mediator of neurite outgrowth. This effect was transient, because after 2 days of NGF treatment, RhoA relocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and its GTP loading returned to a level found in undifferentiated cells.

Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K significantly reduced NGF- mediated Rac1 activation, whereas dominant negative Rac1 abolished the inhibitory signaling to RhoA.

RhoA plays an important role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, cell transformation, and membrane trafficking (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 2Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Welsh C.F. Assoian R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M21-M29PubMed Google Scholar). RhoA cycles between the GDP-bound inactive and active forms. Three classes of molecules are known to interact and regulate GDP/GTP cycling of RhoA: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1 catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP and also stabilize cytosolic RhoA form binding GTP (2Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). For RhoA to transmit signals, two criteria must be satisfied: first, it must in a GTP-loaded form; second, RhoA, which is geranylgeranylated, must be in the right signaling compartment attached to the plasma membrane, where it can interact with its regulators and targets. Thus, RhoA in its GTP-bound active form associates with the inner surface of the plasma membrane (4Noguchi Y. Nakamura S. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. Hirai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3649-3653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas GDI-mediated inactivation of RhoA translocates it to the cytoplasm and prevents it from binding to GTP. The role of RhoA during neuronal differentiation was first suggested by studies using the Rho-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 toxin (Clostridium botulinum C3 Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme), which induces neurite outgrowth in naive (not treated with NGF) PC12 cells (5Nishiki T.

Furthermore, RhoA has been shown to be involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth (6Tigyi G. Miledi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we found that expression of activated V14RhoA mutant prevented NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In contrast, dominant negative RhoA (N19RhoA) expression led to an increase in neurite initiation and branching. Furthermore, RhoA was shown to have a dual role during neuronal differentiation. Inactivation of RhoA appears necessary for the initiation of neuronal differentiation, although during later stages of neurite elongation, introduction of N19RhoA causes the formation of short neurites (11Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest an important role of RhoA in NGF-induced neuronal morphogenesis, little is known about the signal transduction pathways that couple NGF signaling to RhoA. In their active forms, RhoA proteins interact with and modulate the activity of effector proteins that include the serine/threonine protein kinase N (p120, PKN), p160 RhoA-associated kinase ROKα (ROK or ROCK-II), p150 RhoA-binding kinase ROKβ (ROCK-I), citron-K, and nonkinases rhophilin, rhotekin, citron-N, and p140mDia (12Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Among these, ROK has been shown to mediate the formation of stress fibers, focal adhesions, regulation of myosin phosphorylation, and c-fos expression (for review, see Ref. 14Amano M. Fukata Y. Kaibuchi K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of ROK is sufficient to induce neurite retraction in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (15Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rac1 is an essential mediator of axonal growth, guidance, and branching (8Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S.

Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar), linking these GTPases into a system that regulates almost all aspects of cytoskeletal organization. However, this activation cascade appears to be a cell type-specific phenomenon; and in neuronal cells, Rac1 and RhoA, although both activable by Cdc42, have opposing effects on neurite outgrowth (8Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effect of NGF treatment on the GTP loading and membrane association of RhoA during the initiation and elongation phase of neuronal differentiation. We show that NGF through its TrkA receptor transiently inhibits RhoA signaling, as evidenced by its cytoplasmic translocation and diminished ability to interact with ROKα. However, during the elongation phase of neuronal differentiation, 2 days after NGF treatment, RhoA was relocated to the plasma membrane and its activation state returned to the control level. We provide evidence that TrkA, independently from Ras-mediated signaling, regulates PI3K, which through the small GTPase Rac1 mediates RhoA inactivation, which is a permissive signal for the initiation of neurite outgrowth. The present results establish an inhibitory coupling between the TrkA and RhoA through a novel negative regulatory mechanism connecting Rac1 to RhoA in PC12 cells. Wild-type PC12 cells and the M-M17-26 clone, which stably expresses dominant negative Ras mutant, were kindly provided by Dr. G. Cooper (Boston University, Boston, MA). The TrkA-deficient nnr5 clone was provided by Dr. L. A. Green (Columbia University, New York). B5 cells derived from nnr5 overexpressing TrkA were a gift from Dr. Susan Meakin (Robarts Research Institute, Ontario, Canada). All of these clones were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% glutamine (normal medium). To initiate differentiation, 7 × 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes in normal medium and exposed to 100 ng/ml NGF (Alamone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Under these conditions, more than 75% of the wild-type PC12 and B5 cells extended neurites by day 2. Wild-type PC12 cells were transiently transfected with either dominant negative Rac1 construct (pN17Rac1-IRES-GFP) or empty vector (pMX-IRES-GFP) using the Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad). Plasmid (2 μg) and 20 μl of Cytofectene reagent were used for every ml of transfection solution. After exposing the cells to this mixture for 8 h, cells were grown in normal medium. Expression of GFP was detected, and pictures of cells expressing GFP were taken using fluorescence microscopy. Between days 3 and 6 after transfection, 80% of cells expressed GFP; therefore, NGF treatment was carried out between postransfection days 3–6. Briefly, after NGF treatment, cells were rinsed with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 450 μl of lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma. This lysate was incubated for 10 min on ice, and the crude cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was designated “whole cell lysate” and used for the experiments. After NGF treatment, cells were rinsed with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 450 μl of lysis buffer B containing of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysate was sonicated twice for 15 s, and the unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to sediment the crude heavy membrane fraction (HMF). The supernatant of the HMF was used as cytosol. The crude HMF was resuspended in lysis buffer B and recentrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min and designated “HMF.” Protein (20 μg applied per lane) was separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). To block nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the membranes were probed for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in TBST and washed three times with TBST before incubation for 45 min with either peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, 1:5,000) or donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Promega, Madison, WI; 1:7,500). The SuperSignal Reagent (Pierce) was used to visualize antibody binding. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; diluted 1:500), anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:500), anti-phospho-Akt Ser473 antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; diluted 1:1,000), and anti-Akt antibody (New England Biolabs; diluted 1:1,000). The glutathione agarose-immobilized (GST) Rho-kinase (GST-ROK), which contains the Rho binding domain of ROK and GST-PAK1, which contains the p21-binding domain of human PAK1 (residues 51–135), was expressed inEscherichia coli by using the pGEX-KG vector. Bacteria were lysed by 2 × 30 s sonication in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (lysis buffer C) containing 50 μg/ml lysosyme. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The fusion protein was purified using glutathione beads (Sigma) from the supernatant. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer C. GST-ROK or GST-PAK1 immobilized on glutathione beads was added directly to either the HMF, cytosol, or whole cell lysate. After 45 min of shaking at 4 °C, beads were washed with lysis buffer C; the bound RhoA or Rac1 was detected by Western blotting using anti-RhoA or anti-Rac1 antibodies. Every pull-down assay was repeated at least three times using the HMF and two times using whole cell lysate. For controls, RhoA and Rac1 were loaded with either GDP or GTPγS in every pull-down assay. Student's t test for paired variables was used to test for differences elicited by NGF treatment, and data were considered significantly different at p< 0.05. RhoA was detected in the HMF of control naive PC12 cells (Fig.1 A). A brief 20-min treatment with 100 ng/ml NGF caused a translocation of RhoA from the membrane to the cytosol, and the membrane-associated fraction remained low up to 2 h (Fig. 1, A and B). As a positive control, we used C3 toxin, which inactivates RhoA by ADP-ribosylating it on Asn41 and blocks its ability to activate downstream targets. C3 treatment almost completely removed RhoA from the HMF (Fig.1 A) and diminished its binding to ROK both in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 A) and in whole cell lysates (data not shown). The RhoA blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to Rac1 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to RhoA, the amount of Rac1 increased slightly in the same HMF samples. RhoA showed a slight increase in the cytoplasm, whereas when the same blot was probed for Rac1 after stripping, a modest decrease was observed. To quantify the amount of RhoA detected by Western blotting, the area and intensity of bands were integrated and normalized to the untreated control sample (Fig. 1 C). Membrane-bound RhoA is accessible to GEFs and presumed to be predominantly in a GTP-bound activated state, whereas cytosolic RhoA is in an inactivated GDP-bound state associated with GDI. Although a dissociation of RhoA from the plasma membrane is suggestive of its inactivation (Fig. 1, A–C), to obtain direct evidence for a reduced activation state elicited by NGF treatment, we measured the GTP-dependent binding affinity of RhoA to its effector, ROK, which has previously been shown to be inactivated during neurite outgrowth (15Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the HMF, the amount of GTP-bound RhoA decreased within the first 2 h of NGF treatment (Fig. 1 D), as evidenced by its diminished ability to bind to ROK. The decrease was rapid because ROK-bound activated RhoA in the HMF decreased by as much as 40 ± 18% within 20-min treatment. After 2-h NGF treatment, the decrease in activated RhoA diminished further to as low as 30 ± 10% of the untreated control cells (Fig.1 D). Similar results were obtained when whole cell lysate was used in the pull-down assay (data not shown). The cytosol was abundant in RhoA immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 B). Despite this, no RhoA was pulled down from the cytoplasm by ROK (data not shown). However, when GTPγS was added exogenously, RhoA was pulled down by ROK from the cytosol of untreated control and NGF-treated cells, suggesting that it remained readily activable (data not shown). Addition of GDP did not have any effect on the binding of cytosolic RhoA to ROK (data not shown). Taken together, these data confirm that RhoA resident to the cytoplasm is in an inactivated but activable state and that NGF treatment translocates RhoA to this pool. Addition of GDP to the HMF diminished RhoA activation, whereas GTPγS increased it, validating the sensitivity of the assay (Fig.1 A). Wild-type PC12 cells were exposed to either NGF or vehicle for 2 days. The PC12 cells used in the present study responded rapidly to NGF; after 1 day, the cells began extending neurites that reached the diameter of a cell body on the second day of NGF treatment. Thus, after 2 days of NGF exposure, these cells were in the elongation phase of differentiation when whole cell lysate and the HMF were isolated and the amount of RhoA determined. A 2-day NGF treatment caused a 55 ± 15% and 46 ± 4% increase in the amount of total RhoA in whole cell lysate and membrane-associated RhoA in the HMF, respectively (Fig. 2, Aand B). The GST-ROK pull-down assay with the HMF showed no significant change as compared with untreated control cells. Taken together, the present results (Figs. 1 and 2) showed that NGF increases RhoA expression but not activation during neurite elongation. NGF activates TrkA and p75 receptors in PC12 cells. The nnr5 cell line, a clone of the PC12 cell line, lacks functional TrkA, whereas the B5 cell line is an nnr5 clone that stably overexpresses TrkA. These two clones were used to assess the role of the TrkA receptor in the regulation of RhoA. In contrast to wild-type PC12 cells, NGF exposure did not significantly change the amount of membrane-associated RhoA in nnr5 cells (Fig.3). NGF treatment caused no detectable change in the amount of ROK-bound RhoA in nnr5 cells (Fig. 3). In the B5 cells, NGF treatment decreased the amount of membrane-associated RhoA (Fig. 3), as was seen in wild-type PC12 cells (Fig. 1). The amount of ROK-bound RhoA decreased after brief NGF treatment; thus, overexpression of TrkA in nnr5 cells restored the effect of NGF on RhoA signaling. These findings indicate the requirement for functional TrkA receptor in NGF-induced inactivation of RhoA. Because Ras activation is a necessary and sufficient signaling event for neuronal differentiation, we tested NGF-induced inactivation of RhoA in M-M17-26 cells, which stably express high amounts of the dominant negative mutant N17-Ras. In M-M17-26 cells, a brief 20-min NGF treatment led to a 48 ± 7.8% decrease in membrane-bound RhoA. Furthermore, 2 h of NGF treatment reduced the amount of RhoA in the HMF to 27 ± 14.2% of that in untreated control cells (Fig.3). This effect of NGF did not differ significantly from that found in wild-type PC12 cells (Fig. 1). The amount of ROK-associated RhoA also decreased during the first 2 h of NGF treatment (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Ras activity is not necessary for the inactivation of RhoA during the initial phase of NGF-induced differentiation. The Rac1 GTPase has been found capable of regulating RhoA activity in fibroblasts (19Ridley A. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma cells (8Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To test the role of Rac1, the dominant negative N17Rac mutant was transiently expressed in PC12 cells using a tandem vector that also expresses GFP. An empty vector plasmid expressing GFP only was used as a negative control. Expression of N17Rac, but not of GFP, inhibited neuronal differentiation in NGF-treated cells, as these cells developed no neurites (Fig. 4 A). To further control the effect of transient expression of N17Rac protein, NGF-induced activation of Rac1 was measured using a PAK pull-down assay (Fig. 4 B). NGF treatment caused rapid activation of Rac1 in vector-transfected cells but did not cause a detectable activation of Rac1 in N17Rac1-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B). These experiments confirmed that the expression of N17Rac1 inhibited the function of Rac1 in these cells. In cells expressing N17Rac1, NGF did not induce RhoA translocation from the membrane to the cytosol (Fig.4 C). Moreover, the amount of ROK-associated RhoA showed no detectable decrease after NGF treatment. As in wild-type PC12 cells, NGF decreased the amount of both membrane- and ROK-associated RhoA in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that Rac1 mediates an inhibitory signal from TrkA to RhoA. Yamaguchi et al. (37Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported recently that expression of constitutively active V14RhoA blocked NGF-induced activation of Rac1. However, these authors used an 18-h-long serum starvation, which in our hands induces apoptosis. We have tried to reproduce these findings but with a shorter 4-h serum starvation in PC12 cells transiently transfected with V14RhoA. As shown in Fig. 4 D, under these conditions, activation of Rac1 following a 10-min exposure to NGF measured by PAK pull-down was not attenuated in PC12 cells transfected with V14RhoA as compared with vector-transfected cells. Signals from the TrkA-receptor are transmitted in part by PI3K, which in other cell types has been linked to the regulation of Rac1 (20Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). To test the role of PI3K in the NGF-induced inactivation of RhoA, a brief 2-h LY294002 treatment was applied before exposure to NGF. Pretreatment of the cells with 30 μm LY294002 alone did not change the amount of membrane- or ROK-associated RhoA (data not shown). In cells pretreated with LY294002, there was no detectable change in the amount of RhoA in the HMF after NGF treatment (Fig. 5). Furthermore, using the ROK pull-down assay, we found that the amount of ROK-associated RhoA also remained unchanged after NGF treatment (Fig.5). Similar results were obtained when the same experiments were carried out in cells pretreated with another PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig. 5). These results indicate that PI3K activity is required for the NGF-induced regulation of RhoA. We have also investigated the hierarchical relationship between Rac1 and PI3K in signaling events leading to the inactivation of RhoA. First, we inhibited PI3K with LY294002 and then measured the NGF-induced activation of Rac1 by using the PAK pull-down assay. In the control cells, without LY924002 pretreatment, NGF increased the amount of activated Rac1 4-fold (Fig.6 A). In contrast, in PC12 cells pretreated with 30 μm LY924002 for 2 h prior to 5 min NGF treatment, PAK activation was reduced to 2-fold but not abolished (Fig. 6 A). Next, to test whether Rac1 mediates PI3K activation, a dominant negative N17Rac1 mutant was transiently transfected in PC12 cells. To monitor the inhibitory effect of N17Rac1, the GST-PAK pull-down assay was used (see Fig. 4 B). To determine whether N17Rac1 inhibited the activation of PI3K, we measured the phosphorylation of Akt by Western blot using anti-phospho-Akt antibody. There was no detectable phosphorylated Akt in serum-starved PC12 cells (Fig. 6 B). NGF caused a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of Akt in vector- and N17Rac1-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 6 B). Using anti-Akt antibody, we found that the amount of Akt was same in every sample (Fig. 6 B). Thus, our data indicate that NGF-induced activation of PI3K in PC12 cells was independent of Rac1. In the present report, we sought to establish the mechanism underlying our earlier observations using constitutively active and dominant negative RhoA mutants (11Sebok A. Nusser N. Debreceni B. Guo Z. Santos M.F. Szeberenyi J. Tigyi G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which provided circumstantial evidence for a dual role of RhoA in NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Activated RhoA prevented the withdrawal of the cell from the cell cycle and abolished neurite outgrowth, whereas dominant negative RhoA enhanced differentiation. This observation implied that NGF signaling should negatively couple to RhoA to promote the early events of differentiation, which include the cessation of cell proliferation and the initiation of neurite outgrowth. In contrast to naive PC12 cells, in differentiated cells, we found that the expression of activated RhoA accelerated the rate of neurite elongation, whereas dominant negative RhoA reduced it. In the present study, we first investigated the effect of NGF signaling on RhoA by measuring its translocation and GTP-loading as measured by the affinity to its target, ROK. Here we provide evidence that a brief treatment with NGF leads to RhoA inactivation, as shown by its rapid translocation from the membrane to the cytosol and a decrease in its ability to associate with its downstream target, ROK (Fig. 1). These results provide a mechanism for our earlier phenomenological observation that NGF somehow inactivated RhoA-ROK signaling during the initiation phase of neuronal differentiation. We extended our study to determine not only the localization but also the activation state of RhoA during neurite elongation. Again, in agreement with the previous study using RhoA mutants, we found that a prolonged 2-day NGF treatment increased RhoA expression and its association with the plasma membrane during the neurite elongation phase. Although prolonged NGF treatment caused no elevation in the GTP-bound state of RhoA because the amount of ROK-bound RhoA returned to the a level seen in naive cells, this change represents a 70% increase as compared with the initiation phase (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Taken together, these results support our dual-role model proposed earlier: NGF treatment rapidly inactivates RhoA during the initiation phase, but it returns to the plasma membrane compartment with a basal level of GTP loading during the elongation phase of neuronal differentiation. Which NGF receptor mediates the inhibitory effect to RhoA? Using nnr5 cells deficient in functional TrkA receptor and a receptor add-back clone the B5 cells, we found evidence that TrkA is necessary for the inhibitory coupling to RhoA. We next turned our focus to TrkA-linked signaling pathways, specifically the Ras pathway because it has a central role in mediating NGF-induced neuronal differentiation. Settleman et al. (21Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) reported a cross-talk between Ras and Rho by showing that p190Rho-GAP was tyrosine-phosphorylated and formed a complex with the SH2 domain of p120Ras-GAP, suggesting that the latter may act as a Ras effector negatively regulating the activity of RhoA. Booden et al.(22Booden M.A. Sakaguchi D.S. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23559-23568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) found that expression of constitutively activated Ras elicited neurite outgrowth that was prevented by the co-expression of inhibitory Rho only in the presence of increased amounts of inhibitory Rac1. These results suggest that RhoA and Rac1 were coupled to Ras; however, these authors did not elicit differentiation using NGF, but rather with an activated Ras mutant. We reported that activation of RhoA during neurite retraction caused by lysophosphatidic acid was independent of Ras (23Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of Ras-independent signaling from NGF toward RhoA. Recently, Boglari and Szeberenyi (24Boglari G. Szeberenyi J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 1445-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a TrkA-independent Ras pathway exists that is sufficient to mediate neurite outgrowth. Using a PC12 subclone, the M-M17-26 line that expresses a dominant negative N17Ras (25Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we found no significant difference between the effect of NGF on the inactivation of RhoA in wild-type and N17Ras-expressing cells. The M-M17-26 cell line has been well characterized, and there is no evidence for NGF-induced ERK1/2 activation in these cells (data not shown), whereas NGF activates PI3K and consequently Akt (26Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results provide further evidence for a dichotic signaling originating from TrkA: a Ras-dependent branch that activates the MAPK cascade and a Ras-independent one that mediates the inactivation of RhoA and is linked to the PI3K-Akt pathway. The lipid kinase PI3K can mediate signals from Ras to Rac1 required for the oncogenic transformation of Rat-1 cells (27Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In vitrodata suggest that Rac1 specifically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a product of PI3K (28Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). RhoA also displays significant, although much weaker, binding to this lipid (28Missy K. Van Poucke V. Raynal P. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. Payrastre B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30279-30286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression of an activated Ras mutant caused increased Rac1 GTP binding and PI3K activity in membranes of PC12 cells (29Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A hierarchical cascade linking CDC42, Rac1, and RhoA was first described in fibroblasts (19Ridley A. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis based on studies conducted in fibroblasts, activation of Cdc42 induces activation of Rac1, which in turn leads to activation of Rho (for review, see Refs. 2Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar and 30Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To extend this model, functional studies established PI3K as an effector of Ras and an upstream modulator of Rac1 activity (20Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). However, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells, wortmannin does not interfere with Ras-mediated actin remodeling (31Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Hence, a secondary pathway is likely to exist (receptor tyrosine kinase → PI3K → Rac1) that is Ras-independent and turned on by the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, including TrkA. The Ras-independent pathway for Rac1 regulation is supported by the phosphorylation-dependent direct association of PI3K with the Tyr751 residue of TrkA (32Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. Dikic I. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15059-15065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PI3K has been shown to regulate at least two of the Rac1-GEFs, Vav and Sos-1 (33Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 34Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We found no change in the amount of RhoA in the HMF after NGF treatment of cells pretreated with either LY294002 or wortmannin (Fig. 5). These results suggest that PI3K activation is required for the NGF-induced regulation of RhoA. In cells expressing dominant negative Rac1, NGF did not induced translocation of RhoA from the membrane to the cytosol (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the amount of ROK-associated RhoA also showed no detectable decrease in response to NGF treatment in N17Rac1-expressing cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Finally, LY294002 or wortmannin substantially reduced NGF-induced activation of Rac1 in PC12 cells (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, NGF caused a rapid increase in phosphorylation of Akt in both vector- and N17Rac1-transfected PC12 cells (Fig. 6 B). Hence, our data suggest that PI3K acts upstream from Rac1 in the NGF-activated signal transduction pathway inhibiting RhoA (Fig. 7). However, the relationship between Rac1 and Rho is more complex and likely depends on the cell type. In contrast to the Cdc42 → Rac1 → Rho hierarchical cascade described in fibroblasts, no evidence for such a relationship has been found in neuronal cells. For example, in N1E-115 cells, PAK5 mediates signals from Cdc42 and Rac1 leading to the inactivation of RhoA (35Dan C. Nath N. Liberto M. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sander et al. (36Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) showed in NIH3T3 cells that activation of Rac1 leads to the inhibition of RhoA, suggesting that Rac1 is upstream of RhoA. Yamaguchi et al.(37Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18977-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported recently that RhoA suppressed NGF-induced Rac1 activation through the Rho-associated kinase pathway in PC12 cells, suggesting that Rho acts upstream to Rac1. In their experiments, however, NGF treatment was performed following an 18-h serum starvation and growth factor deprivation of PC12 cells, suggesting that this effect is more pertinent to an anti-apoptotic rescue effect of NGF rather than that of inducing neuronal differentiation. Under the conditions used in our assays, we found no inhibiton of NGF-induced Rac1 activation in response to NGF, suggesting that the prolonged serum starvation used by those authors may have affected the outcome of the assay. In our hands an 18-h-long serum withdrawal has adverse effect of the adherence of the cells, and cells are beginning to undergo apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, our results in naive PC12 cells support a Ras-independent signal transduction pathway linking TrkA to Rac1 through PI3K, which mediates the inhibition of RhoA during the early stages of neuronal differentiation (Fig. 7). The signaling complexes involved in coupling these molecules is subject of ongoing studies."

Excessive activation of monocytes and macrophages by LPS with overwhelming production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is thought to be responsible for the clinical manifestation of septic shock (1Manthey C.L.

Recently, BLP has also been shown to activate a variety of host inflammatory cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (5Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T.

Klimpel G.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4868-4878PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-exposure to LPS induces a transient state of cellular hypo-responsiveness to subsequent LPS stimulation with a diminished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced protection against endotoxic lethality (9Schade F.U. Flash R. Flohe S. Majetschak M. Kreuzfelder E. Dominguez-Fernandez E. Borgermann J. Reuter M. Obertacke U. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 50-64Google Scholar). This phenomenon is well established and termed LPS tolerance. LPS tolerance is an adaptive host response and may represent a protective mechanism in response to bacterial infection. For example, pre-exposure of animals to a sub-lethal dose of LPS protects against a subsequent lethal LPS challenge with a significant survival advantage and a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (10Sanchez-Cantu L. Rode H.N. Christou N.V. Arch. Surg. 1989; 124: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Zeisberger E. Roth J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although LPS tolerance suppresses TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 production, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 are not affected (9Schade F.U. Flash R. Flohe S. Majetschak M. Kreuzfelder E.

Therefore, LPS tolerance appears to occur as a consequence of alterations in LPS signal transduction pathways rather than a general cellular dysfunction. Several studies (12Kraatz J. Clair L.

Reduced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and NF-κB-DNA binding activity accompanied by a decreased degradation of both IκB-α and IκB-β are also found in LPS-tolerized cells in response to a second LPS stimulation (13Tominaga K.

On the other hand, BLP as well as several other non-LPS bacterial cell wall components have been shown to not only activate host inflammatory cells but also induce tolerance in these cells to the subsequent stimulation (16Sato S.

Forum. 2000; 51: 191-193Google Scholar) that pre-exposure of MF-1 mice to a sub-lethal dose of BLP induces BLP tolerance that protects against a subsequent lethal BLP challenge. More interestingly, induction of BLP tolerance also protects against the lethality induced by LPS challenge, indicating a cross-tolerance to LPS (19Doyle M. Wang J.H. Redmond H.P. Surg. Forum. 2000; 51: 191-193Google Scholar). Although the signal transduction pathways and the molecular mechanisms of LPS tolerance have been extensively investigated, they are not fully elucidated. Furthermore, little is known in relation to BLP tolerance and the alterations in BLP signaling that are involved in BLP tolerance. Two pattern recognition receptors, CD14 and Toll-like receptors (TLR), are involved in the recognition of bacteria and their cell wall components by the mammalian innate immune system. CD14 is a 55-kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein that recognizes and binds to LPS with high affinity (20Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3420) Google Scholar). LPS can directly activate monocytes and macrophages through its binding to membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14). However, cells that do not express mCD14 also respond to LPS stimulation in a serum-dependent fashion or in the presence of soluble CD14 (sCD14) (21Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 1500-1507PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of CD14 has been also found to facilitate BLP signaling (6Wooten R.M. Morrison T.B. Weis J.H. Wright S.D. Thieringer R. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5485-5492PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sellati T.J. Bouis D.A. Kitchens R.L. Darveau R.P. Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Gangloff S.C. Goyert S.M. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a CD14-dependent pathway used by BLP is distinct from that used by LPS (23Sellati T.J. Bouis D.A. Kitchens R.L. Darveau R.P. Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Gangloff S.C. Goyert S.M. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5455-5464PubMed Google Scholar). Because CD14 lacks a transmembrane region and is incapable of transducing the signaling of bacterial cell wall components including LPS and BLP, a transmembrane protein with potential for intracellular signaling would be required to serve as a primary receptor for BLP and/or LPS signaling or to couple with CD14 as a co-receptor. Recently, a highly conserved family of TLR proteins has been discovered, and each TLR is a type I transmembrane protein and is characterized structurally by an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor homology domain (25Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar, 26Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Among them, TLR4 has been shown to be a primary receptor for LPS signaling, as different mutations in the tlr4 gene found in two mouse strains (C3H/HeJ and C57BL10/ScCr) are responsible for an impaired ability to respond to LPS (27Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Med. 1999; 189: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of mice with targeted disruption in their tlr4 gene revealed that TLR4 knockout mice are LPS hypo-responsive (29Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). TLR2 has also been implicated in mediating LPS signals (31Kirschning C. Wesche J., H. Merrill Ayres T. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 32Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). However, mice with targeted disruption of tlr2 gene, but not TLR4 knockout mice, are hypo-responsive to other non-LPS bacterial cell wall products including BLP (30Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). TLR2-deficient cells are sensitive to LPS stimulation but have no response to Gram-positive bacterial cell wall components (33Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar). When these cells are transfected with TLR2, they respond to BLP stimulation (24Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, two recent studies have shown that activation of target cells by highly purified LPS is through TLR4 only and not through TLR2 (34Hirschfeld M., Ma, Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 35Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These data indicate that in contrast to TLR4, TLR2 is the major receptor for BLP and other non-LPS bacterial cell wall products. Several studies (14Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J.

Muhlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 36Labeta M.O. Durieux J.J. Spagnoli G. Fernandez N. Wijdenes J. Herrmann R.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) that the expression of CD14 is not altered in LPS-tolerized monocytes and macrophages, whereas dysregulation of tlr2andtlr4 gene expression and a reduced surface expression of TLR4 are implicated in LPS tolerance (14Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 37Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). More interestingly, when LPS tolerance in mouse peritoneal macrophages occurs via suppressed TLR4-MD2 surface expression (37Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), tolerance to LPS induced by mycoplasmal lipopeptides, the 2-kDa macrophage-activating lipopeptides (MALP-2), is not through the down-regulation of TLR4-MD2 expression (16Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Muhlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether TLR2, particularly TLR2 protein expression, is associated with the development of BLP tolerance as well as LPS tolerance. In the present study, we report that a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide induces tolerance in human THP-1 monocytic cells not only to subsequent BLP stimulation but also to LPS, indicating a cross-tolerance. Furthermore, induction of BLP tolerance is CD14-independent. When similar levels of suppressed MAP kinase phosphorylation and NF-κB activation are present in both BLP-tolerized and LPS-tolerized cells, BLP tolerance, but not LPS tolerance, prevents BLP-induced TLR2 overexpression. These results indicate the involvement of TLR2 in the development of BLP tolerance. RPMI 1640 medium, PBS, fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin sulfate, and glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. LPS from Escherichia coli serotype O55B5 was purchased from Sigma. BLP, a synthetic bacterial lipopeptide (Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4-OH) derived from the immunologically active NH2 terminus of bacterial lipoproteins, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, which was LPS-free as confirmed by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Charles River Endosafe, Charleston, SC). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and poly(dI-dC) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 mAb (anti-Leu-M3) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Rabbit pAbs against active (phosphorylated) ERK1 and -2, active JNK1 and -2, and active p38 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Goat pAb against human TLR2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A specific mouse anti-human CD14 blocking mAb (MEM-18) was obtained from HBT (Uden, Netherlands), and a specific mouse anti-human TLR2 blocking mAb (2392) was a gift from Genentech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). THP-1 cells (a human monocytic cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. Tolerance in THP-1 cells was induced as described previously (14Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in a serum-present or serum-free medium were preincubated with culture medium (non-tolerant), 10 ng/ml BLP (BLP tolerant), or 10 ng/ml LPS (LPS tolerant) for 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in a fresh culture medium for 2 h. Then cells were stimulated with 100 and 1,000 ng/ml BLP or LPS for different time points. For blocking experiments, the cells were incubated with CD14 blocking mAb (MEM-18, 10 μg/ml) (38Plotz S.G. Lentschat A. Behrendt H. Plotz W. Hamann L. Ring J. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. Ulmer A.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or TLR2 blocking mAb (2392, 25 μg/ml) (39Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P. Zychlinsky A. Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) for 30 min to totally block CD14 or TLR2 before they were exposed to BLP or LPS. THP-1 cells (1 × 105 cells/100 μl) were stained with 20 μl of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 mAb at 4 °C for 30 min. FITC-conjugated isotype IgG2b mAb was used as a negative control. mCD14 expression on THP-1 cells was analyzed on a FACscan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) for detecting the log of the mean channel fluorescence intensity with an acquisition of FL1. A minimum of 10,000 events were collected and analyzed using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). THP-1 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) incubated in 24-well plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) were subjected to different challenges as described above. Cells were then stimulated with 100 and 1,000 ng/ml BLP or LPS for 6 h. Cell-free supernatants were collected by centrifugation, transferred to new tubes, and stored at −70 °C until analysis. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in cell supernatants were assessed using commercially available ELISA kits (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-tolerized and BLP- or LPS-tolerized THP-1 cells were further stimulated with 100 ng/ml BLP or LPS for different time points. After being extensively washed with cold PBS, cells were lysed in ice with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined using a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). The proteins were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min in loading buffer (60 mm Tris, 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Aliquots containing equal amount of total proteins from each sample were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking for 2 h with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 6% nonfat milk, membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-MAP kinase pAbs or anti-TLR pAb. Blots were further incubated for 1 h with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dual transfections of THP-1 cells were accomplished using 12 μl/ml Dmrie-C reagent (Invitrogen) and 4.0 μg/ml pNF-κB-Luc vector DNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) that contains the firefly luciferase gene as the reporter. The pRL-CMV vector (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene was used as internal control. Briefly, THP-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and preincubated for 24 h with culture medium, 10 ng/ml BLP, or 10 ng/ml LPS. After being washed with PBS and incubated in fresh culture medium for 2 h, non-tolerized and BLP- or LPS-tolerized cells were transfected with Dmrie-C-DNA complexes that were formed by mixture of pNF-κB-Luc vector DNA (0.8 μg/well) and pRL-CMV vector DNA (0.08 μg/well) with Dmrie-C reagent (2.4 μl/well) in 200 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Cells were transfected with the complexes for 4 h and cultured for a further 14-h period after replacement of the medium. Each transfection was performed in duplicate. After transfection, cells were stimulated with BLP (100 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cell extracts were prepared using the Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and protein content in each sample was determined using a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Firefly and Renillaluciferase activities were measured using the Dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) to assess promoter activity and transfection efficiency. Non-tolerized and BLP- or LPS-tolerized THP-1 cells in 6-well plates (1 × 106cells/well) were further treated with 100 ng/ml BLP or LPS for 60 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (40Bowie A.G. Moynagh P.N. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25941-25950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a hypotonic solution (10 mm Hepes, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.9) on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to pellet nuclei. Cytoplasmic supernatants were removed, and nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) on ice for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm, and supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were collected. All buffers contained freshly added 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were determined using a micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). All nuclear extracts were stored at −70 °C until analysis. EMSA were performed as described previously (41Bourke E. Kennedy E.J. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39996-40002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.0–4.0 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 30,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGA GGGGACTTTCCC AGG C-3′, containing the NF-κB consensus sequence (underlined) (Promega) that had been labeled previously with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The DNA-binding reactions were performed in the presence of 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 5.0 mmdithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 30 min. For competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5′-AGT TGA GGCGACTTTCCC AGG C-3′, containing the mutated NF-κB consensus sequence (underlined) (Promega) was added to the nuclear extracts 30 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. All reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were subsequently dried and autoradiographed. All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. Differences were judged statistically significant when thep value was less than 0.05. LPS activates monocytes and macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. Fig.1, A and B, shows that BLP is a more potent stimulus than LPS for human THP-1 monocytic cell activation, as naive (non-tolerant) THP-1 cells exposed to BLP at 100 and 1,000 ng/ml for 6 h produced much higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 (p < 0.05, versus LPS stimulation). A synergistic effect of mycoplasmal lipopeptides (MALP-2) and LPS on TNF-α production in murine peritoneal macrophages has been reported previously (16Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Muhlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, there were no further increases in TNF-α and IL-6 production found in THP-1 cells stimulated with combinations of BLP and LPS, when compared with cells stimulated with BLP alone (Fig. 1, A and B). When THP-1 cells were preincubated with 10 ng/ml BLP for 24 h and then subjected to a second stimulation with high doses of BLP (100 and 1,000 ng/ml), TNF-α and IL-6 production was significantly attenuated (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating induction of BLP tolerance. Most interestingly, BLP-tolerized THP-1 cells had an impaired ability to produce TNF-α and IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation or LPS plus BLP stimulation (Fig. 1, C andD), indicating a novel cross-tolerance to LPS induced by BLP pretreatment. Preincubation of THP-1 cells with LPS induced LPS tolerance, as demonstrated by attenuated TNF-α and IL-6 production in response to a second LPS stimulation (Fig. 1, E andF). Notably, LPS-tolerized THP-1 cells exhibited markedly reduced production of TNF-α and IL-6 in response to subsequent BLP or BLP plus LPS stimulation (Fig. 1, E and F). However, unlike BLP-tolerized THP-1 cells, which were effectively unresponsive when challenged with LPS or LPS plus BLP, LPS-tolerized cells still produced significant levels of TNF-α and IL-6 when challenged with BLP or BLP plus"

Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of an asparagine residue has recently been reported to regulate C-TAD function by disrupting the interaction with the CH1 domain of the p300/CBP coactivator at normoxia. Here we have performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of a predicted α-helix within the C-TAD of mouse HIF-1α to identify residues important for transactivation and interaction of the C-TAD with transcriptional coactivators. We observed that several hydrophobic residues, Ile802, Leu808, Leu814, Leu815, and Leu818, were critical for transactivation and binding to the CH1 domain of CBP in hypoxic cells. Moreover, E812A/E813A and D819A mutations impaired hypoxia-dependent transactivation without disrupting binding to CH1. In the context of full-length HIF-1α, mutation of the leucine residues conferred conformational changes to the protein and significantly reduced the transactivation function as well as functional interaction with the transcriptional coactivators CBP and SRC-1.

CBP and p300 are coactivator proteins that operate at the end points of a variety of signal transduction pathways, thereby modulating specific gene expression programs involved in cell growth, differentiation, homeostasis, and viral pathogenesis (15Giordano A.

Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Both CBP/p300 and p160/SRC enhance the function of two hypoxia-inducible transactivation domains located in the C-terminal half of HIF-1α (8Carrero P.

Within this portion of human and mouse HIF-1α, the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD) is located between amino acids 532 and 585 and amino acids 531 and 584, respectively, whereas the C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) spans amino acids 776–826 of hHIF-1α and 772–822 of mHIF-1α (16Jiang B.H.

Low availability of oxygen will inhibit this mechanism, leading to the release of von Hippel Lindau tumor supressor protein, thus stabilizing the N-TAD and facilitating the transactivation function. In contrast, C-TAD protein levels are not affected by changes in oxygen concentration, but transactivation mediated by this domain is strongly induced by hypoxia (8Carrero P. Okamoto K.

(27Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) have identified a protein, FIH-1, which binds to the C terminus of HIF-1α, repressing C-TAD-mediated transactivation, and have proposed a model involving recruitment of von Hippel Lindau tumor supressor protein and histone deacetylases to FIH-1 to form a repressor complex. In addition, a more recent report has demonstrated that an asparagine residue in the C-TAD is hydroxylated at normoxia, resulting in inhibition of the interaction between the C-TAD and the CH1 domain of p300 (28Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). This mechanism seems also to be mediated by Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, since the use of specific inhibitors for these enzymes leads to constitutive activity of C-TAD (28Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 29Sang N. Fang J. Srinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2984-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The structure of the HIF-1α C-TAD bound to the CH1 domain of p300 has recently been solved in two independent studies (30Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Depending on the fragment used, the C-TAD is shown to form two or three α-helices upon binding to the CH1 domain of CBP. Both studies show that the last α-helix is in intimate contact with CH1. Previous observations have shown that deletion of the last 13 amino acids renders the C-TAD transcriptionally inactive, indicating that this region is critical for the transactivation function (8Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).In this study, we have characterized the C-TAD by performing alanine-scanning mutagenesis based on the predicted structure of this transactivation domain. We have identified residues within the C-TAD that are critical for the hypoxia-inducible transactivation response and for potentiation of this response by CBP and SRC-1. We show that mutation of specific amino acids in the C-TAD results in loss of transactivation through disruption of the binding to the CH1 domain of CBP. Moreover, we demonstrate that in vivo colocalization of mHIF-1α and CBP in intranuclear foci is impaired by mutations in the C-TAD of HIF-1α that negatively affect the hypoxia-inducible transactivation function of the protein.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have identified amino acids within the predicted helix 2 of the HIF-1α C-TAD that are essential for the hypoxia-dependent transactivation response, interaction with CBP, and intranuclear colocalization with CBP. CBP/p300 has been shown to play a critical role in cellular responses to hypoxia. Functional assays have demonstrated that CBP is able to enhance HIF-1α-mediated transactivation function, indicating that CBP functions as a coactivator in hypoxia-induced transcriptional responses (7Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 8Carrero P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CH1 region of p300 has been shown to interact with HIF-1α (7Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) by directly targeting the C-TAD, as assessed by protein-protein interaction assays (11Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Based on this mechanism, overexpression of the C-TAD motif of HIF-1α was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in animal models, possibly by disrupting the interaction of HIF-1α with p300 (12Kung A.L. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). More recently, the solution structure of the complex formed by the HIF-1α C-TAD and the CH1 domain of p300/CBP has been determined in two independent studies (30Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In one of these studies, the C-TAD forms three short helices upon binding to the CH1 domain (31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Two of the C-TAD helices identified in the solution structure overlap partially with the predicted helices described in the present study, whereas the central helix containing Asn803 (hHIF-1α) was not predicted by the program and therefore was not considered in this study.Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the two predicted α-helices of the C-TAD demonstrated that mutations of hydrophobic residues within helix 2 completely abrogated C-TAD-mediated transactivation, physical interaction with the isolated CH1 domain of CBP, and CBP-mediated enhancement of transcription. The predicted helix 2 has been reported to be essential for the interaction of HIF-1α C-TAD with the CH1 region (20Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the solution structure of the C-TAD-CH1 complex the last helix of the C-TAD was docked in the groove of the CH1 domain, and many hydrophobic and polar interactions contribute to the stabilization of the complex (30Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Two of the leucines within the predicted helix 2 that were identified in our mutation analysis have been previously shown to constitute part of the interface between HIF-1α C-TAD and the CH1 motif (Leu818 and Leu822 in hHIF-1α, corresponding to Leu814and Leu818 in mHIF-1α) (11Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified three additional hydrophobic residues, Ile802, Leu808, and Leu815 in mHIF-1α C-TAD, that were critical for transcriptional activation by the C-TAD and interaction with CBP. In the solution structure of the complex between the C-TAD and the minimal CH1, all of these amino acids were proposed to make hydrophobic and polar interactions important for stabilization of the complex. Residues Ile802 and Leu808 are located in an intrahelix bridge, whereas Leu814, Leu815, and Leu818 are present in the last helix of the C-TAD (30Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in our study mutation of acidic residues to alanine (mutants E812A/E813A and D819A) decreased or abrogated hypoxia-dependent transactivation mediated by the C-TAD, but in contrast to any mutation of the hydrophobic amino acids, E812A/E813A and D819A were still able to interact with CH1. Moreover, transactivation by the E812A/E812A mutant was enhanced by CBP. Both residues Glu817 and Asp823 of hHIF-1α (corresponding to Glu813and Asp819 in mHIF-1α) have been proposed to make electrostatic interactions with CH1 in the structural studies but do not seem to be critical for binding to CBP in our functional analysis.It has recently been proposed that hypoxia-dependent transactivation mediated by the C-TAD is regulated by hydroxylation of Asn803 (Asn799 in mHIF-1α) by Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (28Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). When mutated to alanine, Asn803 has been shown to generate a constitutive C-TAD (28Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of Asn807present in the predicted helix 2 resulted in increased transactivation activity only under hypoxic conditions. Asn807 has been proposed to make polar interactions with the p300 CH1 domain in one of the structural studies, whereas in the other study the Asn807 was in a disordered structure (30Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M., De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Based on our results Asn807 appears not to be critical for either transactivation or interaction with CBP.In the present study, we have visualized the in vivointeraction between HIF-1α and CBP using CFP and YFP fusion proteins. Upon coexpression of both proteins, the alterations observed with regard to intranuclear distribution patterns indicate that an in vivo interaction occurs in a hypoxia-inducible manner. These interactions are dependent on the integrity of the HIF-1α transactivation domains, since recruitment of the two proteins to accumulation foci was lost when a mutant, transcriptionally inert form of HIF-1α was used in the assay. Intranuclear redistribution of CBP by a transcription factor has been previously shown with C/EBPα, and this event is dependent on the C/EBPα transactivation domain (44Schaufele F. Enwright III, J.F. Wang X. Teoh C. Srihari R. Erickson R. MacDougald O.A. Day R.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1665-1676PubMed Google Scholar). Also, steroid hormone receptors have been shown to recruit coactivators such as SRC-1 and TIF2 to accumulation foci in a ligand-dependent manner (42Stenoien D.L. Mancini M.G. Patel K. Allegretto E.A. Smith C.L. Mancini M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 518-534PubMed Google Scholar, 45Saitoh M. Takayanagi R. Goto K. Fukamizu A. Tomura A. Yanase T. Nawata H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This process of coregulator redistribution by a transcription factor, also known as intranuclear marshaling, correlates with the formation of complexes potentially involved in regulation of gene expression.Our results demonstrate the importance of the helix 2 motif of the C-TAD in the context of HIF-1α full-length protein, since mutations of helix 2 leucines affected the conformation of the protein and the hypoxia-dependent transactivation function of HIF-1α as well as interaction with CBP in vivo. However, in contrast to the report by Gu et al. (11Gu J. Milligan J. Huang L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3550-3554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), our data showed that mutations targeting the C-TAD predicted helix 2 are not enough to render full-length HIF-1α transcriptionally inert, thus indicating an important role of the N-TAD for the transactivation function of the full-length protein. Complete inactivation of the transactivation function of HIF-1α was only achieved by deletion of the N-TAD concomitant with introduction of critical mutations within the C-TAD. Thus, the N-TAD, in addition to the previously described role in targeting HIF-1α for degradation at normoxia (2Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also contributes to the hypoxia-inducible transcriptional activation in the hypoxic cell by mediating interaction in vivo between HIF-1α and CBP, resulting in potentiation of the transactivation function of HIF-1α. Taken together, we have identified several residues in the C-TAD that are important for hypoxia-dependent activation of transcription by HIF-1α. We have also obtained evidence that mutation of several hydrophobic residues present in a predicted α-helix of the C-TAD not only disrupts the in vitro interaction with the CH1 domain of CBP but also impairs the interaction of HIF-1α with CBP in vivo. In mammalian organisms, a reduction in cellular or systemic levels of O2 (hypoxia) induces a coordinated cascade of biological responses. A critical regulator of these responses to hypoxia is the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α).1 Together with a partner factor, Arnt, HIF-1α forms in the nucleus of hypoxic cells a heterodimeric complex of basic helix-loop-helix/Per, Arnt, and Sim domain proteins that activates transcription of a network of genes encoding erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glycolytic enzymes (1Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is very rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome upon ubiquitylation mediated by the von Hippel Lindau tumor supressor protein (2Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R.

The initial excitement in this young field has led to the development of more than 500 gene therapy protocols approved for evaluation in clinical trials. As these clinical trials progress, many obstacles have been identified that investigators in the field will need to overcome. Among the most important areas of investigation in the field of cancer gene therapy are 1) development of novel vectors to improve gene delivery, 2) development of tumor-selective binding to improve specific tumor targeting, and 3) improvement of the therapeutic window to reduce the toxicity of gene therapy administered alone or in combination with conventional agents. The challenge is not to replace current strategies for cancer therapy with gene therapy but to incorporate gene therapy as a more rational, molecularly based approach to increase our therapeutic armamentarium."
https://openalex.org/W2114305841,"Free radical-initiated oxidant injury and lipid peroxidation have been implicated in a number of neural disorders. Docosahexaenoic acid is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid in the central nervous system. We have shown previously that this 22-carbon fatty acid can yield, upon oxidation, isoprostane-like compounds termed neuroprostanes, with E/D-type prostane rings (E4/D4-neuroprostanes). Eicosanoids with E/D-type prostane rings are unstable and dehydrate to cyclopentenone-containing compounds possessing A-type and J-type prostane rings, respectively. We thus explored whether cyclopentenone neuroprostanes (A4/J4-neuroprostanes) are formed from the dehydration of E4/D4-neuroprostanes. Indeed, oxidation of docosahexaenoic acid in vitro increased levels of putative A4/J4-neuroprostanes 64-fold from 88 ± 43 to 5463 ± 2579 ng/mg docosahexaenoic acid. Chemical approaches and liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry definitively identified them as A4/J4-neuroprostanes. We subsequently showed these compounds are formed in significant amounts from a biological source, rat brain synaptosomes. A4/J4-neuroprostanes increased 13-fold, from a basal level of 89 ± 72 ng/mg protein to 1187 ± 217 ng/mg (n = 4), upon oxidation. We also detected these compounds in very large amounts in fresh brain tissue from rats at levels of 97 ± 25 ng/g brain tissue (n = 3) and from humans at levels of 98 ± 26 ng/g brain tissue (n = 5), quantities that are nearly an order of magnitude higher than other classes of neuroprostanes. Because of the fact that A4/J4-neuroprostanes contain highly reactive cyclopentenone ring structures, it would be predicted that they readily undergo Michael addition with glutathione and adduct covalently to proteins. Indeed, incubation of A4/J4-neuroprostanes in vitro with excess glutathione resulted in the formation of large amounts of adducts.

The formation of NPs from DHA is similar to the formation of IsoPs from arachidonic acid and proceeds via the generation of highly unstable endoperoxide intermediates (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Roberts II, L.J. Montine T.J. Markesbery W.R.

These intermediates can undergo reduction in vitro and in vivo to form NPs containing F-type prostane rings (F4-NPs) or can isomerize to molecules with E-type and D-type prostane rings (E4/D4-NPs). Levels of these compounds are significantly increased in the temporal and parietal cortices obtained from patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control subjects (11Reich E.E.

DHA is concentrated in neurons, and we have thus suggested that NP formation may be a useful marker of selective neuronal oxidative injury. It is well known that eicosanoids containing E-type and D-type prostane rings are unstable and readily dehydrate in aqueous solutions to cyclopentenone-containing compounds (12Fitzpatrick F.A. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11713-11718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example PGE2and PGD2 can dehydrate to PGA2 and PGJ2, respectively. PGJ2 can undergo further metabolism to Δ12-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2. Cyclopentenone PGs have attracted considerable interest because of their ability to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, various compounds of the A- and J-series have been shown to inhibit proliferation with a G1 cell cycle arrest and to induce differentiation (13Narumiya S. Ohno K. Fujiwara M. Fukushima M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 506-511PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cuzzocrea S. Wayman N.S. Mazzon E. Dugo L., Di Paola R. Serraino I. Britti D. Chatterjee P.K. Caputi A.P.

On the other hand, at concentrations in the nanomolar range, A- and J-series PGs induce proliferation (16Chinery R. Coffey R.J. Graves-Deal R. Kirkland S.C. Sanchez S.C. Zackert W.E. Oates J.A.

One limitation of the studies reported to date with cyclopentenone PGs is that there is marked paucity of evidence that they are formed in vivo (19Hirata Y. Hayashi H. Ito S. Kikawa Y. Ishibashi M. Sudo H. Miyazaki M. Fukushima S. Narumiya S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16619-16625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shibata T. Kondo M. Osawa T. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Uchida K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10459-10466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that analogous to the formation of A-ring and J-ring PGs from the dehydration of cyclooxygenase-generated PGE2 and PGD2, A2/J2-IsoPs are generated in vitroand in vivo from IsoPs containing E-type and D-type prostane rings (E2/D2-IsoPs) (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of this observation relates to the fact that A2/J2-IsoPs contain α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moieties and are thus highly reactive and readily adduct, via Michael addition, GSH and protein thiols. Indeed, we have shown that in the presence of GSH and cellular GSH transferase, the A-ring IsoP 15-A2t-IsoP (8-iso-PGA2) rapidly conjugates GSH (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The adduction of relevant reducing substances and proteins by endogenously generated IsoPs may be responsible for some of the adverse effects of oxidant stress in vivo. Analogous to the formation of A2/J2-IsoPs from the dehydration of E2/D2-IsoPs, it would be postulated that E4/D4-NPs can undergo dehydration resulting in the generation of cyclopentenone NPs, termed A4/J4-NPs. The mechanism of formation of A4/J4-NPs from DHA is shown in Fig.1, A–C. Initially, five DHA radicals are generated, and following the addition of molecular oxygen, eight peroxyl radicals result. Subsequently, the peroxyl radicals undergo endocyclization followed by addition of molecular oxygen to form eight bicyclic endoperoxide intermediate regioisomers (not shown). These regioisomers then undergo rearrangement to generate eight E4-NP and eight D4-NP regioisomers. Each regioisomer is theoretically composed of eight racemic diastereoisomers for a total of 256 E-ring and D-ring compounds. These molecules subsequently undergo dehydration to A-ring and J-ring compounds. Loss of one chiral center reduces the total number of potential A4/J4-NPs to 128. The Eicosanoid Nomenclature Committee has established and approved a nomenclature system for the IsoPs, in which the different regioisomer classes are designated by the carbon number of the side chain where the hydroxyl is located, with the carbonyl carbon designated as C1 (22Taber D.F. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1997; 53: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By applying this system to NPs, A-ring and J-ring regioisomers can be designated as the 4-series A4/J4 NPs, the 7-series A4/J4-NPs, 11-series, etc. This is comparable with the series obtained with D4/E4 NPs (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that A4/J4-NPs are, in fact, formed in significant amounts in vitro and in vivo from the free radical catalyzed peroxidation of DHA. Docosahexaenoic acid, dimethylformamide, and undecane were purchased from Aldrich. Pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide, methoxyamine HCl, and diisopropylethylamine were from Sigma. 2,2′-Azobis-(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH) was from Eastman Kodak Co. [2H3]Methoxyamine HCl was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA).N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) was from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). [2H9]N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide was from CDN Isotopes (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). C-18 and Silica Sep-Pak cartridges were from Waters Associates. 60ALK6D TLC plates were from Whatman. [2H4]PGA2 and [2H4]PGE2 were from Cayman Biochemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). B & J Inert SPE System Columns (Glass Sep-Paks) were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). DHA was oxidized in vitro using an iron/ADP/ascorbate mixture, as described previously (23Longmire A.J. Swift L.L. Roberts II, L.J. Awad J.A. Burke R.F. Morrow J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Samples obtained from oxidation of DHA or from other sources were extracted in ethyl acetate and subsequently converted to O-methyloxime derivatives by incubation with methoxyamine HCl in pyridine for 45 min at 55 °C. A4/J4 NPs were then extracted using C-18 Sep-Pak cartridges as described (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The eluted samples were converted to O-methyloxime PFB ester derivatives, purified by TLC using 60ALK6D silica gel plates employing a solvent system of hexane/acetone (70:30, v/v) as utilized previously for A2/J2-IsoPs (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Compounds migrating in the region from 2 cm below to 1.5 cm above the methyloxime PFB ester of PGA2 (R f = 0.27–0.54) were scraped, extracted with ethyl acetate, converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives, and quantified by stable isotope dilution techniques employing gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization (NICI)/mass spectrometry (MS). The standard used for quantification of A4/J4-NPs was [2H4]PGA2. The major ions generated in the NICI mass spectra of the PFB ester,O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivatives of A4/J4-NPs and the [2H4]PGA2 are the carboxylate anions at m/z 458 and m/z438, respectively. Quantification of A4/J4-NPs was performed based on integration of peak areas. GC/NICI/MS was carried out using either a Hewlett-Packard 5890 GC/MS (Palo Alto, CA) or a Thermo-Finnigan Voyager GC/MS (San Jose, CA). Treatment of PGA2 with BSTFA and piperidine has been shown to convert it to a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative, which is specific for A-ring prostanoids (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed for the formation of this derivative of A4/J4-NPs. PFB esters of putative cyclopentenone-NPs were treated with a 1:1 mixture of BSTFA/piperidine for 1 h at 60 °C and analyzed by GC/NICI/MS monitoring the carboxylate anions at m/z 586 for the NPs andm/z 566 for [2H4]PGA2. In some experiments, compounds were exposed to catalytic hydrogenation after conversion to piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivatives as described (24Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Compounds generated by in vitrooxidation of DHA were purified by normal phase HPLC using a 25 cm × 4.6 mm Econosil SI column with 5-μm particles employing an isocratic solvent system of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid (97:3:0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A4/J4-NPs eluted in retention volumes 13–37 ml. Fractions were analyzed by GC/MS for A4/J4-NPs. Selected fractions that contained substantial amounts of A4/J4-NPs were acidified with 1 n HCl, extracted with 2 volumes of ethyl acetate, dried, and redissolved in a small volume of ethanol. Fractions were then analyzed by LC/ESI/MS/MS in the negative ion mode using a 5 cm × 2.1 mm Zorbax C-18 column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The solvent system was a gradient consisting of 5 mmammonium acetate/acetonitrile/acetic acid (90:10:0.1, v/v/v) to 5 mm ammonium acetate/acetonitrile/acetic acid (10:90:0.1, v/v/v) over the course of 10 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The auxiliary gas pressure was 10 liters/min, and the sheath gas pressure was 60 lb/in2. The voltage on the capillary was 20.0 V; the capillary temperature was 200 °C, and the tube lens voltage was 75.0 V. Parent ions were scanned from m/z 300 to 400. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of molecular ions of putative A4/J4-NPs in these fractions was performed from 20 to 30 eV scanning daughter ions from m/z 50 to 400. The spectrum shown was obtained at 25 eV. The CID gas was argon with a pressure set at 2.5 millitorr. Spectra were displayed by averaging scans across chromatographic peaks. LC/MS was carried out using a Finnigan TSQ 7000 instrument (San Jose, CA). Brain tissue was obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats and homogenized, and synaptosomes were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (25Blakely R.D. Ory-Lavollee L. Thopmson R.C. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation was initiated by the addition of AAPH (final concentration of 5 mm). Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 2 h. The reactions were terminated by placing the samples at −80 °C, and lipids were extracted by the method of Folch (see Ref. 3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E.

Esterified A4/J4-NPs in phospholipids were hydrolyzed using chemical saponification with potassium hydroxide (26Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Daniel V.C. Awad J.A. Mirochnitchenko O. Swift L.L. Burke R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), following treatment with methoxyamine HCl in chloroform/methanol 2:1 for 1 h at room temperature. Purification was performed as for free A4/J4-NPs, and levels of A4/J4-NPs were then quantified by GC/MS. Data are expressed relative to protein concentration as determined by the Pierce BCA assay (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Tissue samples were obtained from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and postmortem human parietal lobe tissue (informed consent obtained). Samples were homogenized in chloroform/methanol 2:1 containing BHT (0.005%) and triphenylphosphine (10 mg/ml) to prevent autoxidation. 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl were added to the samples; they were then shaken and centrifuged, and the aqueous layer was discarded. The samples were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 1 ml of chloroform, and phospholipids containing A4/J4-NPs were separated from other lipids as follows. A glass silica Sep-Pak (500 mg) was prewashed with 5 ml of hexane followed by 5 ml of chloroform. Each sample was applied to the Sep-Pak and initially extracted with 12 ml of hexane/MTBE (200:3, v/v). Unoxidized cholesterol esters and triglycerides elute in this fraction. Subsequently, the column was extracted with 12 ml of methanol/MTBE (5:95, v/v) to remove oxidized non-polar lipids and cholesterol. A final extraction using 15 ml of MTBE/methanol/ammonium acetate (0.0 1m) (5:8:2 v/v/v) elutes oxidized and unoxidized phospholipids. In preliminary studies, >98% of A4/J4-NPs eluted in the phospholipid fraction. Further purification of A4/J4-NPs was identical to that employed for the rat synaptosomes as noted above. A4/J4-NPs (∼100 ng) obtained from the in vitro oxidation of DHA were purified by Sep-Pak extraction and TLC and incubated in 0.1 m KPO4buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of a 10-fold excess (∼1 μg) of GSH and 1 mg of bovine liver GSH transferase (Sigma) containing a mixture of GSH transferases at 37 °C for 2 h (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture was then acidified to pH 3 and extracted with 2 volumes of MeCl2. Unconjugated A4/J4-NPs were measured in the organic fraction by GC/MS, and conjugated NPs represented the difference between the amount of A4/J4-NPs added to the incubationversus that amount present in the organic fraction. Subsequently, A4/J4-NP-GSH adducts from a separate incubation were definitively identified by LC/MS. Adducts were purified by extraction using a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge preconditioned with acetonitrile and 0.1 m ammonium acetate (pH 3.4) (21Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and eluted with 10 ml of 95% ethanol and analyzed by LC/MS. LC was carried out using a MAGIC 2002 LC system (Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA) operating in the isocratic mode with the mobile phase of H2O/acetonitrile/acetic acid (77:22.9:0.1, v/v/v), and compounds were separated on an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 5-μm particle size; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) at a flow rate of 75 μl/min. Following on-line chromatography, samples were characterized employing a Finnigan TSQ-7000 (San Jose, CA) triple quadripole mass spectrometer operating in the positive ion mode. An electrospray source was fitted with a 100 μm internal diameter deactivated fused silica capillary column and used nitrogen for both sheath and auxiliary gas, operating at 60 pounds/square inch and 10 liters/min, respectively. The ESI potential was maintained at 3.5 kV, the heated capillary at 20 V and 200 °C, and the tube lens 70 V. For tandem MS, parent compounds were collisionally activated at an energy of −15 eV and under 2.5 millitorrs of argon. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using an Alpha work station (Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, MA) running Finnigan ICIS software, version 8.3.2. A representative selected ion current chromatogram obtained from the oxidation of DHA in vitro with iron/ADP/ascorbate for 6 h is shown in Fig. 2. The two large chromatographic peaks shown in the m/z 438 channel represent the syn- and anti-O-methyloxime isomers of the internal standard [2H4]PGA2. In the upperm/z 458 ion current chromatograms are a series of chromatographic peaks eluting over approximately a 2-min interval. These compounds possessed a molecular mass predicted for A4/J4-NPs. In addition, it would be predicted that the retention time of A4/J4-NPs on GC should be longer than that of the deuterated PGA2 internal standard because the former compounds contain two additional carbon atoms (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As for PGA2 and PGJ2, as well as for the A2/J2-IsoPs, that have similar chromatographic properties on TLC and GC and identical molecular masses, it is not possible to differentiate between A-type and J-type prostane rings in the putative NP compounds detected in them/z 458 ion current chromatogram shown in Fig. 2. However, because both PGE2 and PGD2 readily dehydrate in aqueous solutions to form PGA2 and PGJ2, respectively, it is expected that the D4-NPs and E4-NPs would dehydrate to form A4-NPs and J4-NPs. Additional experimental approaches were undertaken to provide further evidence that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks in the m/z 458 ion current chromatogram were A4/J4-NPs. First, the m/z457 ion current chromatogram contained no chromatographic peaks, indicating that the peaks in the m/z 458 chromatogram are not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion of less than m/z 458. Analysis of putative A4/J4-NPs as [2H9]TMS ether derivatives resulted in a shift of the m/z458 chromatographic peaks up 9 Da to m/z 467, indicating the presence of 1 hydroxyl group (data not shown). When these compounds were analyzed asO-[2H3]methyloxime derivatives, the m/z 458 chromatographic peaks all shifted up to m/z 461, indicating the presence of 1 carbonyl group (not shown). Subsequently, analysis following treatment with BSTFA/piperidine resulted in the formation of piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivatives (Fig. 3 A). The amount of A4/J4-NPs analyzed as this derivative was calculated to be 547 ± 232 ng/mg DHA (mean ± S.E.,n = 3), which is less than the amount formed when compounds are analyzed as O-methyloxime, TMS ether derivatives. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that we have found that, although treatment of PGA2 with BSTFA/piperidine efficiently converts it to a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative, only small amounts of this derivative are formed with PGJ2. By analogy, therefore, only a portion of the mixture of A4/J4-NPs would be expected to form a piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivative. Finally, putative A4/J4-NPs were analyzed following catalytic hydrogenation as piperidyl-enol-TMS ether derivatives. Prior to hydrogenation, there were no chromatographic peaks present 10 Da above the m/z 586 in the m/z 596 chromatogram. However, following hydrogenation, intense chromatographic peaks appeared at m/z 596 (Fig. 3 B) with the loss of chromatographic peaks at m/z586, indicating the presence of 5 double bonds. It should be noted that it was not possible to analyze putative A4/J4-NPs following hydrogenation asO-methyloxime TMS ether derivatives because of the presence of interfering chromatographic peaks 10 Da abovem/z 458. Collectively, these data indicated that the compounds represented by the chromatographic peaks in them/z 458 ion current chromatogram shown in Fig. 2have the functional groups and the number of double bonds predicted for A4/J4-NPs. To provide direct evidence that the compounds analyzed by selected ion monitoring MS were A4/J4-NPs, LC/ESI/MS/MS in the negative ion mode was employed. The material was purified before LC/MS analysis by HPLC, and eluted fractions containing significant amounts of putative A4/J4-NPs as determined by GC/MS were then analyzed by LC/MS. Notably, A4/J4-NPs eluted over a very broad volume from 13 to 37 ml using this HPLC solvent system (Fig.4 A). Subsequently, 1-ml fractions were analyzed by LC/MS. The predicted [parent molecule − H]− ion, hereafter referred to as [M − H]−, for A4/J4-NPs ism/z 357. Fig. 4 B shows the selected ion monitoring chromatogram of the ion at m/z 357 obtained from one of the analyses of putative cyclopentenone NPs eluting from the HPLC at 18 ml. In this fraction, A4/J4-NPs elute from the LC column as a relatively broad set of peaks over about 1 min. A composite collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectrum obtained by summing scans over the broad chromatographic peak in Fig. 4 B is shown in Fig. 4 C. CID of the ion at m/z 357 resulted in the formation of a number of relevant daughter ions that would be predicted to be common to all of the A4/J4-NPs, including m/z339 ([M − H] − H2O)−,m/z 313 ([M − H] − CO2)−, and m/z 295 ([M − H] − H2O − CO2)−. Other prominent daughter ions are present that may result from fragmentation of specific A4/J4-NP regioisomers. Because of the limited amount of material and the lack of chemically synthesized A- and J-ring NPs, it is impossible to know with certainty the chemical structures of these smaller fragments. Nonetheless, on the basis of our previous work (3Reich E.E. Zackert W.E. Brame C.J. Chen Y. Roberts II, L.J. Hachey D.L. Montine T.J. Morrow J.D.

The sequence preceding the transcription initiation site, which is GC-rich, contains four GC boxes and one Oct1-binding site, but there is no TATA box or CCAAT box. In vivo footprint analysis in human cancer cells shows that two GC boxes and the Oct1-binding site are occupied by Sp1 and Oct1, respectively. We show here that treatment with anticancer agents enhances ATP6Lexpression. Although cisplatin did not induce ATP6L promoter activity, it altered ATP6LmRNA stability. On the other hand, the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, TAS-103, strongly induced promoter activity, and this effect was completely eradicated when a mutation was introduced into the Oct1-binding site. Treatment with TAS-103 increased the levels of both Sp1/Sp3 and Oct1 in nuclear extracts. Cooperative binding of Sp1 and Oct1 to the promoter is required for promoter activation by TAS-103. Incubation of a labeled oligonucleotide probe encompassing the −73/−68 GC box and −64/−57 Oct1-binding site with a nuclear extract from drug-treated KB cells yielded higher levels of the specific DNA-protein complex than an extract of untreated cells. Thus, the two transcription factors, Sp1 and Oct1 interact, in an adaptive response to DNA damage, by up-regulating expression of the vacuolar H+-ATPase genes. Furthermore, combination of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, with TAS-103 enhanced apoptosis of KB cells with an associated increase in caspase-3 activity. Our data suggest that the induction of V-ATPase expression is an anti-apoptotic defense, and V-ATPase inhibitors in combination with low-dose anticancer agents may provide a new therapeutic approach.

Moreover, tumor cells often exist in an hypoxic microenvironment lower in pH than that of surrounding normal cells. Hence, proton extrusion may be up-regulated to protect tumor cells from acidosis. Four major types of pH regulators have been identified in tumor cells as follows: sodium-proton exchangers, bicarbonate transporters, proton-lactate symporters, and proton pumps. The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)1 is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

It is a multisubunit enzyme composed of a membrane sector and a cytosolic catalytic sector (10Bowman B.S. Dschida W.J. Harris T. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it pumps protons from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the vacuole and also regulates cytosolic pH. V-ATPase is active in the plasma membrane of human tumor cells (11Martinez-Zaguilan R. Lynch R.M. Martinez G.M. Gillies R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1015-C1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and V-ATPase genes are considered “housekeeping genes.” However, cytosolic pH is critical for the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents (12Laurencot C.M. Andrews P.A. Kennedy K.A. Oncol. Res. 1995; 7: 363-369PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular acidosis is thought to be a trigger for apoptosis and to play a role in drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms regulating tumor acidity is important for developing new approaches to cancer chemotherapy. By using differential display, we have shown that one of the proton pump subunit genes, ATP6L (subunit c), is induced by cisplatin (13Murakami T. Sibuya I. Ise T. Zhe-Sheng C. Akiyama S. Nakagawa M. Izumi H. Nakamura T. Matsuo K. Yamada Y. Kohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and several V-ATPase subunit genes are up-regulated in drug-resistant cell lines (13Murakami T. Sibuya I. Ise T. Zhe-Sheng C.

Interaction of the V-ATPase c subunit with β1 integrin has been reported (15Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23119-23127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,16Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. J. Biol.

The level of the V-ATPase c subunit may be critical for V-ATPase activity. In order to study transcriptional regulation of the c subunit at the molecular level, we have identified its promoter sequences and characterized the transcription factors that regulate its expression in cancer cells. We hypothesized that V-ATPase expression is up-regulated in response to cellular acidosis and show that c subunit promoter activity is activated by treatment with anticancer agents, especially the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, TAS-103 (17Azuma R. Urakawa A. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Appl. 1997; 691: 179-185Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Byl J.A. Fortune J.M. Burden D.A. Nitiss J.L. Utsugi T. Yamada Y. Osheroff N.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4077-4084PubMed Google Scholar). We show also that the levels of two transcription factors, Sp1 and Oct1, increase in response to genotoxic stress and that V-ATPase inhibition strongly enhances TAS-103-induced apoptosis. ATP6Lgenomic clones were isolated from a human placental genomic library in EMBL3 by screening with cDNA. All positive phage were mapped with EcoRI and SalI. Several genomic fragments were also used as hybridization probes to confirm the overlapping regions. Two genomic DNA fragments around the first exon were subcloned into pUC18 (Fermentas AB, Lithuania) and sequenced with an Automated sequencer 377 (PE Applied Biosystems). The primer, 5′-GTCACATGACCTGGGCCCCG-3′, derived from the first exon ofATP6L, was labeled at its 5′ end and hybridized with poly(A) RNA from KB cells in 80% formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES (pH 6.4), and 1 mm EDTA for 4 h at 52 °C. The primer-RNA hybrid was precipitated and resuspended in reverse transcriptase mixture (Invitrogen). After 1 h of incubation at 42 °C, the reaction was terminated by making the solution 20 mm in EDTA. The RNA was hydrolyzed with 0.125m NaOH for 1 h at 65 °C, the reaction neutralized, and the extended DNA then precipitated with alcohol. The DNA was analyzed on a 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel to determine the size of the extended product. Sequencing reactions using the same primer were similarly analyzed.

Cancer Lett. 1994; 81: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.292 mg/ml l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. The anti-Sp1 (catalogue number sc-420 for supershift assay, sc-59 for chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and Western blotting), anti-Sp3 (sc-644), anti-Oct1 (sc-232), and anti-Oct2 (sc-233) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antiserum to V-ATPase subunit E was generated by multiple immunization of a New Zealand White rabbit with synthetic peptides as described (23Miura K. Miyazaki S. Furuta S. Mitsushita J. Kamijo K.

The sequence of the synthetic peptides is ALFGANANRKFLD. Total RNA from KB cells was isolated using Sepasol reagent (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ filter (Amersham Biosciences) with 10× SSC. Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as described (24Koike K. Abe T. Hisano T. Kubo T. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1996; 87: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For analysis of stability of V-ATPase subunit transcripts by cisplatin or TAS-103, KB cells were treated with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) and cisplatin (10 μm) or TAS-103 (4 μm) for 6 h. Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma, and TAS-103 was kindly provided from Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). KB cells were treated with or without TAS-103 for 12 h. Briefly, cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended to 0.25 m sucrose. The resuspension was overlaid with 2.10 and 1.25 m sucrose cushions and centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 12 h. The membrane fractions at the 0.25–1.25 m sucrose interface were collected and used for Western blotting. For metabolic labeling, KB cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish were cultured in Dulbecco's methionine and cysteine-free modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and were labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine labeling mixture (AmershamBiosciences) with or without 4 μm TAS-103 for 12 h. After washing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF). After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, 2 mg of supernatant (cellular fraction) were incubated with antiserum to V-ATPase subunit E or preimmune binding to 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose. The mixtures were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C and washed three times with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitation samples and 1% of preimmunoprecipitation samples (input) were simultaneously separated on a 15 or 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The EcoRI and NotI fragment (nt −1627 to nt +194) of the ATP6L gene into theSmaI site of basic vector 2 (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) was designed pV-ATPase c Luc1. For the construction of deletion constructs, it was digested with PstI (pV-ATPase c Luc2),BshTI (pV-ATPase c Luc6), and NarI (pV-ATPase c Luc7). The digestion products were self-ligated. Other constructs (pV-ATPase c Luc3, -4, and -5) were constructed by PCR (Fig.7 A). The pV-ATPase c Luc3m1, Luc3m2, Luc3m3, Luc3SR, and Luc3–5bp were constructed by PCR-based method using mutated oligonucleotides (Figs. 7 B and 9 B). ATP6Egenomic clones were isolated from a human placental genomic library, and the 5′-flanking region of the ATP6E(nt −715 to +132) gene was subcloned in basic vector 2 (pV-ATPase E Luc1). Sp1 cDNA (encoding amino acids 30 to C-terminal) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley), and theXhoI fragment added start codon at the N-terminal start codon was ligated in pcDNA3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). For expression plasmids, full-length cDNA fragments of human Sp3, Oct1, and Oct2 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from KB cells and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The following oligonucleotides were used for cDNA constructions: Sp3, 5′-ATGGCTGCCTTGGACGTGGATAGC-3′ and 5′-TTACTCCATTGTCTCATTTCCAGAAAC-3′; Oct1, 5′-ATGAACAATCCGTCAGAAACCAGTAAACC-3′ and 5′-TCACTGTGCCTTGGAGGCGGTGGTGG-3′; Oct2, 5′-ATGGTTCACTCCAGCATGGGGGC-3′ and 5′-TTACCCCGTGCTGGGGTTCAGG-3′.Figure 9Cooperation between Sp1 and Oct1 at theATP6Lpromoter. A, EMSA with mutant forms of Oligo3. Labeled oligonucleotides with reversed GC box (Oligo3SR) or a 5-bp sequence inserted between the Sp1 and Oct1 sites (Oligo3–5bp) were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Buffer S nuclear extracts of KB cells treated with TAS-103 (4 μm) were incubated with probes and 2 μg of anti-Sp1 or anti-Oct1 antibody (Ab) for 30 min at 4 °C. The slower migrating band (C3) is a complex formed with both Sp1 and Oct1, the faster migrating band (C6) is formed with either Sp1 or Oct1.

On the following day, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA using 2 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The β-galactosidase reporter gene (pSV-β-gal, Nippon Gene, Tokyo) was co-transfected as an internal control. After transfection for 12 h, the cells were washed, incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in fresh medium or in medium containing either TAS-103 (4 μm) or cisplatin (10 μm), and then harvested. For co-transfection experiments with Sp1, Sp3, Oct1, and Oct2 expression plasmids, PC3 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid (pV-ATPase c Luc3) and 0.4 μg of expression plasmid. After transfection for 12 h, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in fresh medium and then harvested. Lysed cells were assayed for luciferase activity using a Picagene kit (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan); the light intensity was measured for 15 s with a luminometer (Dynatech ML1500, JEOL, Japan). The β-galactosidase enzyme assay was performed according to the protocol of Promega. KB cells and MCF7 cells were treated with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo (25Konishi T. Nomoto M. Shimizu K. Abe T. Itoh H. Friedrich H. Gunther E. Higashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The extracted DNA was cleaved with 1 m piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min. As a control guanine ladder, naked genomic DNA from KB cells was reacted with DMS in vitro and cleaved with piperidine as described above. Ligation-mediated PCR was performed as described previously (25Konishi T. Nomoto M. Shimizu K. Abe T. Itoh H. Friedrich H. Gunther E. Higashi K. J. Biochem.

The nucleotide sequences of individual primers are as follows: 5′-GCCTGCAGCTTCACGCC-3′ (−172 to −184) primer 1; 5′-CGCCGGGAACCCAACACCTGC-3′ (−135 to −115) primer 2; 5′-CCGGGAACCCAACACCTGCAGACGACGC-3′ (−133 to −106) primer 3 for analysis of the lower strand of the subunit c gene. Primers 1 and 2 were used for the first strand synthesis and PCR amplification, respectively. Primer 3 was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and used for final detection of the ladder. Protein-DNA cross-linking was performed by incubating KB cells with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 5 min. Cells were then lysed in buffer X (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm PMSF) for 15 min on ice. The lysate was sonicated with 10 pulses of 10 s each at 50–60% of maximum power with a sonicator (Taitec, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a microtip to reduce the chromatin fragments to average sizes of less than 500 bp. Soluble chromatin was precleared by addition of 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose. An aliquot of precleared chromatin containing 1 × 106 cells was removed and used in the subsequent PCR analysis. The remainder of the chromatin was divided, with each having 1 × 106 cells, and diluted with buffer X. Then protein-DNA was incubated with 2 μg of anti-Sp1, anti-Oct1 antibody, and normal rabbit IgG in a final volume of 800 μl overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose pellets were washed once with 1 ml of buffer X, once with high salt buffer X (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm PMSF), once with LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate (pH 8.0)), and twice with TE (10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Immune complexes were eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, 1% SDS). To reverse the protein-DNA cross-linking, eluted samples were incubated with 0.2 m NaCl for 4 h at 65 °C. Samples were digested with proteinase K (0.04 mg/ml) for 2 h at 45 °C and then with RNase A (0.02 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of H2O. Aliquots of 1 μl of serial dilution were analyzed by PCR with the appropriate primer pairs. The V-ATPase c promoter primers are as follows: 5′-CTGCAGACGACGCGCAGCCGCAGAGGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCGCGAGACCGGTCCAACGCTGCGGAGATC-3′, and the YB-1promoter primers are 5′-AGATCTCTATCACGTGGCTGTTGC-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTATCAGTCCTCCATTCTCATTGG-3′. Amplification was performed for a pre-determined optimal number of cycles. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, which were stained with ethidium bromide. Nuclear extracts using buffer S of KB cells were prepared as described (27Rundlof A.K. Carlsten M. Arner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30542-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were collected with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed with a dropping of 0.6% Nonidet P-40, and the lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer S (20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm DTT), and KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.4 m and incubated for 15 min on ice with frequent gentle mixing. Following centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material, the supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −70 °C. Nuclear extracts using buffer C were also prepared as described (28Ise T. Nagatani G. Imanura T. Kato K. Takano H. Nomoto M. Izumi H. Ohmori H. Okamoto T. Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 342-346PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were collected with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were lysed with a dropping of 0.6% Nonidet P-40, and the lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT) and incubated for 15 min on ice with frequent gentle mixing. Following centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove insoluble material, the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. Its protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. EMSAs were performed as described (27Rundlof A.K. Carlsten M. Arner E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30542-30551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 μg of nuclear extract proteins prepared with buffer S were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 7.5% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 × 104cpm (1 ng) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe in the absence or presence of various competitors. On the other hand, 4 μg of nuclear extract proteins prepared with buffer C were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 8% glycerol, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 × 104 cpm (1 ng) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Products were analyzed on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels using a bioimaging analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). The sequences of oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are as follows: Oligo1 (−118 to −89), 5′-CTGCAGACGACGCGCAGCCGCAGAGGAGGC-3′ and 3′-ACGTCTGCTGCGCGTCGGCGTCTCCTCCGC-5′; Oligo2 (−98 to −69), 5′-CAGAGGAGGCGGGGCGTCCGAGGCCCCGCC-3′ and 3′-TCTCCTCCGCCCCGCAGGCTCCGGGGCGGG-5′; Oligo3 (−78 to −49), 5′-AGGCCCCGCCCCGTATGCTAATGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCGGGGCGGGGCATACGATTACTTCGTGTG-5′; Oligo4 (−58 to −29), 5′-ATGAAGCACACACCACACCGCCCCGCCCCG-3′ and 3′-ACTTCGTGTGTGGTGTGGCGGGGCGGGGCC-5′; Oligo5 (−38 to −9), 5′-CCCCGCCCCGGCGCGAGACCGGTCCAACGC-3′ and 3′-GGGCGGGGCCGCGCTCTGGCCAGGTTGCGA-5′; Oligo6 (−28 to +2), 5′-GCGCGAGACCGGTCCAACGCTGCGGAGATC-3′ and 3′-GCGCTCTGGCCAGGTTGCGACGCCTCTAGG-5′; Oligo3m1, 5′-AGGCCCTTCCCCGTATGCTAATGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCGGGAAGGGGCATACGATTACTTCGTGTG-5′; Oligo3m2, 5′-AGGCCCCGCCCCGTATGCTTTTGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCGGGGCGGGGCATACGAAAACTTCGTGTG-5′; Oligo3m3, 5′-AGGCCCTTCCCCGTATGCTTTTGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCGGGAAGGGGCATACGAAAACTTCGTGTG-5′; Oligo3SR, 5′-AGGGGGGCGGGGGTATGCTAATGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCCCCCGCCCCCATACGATTACTTCGTGTG-5′; Oligo3–5bp, 5′-AGGCCCCGCCCCGTCTAGAATGCTAATGAAGCACA-3′ and 3′-CCGGGGCGGGGCAGATCTTACGATTACTTCGTGTG-5′. For supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with probes and 2 μg of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-Oct1, and anti-Oct2 antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Preparation of nuclear extracts and separation of membrane fractions were described above. Nuclear extracts (100 μg of protein) of KB cells prepared with buffer C were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and membrane fractions (40 μg) by sucrose gradient of KB cells were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semidry blotter. Prestained protein marker (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was used as a molecular weight standard. Immunoblot analysis was performed with an appropriate dilution of each antibody. KB cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish were treated with TAS-103, bafilomycin A1 (Wako, Ohsaka, Japan), and a combination of these drugs for 36 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% SDS and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 50 °C for 2 h and then with RNase A (0.02 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Purified DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of H2O. DNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, which were stained with ethidium bromide (19Kluza J. Lansiaux A. Wattez N. Mahieu C. Osheroff N. Bailly C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4077-4084PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 4 × 104 KB cells and treated with TAS-103, bafilomycin A1, and a combination of these drugs for 36 h. The cells were removed by trypsinization and resuspended in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant fractions were collected. The fluorescence (CPP32 activity) of each sample was analyzed with the Fluorometric CaspACETMAssay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For caspase activity with CaspACETMFITC-VAD-FMK in situ marker (Promega, Madison, WI), KB cells were treated with TAS-103, bafilomycin A1, and a combination of these drugs for 48 h. Cells were stained with CaspACETMFITC-VAD-FMK in situ marker according the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. For statistical analysis of each experiment, 4 fields (×400) were counted per stimulation and cell type (between 300 and 400 cells in total). To isolate genomic clones encoding the 5′ region of theATP6L gene, a human genomic library was screened with a previously isolated ATP6LcDNA clone (13Murakami T. Sibuya I. Ise T. Zhe-Sheng C. Akiyama S. Nakagawa M. Izumi H. Nakamura T. Matsuo K. Yamada Y. Kohno K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Two clones containing non-identical inserts were characterized. The restriction map of these clones is shown in Fig.1 A, and sequence analysis confirmed that they encode ATP6L. To localize the first exon more accurately, the promoter proximal plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes and analyzed by Southern blotting using cDNA. In order to determine the nucleotide sequence of the promoter region, a 1.9-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment of EMBL3 was subcloned into pUC18 (Fig. 1 A), and the nucleotide sequence of the first exon and its 5′-flanking region were determined (Fig.1 B). This fragment contained exons with sequences identical to the 5′ portion previously determined from cDNA. To define precisely the transcription initiation site, we performed primer extension. The cDNA products extended from the primer were analyzed by electrophoresis and sequenced using the same primer. Two major transcription initiation sites were observed (Fig.2). About 20% of the transcripts initiated at +1 and 80% initiated at +75. The transcription initiation site of the human gene is located 236 bp upstream from that of the mouse gene (29Wang S.P. Krits I. Bai S. Lee B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8827-8834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An additional 100-bp sequence of the 5′-untranslated region has been published.

Among them, chromosome 3 shows a very high incidence of loss of heterozygosity (LOH); and several established or candidate tumor suppressor genes, including the VHL,FHIT, and RASSF1A genes, are located on this chromosome (6Kaelin Jr., W.G. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Druck T. Berk L. Huebner K. Oncol.

Zabarovsky E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7504-7509Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The VHL gene is responsible for a hereditary cancer syndrome, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, and accounts for 30–90% LOH on chromosome 3 in sporadic clear cell RCC. On the other hand, other chromosomes show LOH at various frequencies, generally ranging from 20 to 50%; and several candidate genes were mapped. Tuberous sclerosis patients develop RCC, and theTSC-2 gene located on chromosome 16 may be responsible for this type of RCC (9Green A.J. Smith M. Yates J.R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, details of the mechanism of RCC formation are unknown for most of these established or candidate tumor suppressor genes, and a number of genes are associated with RCC.Loss of function of recessive tumor suppressor genes proceeds through inactivation of the genes for both alleles (10Knudson A.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This process, so-called “two hits,” involves genetic as well as epigenetic mutations. On the other hand, an increasing amount of evidence supports loss of function by methylation in the promoter and/or exon 1 regions (11Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 12Esteller M. Herman J.G. J.

Such genes might not accompany a genetic mutation at a very high frequency and thus show a relatively low incidence of deletions, which are needed for mapping the sporadic tumor-related loci with microsatellite markers. This indicates that a tumor suppressor gene can be found even in the loci showing relatively low frequencies of homozygous or hemizygous deletions. As a comprehensive method for searching and cloning the sites of hemizygous methylation is not available, mapping hemizygous deletions for the tumor-related loci is still an efficient strategy.We previously performed a comprehensive search for LOH sites in 44 (mostly clear cell-type) RCC cases, and a total of 27 candidate loci showing frequencies of LOH of at least 10% were found (14Hatano N. Nishikawa S.N. McElgunn C. Sarkar S. Ozawa K. Shibanaka Y. Nakajima M. Ghoji K. Kiyama R. Mol. Carcinogen. 2001; 31: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Among them, LOH on chromosome 9 showed as a relatively frequent event in RCC (25%). We report here a candidate tumor suppressor gene and a mechanism of LOH for this gene.DISCUSSIONHaploinsufficiency is one of the prerequisites for recessive tumor suppressor genes, where serial hits for both alleles are needed for loss of function (23Cook W.D. McCaw B.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Inherited cancers show the first hit as a germ-line mutation, and the second hit results in loss of function of the gene, as explained by the hypothesis of Knudson (24Knudson Jr., A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5485) Google Scholar). On the other hand, sporadic cancers have more difficulty in assessing whether the gene acts as a tumor suppressor because the first hit is recognized mainly after the second hit, which results in tumor formation. In this case, one cannot see the process of cancer formation, as the first-hit state in a single cell is hard to observe and is mainly seen after the second hit, which is often complicated by additional mutations in many other genes, sometimes accompanied by more dynamic chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, one can try to reconstruct the process retrospectively. A third case, loss of function by methylation, is becoming more evident, as this includes epigenetic changes sometimes observed in many cells (25Esteller M. Silva J.M. Dominguez G. Bonilla F. Matias-Guiu X. Lerma E. Bussaglia E. Prat J. Harkes I.C. Repasky E.A. Gabrielson E. Schutte M. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. J. Natl.

A. 2002; 99: 4562-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, there is no report so far of imprinted tumor suppressor genes, where allele-specific and hemizygous methylation in the normal cells followed by loss of heterozygosity is expected for the same gene. Because the numbers of epigenetic alterations in sporadic cancers, expected to be a few to hundreds (29Ponder B.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), cannot be explained by somatic mutations alone (usually on the order of 10−5 in frequency or less), methylation and other mechanisms with even higher frequencies might have contributed. The very high frequency (9 of 10 cases) of allele-specific methylation of the Kank gene in normal tissues, which was followed by deletion of the normal allele, indicates a crucial role for this gene in the tumorigenesis of RCC. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)1 is the most common malignancy in the adult kidney and shows genetic rearrangement in a number of chromosomes (1Morita R. Ishikawa J. Tsutsumi M. Hikihi K. Tsukada Y.

However, there is no report so far of imprinted tumor suppressor genes, where allele-specific and hemizygous methylation in the normal cells followed by loss of heterozygosity is expected for the same gene. Because the numbers of epigenetic alterations in sporadic cancers, expected to be a few to hundreds (29Ponder B.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), cannot be explained by somatic mutations alone (usually on the order of 10−5 in frequency or less), methylation and other mechanisms with even higher frequencies might have contributed. The very high frequency (9 of 10 cases) of allele-specific methylation of the Kank gene in normal tissues, which was followed by deletion of the normal allele, indicates a crucial role for this gene in the tumorigenesis of RCC. Haploinsufficiency is one of the prerequisites for recessive tumor suppressor genes, where serial hits for both alleles are needed for loss of function (23Cook W.D. McCaw B.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3434-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Inherited cancers show the first hit as a germ-line mutation, and the second hit results in loss of function of the gene, as explained by the hypothesis of Knudson (24Knudson Jr., A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5485) Google Scholar). On the other hand, sporadic cancers have more difficulty in assessing whether the gene acts as a tumor suppressor because the first hit is recognized mainly after the second hit, which results in tumor formation. In this case, one cannot see the process of cancer formation, as the first-hit state in a single cell is hard to observe and is mainly seen after the second hit, which is often complicated by additional mutations in many other genes, sometimes accompanied by more dynamic chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, one can try to reconstruct the process retrospectively.

This mutant nitrogenase can reduce acetylene, but its N2reduction activity is only ∼7% that of the wild type. Furthermore, unlike the wild type, its H2 evolution activity is inhibited in the presence of CO (2McLean P.A. Dixon R.A. Nature. 1981; 292: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Dixon R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The wild-type Kp1 protein and NifV− Kp1 protein apparently possess the same metal constituents (1Hawkes T.R. McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); however, it is thought that the organic acid constituent of the FeMoco differs.The wild-type Kp1 has homocitrate ligated to the molybdenum atom of the FeMoco (4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Homocitrate is synthesized by the nifV-encoded homocitrate synthase (NifV) condensation of acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate (5Zheng L.M. White R.H. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R-homocitrate is the only isomer producedin vivo (6Hoover T.R. Robertson A.D. Cerny R.L. Hayes R.N. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. Nature. 1987; 329: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and in an in vitro FeMoco assembly system (7Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), only the R-isomer is incorporated from racemic mixtures of L- and R-isomers. The incorporation of 17 different di- and tricarboxylic acids into the cofactor has been tested, but only citrate, which differs from homocitrate by a single methylene group (see Fig. 1), yielded a FeMoco analogue capable of producing MoFe protein with C2H2reduction activity comparable to that of the wild type (7Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy of the extracted organic moiety from NifV− Kp1 identified citrate but no homocitrate (8Liang J. Madden M. Shah V.K. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8577-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The authors reasonably concluded that the citrate was bound in place of homocitrate, although these experiments did not prove its association with the FeMoco. Here we report the crystal structure of the NifV− Kp1 protein at 1.9 Å resolution demonstrating that citrate occupies the site of homocitrate in the altered protein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe protein components of the NifV− Kp1 model were closely superposable with the wild-type Kp1 structure, giving a root mean square deviation of only 0.27 Å over all protein atoms. A difference electron density map at 1.9 Å resolution calculated using phases derived from a model containing FeMoco without an organic acid substituent, clearly indicated residual density at the molybdenum end of the cofactor. However, homocitrate gave a relatively poor fit to this density, whereas citrate gave a better fit but did not account for all the residual density. An additional lobe of density was present extending away from the shortened (with respect to homocitrate) carboxylate arm of the citrate (Fig. 2), which was consistent with the presence of an additional atom. Furthermore, the average temperature factor for the citrate refined to a significantly higher value than that for the molybdenum of the FeMoco, 32 Å2 versus 17 Å2, respectively, strongly suggesting that the citrate was present at reduced occupancy. By comparison, after refinement of the wild-type dithionite-reduced structure at 1.6 Å resolution, the fully occupied homocitrate and the molybdenum had comparable temperature factors of 12 Å2 and 11 Å2, respectively (4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Figure 2Stereo view showing a superposition of the structures of wild-type Kp1 (thin bonds, from PDB entry 1QGU) and NifV − Kp1 (thick bonds) at the molybdenum end of FeMoco. Also displayed is a 1.9 Å resolution positive difference electron density map contoured at 4ς, calculated from the NifV− data and a model lacking an organic acid. The longer carboxylate arm of the homocitrate in the wild-type structure can clearly be seen protruding from the density, whereas the citrate and water molecule of the NifV− model are more consistent with the density. For clarity, the bonds from the organic acids to the molybdenum atoms and the additional half-occupancy water molecules of the NifV− structure have been omitted. This figure was produced using the programs O and OPLOT (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Attempts to model alternative organic acids into the residual electron density were less convincing than the citrate, whereas the placement of a water molecule in the extra lobe of density yielded an improbable hydrogen bond length of 1.6 Å with the citrate. Similarly, a monovalent cation, such as sodium, would have been too close to the carboxylate group. Nevertheless, the putative water molecule was capable of hydrogen bonding to the backbone NH group of Ile-α423 (α425 in Av1 2Kp1 residue numbering is used throughout. For a comparison of Kp1 and Av1 sequences see Ref. 4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar. (Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase component 1)), an interaction mimicking that seen in the wild-type protein between the long carboxylate arm of homocitrate and this residue (Fig.3). Because we have a full complement of metals (see “Experimental Procedures”), we therefore propose that the crystal comprised a mixture of protein containing FeMoco with citrate bound, and protein containing FeMoco without an organic ligand (referred to as MoFe cluster, see below). In the absence of the citrate, a network of water molecules most likely occupies this region and may mimic some of the interactions made by the citrate with both the protein and the molybdenum. Therefore, the citrate and the original water molecule were assigned half-occupancy, and two additional half-occupancy water molecules were introduced, overlapping the carboxyl oxygen (O-5) and the hydroxyl oxygen (O-7) of the citrate that coordinate the molybdenum. After the final refinement, the citrate had an overall temperature factor of 17 Å2, and the three half-occupancy waters had an average temperature factor of 16 Å2, as compared with the overall value of 17 Å2 for the rest of the cofactor. As a further test, the refinement was repeated using a half-occupancy homocitrate in place of the citrate, which resulted in a slightly higher overall temperature factor of 20 Å2 for the organic acid moiety. Nevertheless, averaging the temperature factors of the atoms at the end of the long pendant arm (–CH2–COO−) of the refined homocitrate gave a value of 26 Å2 as compared with the structurally equivalent group (–COO−) of citrate, that gave a significantly lower value of 18 Å2. Therefore, we conclude that these data were more consistent with the presence of citrate than of homocitrate.Figure 3The same superposition as Fig. 2 displaying more of the FeMoco environment. In particular showing the interactions of the organic acids with the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The low level of N2 reduction displayed by thenifV mutant of K. pneumoniae (2McLean P.A. Dixon R.A. Nature. 1981; 292: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Dixon R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) could result from a low constitutive level of homocitrate. Indeed, inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, a homocitrate synthase catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of lysine (18Strassman M. Ceci L.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 14: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the genome sequence for K. pneumoniae strain M5a1 is not yet available, it is genetically very similar to Escherichia coli. Although a homocitrate synthase is not specifically annotated in the E. coli genome, there are a number of NifV homologues. Sequence similarity searching with the Klebsiella enzyme using PSI-BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59110) Google Scholar) found three E. coli homologues of 2-isopropylmalate synthase, each with 31% identity to NifV. The latter enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of leucine, namely the condensation of acetyl-CoA and α-ketoisovalerate to form 2-isopropylmalate, a reaction that is closely similar to that performed by NifV. There is a possibility that homologues of these gene products are also present in K. pneumoniae and may be able to produce homocitrate. Therefore, although the insertion of citrate rather than homocitrate into the NifV− Kp1 structure is more consistent with our data, we cannot rule out the incorporation of a small percentage of the latter into the cofactor. We would not be able to detect this crystallographically.Imperial et al. (7Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed the requirement for an organic acid during in vitro FeMoco biosynthesis. However, there remains the possibility that other organic acids may indeed facilitate the biosynthesis of the FeMoco but are not always themselves incorporated. Hoover et al. (20Hoover T.R. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that thein vitro FeMoco biosynthetic system has a 10–100-fold stronger preference for homocitrate than for any other organic acid tested. These data may suggest that alternative organic acids do not bind as tightly as homocitrate to the FeMoco. Perhaps, these alternative organic acids are more prone to dissociation from the FeMoco metal cluster at some stage after assisting in the biosynthesis/insertion process. This scenario has the potential to produce three types of protein or more likely various combinations of the three: (i) MoFe protein that possesses FeMoco and an organic acid, (ii) MoFe protein that possesses FeMoco but no organic acid, or (iii) apoMoFe protein (protein that lacked FeMoco and an organic acid completely). Certainly scenarios (i) and (iii) have been shown to occur, and (ii) can be produced artificially (see below). However, the possibility that (ii) occurs in combination with (i) has not been considered. Spectroscopic techniques such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure are unlikely to detect subtle differences in the molybdenum environment such as replacement of a carboxyl ligand with a water molecule.MoFe protein containing a MoFe-like center that lacks homocitrate (termed the MoFe cluster) has been constructed (21Ma L. Gavini N. Liu H.I. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18007-18015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ma L. Brosius M.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10528-10532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This was produced by isolating FeMoco from MoFe protein in a way that removes the homocitrate (extraction into acidic methyl ethyl ketone) and reintroducing the MoFe cluster into apoMoFe protein. This protein did not reduce protons or acetylene, but in the presence of Fe protein and MgATP, hydrolysis of MgATP occurred at 28% that of the wild-type protein rate. Furthermore, the spectroscopic properties of MoFe cluster protein were virtually indistinguishable from the wild-type protein. It exhibited the same characteristic S = 3/2 spin signal in the presence of dithionite and very similar oxidation states and ligand environments as defined by Mo-k edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure. Presumably this means that the homocitrate hydroxyl and carboxyl ligands are replaced by water. However, it appeared that the metal content might be altered in the MoFe cluster which was reported as a 6Fe:1Mo ratio compared with a 7Fe:1Mo ratio for isolated FeMoco, although this may not be a statistically significant difference. These observations would suggest that if our preparation of NifV− Kp1 had 50% of the MoFe protein containing citrate and 50% with no organic acid, then spectroscopically it would be impossible to distinguish the two species. This interpretation is consistent with the recent mass spectrometric analysis of NifV− Av1, where the citrate concentration was only 30% that of the molybdenum (23Newton W.E. Vichitphan K. Fisher K. Finan T. Layzell D. O'Brien M.R. Vessey K. Newton W.E. 13th International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation. CABI Publishing, Wallingford, Oxford, UK2002Google Scholar).If acetylene reduction by MoFe protein requires a FeMoco containing an organic acid but the activity is essentially the same with either homocitrate or citrate, then a 50% occupancy of citrate could account for the activity of the NifV− Kp1 preparation, which was half the activity of the wild-type protein: 930 nmol min−1 mg−1 (this work) versus 1800 nmol min−1mg−1, respectively (4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Explanations for the effects of the nifV mutation on H2 evolution and N2 reduction activities are more difficult to deduce. There is good spectroscopic evidence that MoFe protein binds CO at at least two sites on wild-type FeMoco (24Pollock R.C. Lee H.I. Cameron L.M. Derose V.J. Hales B.J. Ormejohnson W.H. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8686-8687Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Lee H.I. Cameron L.M. Hales B.J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 10121-10126Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26George S.J. Ashby G.A. Wharton C.W. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6450-6451Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This results in inhibition of the reduction of most substrates, but not H2 evolution. However, CO does inhibit H2 evolution by the NifV− nitrogenase (2McLean P.A. Dixon R.A. Nature. 1981; 292: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This behavior is also observed with a Gln-α190 Lys mutant (27Scott D.J. May H.D. Newton W.E. Brigle K.E. Dean D.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Scott D.J. Dean D.R. Newton W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20002-20010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gln-α190 (α191 in Av1) is hydrogen-bonded to one of the carboxyl groups of homocitrate (Fig. 3). These data imply a relationship between modification of homocitrate and CO inhibition of H2evolution. It is conceivable that such modifications perturb proton supply to FeMoco or possibly cause slight changes in the molybdenum coordination sphere, which allow CO to bind.The site of binding of other substrates to FeMoco has been investigated using targeted mutagenesis of the residues surrounding it in the protein. There is strong evidence for two sites for acetylene binding, one of high and the other of lower affinity. The evidence (29Christiansen J. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36104-36107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicates that the high affinity site is on a central 4Fe face of FeMoco close to Val-α69 (α70 in Av1). When this site is perturbed by mutating the preceding residue, Gly-α68 (α69 in Av1), to a Ser, acetylene becomes a competitive inhibitor of N2 reduction. These data suggest that N2 binds to the lower affinity acetylene site (29Christiansen J. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36104-36107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the location of this site is unclear. Several other mutations, in such disparate positions as Gln-α190 (28Scott D.J. Dean D.R. Newton W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20002-20010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (near homocitrate) and Arg-α275 (α277 in Av1) (30Shen J. Dean D.R. Newton W.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4884-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (close to Cys-α273 or α275 in Av1, which binds the tetrahedral iron at the opposite end of FeMoco), eliminate N2 reduction activity and thus give no clue to the N2 binding site or its mechanism of reduction. One explanation of the above phenomenon is that the environment of FeMoco is critically important in accessing the lower redox levels. On the above model, level E4 of the Lowe-Thorneley scheme (31Thorneley R.N.F. Lowe D.J. Spiro T.G. Molybdenum Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 221-284Google Scholar), which binds N2, can be accessed in the wild-type. However, the above substitutions of amino acids, and possibly homocitrate, in the FeMoco environment perturb critical hydrogen bonds such that only level E2 can be reached and thus only H+ and acetylene reduced.There have been numerous attempts to model the binding and reduction of substrates by the FeMoco, as reviewed in Lawson and Smith (32Lawson D.M. Smith B.E. Sigel A. Sigel H. Molybdenum and Tungsten: Their Roles in Biological Processes. 39. M. Dekker, Inc., New York2002: 75-119Google Scholar), but only one model specifically addresses the role of the organic acid in catalysis. In this model, based on the Av1 structure (33Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), citrate and homocitrate are thought to bind to the molybdenum atom in an analogous fashion through alkoxy and carboxylato groups (34Gronberg K.L.C. Gormal C.A. Durrant M.C. Smith B.E. Henderson R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10613-10621Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). During catalysis, after dissociation of the carboxylate ligand from molybdenum, the flexible pendant arm of the homocitrate is proposed to hydrogen-bond to the Nε2 of His-α440 (α442 in Av1). This hydrogen bond would impose an imidazolate character on the His, effectively increasing the electron density within the cluster and thus promoting N2 binding. By contrast, the shorter arm of citrate would be unable to make the same hydrogen bond to the His, with the result that N2 affinity of the cluster is decreased.In conclusion, through x-ray crystallography we have identified citrate bound to the molybdenum atom of the FeMoco in NifV− Kp1. This observation is consistent with a body of biochemical and spectroscopic data, although in these studies the association of citrate with the cofactor itself was not proven. In addition, our study shows that the citrate is only present in approximately half of the cofactors, being substituted by water molecules in the remainder. This may account for the halving of acetylene reduction activity for this mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme. Nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia according to the following reaction.

Each αβ half of the “wild-type” protein possesses an [8Fe7S] P-cluster and a [1Mo7Fe9S:homocitrate] FeMoco 1The abbreviations used are: FeMoco, iron-molybdenum cofactor. 1The abbreviations used are: FeMoco, iron-molybdenum cofactor. center, the latter being the site at which substrate reduction occurs (1Hawkes T.R. McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The nifV mutant of K. pneumoniaeproduces an enzyme that has a wild-type Fe protein but an altered MoFe protein (NifV− Kp1 with a modified FeMoco. This mutant nitrogenase can reduce acetylene, but its N2reduction activity is only ∼7% that of the wild type. Furthermore, unlike the wild type, its H2 evolution activity is inhibited in the presence of CO (2McLean P.A. Dixon R.A. Nature. 1981; 292: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 3McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Dixon R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The wild-type Kp1 protein and NifV− Kp1 protein apparently possess the same metal constituents (1Hawkes T.R. McLean P.A. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); however, it is thought that the organic acid constituent of the FeMoco differs. The wild-type Kp1 has homocitrate ligated to the molybdenum atom of the FeMoco (4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Homocitrate is synthesized by the nifV-encoded homocitrate synthase (NifV) condensation of acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate (5Zheng L.M. White R.H. Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5963-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R-homocitrate is the only isomer producedin vivo (6Hoover T.R. Robertson A.D. Cerny R.L. Hayes R.N. Imperial J. Shah V.K. Ludden P.W. Nature. 1987; 329: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and in an in vitro FeMoco assembly system (7Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), only the R-isomer is incorporated from racemic mixtures of L- and R-isomers. The incorporation of 17 different di- and tricarboxylic acids into the cofactor has been tested, but only citrate, which differs from homocitrate by a single methylene group (see Fig. 1), yielded a FeMoco analogue capable of producing MoFe protein with C2H2reduction activity comparable to that of the wild type (7Imperial J. Hoover T.R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7796-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy of the extracted organic moiety from NifV− Kp1 identified citrate but no homocitrate (8Liang J. Madden M. Shah V.K. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8577-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The authors reasonably concluded that the citrate was bound in place of homocitrate, although these experiments did not prove its association with the FeMoco. Here we report the crystal structure of the NifV− Kp1 protein at 1.9 Å resolution demonstrating that citrate occupies the site of homocitrate in the altered protein. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe protein components of the NifV− Kp1 model were closely superposable with the wild-type Kp1 structure, giving a root mean square deviation of only 0.27 Å over all protein atoms. A difference electron density map at 1.9 Å resolution calculated using phases derived from a model containing FeMoco without an organic acid substituent, clearly indicated residual density at the molybdenum end of the cofactor. However, homocitrate gave a relatively poor fit to this density, whereas citrate gave a better fit but did not account for all the residual density. An additional lobe of density was present extending away from the shortened (with respect to homocitrate) carboxylate arm of the citrate (Fig. 2), which was consistent with the presence of an additional atom. Furthermore, the average temperature factor for the citrate refined to a significantly higher value than that for the molybdenum of the FeMoco, 32 Å2 versus 17 Å2, respectively, strongly suggesting that the citrate was present at reduced occupancy. By comparison, after refinement of the wild-type dithionite-reduced structure at 1.6 Å resolution, the fully occupied homocitrate and the molybdenum had comparable temperature factors of 12 Å2 and 11 Å2, respectively (4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Attempts to model alternative organic acids into the residual electron density were less convincing than the citrate, whereas the placement of a water molecule in the extra lobe of density yielded an improbable hydrogen bond length of 1.6 Å with the citrate. Similarly, a monovalent cation, such as sodium, would have been too close to the carboxylate group. Nevertheless, the putative water molecule was capable of hydrogen bonding to the backbone NH group of Ile-α423 (α425 in Av1 2Kp1 residue numbering is used throughout. For a comparison of Kp1 and Av1 sequences see Ref. 4Mayer S.M. Lawson D.M. Gormal C.A. Roe S.M. Smith B.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar. (Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase component 1)), an interaction mimicking that seen in the wild-type protein between the long carboxylate arm of homocitrate and this residue (Fig.3). Because we have a full complement of metals (see “Experimental Procedures”), we therefore propose that the crystal comprised a mixture of protein containing FeMoco with citrate bound, and protein containing FeMoco without an organic ligand (referred to as MoFe cluster, see below). In the absence of the citrate, a network of water molecules most likely occupies this region and may mimic some of the interactions made by the citrate with both the protein and the molybdenum. Therefore, the citrate and the original water molecule were assigned half-occupancy, and two additional half-occupancy water molecules were introduced, overlapping the carboxyl oxygen (O-5) and the hydroxyl oxygen (O-7) of the citrate that coordinate the molybdenum. After the final refinement, the citrate had an overall temperature factor of 17 Å2, and the three half-occupancy waters had an average temperature factor of 16 Å2, as compared with the overall value of 17 Å2 for the rest of the cofactor. As a further test, the refinement was repeated using a half-occupancy homocitrate in place of the citrate, which resulted in a slightly higher overall temperature factor of 20 Å2 for the organic acid moiety. Nevertheless, averaging the temperature factors of the atoms at the end of the long pendant arm (–CH2–COO−) of the refined homocitrate gave a value of 26 Å2 as compared with the structurally equivalent group (–COO−) of citrate, that gave a significantly lower value of 18 Å2. Therefore, we conclude that these data were more consistent with the presence of citrate than of homocitrate.Figure 3The same superposition as Fig. 2 displaying more of the FeMoco environment.

AB076406AB076405 vacuolar H+-ATPases expressed sequence tag microtubule-associated protein-2 The vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases),1 which are ATP-dependent proton pumps, are ubiquitous enzymes that translocate H+ across the membranes of endomembrane organelles, including vacuoles, lysosomes, endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, chromaffin granules, and coated vesicles (1Nelson N.

V-ATPase activity is also essential for intracellular membrane trafficking, processing or degradation of proteins, and receptor-mediated endocytosis in other organelles of neuronal cells. V-ATPases (V1V0) have a structure and mechanism similar to those of F-type ATPases (ATP synthases, F1F0), and their ATP-dependent conformational changes are transmitted from the membrane extrinsic sector (V1 or F1) to the proton pore (V0 or F0) through a number of subunits forming a stalk (1Nelson N.

In the case of the mammalian V1 sector, the expression of B1 is strictly limited to kidney and cochlea (25Karet F.E. Finberg K.E. Nelson R.D. Nayir A. Mocan H. Sanjad S.A. Rodriguez-Soriano J.

In contrast to the ubiquitously distributed E2 subunit, E1 is expressed specifically in testis and is required for acrosome acidification. Thus, V-ATPases may have two kinds of isoforms: those expressed in specific cells (a4, B1, and E1) and those that show specific localization after cellular differentiation (a3). The bovine G subunit was shown to contain two kinds of isoforms, although the expression pattern and localization of each isoform were not shown (27Crider B.P. Andersen P. White A.E. Zhou Z., Li, X.

In this study, we have characterized two mouse genes, Atp6g1 and Atp6g2, encoding theG1 and G2 isoforms of the V-ATPase Gsubunit, respectively. G2 was found exclusively in central nervous system neurons and exhibits high similarity to G1, which is expressed ubiquitously. In addition to the cell bodies and dendrites, we found that V-ATPases of the G2 isoform were localized in synaptic vesicles in axons, whereas those of theG1 isoform were not detectable. Our results constitute the first evidence that a unique V-ATPase with the G2 isoform is involved in the acidification of synaptic vesicles in central nervous system neurons. The GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was searched using the yeast Vma10p sequences (28Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol.

The mouse EST clone containing the entire open reading frame for the G1 or G2 isoform was verified by ABI Prism® BigDyeTM terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared with a digoxin/RNA labeling mixture and the corresponding T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 498- and 932-bp fragments derived from the 3′-untranslated regions ofG1 and G2, respectively, were cloned into the pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) and used to prepare probes. In situ hybridization was performed using 8-μm cryosections of the brains of ICR mice (∼8–10 weeks old) as previously described (29Murata Y. Kodama H. Abe T. Ishida N. Nishimura M. Levinson B. Packman S. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Sections were hybridized with probes at 45 °C for 16 h and then washed successively. For the reaction with anti-digoxigenin antibodies, slides were washed with buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Samples were treated with 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in buffer A and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted 1:750 in buffer A for 1 h. The slides were washed with buffer A and then incubated in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5). Alkaline phosphatase activity was abolished with Tris/EDTA, and the slides were rinsed in water, counterstained with methyl green, and then mounted with Crystal Mount (Biomeda). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (30Sun-Wada G.-H. Manabe S. Yoshimizu T. Yamaguchi C. Oka T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biochem.

The entire open reading frames for G1 and G2 were amplified by PCR with HiFiTM polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cloned into the pKT10 or pKT10-N-Myc vector (31Tanaka K. Nakafuku M.

Polyclonal antibodies against G1 or G2 were raised in rabbits by immunization with peptides corresponding to each isoform (G1, KETREKMTVLQNYFEQNRDE, positions 75–94; G2, QATRRQVQGMQSSQQRNRER, positions 75–94). The antisera were purified on affinity columns with coupled bacterially expressed recombinant proteins. The anti-A subunit antiserum was from Wako Bioproducts. The anti-c subunit antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. S. Ohkuma (34Nezu J. Motojima K. Tamura H. Ohkuma S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

Briefly, whole mouse brains were homogenized in buffered sucrose (320 mm sucrose and 4 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4); the homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min; and the supernatant (S1) was centrifuged for 15 min at 9200 ×g. The resulting supernatant (S2) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, yielding S3 and P3 (supernatant and pellet, respectively). The 9200 × gpellet (P2) was resuspended in the buffered sucrose and centrifuged at 10,200 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet (P2′) was resuspended in the same buffer and homogenized with 9 volumes of ice-cold water. The mixture was added to 1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 7.5 mm; incubated on ice for 30 min; and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, yielding the LP1 pellet and LS1 supernatant fraction. LS1 was further centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 2 h, and LP2 was suspended in 40 mm sucrose. LP2 was applied to a continuous sucrose gradient (50–800 mm) and centrifuged at 65,000 × g for 5 h. Fractions containing synaptophysin (a synaptic vesicle protein marker) were used as synaptic vesicle fractions. The lysosomal membranes were prepared using OptiPrep (Nycomed Pharma) as described previously (36Graham J. Ford T. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the lysosomal membrane marker LAMP-2 (37Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were used for measuring ATPase activity. ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay (26Sun-Wada G.-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

For determining the K m(ATP) andV max for V-ATPase, concanamycin-sensitive ATPase activity was measured over a range of ATP concentrations between 0.05 and 2.0 mm. Synaptic vesicles (8 μg of protein) or lysosomal membranes (30 μg of protein) were incubated in assay buffer (5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 4 mm KCl, 0.3m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase) with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide or 1 μm concanamycin A (in the same solvent) at 37 °C for 2 min. The assay was started by adding various concentrations of ATP, and the absorbance at 340 nm was continuously monitored using a Hitachi UV-2500 PC spectrophotometer. For solubilization of V-ATPase, the brain membrane fraction (5 mg/ml) was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 2%n-octyl β-glucopyranoside, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. ATPase activity bound to protein A-Sepharose beads was assayed as follows. Anti-G1 or anti-G2 IgG antibody (100 μg) was incubated in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and a 25% suspension of protein A beads at room temperature for 2 h. Beads were washed twice and resuspended in the same buffer (original volume). The antibody-bound beads were then incubated with solubilized membranes at 4 °C for 1.5 h, rinsed extensively, and resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer. The ATPase activities were assayed immediately in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml phosphatidylglycerol with or without concanamycin A using [γ-32P]ATP (0.1–5 mm) (38Tanabe M.

The amount of membrane protein bound to the beads was estimated as described previously (39Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of hippocampal and cerebellar cells were carried out using 18.5-day postcoitus embryonic mouse brains (40Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were dissociated by gentle homogenization with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and then plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated culture slides. They were cultured in NeurobasalTM medium (Invitrogen) containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 500 μml-glutamine, 25 μml-glutamic acid, and 25 μmβ-mercaptoethanol for the first 4 days and maintained by replacing the medium every 4 days. Whole brains were obtained from adult ICR mice, cryosectioned at 12 μm, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then subjected to immunohistochemistry (20Oka T. Murata Y. Namba M. Yoshimizu T. Toyomura T. Yamamoto A. Sun-Wada G.-H. Hamasaki N. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40050-40054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hippocampal and cerebellar cells cultured for 14 days were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then washed with 0.1 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% saponin, 2% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were labeled with primary and secondary antibodies. After extensive washing with the same buffer, the cells were mounted onto slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs Inc.) and then visualized using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The primary antibodies used were anti-microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) (Sigma), anti-2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (Sigma), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-synaptophysin (Progen). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (both from (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The cells were counterstained with TOPRO-3 (diluted 1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc.) to identify nuclei. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Adult mouse tissues were dissected and suspended in ice-cold 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture and then homogenized in a Wheaton homogenizer. The lysates, obtained upon centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, were centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol were used as membrane fractions. Western blotting was carried out as previously described (18Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of V-ATPase, the supernatant (solubilized V-ATPase) was incubated with 1 μg of anti-G1 or anti-G2 antibody or preimmune IgG for 1 h and then with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. After washing the beads six times with the above buffer, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in sample buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blotting. The pre-embedded silver enhancement immunogold method was used (26Sun-Wada G.-H. Imai-Senga Y. Yamamoto A. Murata Y. Hirata T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18098-18105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate-buffered saline, the mouse brain was dissected and fixed in the same solution at 4 °C for 2 h. Cryosections (6 μm) were reacted with primary antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with colloid gold (1.4-nm diameter)-conjugated secondary antibodies. The gold labeling was intensified using a silver enhancement kit (Nano Probes). Similarity searches with the yeast Vma10p (G subunit) amino acid sequence revealed the presence of related mouse EST clones in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank and the RIKEN Full-length cDNA Project Database (42Carninci P. Shibata Y. Hayatsu N. Sugahara Y. Shibata K. Itoh M. Konno H. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1617-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mouse EST clones fall into two categories, both of which are homologous to Vma10p, indicating the presence of two genes. We have determined the sequences of two EST clones (DDBJ/GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers BG175176 and BG296113) and named the proteins encoded by them the G1 and G2 isoforms, respectively. Both isoforms comprise 118 amino acid residues and show high homology (76% similarity) to yeast Vma10p (Fig.1). G1 and G2 exhibit 62% identity to each other. The amino-terminal regions ofG1 and G2 are highly conserved, whereas their carboxyl-terminal regions are variable (Fig. 1). The mouse genes encoding G1 and G2 were designated asAtp6g1 and Atp6g2, respectively. They were mapped to chromosomes 4 and 17, respectively, according to the RIKEN Database. 2Available at gsc.riken.go.jp/e/FANTOM/map/mouse/. The GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers for the cDNAs (Atp6g1 and Atp6g2) are AB076406 and AB076405, respectively. The 1.2-kb G1 transcript was detected in all tissues examined, whereas the 1.6-kb G2 transcript was expressed predominantly in brain (Fig.2 A). Consistent with its ubiquitous expression, G1 was detected from an early embryonic stage (4.5 days postcoitus). On the other hand, G2 was induced at 10.5 days postcoitus and was maintained at all subsequent stages (Fig. 2 B). 10.5 days postcoitus is the stage when the first motor neurons are established, with the outgrowth of axons starting 2 days later (43Nornes H.O. Carry M. Brain Res. 1978; 159: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Upon whole-mount in situ hybridization of 10.5-day postcoitus embryos, G1 mRNA was detected in all tissues (Fig. 3 A), whereasG2 was exclusively expressed in the central nervous system (Fig. 3 B, arrowheads). Both isoforms were highly expressed in similar regions of the adult brain (Fig. 3 C). They were strongly expressed in the cerebral cortex; dentate gyrus; the pyramidal neurons in the Ammon's fields of the hippocampus; and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The antibodies raised against G1 or G2 using specific peptides (Fig. 1) recognized the corresponding isoform expressed in yeast (Fig.4 A). Immunoblotting with anti-G2 IgG antibody revealed an 18-kDa protein only in brain, whereas the anti-G1 antibody recognized a 16-kDa band in all tissues (brain and kidney are shown in Fig. 4 A). The molecular sizes of both bands appeared to be slightly larger than those predicted from the corresponding cDNAs (13.7 and 13.6 kDa, respectively), possibly due to their amino-terminal regions being rich in lysine and arginine. Membranes were obtained from brains and treated with octyl glucoside. The solubilized V-ATPase fraction was incubated with anti-G1 or anti-G2 IgG antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to PAGE. The precipitate contained the A andc subunits of the V1 and V0 sectors, respectively, suggesting that both G1 and G2 are functional subunits of V-ATPase (Fig. 4 B). We have also examined whether or not the mouse isoforms can complement the yeast Δvma10 mutant lacking the G subunit. The open reading frame of G1 or G2 was placed under the control of the yeast TDH3 constitutive promoter, and the resulting plasmid expressing the native G1 orG2 subunit with or without a Myc tag was introduced into Δvma10 cells. The mutant cells could not grow in neutral pH medium (Fig. 5, Vector), whereas those with VMA10 or mouse G2 (without a tag) could (Fig. 5, VMA10 and G2). This indicated that expression of mouse G2 functionally complemented Δvma10. Similar complementation was not observed withG1 (Fig. 5, G1). The brain-specific expression of G2 suggests that a V-ATPase of this isoform may be involved in neuron-specific function(s). Because bothG1 and G2 are highly expressed in the adult brain, we suspected that the intracellular localizations of the two isoforms may be different. As expected, immunostaining with isoform-specific antibodies revealed that the intracellular localizations of G1 and G2 were remarkably distinct (Fig. 6). Strong signals forG1 were detected in the cell bodies of hippocampal neurons, Purkinje cells, and cerebral neurons, whereas ones for G2 were detected in fibers in the axonal region (Fig. 6,arrowheads), in addition to cell bodies and dendrites (Fig.6). We have labeled G1 or G2 in cultured hippocampal or cerebellar cells together with brain MAP2 (44Huber G. Matus A. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 151-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glial fibrillary acidic protein (45Reeves S.A. Helman L.J. Allison A. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuroscience. 1989; 28: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), markers of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, respectively. G1 was positive in the three cell types (Fig.7, A–C), whereasG2 was expressed only in MAP2-positive cells (Fig.7 C). These results indicated that G2 was expressed exclusively in neuronal cells. On the other hand, the ubiquitously distributed G1 subunit was expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in addition to neurons. G2 was clearly found in the axonal domain in addition to dendrites and cell bodies (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore,G2 staining coincided with staining of synaptophysi"

These interactions are (i) electrostatic interactions between the extremity of Lys25 side chain and carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues from the channel selectivity filter that may be strengthened by solvent exclusion provided by (ii) hydrophobic interactions involving BgK residues Tyr26 and Phe6 and Kv1.1 residue Tyr379 whose side chain protrudes in the channel vestibule. In other Kv1 channel-BgK complexes, these interactions are likely to be conserved, implicating both conserved and variable residues from the channels.

In particular, one protein ligand can bind multiple receptors and a receptor can be bound by several protein ligands of similar or even different structures (l-3), and the molecular mechanisms underlying these multiple bindings are not well understood. Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels and toxins from scorpions, snakes, sea anemones, and conus that block currents through these channels offer an appropriate mean to investigate the molecular basis of such pleiotropic aspects of protein-protein interactions. Indeed, a potassium channel can be blocked by different toxins of similar or different folds, and conversely a toxin can bind to several members of Kv1 channels (3Ménez A. Servent D. Gasparini S. Ménez A. Perspectives in Molecular Toxinology. 10. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK2002: 175-202Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that the four groups of toxins use a convergent solution to block Kv1 channels. First, despite their unrelated structures, they all exert their function by binding to the same P-region of the channels, comprised between transmembrane segments S5 and S6 (4Stocker M. Pongs O.

Second, the binding sites of all these toxins contain a functional dyad composed of a lysine and a hydrophobic residue that might constitute a minimal functional core for the toxins to bind Kv1 channels, whereas additional residues might provide each toxin with a specific binding profile (3Ménez A.

To get further insights into the toxin-channel interactions and in particular into the role of the dyad residues, we used double mutant cycle analysis to identify proximities between residues of BgK, a sea anemone toxin, and Kv1.1. Then, these proximities were used to determine the structure of BgK complexed with the S5-S6 region of Kv1.1. Analysis of this model provides a molecular basis for the convergent evolution of toxins that block Kv1 channels. BgK as well as the analogs were synthesized using a previously described procedure (13Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L.C. Rowan E.G.

The sequence identity between the S5-S6 region of Kv1.1 (residues 325–409) and region 28–112 of KcsA is 32%. For the region comprised between the two transmembrane segments S5 and S6, the sequence identitiy is 47% between both channels (Kv1.1, residues 348–382; KcsA, residues 51–85). Based on this high degree of similarity, a model of the S5-S6 region of Kv1.1 was generated by Modeler 4.0 (21Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M.

A rigid body simulated annealing procedure at 5,000 K (1,000 steps), then at 500 K (1,000 steps), was used to dock BgK on Kv1.1, driven by six distance restraints of 6 + 1, −3 Å between the residues (BgK-Kv1.1): Phe6(Cε)-Tyr379(Cε), Asn19(Nδ2/Oδ1)-Ser357(Ογ), Ser23(Ογ/Ηγ)-Tyr379(Cε), Tyr26(Cε/Oη)-Ser357(Ογ), Tyr26(Cε/Oη)-Asp361(Oδ), and Tyr26(Cε/Oη)-Tyr379(Cε) with no assignment of the channel subunit.

The 49 energetically best complexes were refined, using a procedure in which the structure of BgK was progressively relaxed by decreasing harmonic restraints from 1,000 to 0 kcal/mol/Å2 to allow flexibility of the side chains. Fluctuations in the turret regions of Kv1.1 were permitted by applying no harmonic restraints on residues 349–361. To ensure continuity between the turrets and the other parts of the channel, harmonic restraints of 5 kcal/mol/Å2 were applied to the atoms of residues 346–348 and 362–364. The rest of the channel was maintained fixed by applying harmonic restraints of 1,000 kcal/mol/Å2. The procedure included 5,000 steps of dynamics at 500 K and 8,000 steps of dynamics at 400 K using 0.8-fold reduced Van der Waals radii, followed by 10,000 steps at 300 K, using classical Van der Waals radii, under harmonic restraints. Then, 2,000 steps of minimization were performed. The 10 best structures were examined and for each restraint, and the closest channel subunit was chosen. Last, these structures were minimized with a dielectric constant equal to 10 under the following modified distance restraints: 6 + 1, −3 Å between the residues (BgK-Kv1.1 subunit) (subunits were named clockwise A, B, C, and D): Phe6 (cycle atoms)-Tyr379A (cycle atoms), Asn19(Nδ2/Oδ1)-Ser357C(Ογ), Ser23(Ογ/Ηγ)-Tyr379D(Oη), Tyr26(Oη)-Ser357D(Ογ), Tyr26(Oη)-Asp361D(Oδ) and Tyr26(cycle atoms)-Tyr379D(cycle atoms). Nonbonded interactions were calculated with a switching function extending from 7.5 to 9.0 Å. A united atom model was used in which nonpolar hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms are incorporated into the latter, but the polar hydrogen atoms were treated explicitly. All the calculations were carried out using X-PLOR (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A system for X-ray cristallography and NMR, version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) in a force field derived from CHARMM19 (file topallh19.pro and parallh19.pro in X-PLOR 3.1). Van der Waals and electrostatic energies for all the residues-residues pairs were calculated, and residues were considered as interacting for energies >1 kcal·mol−1. For each cycle of the double mutant analysis, the effect of a substitution in BgK on the effect of a substitution in Kv1.1 was quantified by measuring the affinity of wild-type and monosubstituted BgK for wild-type and monosubstituted mKv1.1 channels. Choice of residues substituted in BgK was based on previous results (24Alessandri-Haber N. Lecoq A. Gasparini S. Grangier-Macmath G. Jacquet G. Harvey A.L. de Medeiros C.L.C. Rowan E.G. Gola M. Ménez A. Crest M. J. Biol.

In the P-region of Kv1.1, four positions, reported to be important for toxins binding (28Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S.

As a control, we also substituted a buried residue from the pore helix (S369T). The electrophysiological properties of the mutant channels in respect to the voltage dependence of activation, deactivation, and inactivation were not significantly different from wild-type channels. Minor changes in respect to the time course of inactivation were observed as expected, for example for the Y379H mutant channel (for comparison, see Ref. 31Jäger H. Rauer H. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 506: 291-301Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since toxin affinity was estimated using changes in peak current amplitudes, minor changes in the inactivation time course will not influence these estimations. The analogs of BgK were first tested both by electrophysiological and binding experiments (Fig. 2, Aand B) on wild-type Kv1.1. For electrophysiological experiments, analogs F6A, H13A, N19A, and Y26A were tested by dose-response experiments (Fig. 2 A), whereasK d values for analogs W5A, S23A, Q24A, and K25A were deduced from the block of current by certain concentrations that allowed the calculation of K d values assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry. All the values are shown in TableI. Probably reflecting differences in the state of the channels used in both experiments, the affinity of BgK for Kv1.1 measured in electrophysiological experiments is nanomolar, whereas it is picomolar in binding experiments. However, despite this affinity range difference, the effects of substitutions on both the capacity of BgK to block current through Kv1.1 channels and to inhibit125I-α-DTX binding to Kv1.1 channels were found to be similar (Fig. 2 C) and in the same range than those reported in a previous study (24Alessandri-Haber N. Lecoq A. Gasparini S. Grangier-Macmath G. Jacquet G. Harvey A.L. de Medeiros C.L.C. Rowan E.G. Gola M. Ménez A. Crest M. J. Biol.

Then, the affinity of wild-type BgK was measured for the five mutated channels; results indicate that both the turret (mutations E353S and S357N) and the loop connecting the selectivity filter to the second trans-membrane helix (mutation Y379H) are important for BgK binding to Kv1.1 channel (Fig. 2 D and Table I).Table IDouble mutant cycle analysisKv1.1 wt, K d (nm) ± 2 S.E.

Double mutant cycles were carried out for the five analogs of BgK and the five Kv1.1 mutants. In addition, since a preliminary model of the complex BgK-Kv1.1 suggested proximities between residues Trp5, Ser23, and Gln24 from BgK and residue Tyr379 from Kv1.1, we also made cycles for these residues. All the K d values are reported in Table I. The coupling energy ΔΔG values (in kcal·mol−1) (32Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which measures the co-operativity of the effects of substitutions in both BgK and the channel, was calculated using the following equation: ΔΔG =RT ln [K d (wt, wt).K d (mut, mut)]/[K d (wt, mut)·K d (mut, wt)] (R = 1.99 cal·mol−1 and T = 293 K) are reported in Table I and displayed in Fig. 3, they vary between 0.08 kcal·mol−1 for H13A-E353S or F6A-S357N (BgK-Kv1.1) to 2.33 kcal·mol−1 for K25A-Y379H. The complexes were calculated using high temperature molecular dynamics simulation and minimization under distance restraints, as deduced from coupling energies. Indeed, it has been shown that these coupling energies may reflect proximity between residues (33Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 34Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13231-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); in an extensive study for validating the signification of coupling energies (34Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13231-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it was found that values >0.6 kcal·mol−1 were determined for residues separated by less than 5 Å. In our study, we found a value of coupling energy up to 0.73 kcal·mol−1for a cycle, implicating a buried residue of the channel (Ser369) used as a negative control. Therefore, we used as a threshold the value of 0.7 kcal·mol−1 for interpreting coupling energies as proximity between the mutated residues. Furthermore, coupling energies reflect proximities, provided the substitutions have not induced any structural rearrangement (33Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 34Roisman L.C. Piehler J. Trosset J.Y. Scheraga H.A. Schreiber G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13231-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since the critical substitution K25A in BgK was coupled to all the channel substitutions, even when the residue was buried (Ser369) (Table I), we suspected a nonspecific effect due to a structural rearrangement at the complex interface. Therefore, no distance restraint was applied on residue Lys25. By contrast for all the other residues for which several double mutant cycles were achieved, both kind of coupling energies values were determined: > or <0.7 kcal·mol−1. Thus, coupling energies higher than 0.70 kcal·mol−1 were considered to reflect a distance restraints of 6 + 1, −3 Å, which was therefore applied to the following pairs of residues in the BgK-Kv1.1 complex: Phe6-Tyr379, Asn19-Ser357, Ser23-Tyr379, Tyr26-Ser357, Tyr26-Asp361 and Tyr26-Tyr379 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Some fluctuations in the turret region were allowed during calculations of the models of the complex BgK/S5-S6 region of Kv1.1. The reason for that was based on a previous molecular dynamic of the KcsA channel in a bilayer membrane which showed the flexibility of this region (35Bernèche S. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2900-2917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). These fluctuations were neither seen in the x-ray structure (36Doyle A.D. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar), as this region is involved in protein-protein crystal contacts, nor in the more recent structure solved at 2 Å resolution (22Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), where KcsA is complexed with a Fab fragment, via the turret region. However, comparison of the two structures reveals for the turret region slight differences on Cα positions and large variation of the χ1 angles. Furthermore, recent docking studies also suggest some structural differences between bacterial and mammalian channels, in particular in the region containing residues 53 and 56 (using the KcsA numbering) (19Wrisch A. Grissmer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39345-3935320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fine, we considered 10 complex structures whose structural statistics are shown in TableII. These structures converged (Fig.4); the mean Cα r.m.s.d. for the docked BgK is 1.7 Å around the average structure of the complex. Residues of BgK whose relative solvent accessible surface area in the complex is less than 30% and for which difference between their relative solvent accessible surface area alone and complexed with the channel is more than 30% were defined as forming the binding site: it includes 14 residues (Arg3, Trp5, Phe6, Lys7, Glu8, His13, Thr22, Ser23, Gln24, Lys25, Tyr26, Arg27, Ala28, and Asn29). To compare this binding site to the functional sites of BgK, we identify the residues of BgK important for binding to Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6, using binding experiments (Ref. 37Racapé, J., Identification and Analysis of Molecular Determinants Used by Animal Toxins to Bind Kul Channels. PhD thesis, 2001, Université Paris-Sud XI, Paris.Google Scholar and Fig. 5). In agreement with previous results (24Alessandri-Haber N. Lecoq A. Gasparini S. Grangier-Macmath G. Jacquet G. Harvey A.L. de Medeiros C.L.C. Rowan E.G. Gola M. Ménez A. Crest M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35653-35661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), these binding sites contain three common residues: Ser23, Lys25, and Tyr26. In addition to these residues, four residues were found be important for BgK binding to Kv1.1 (change in free energy of binding ΔΔG upon alanine substitution >1 kcal·mol−1): Arg3, Lys7, His13, Asn19. Therefore, the functional site of BgK for binding to Kv1.1 contains seven residues. Interestingly, all these residues but Asn19 are included in the binding site. However, Asn19 is at the border of this interface (Fig.6 A), and even so, the difference between its relative solvent accessible surface area alone or complexed is 20%. The remaining eight residues that form the binding site are: Asn29, which could not be definitively identified as functionally important because of structural perturbations induced by its alanine substitution; Glu8, Thr22, Gln24, and Ala28, located at the edge of the binding site, which have not been identified as important residues for binding to Kv1.2 and Kv1.6; and Trp5, Phe6, and Arg27, which are important for BgK binding to other Kv1 subtypes (Kv1.2 and Kv1.6) (Fig.6 A).Table IIStructural statistics of the models of BgK/S5-S6 region of Kv1.1 (averaged over the 100 models)Number of restraints2-a6 + 1, −3 Å between the residues (BgK-Kv1.1 subunit): Phe6 (cycle atoms)-Tyr A379, Asn19(Nδ2/Oδ1)-Ser C357(Oγ), Ser23(Oγ/Hγ)-Tyr D379(Oη), Tyr26(Oη)-Ser D357(Oγ), Tyr26(Oη)-Asp D361(Oδ) and Y26(cycle atoms)-Tyr D379(cycle atoms).6Number of models10Violations of the restraintsNumber of structures> 1 Å0> 0.5 Å1Average distances between the residues on which distance restraints were applied2-a6 + 1, −3 Å between the residues (BgK-Kv1.1 subunit): Phe6 (cycle atoms)-Tyr A379, Asn19(Nδ2/Oδ1)-Ser C357(Oγ), Ser23(Oγ/Hγ)-Tyr D379(Oη), Tyr26(Oη)-Ser D357(Oγ), Tyr26(Oη)-Asp D361(Oδ) and Y26(cycle atoms)-Tyr D379(cycle atoms).Phe6-Tyr D3795.2 ÅAsn19-Ser C3576.3 ÅSer23-Tyr D3794.8 ÅTyr26-Ser D3577.2 ÅTyr26-Asp D3617.6 ÅTyr26-Tyr D3796.5 ÅCα r.m.s.d.Over the starting model of Kv1.1 (fixed regions2-bFixed regions of the channel, residues 325–345 and 365–409; flexible regions of the channel, residues 350–360.)1.8 ÅOver the average modelflexible region of Kv1.12-bFixed regions of the channel, residues 325–345 and 365–409; flexible regions of the channel, residues 350–360.2–5 ÅBgK1.7 ÅBuried surface1,040 ± 64 Å2EnergiesETot− 3,593 ± 18 kcal·mol−1Ebond61 ± 0.7 kcal·mol−1Eangle418 ± 6 kcal·mol−1Eimproper77 ± 2 kcal·mol−1EVan der Waals− 3,326 ± 19 kcal·mol−1Eelec2-cElectrostatic energy was calculated with a dielectric constant equal to 10.− 1,146 ± 9 kcal·mol−1Edistance constraint2-dThe energy constant for distance restraint was set to 3 kcal · mol.−11.9 ± 1 kcal·mol−12-a 6 + 1, −3 Å between the residues (BgK-Kv1.1 subunit): Phe6 (cycle atoms)-Tyr A379, Asn19(Nδ2/O"

Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When eIF2A was initially identified, it was believed to be the functional homolog of prokaryotic IF2, because IF2 catalyzes similar reactions. One slight difference was that eIF2A would catalyze polyphenylalanine synthesis at low [Mg2+] with Phe-tRNAE. coli but not Phe-tRNA from eukaryotic sources. Subsequent identification of eIF2 led to the functional comparison of the eIF2A and eIF2. Unlike IF2 or eIF2A, eIF2 was unable to catalyze poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, although it could direct the formation of puromycin-sensitive 80 S preinitiation complexes with Met-tRNAi (2Gupta N.K. Woodley C.L. Chen Y.C. Bose K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4500-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF2A and IF2 have been shown to bind initiator tRNA in a GTP-independent manner, but require the presence of the small ribosomal subunit and the trinucleotide start codon, AUG. In contrast, eIF2 formed a ternary complex composed of Met-tRNAi and GTP, a step that did not require AUG (3Levin D.H. Kyner D. Acs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Both eIF2 and eIF2A were active in the methionyl-puromycin synthesis assay and have the same complementary factor and nucleotide requirements (eIF1A, eIF5A, eIF5B, and GTP). eIF2 was found to out-compete eIF2A in the methionyl-puromycin synthesis assay when both proteins were present (4Adams S.L. Safer B. Anderson W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9083-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both eIF2 and eIF2A function in the methionyl-puromycin assays, the order of events differed between the two. eIF2A binds Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a codon-dependent manner, whereas eIF2 binds Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits in a GTP-dependent manner. Although eIF2A binds Met-tRNAi to 40 S subunits and is assumed to interact with the 40 S subunit, no subunit complex has been identified with eIF2A bound to the subunit. Both factors required eIF5B, eIF1A, and eIF5A to catalyze methionyl-puromycin synthesis. The GTP requirement for both pathways in methionyl-puromycin synthesis was investigated (5Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3708-3711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eIF2 pathway has an apparentK m for GTP of 1.1 μm, whereas the pathway using eIF2A resulted in an apparent K m of 12.6 μm. Thus, in the eIF2 pathway, eIF2 binds GTP as part of the ternary complex, eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi. In the eIF2A pathway, the likely factor that binds GTP is eIF5B, because this factor has a K m of ∼10 μm for GTP as determined by the ribosome-dependent GTPase assay (6Merrick W.C. Kemper W.M. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5556-5562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With these assays, it was also shown that eIF2 could form methionyl-puromycin without the addition of extra GTP; therefore, one GTP was all that was required for eIF2-directed 80 S complex formation (5Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3708-3711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In assays that utilized natural mRNA in place of the trinucleotide AUG, eIF2A was not found to be active, and thus eIF2 was considered the initiation factor responsible for directing the binding of initiator tRNA to the P-site (4Adams S.L. Safer B. Anderson W.F. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9083-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the only purified mRNA available at the time was globin mRNA, eIF2A was not tested with different cellular or viral mRNAs. With the discovery of a variety of alternative pathways for eukaryotic initiation (i.e.internal initiation, re-initiation, non-AUG initiation, etc.; Ref. 7) it was of interest to determine whether eIF2A might play a role in these atypical initiation events. In this study, the first step toward understanding the role of eIF2A in initiation was to determine the amino acid sequence of tryptic fragments of eIF2A. These sequences were then compared with those available in the protein data base. Partial sequences were identified in human EST clones. Complete sequencing of these clones allowed for the generation of the complete eIF2A sequence. From this human eIF2A sequence, a yeast homolog was identified. Yeast strains were obtained that lacked the gene for eIF2A. These ΔeIF2A strains were viable and showed no growth rate phenotype, although they sporulated about a third as well as wild type. By using an HA-tagged eIF2A, eIF2A was found associated with both 40 S subunits and 80 S ribosomes, but little or no eIF2A was present in polysomes. The following reagents were commercially available:Escherichia coli tRNA (Miles); BamHI,HindIII, and XhoI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs); non-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Green Hectares); trichloroacetic acid (Pierce); poly(U) (AmershamBiosciences); pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate (Calbiochem); DNA oligonucleotides (Case Western Reserve University Molecular Biology Core Facility); nucleotide triphosphates (Sigma); and sulfometuron methyl (Chem Service). eIF2A was purified from commercially available rabbit reticulocyte lysate in one of two ways. The original purification was as described previously (1Merrick W.C. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involved the sequential use of ammonium sulfate fractionation (0–70%), DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G200 size-exclusion chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, and finally, Sephadex G-100 size-exclusion chromatography. Activity of eIF2A was monitored using the low [Mg2+] poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenylalanine assay, and protein purity was monitored using SDS-gel electrophoresis (see below). For the eIF2A preparations recovered by an alternative purification protocol (8Grifo J.A. Tahara S.M. Morgan M.A. Shatkin A.J. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5804-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the purification of eIF2A from the ribosomal salt wash involved sequentially phosphocellulose chromatography, sucrose gradient sedimentation, ACA 34 size-exclusion chromatography, Sephadex G-75 size-exclusion chromatography, CM-cellulose chromatography, and Sephadex G-100 size-exclusion chromatography. Final purity of the eIF2A preparations was comparable using either of these purification schemes. This derivative of the poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis assay is sensitive to the activity of initiation factors. Assays were performed as described previously (9Merrick W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 108-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each 50-μl reaction contained 1 μg of eEF2, 3 μg of eEF1A, 2 μg of eIF1A, 2 μg of eIF5A, 0.2 μg of eIF5B, 2.0 μg of eIF2A (or aliquots from column fractions), 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 pmol of Phe-tRNA (E. coli), 0.5 of A 260 of sucrose cushioned ribosomes, 0.1 unit of pyruvate kinase, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm GTP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 A260 poly(U), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 15 min. Incorporation of [14C]Phe into polyphenylalanine was determined as hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, type HA) for scintillation counting. After gel electrophoresis, staining with Coomassie Blue, and destaining, the protein band of interest was excised from the gel, divided into small pieces, and destained in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid in water overnight. The destain was changed once. Gel pieces were then dehydrated by the addition of acetonitrile, which was removed by lyophilization. Gel pieces were then reduced by the addition of 100 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 55 °C. Dithiothreitol was removed and the sample alkylated in 100 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min. The sample was washed with ammonium bicarbonate, then dehydrated with acetonitrile twice, and dried. Gel pieces were then rehydrated in 50–100 μl of a 20 μg/ml trypsin solution. Digestion was allowed to precede overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted twice in 200 μl of 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and pooled. The sample was then lyophilized to less than 25 μl, but not to complete dryness, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (10Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). These experiments were performed by Dr. Michael Kinter of the University of Virginia as a fee for service. SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) was added at equal volume to samples for electrophoresis. The samples were heated to 90 °C for 5 min prior to loading. The samples were then subjected to gel electrophoresis through a 12.5% acrylamide, 0.11% bisacrylamide gel in a Tris glycine (pH 8.3) buffer system as described previously (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein bands were identified by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue. For Western blots, following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nylon membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) using a transfer apparatus (4 h at 6 V) according to the method of Towbin et al. (12Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Immobilized proteins were exposed to rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against either a peptide sequence from the human hIF2 (eIF5B) sequence or rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against yeast eIF2α (generous gifts from Dr. Thomas Dever, National Institutes of Health) or goat polyclonal antiserum raised against eIF2 purified from rabbit reticulocytes. Detection of immunoreactive proteins was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and the ECL system (Bio-Rad). All plasmid preparations were performed as indicated in the instructions for Qiagen mini-preparation protocols. Glycerol stocks (70% glycerin) for each strain were maintained at the vapor temperature of liquid nitrogen. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed as indicated for each enzyme by the manufacturer. Commercially available multiple human tissue RNA blots were obtained from and probed as indicated by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). A probe specific for the eIF2A sequence was synthesized by random primer methodology utilizing a 1.5-kbp insert from the human EST clone 327130. The plasmid was digested with XhoI and HindIII. This DNA fragment was isolated by subjecting it to electrophoresis through low-melt agarose, visualizing the band stained with ethidium bromide by exposing the gel to UV light, and excising the 1.5-kbp fragment. Fifty nanograms of this fragment, still contained within the agar, was used as the template for random-primed Klenow reactions using the Prime-A-Gene labeling kit as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The radiolabeled probe was purified by size-exclusion chromatography and added to the hybridization buffer to be used to probe a multiple human tissue blot. After blotting and washing according to the manufacturer's protocol, the Northern blot was analyzed by autoradiography and band intensity determined by densitometry. DNA sequencing was performed by either the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at Case Western Reserve University or the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Sequencing was performed using either commercially available T7 promoter primers or custom-synthesized oligonucleotides using the fluorescently labeled dideoxy terminator methodology. The following yeast strains were used in this report: J140 (MATa, ura3-52, leu2-3, leu2-112, fun12::LEU2), a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Dever (NICHD, National Institutes of Health); BY4741 (MATa, his3-1, leu2-0, ura3-0, met15-0, fun12::KANMX), BY4742 (MATα, his3-1, leu2-0, lys2-0, ura3-0, met15-0, eIF2A::KANMX), BY4743 diploid (MATa/α, his3-1/his3-1, leu2-0/leu2-0, met15-0/+, lys2-0/+, ura3-0/ura3-0) from ResGen; LH12/2A (MATα, his3-1, leu2-0, lys2-0, ura3-0, met15-0, fun12::LEU2, eIF2A::KANMX), this work. Yeast cultures were grown as indicated using either synthetic medium containing 0.67% Difco yeast nitrogen base, 1% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose and supplemented with the appropriate amino acids or complete medium (13Becker D. Guarente L. Guthrei C. Fink G. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 182-187Google Scholar). Yeast were grown in the appropriate medium at 30 °C to log phase. Transformation was done using the lithium acetate method (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 53: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). For expression of HA-tagged eIF2A, yeast were grown in complete medium with 2% glucose, washed three times, and then shifted to complete medium with 2% galactose for 7 h before harvesting. To determine doubling times, all strains were diluted into complete media and theA 600 were taken every 2–4 h until they reached stationary phase. The results are an average of at least three independent measurements. p180, p196, p226, and p227 plasmids (15Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) derivatives of YCp50 (CEN, URA3) vector bearing different GCN4-lacZ alleles under the control of the GAL1 promoter were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Dever (National Institutes of Health). Plasmids were transformed into isogenic yeast (BY4741) or eIF2AΔ strains. For assays, cells were grown in a minimal synthetic (SD) medium supplemented with appropriate amino acids, containing 2% galactose for 2 h. To invoke amino acid starvation, sulfometuron methyl (stock solution of 2 mg/ml in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4.5 h. Cells were harvested, and lacZactivity was measured following the protocol described in CLONTECH Yeast Protocols Handbook usingO-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Cell extracts were prepared by subsequent cycles of cell freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing them at 37 °C. The yeast eIF2A gene was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA from the strain BY4743 from ResGen. The primers used were 5′-GGTTCAATAACACGGATCCATTATGTCATCTCAG-3′ (the 5′ primer) and 5′-GTATGGATCCTGCAGTTTCTTCTAGTTTATTC-3′ (the 3′ primer), and the product was incorporated at the 5′ BamHI site to clone in-frame with the HA tag in the pTB328 Gal-HA-leu2 vector which is YCplac111galp, CEN, LEU2, GAL1 promoter, HA tag (originally constructed by Dr. Thomas Beck in Dr. Michael Hall's laboratory (Ref. 16Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and a generous gift from Dr. Sandra Lemmon, Case Western Reserve University). All procedures were performed at 4 °C except where indicated. Yeast cells from 50 ml of log phase culture were pelleted, treated for 1 min with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem), and repelleted. Lysates were made by bead-beating the yeast for 4 min, with intermittent cooling on ice, in polysome buffer that contained 100 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 14.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. This mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 8 min, and the supernatant was removed. 5–10 A 254 units were layered onto a 16.2-ml 10–50% sucrose gradient containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Lysates were sedimented in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor at 27,000 rpm for 4.5 h. Gradients were collected with continuous monitoring at 254 nm using an ISCO UA-5 absorbance detector and 1640 gradient collector. Samples run over 10–25% gradients were sedimented in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor at 20,000 rpm for 16.5 h. Pellets were resuspended in polysome buffer, and supernatant fractions were either collected as above or pooled where indicated. For Western blots from gradient fractions, yeast were grown in galactose-containing media overnight until they were in mid-log phase, and fractionation was performed as above. Proteins collected from sucrose gradient fractions were precipitated with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid, washed twice in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and acetone (1:5, v/v), and solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Pellets from 10–25% gradients were resuspended in polysome buffer for immunoprecipitation or in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of each fraction were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred as above to Immobilon (Millipore Corp.). The amino acid composition and molecular weight for eIF2A purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate were available (1Merrick W.C. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, no peptide sequence analysis had been performed for eIF2A. Initial attempts to sequence eIF2A by Edman degradation failed suggesting the N terminus was blocked and therefore internal sequencing was required. Purified eIF2A was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The 65-kDa molecular mass band was excised and subjected to digestion by trypsin. The resulting tryptic fragments were removed from the gel by diffusion and subjected to sequence determination by tandem mass spectrometry as described under “Materials and Methods.” Of the recovered tryptic fragments from the 65-kDa protein, the sequence for eight peptides was obtained (Fig.1 A). Leucine and isoleucine are indistinguishable by mass; thus these amino acids are assigned only upon identification of the peptide sequences in the data base. None of the eight peptides were identified in any protein data base; however, all 8 were found encoded by sequences in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) Library (Fig. 1 A). Peptides A–D were encoded by the sequence in EST 327130, EST 114013 encoded peptides E–G, and peptide H was encoded by clone AAADMFE. The EST clones were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and the inserts were sequenced. Once the inserts were sequenced, overlapping regions were identified allowing a complete sequence to be deduced from the three clones. The coding sequence for the entire protein including a poly(A) tail addition signal is shown in Fig. 1 B with the initiating AUG and the polyadenylation sequences underlined. This sequence codes for a 585-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 65,095 daltons. Of the 85 amino acids sequenced, over 98% are identical to the human sequence (84 of 85 are identical). The one difference is an asparagine in the 114013 EST sequence in place of a threonine in peptide G. This asparagine is found at amino acid 20 in Fig. 1 B. The sequence presented in Fig. 1 B appears to contain the entire coding region although the short 5′ sequence available does not rule out the possibility of a short N-terminal extension. As it is, the coding region for 585 amino acids yields a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 65,095 daltons, which is in agreement with previous determinations by SDS-PAGE analysis and equilibrium sedimentation centrifugation (1Merrick W.C. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the amino acid composition from the predicted sequence is an excellent match to that previously determined (1Merrick W.C. Anderson W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as is the pI (8.9 calculated and 9.1 observed). 2W. C. Merrick, unpublished data. Next, for the small amount of 5′ sequence available, the proposed initiating AUG is in a good start site context with an A at −3 and a G at +4 (17Kozak M. Cell. 1978; 15: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The predicted N-terminal sequence is Met-Ala. From studies in several systems, with a complete study in yeast, this sequence is predicted to yield an N terminus of N-acetyl-Ala (18Flinta C. Persson B. Jornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Huang S. Elliot R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee L.H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Persson B. Flinta C. von Heijne G. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This prediction is consistent with the lack of any signal from the native protein when subjected to amino acid sequencing. Subsequent to our determination of the nucleotide sequences of the three EST clones, a similar sequence was found in the data base (GenBankTM accession number AF212241) for a protein termed CDA02 and described briefly as a novel gene expressed in human pheochromocytoma. This cDNA sequence extended about 70 nucleotides 5′ of our sequence as indicated,37079e1In this sequence, the final AC ATG GCG at the 3′ end represents the 5′-terminal sequence found in our clone as well. Thus, there appear to be two, in-frame AUG codons upstream of our presumed initiating AUG. We feel that it is unlikely that these AUG codons serve as initiating codons. The first AUG codon is followed by one that would code for arginine. With arginine as the second amino acid, one would expect the N-terminal methionine to have been removed but no further modifications (18Flinta C. Persson B. Jornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Huang S. Elliot R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee L.H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M.

Biochem. 1985; 152: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the protein should have yielded an amino acid sequence with the intact protein. The second AUG codon is followed by one that would code for asparagine that would predict anN-acetylmethionine at the N terminus (18Flinta C. Persson B. Jornvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Huang S. Elliot R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee L.H. Blair L.C. Ghosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L. Kolacz K.H. Saito K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8242-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Persson B. Flinta C. von Heijne G. Jornvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although this modification would be consistent with our sequencing results, the codon context around this AUG is poor with a U at the −3 position and an A at the +4 position (this is also likely a problem for the first AUG codon as the human genome sequence predicts a C at the −3 position and an A at the +4 position). Finally, as the predicted amino acid N-terminal to our proposed initiating methionine is an asparagine, one would not observe the peptide APSTPLLTVR unless protein synthesis began at the AUG codon noted in Fig. 1 B (i.e. the amino acid to the N-terminal side of this peptide would have to have been an arginine or a lysine). Besides the more extended 5′ nucleotide sequence, there were several other differences noted in the nucleotide sequence as shown in TableI. In all, there are 14 codon differences and a single nucleotide difference in the 3′-untranslated region (not shown). Half of the codon changes yield the same amino acid, and most, but not all, of the remaining changes are of a conservative nature. As only a single gene was found in the search of the human genome data base, we assume these differences represent polymorphisms in the human population.Table IDifferences in the nucleotide sequences of two eIF2A clonesCodon no.eIF2A (this report)eIF2A (AF212241)Amino acid54GCAGGCAla → Gly55ATTAATIle → Asn74GACGATAsp75CTCCTTLeu256CTTCTALeu261CAAACAPro → Thr263TTCGGAPhe → Gly267GTCGTAVal268CTGGTGLeu → Val291GTCGTAVal292TCTTATSer → Tyr293GGTGGGGly316CCTCTCPro → Leu478AAAAAGLysThe codon number is set with the first codon being that for the initiating methionine (see Fig. 1 B). Open table in a new tab The codon number is set with the first codon being that for the initiating methionine (see Fig. 1 B). As will be noted below, the human eIF2A sequence maps to both the N and C terminus of the yeast eIF2A protein. Based on this match with either the yeast eIF2A sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see below) or Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the observations cited above, there is no expectation that there is any portion of the protein sequence missing. By using the cDNA described above, the position of the eIF2A gene in the human genome was located on chromosome 3 with transcription heading away from the stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (SERP1) gene (Fig. 2). The eIF2A mRNA is generated from 15 to 16 exons from a primary transcript that appears to be about 55 kb in size. The first identified exon is separated from the second identified exon by about 30 kb, and the remaining introns vary from about 140 to 6,000 nucleotides. Within this 30 kb would be the coding region for nucleotides 103–171 of the mRNA that were not found to match any sequence in the genome data base. However, within these 30 kb, there are patches of over 100 nucleotides where there is no sequence information. We believe that exon 2 (and perhaps exon 3) would be found in these patches. By using the program PromoterInspector from Genomatix (www.genomatix.de), a promoter element was identified upstream of the 5′ end of the cDNA sequence which would predict that the first nucleotide of the mRNA was about 110 nucleotides 5′ of the initiating AUG or about 35 nucleotides 5′ of the longest cDNA sequence (see above, GenBankTM accession number AF212241). This promoter would appear to be TATA-less and contains the housekeeping element GGGCGC. In addition to the eIF2A gene, two putative pseudogenes for eIF2A were also found. These genes are assumed to be pseudogenes as they lacked introns and were missing portions of the 5′ end of the mRNA (5′-untranslated region and coding regions). To determine whether the sequence of eIF2A from the EST clones represents the full-length sequence, Northern blot analysis was performed on commercially available human tissue poly(A)+ mRNA blots. The EST 327130 was used to synthesize a radiolabeled probe by random priming on the excised eIF2A-encoding region. The resulting Northern blot is shown in Fig.3. The probe detects a single transcript of ∼2.1 kb."

To investigate whether the α18-mer can bind other α-neurotoxins besides α-bungarotoxin, we designed a two-dimensional1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiment to screen four related neurotoxins for their binding ability to the peptide. Of the four toxins tested (erabutoxin a, erabutoxin b, LSIII, and α-cobratoxin), only α-cobratoxin binds the α18-mer to form a 1:1 complex. The NMR solution structure of the α-cobratoxin·α18-mer complex was determined with a backbone root mean square deviation of 1.46 Å. In the structure, α-cobratoxin contacts the α18-mer at the tips of loop I and II and through C-terminal cationic residues. The contact zone derived from the intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects is in agreement with recent biochemical data. Furthermore, the structural models support the involvement of cation-π interactions in stabilizing the complex. In addition, the binding screen results suggest that C-terminal cationic residues of α-bungarotoxin and α-cobratoxin contribute significantly to binding of the α18-mer. Finally, we present a structural model for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-α-cobratoxin interaction by superimposing the α-cobratoxin·α18-mer complex onto the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (Protein Data Bank code 1I9B).

As the prototype for the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels, it has been intensively studied. The ligand-gated ion channel family includes the glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A, γ-aminobutyric acid, type C, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptors. All are apparently pentamers composed of either identical or homologous transmembrane subunits. The skeletal muscle-type nAChR contains two α1 subunits and one each of the β1, γ(ε), and δ subunits. The αγ(ε) and αδ interfaces form the sites for ligand binding (see Ref. 1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar for review). Recently, a natural homologue of the extracellular domain of the nAChR, the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), was discovered as a soluble, secreted pentamer in the central nervous system of the snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The x-ray crystal structure of this AChBP at 2.7 Å reveals the putative conformational architecture of the extracellular domain of the nAChR (2Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V.

The snake venom-derived α-neurotoxins are classic competitive antagonists of the muscle-type nAChRs, and they can be divided into two related groups as follows: short and long α-neurotoxins. X-ray crystal structures and NMR solution structures of several different α-neurotoxins reveal a conserved structural pattern consisting of a core of disulfides with three fingers or loops (3Love R.A.

Cbtx has 71 amino acid residues and 5 disulfide bridges. It binds muscle-type nAChR at the neuromuscular junction and causes paralysis by preventing acetylcholine binding to the nAChR. LSIII, from the venom of Laticauda semifasciata, is also classified as a long α-neurotoxin because of its fifth disulfide bond and is composed of 66 amino acid residues (8Connolly P.J. Stern A.S. Hoch J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Erabutoxin a (Ea) and erabutoxin b (Eb) are both closely related short α-neurotoxins, with 62 amino acid residues, that are also found in the snake venom from L. semifasciata.

A peptide fragment (α18-mer) with a sequence corresponding to residues 181–198 (α1-181YRGWKHWVYYTCCPDTPY198), from the Torpedo californica nAChR, binds Bgtx with an apparentK d of ∼65 nm (19Pearce S.F. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have described previously three NMR solution structures of Bgtx in complex with this α18-mer (10Zeng H. Moise L. Grant M.A. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22930-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and with two other α-subunit derived peptides, an α12-mer (Torpedo α1, 185–196) (20Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and an α19-mer (Chick α7, 178–196) (12Moise L. Piserchio A. Basus V.J. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12406-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The structures of these Bgtx·peptide complexes provide valuable information about the contribution of the contact residues involving in Bgtx binding to the native nAChR. We now report an NMR-based binding assay using the α18-mer to screen for interaction with four α-neurotoxins related to Bgtx. We also report an NMR structural analysis of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. Our goal is to further define the contribution of individual amino acid residues in the α1 subunit to the interaction between the nAChR and the α-neurotoxins. The α18-mer was expressed and purified as described previously (10Zeng H. Moise L. Grant M.A. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22930-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide was expressed as a ketosteroid isomerase fusion protein using plasmid pET 31b(+) in standard M9 medium and Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) with the replacement of15NH4Cl for NH4Cl to uniformly enrich the peptide with 15N. The peptide was cleaved from the fusion protein by reaction with cyanogen bromide, and it was then purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography. As before, the C-terminal homoserine lactone form of the α18-mer was used for the NMR studies described below. For the HSQC screen, the15N-enriched α18-mer was resuspended in 50 mmof per-deuterated potassium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) with 5% D2O and 0.05% sodium azide. Cbtx, Ea, Eb, and LSIII (from Sigma) were prepared in the same buffer at a concentration of 1 mm. Toxins from their stock solutions were added to the α18-mer in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The final concentration of all mixtures was 0.2 mm. For the structure analysis of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex, the 15N labeled α18-mer was resuspended in the buffer described above. Cbtx, from a 5 mm stock solution, was then added to the α18-mer to form a 1:1 Cbtx·α18-mer complex. The final concentration of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex was 1.6 mm. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at a temperature of 35 °C. Chemical shifts at this temperature were calibrated with respect to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl) tetradeutero sodium propionate (0.0 ppm). The various toxin/α18-mer samples were analyzed by a two-dimensional15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (1H-15N HSQC) experiment (21Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol.

The assignments of the HN protons and Hα protons of the amino acid spin systems of the peptide were further confirmed by a three-dimensional HNHA experiment (29Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlations (sequential, medium range, and long range NOEs) were identified by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) (21Piotto M.

NH exchange experiments in D2O were performed to identify slowly exchanging amide protons presumably involved in stable hydrogen bonds. The Cbtx·α18-mer complex sample was lyophilized, and immediately after resuspending the complex in 99.99% D2O, an HSQC and 12 sequential TOCSY spectra (3-h acquisition time for each) were collected. All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with XwinNmr (Bruker), NMRPipe (31Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar), and Sparky (32Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3 Version 3.103. University of California, San Francisco, CA2001Google Scholar). The distance constraints were obtained from the cross-peak volumes in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex by integration using the Gaussian fitting protocol in Sparky. The cross-peaks, according to their volumes, were manually classified into three categories: strong, medium, and weak with corresponding distance ranges of 1.8–3.0, 1.8–4.0, and 1.8–5.0 Å, respectively. Those amide protons, involved in β-sheet-like Hα-Hα and Hα-HNNOEs, which could be identified in NH exchange experiments as stable to exchange after 21 h in D2O were classified as “hydrogen bond” protected amide protons and as hydrogen bond donors. For the structural incorporation of hydrogen bonds, the distance constraint of HN-O was assigned a value of 1.6–2.5 Å and that of N-O was constrained to 2.5–3.3 Å. The Hα-HN3 J coupling constants of the α18-mer peptide were derived from the three-dimensional HNHA experiments (33Macura S.I. Westler W.M. Markley J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 100-103Google Scholar). The 3 Jcoupling constants were converted to dihedral angle restraints using methods described previously (34Thompson G.S. Leung Y.-C. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Redfield C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For 3 J< 6 Hz, the dihedral angle restraint (φ) was assigned to −60 ± 30°; for 3 J > 8 Hz, the φ was −120 ± 40°. All structures were calculated from random models with distance geometry and by applying the simulated annealing protocols in the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) software package (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The potential energy function used in these calculations was the sum of the van der Waals repulsion term whose force constant varied from 0.003 to 4 kcal mol−1 Å−4 during the cooling stage, the NOE distance constraints using a square-well potential with a force constant of 50 kcal mol−1, the dihedral angles with a force constant of 200 kcal mol−1rad−2, the bond length, and the bond angles. Pseudoatoms were used for protons that could not be stereospecifically assigned. The pseudoatom correction feature of CNS was used to adjust the NOE distance constraint range automatically. Each round of calculation was initiated with a random seed number. Resulting structural models with no NOE violation larger than 0.5 Å were regarded as acceptable structures. The 10 lowest energy structures of 100 acceptable structures were selected to form an ensemble to represent the final structural model of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. The intermolecular contact surface areas of all the final individual Cbtx·α18-mer complex structures were calculated using Contacts of Structural Units software (36Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The analysis of energetically significant cation-π interactions within the structure models of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex was performed using CaPTURE (37Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). The visualization of the structures was carried out in MOLMOL (38Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). All structure coordinates of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex have been deposited at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. The entries for the ensemble structures and the minimized average structure are 1LXG and 1LXH, respectively. As described previously (10Zeng H. Moise L. Grant M.A. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22930-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the α18-mer can form a stoichiometric complex with Bgtx that is amenable for NMR structure analysis. To investigate whether the α18-mer can also be recognized by other α-neurotoxins, we designed an NMR-based screen to test for interactions with α-neurotoxins related to Bgtx (Cbtx, Ea, Eb, and LSIII). The screen was based on the use of an15N-enriched α18-mer and a two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC experiment that is designed to acquire signal only from 15N-attached protons of the peptide (i.e. amide protons and the side chain protons of Arg and Trp). Comparison of the spectra of the α18-mer·α-neurotoxin samples with that of free α18-mer was used to determine whether there is an interaction between the α18-mer and these toxins. A binding interaction between α18-mer and the toxin is indicated in those cases where HN resonances of the α18-mer undergo chemical shift changes. An HSQC titration is necessary to determine whether this binding is in the realm of slow, medium, or fast exchange. If none of the HN resonances of the α18-mer undergo any chemical shift changes upon toxin addition, an interaction in the millimolar to sub-millimolar affinity range (the NMR sample concentration range) can be effectively ruled out. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that Ea (Fig. 1 A), Eb (Fig. 1 B), and LSIII (Fig.1 C) do not bind to the α18-mer, whereas Cbtx does form an apparent stoichiometric complex with the α18-mer (Fig.1 D). We next carried out HSQC-based mole ratio titration studies to determine whether the Cbtx·α18-mer complex was indeed stoichiometric and whether the interaction is in slow exchange (Fig.2). From the HSQC titration, it is clear that the free peptide (Fig. 2 A) is largely unstructured. Upon binding to Cbtx, the chemical shift positions of the HN resonances for the bound peptide are altered due to complex formation but remain fixed in position and do not vary as a function of the Cbtx concentration (Fig. 2, B–D). These observations indicate that the α18-mer forms a 1:1 complex with Cbtx, that the α18-mer acquires structure upon binding, and that the Cbtx·α18-mer complex is in slow exchange (i.e. time scale in the millisecond to second range).Figure 2The mole ratio titration of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex as detected by HSQC.

The solid arrow indicates one of the resonances in free α18-mer whose intensity decreases upon the incremental addition of Cbtx. Its chemical shift remains constant throughout. The double-headed arrowpoints to one of the resonances in the Cbtx-bound α18-mer. Its intensity increases with the incremental addition of Cbtx, but its chemical shift remains unchanged indicative of slow exchange.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three-dimensional TOCSY-HSQC, threedimensional NOESY-HSQC, and three-dimensional HNHA experiments were performed to assign the resonances of the α18-mer in the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. From these three-dimensional NMR experiments, we assigned the observable resonances for all of the amino acid residues in the α18-mer except for the N-terminal Tyr181, which has an exchangeable HN, and the two prolines that lack amide protons. These assignments of the peptide resonances were used in the analysis of the two-dimensional NMR data to distinguish peptide resonances from Cbtx-associated proton resonances, greatly facilitating the assignment of the Cbtx resonances. Guided by the two-dimensional NMR assignments of free Cbtx (6Le-Goas R. LaPlante S.R. Mikou A. Delsuc M.A. Guittet E. Robin M. Charpentier I. Lallemand J.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4867-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we completed the two-dimensional NMR assignments for free Cbtx and for the Cbtx·α18-mer complex with additional homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY and two-dimensional TOCSY experiments. By comparing the chemical shift assignments for free and bound Cbtx, we found that the region from Asp27 to Val37 of Cbtx is characterized by significant chemical shift changes upon complex formation (TableI).Table IChemical shift perturbations in Cbtx induced by α18-mer bindingResidueProtonFree CbtxBound CbtxppmAsp27Hβ13.172.87Asp27Hβ22.562.78Asp27HN8.169.14Phe29Hα4.734.58Cys30Hα4.075.32Cys30Hβ13.603.02Cys30Hβ23.182.72Cys30HN7.799.14Ile32Hγ11.611.76Arg33Hα4.554.35Arg33HN8.228.38Gly34HN7.668.93Arg36Hβ10.650.02Arg36Hβ20.06−0.15Arg36Hγ11.181.36Arg36Hγ21.031.23Val37Hβ1.801.46All of the resonances listed here are characterized by chemical shift changes upon peptide binding of greater than 0.15 ppm.

Proton designations follow IUPAC recommended nomenclature. Distance constraints were obtained from the intensities of the NOE peaks in two-dimensional NOESY spectra of the complex as described under “Experimental Procedures,” whereas hydrogen bonds important for secondary structure were identified by NH exchange experiments. In addition, the dihedral angle restraints for the peptide were calculated from Hα-HN3 J couplings obtained through HNHA experiments. All of these constraints (TableII) were then incorporated into CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) to calculate structural models of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. The CNS calculations incorporate both distance geometry and simulated annealing protocols. After multiple rounds of calculation using different random seed numbers, a pool of 100 structures with no NOE violation larger than 0.5 Å was obtained. From the pool of acceptable structures, 10 structures with the lowest potential energy were selected to represent a structural ensemble of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. The overall backbone atomic root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the individual structures and the mean structure of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex is 1.69 Å. We identified a highly defined region composed of residues 2–70 of Cbtx and residues 187–196 of the α18-mer. The remaining residues (residues 1 and 71 of Cbtx, 181–186 and 197–198 of the α18-mer) lacked long range NOE constraints. In this more highly defined region, the backbone r.m.s.d. is 1.46 Å (Table II). The structural ensemble of the complex is shown in Fig.3. For clarity, only the more highly defined regions are shown. The α18-mer-bound Cbtx is oriented to show the concave surface, loop I on the left, loop III on the right, and the tip of the loop II at the bottom. The overall three-finger-like motif is retained in the structure of bound Cbtx with the central β-sheet between loop II (Val19–Trp25) and loop III (Val52–Ser58) giving rise to long range Hα-Hα and Hα-HNNOEs and 6 slowly exchanging amide protons (HNs of Cys20, Thr22, Thr24, Asp53, Gln55, and Cys57). All 10 of the ensemble structures of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex contain this β-sheet. In free Cbtx, this central β-sheet is a triple-stranded one with two strands within loop II and the third strand contributed by loop III (6Le-Goas R. LaPlante S.R. Mikou A. Delsuc M.A. Guittet E. Robin M. Charpentier I. Lallemand J.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4867-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our spectra of free Cbtx, we also observed long range Hα-Hα and Hα-HNNOEs within loop II between Val19–Trp25 and Arg36–Ala42 region as described previously (6Le-Goas R. LaPlante S.R. Mikou A. Delsuc M.A. Guittet E. Robin M. Charpentier I. Lallemand J.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4867-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, those NOEs and accompanying slow-exchanging amide protons were not seen in the spectra of the Cbtx·α18-mer complex. We think that the binding induced conformational changes involving the tip of loop II weaken this intra-loop β-sheet to a considerable extent, so the typical evidence for a β-sheet was not observed within loop II of the peptide-bound Cbtx. Many of the large changes (>0.15 ppm) in chemical shift in bound Cbtx (Table I) indicate structural alterations in the tip of loop II (Asp27–Val37) consistent with extensive contacts between the Ile32-Arg36region of Cbtx and the peptide (Fig. 3).Table IIStructural statistics for the Cbtx·α18-mer complexNOE constraintsTotal603Intraresidue366Sequential (‖i−j‖ = 1)152Medium range (1 < ‖i−j‖ ≤ 4)13Long range (‖i−j‖ > 4)52Intermolecular20Dihedral angle restraints9Disulfide bonds6Hydrogen bonds6r.m.s.d to the average structure (Å)BackboneDefined region2-aResidues, Cbtx 2–70, α18-mer 187–196.1.46Overall2-bResidues, Cbtx 1–71, α18-mer 181–198.1.69Heavy atomsDefined region2-aResidues, Cbtx 2–70, α18-mer 187–196.2.25Overall2-bResidues, Cbtx 1–71, α18-mer 181–198.2.57Distance constraint violations > 0.5Å02-a Residues, Cbtx 2–70, α18-mer 187–196.2-b Residues, Cbtx 1–71, α18-mer 181–198.

To investigate the mechanism by which tryptophan binding activates TRAP, we generated hetero-11-mers containing different proportions of subunits from wild type (WT) TRAP that bind tryptophan and from a mutant TRAP (Thr25 to Ala) defective in tryptophan binding. Studies of these hetero-11-mers show that tryptophan-binding sites created from active subunits bind tryptophan with similar affinity to those in WT homo-11-mers, whereas sites containing the T25A substitution do not bind tryptophan. Hetero-11-mers with very few (one or two) bound tryptophans show only 10-fold lower affinity than WT TRAP for an RNA with 11 GAG repeats, whereas TRAP with no bound tryptophan shows no detectable binding to this RNA. We also demonstrate that tryptophan binding induces a conformational change in TRAP in the vicinity of the RNA-binding site, suggesting a possible mechanism for activation of RNA binding. Expression of genes involved in tryptophan metabolism in Bacillus subtilis is regulated by the TRAP protein in response to changes in l-tryptophan levels.

Tryptophan biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis requires the products of seven trp genes (1Henner D. Yanofsky C. Sonenshein A. Hoch J. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology and Molecular Genetics. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1993: 269-280Google Scholar). Expression of these genes, which are located in the trpEDCFBA and folate operons, is negatively regulated by TRAP (t rp RNA-bindingattenuation protein) in response to changes in the intracellular levels of l-tryptophan (2Kuroda M. Shimotsu H. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 792-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J.

TRAP regulates both transcription of the trp operon and translation of its initial structural gene, trpE. In the presence of excess tryptophan, TRAP binds to the 5′ leader region of the nascent trp mRNA, facilitating formation of a transcription terminator, which halts transcription prior to the structural genes. Under conditions of limiting tryptophan, TRAP does not bind to the trp leader RNA, thus allowing it to form an alternative antiterminator structure that permits transcription to continue into the structural genes (2Kuroda M. Shimotsu H. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 792-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP also binds to the leader region of nonterminated trp mRNAs that have extended through the attenuator region, and this binding alters the RNA structure so as to sequester the trpE Shine-Dalgarno sequence and inhibit translation initiation of this gene (3Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Du H. Babitzke P. J. Biol.

Translation of trpG, which is located within the folate operon, is also regulated by TRAP; in regulating expression of this gene, TRAP competes directly with ribosomes for binding to the mRNA (3Kuroda M. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yang M. Saizieu A. Loon A.P.G.M. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4272-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP also regulates translation of yhaG (8Sarsero J. Merino E. Yanofsky C. J.

A. 2000; 97: 2656-26661Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The former gene is predicted to encode a tryptophan transport protein (8Sarsero J. Merino E. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2329-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the function of the latter gene product is unknown. TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits arranged in a symmetric ring (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P.

Biol. 1999; 289: 1003-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The secondary structure mainly consists of 11 seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheets, each formed from β-strands from two adjacent subunits. 11 tryptophan-binding sites are formed between adjacent subunits, and each tryptophan interacts with amino acid residues of both subunits (see Fig. 1). When activated by 11 tryptophan molecules, TRAP binds to RNAs containing multiple (up to 11) (G/U)AG triplet repeats optimally separated by two or three nonconserved nucleotides (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Babitzke P. Bear D.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5159-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TRAP complexed with an RNA containing 11 GAG repeats shows that the single-stranded RNA wraps entirely around the outer perimeter of the protein ring forming specific interactions between the bases of the RNA and the protein (14Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The observations that TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits that create 11 binding sites for l-tryptophan between adjacent subunits and that TRAP binds RNAs with up to 11 (G/U)AG repeats (with restricted spacing between repeats) raise several issues with regard to how this protein functions to regulate gene expression. TRAP must avoid binding to RNAs with only several (G/U)AG repeats, and it must only bind its various RNA targets at the appropriate level of intracellular tryptophan. Little is known about how tryptophan binding activates TRAP to bind RNA. The structure of TRAP in the absence of tryptophan is not known; however, previous studies have shown that the apo-protein remains an 11-mer (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In particular, the relationship between the number of bound tryptophan molecules and the number of RNA-binding sites activated is not known. Because the binding of 11 molecules of tryptophan to TRAP is positively cooperative (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4519-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to directly analyze the properties of TRAP 11-mers containing defined subsaturating levels of bound tryptophan. Recently we have developed a method to generate TRAP hetero-11-mers composed of two different types of subunits, such as mutant and wild type (WT). 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; 5-IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; 5-IAF, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. Our data show that the mutant subunits can assemble randomly with WT subunits yielding a total of 12 different species of 11-mers (the two homo-11-mers and 10 different possible hetero-11-mers) (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By varying the ratio of the two types of subunits that are mixed, we can change the abundance of each species within the mixture of renatured hetero-11-mers. In this paper, we created TRAP hetero-11-mers composed of subunits from WT TRAP and subunits from a mutant protein defective in tryptophan binding. Residues from two adjacent subunits contribute to the formation of each tryptophan-binding site on TRAP (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Hence within the hetero-11-mers there are two different types of tryptophan-binding sites. In one case the binding site contains the altered residue from the mutant subunit. Our data indicate that these sites do not bind tryptophan. The second type of binding site is created from the juxtaposition of two fully functional regions from the two adjacent active subunits, either two wild type subunits or the unaltered portion of a mutant subunit combined with that from a wild type subunit. Our results show that these sites bind tryptophan with an affinity similar to that of those in the wild type homo-11-mer. We also show that binding only one or two tryptophan molecules to hetero-11-mers (those with only one or two active binding sites) dramatically stabilizes the TRAP-RNA complex as compared with TRAP 11-mers with no bound tryptophan. The affinity of these TRAP hetero-11-mers for RNA depends on both the number of tryptophan molecules bound and the number of (G/U)AG triplet repeats in the target RNA, suggesting that nonliganded subunits within the hetero-11-mers contribute to the stability of complexes with RNA. Our studies also indicate that tryptophan binding induces a conformational change in only the subunits to which it is bound. Together, our results suggest that binding one or two tryptophan molecules activates RNA-binding sites associated with these tryptophan-binding sites and that this activation plays a crucial role in nucleating the TRAP-RNA interaction. Once this initial RNA-binding complex is formed, the remaining RNA-binding sites on the protein can interact with the RNA even though they have not been activated by bound tryptophan. Wild type and mutantmtrB genes encoding TRAP were subcloned onEcoRI/HindIII fragments following the T7 promoter in pBlueScript (Stratagene) and were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 as described previously (18Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We followed a previously published protocol to purify TRAP by immunoaffinity chromatography (19Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The concentration of each protein was determined by UV absorbance (extinction coefficient of 1280m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm) and confirmed by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and SDS-PAGE. (GAGAU)n RNA, wheren indicates the number of tandem GAGAU repeats, was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and labeled with [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (19Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Subunit mixing was performed as described previously by Li et al. (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Various ratios of WT and mutant TRAP proteins (0.5–5.0 mg/ml) were denatured in 4 mguanidine hydrochloride (Angus, Niagara Falls, NY) at room temperature for 1 h. The mixtures were then dialyzed against 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. The concentrations of renatured proteins were quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce) and SDS-PAGE based on comparison with known TRAP standards. Tryptophan binding to TRAP was measured at 37 °C by circular dichroism spectroscopy using a JASCO model J-715 spectrapolarimeter. The spectra were recorded between 190 and 300 nm for 5 μm TRAP 11-mers in the presence of various concentrations of tryptophan. At each tryptophan concentration, the spectrum of free tryptophan was subtracted. The CD at 225 nm, which shows the maximal difference between spectra of apo- and liganded TRAP, was used to measure tryptophan binding. CD225 (θ) of free tryptophan increases linearly with concentration, whereas the net CD signal (Δθ) from bound tryptophan to TRAP saturates at high concentrations of tryptophan. The values of Δθ were normalized to give Δθ% by comparing to maximal CD signal change at saturation and Δθ% were fit to following the Hill equation (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M.

Δθ%=a*([Trp]/S0.5)n)/(1+([Trp]/S0.5)n)Equation 1 where a is the saturation level of bound tryptophan ([Trp]b) and S 0.5 represents the binding affinity and is the defined as the concentration of free tryptophan ([Trp]f) when [Trp]b is at 50% of saturation. The Hill coefficient (n) reflects the cooperativity of the binding. Binding is noncooperative forn = 1.0, positively cooperative for n >1.0, and negatively cooperative for n <1.0. WhenS 0.5 values were normalized based on the number of WT subunits in the heteromers, the Hill coefficient was set to 1.0 for fitting because we found no cooperativity for tryptophan binding to these heteromers. RNA binding to TRAP in the presence of 100 mm tryptophan was determined using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay at 37 °C (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before filtering. For each assay, at least one set of reactions was performed in the absence of tryptophan, as a control. The data were analyzed using a nonlinear least squares fitting to single binding site equation (20Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Prizm, Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). 200 ng of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (5-IAF; Molecular Probes) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) was quickly mixed with 10 μg of TRAP in a total of 100 μl. The reaction was stopped after 0.5–20 min by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol. The samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE to separate free dye from labeled proteins. Digital images of the gel were taken using a 312-nm transilluminator and a Kodak DC290 digital camera. Fluorescence intensities of bands were quantified using 1D Kodak software, version 3.5. The number of 5-IAF molecules bound per TRAP 11-mer was determined by comparison with intensities of free fluorophore at known concentrations. To adjust the loading errors, the gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to determine the protein concentration. We created heteromeric TRAP 11-mers composed of various ratios of subunits derived from wild type 11-mers and from mutant 11-mers that are inactive for tryptophan binding, so as to mimic situations in which the wild type TRAP protein has different numbers of bound tryptophan molecules. As the source of inactive subunits, we used the mutant TRAP protein T25A (Thr25 in the tryptophan-binding pocket changed to Ala). This protein is defective in tryptophan binding and does not bind RNA (18Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the T25A protein contains all the residues shown to be involved in complex formation with RNA (14Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we assume that the RNA-binding sites on this protein are structurally identical to those in WT TRAP. The active subunits were from a mutant TRAP protein in which Lys71 is replaced by Ala (K71A). The advantage of using this protein is that because of the charge change (Lys to Ala) on the surface of each subunit, K71A TRAP displays faster mobility on native polyacrylamide gels than the T25A protein. This property allows us to distinguish hetero-11-mers with different subunit compositions using these gels (Fig. 2). Lys71 is distant from the tryptophan and RNA-binding sites on TRAP (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and K71A TRAP is fully active both in vivo(18Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and in vitro (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, all hetero-11-mers composed of WT and K71A subunits are fully active in tryptophan binding and in RNA binding (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we will refer to K71A subunits as WT in this paper. To construct WT-T25A TRAP hetero-11-mers, we denatured WT and T25A TRAP 11-mers into unfolded monomers using guanidine hydrochloride, mixed the two types of subunits in various ratios, and regenerated 11-mers by dialysis in sodium phosphate buffer (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All pools of heteromers have similar secondary structure as WT TRAP homo-11-mers, based on CD analysis, and all have assembled as 11-mers based on size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). When displayed on native polyacrylamide gels, these pools show a total of 12 different bands corresponding to the two homo-11-mers (WT and T25A) and 10 hetero-11-mers with different numbers of each type of subunit (10WT-1T25A, 9WT-2T25A, etc.) (Fig. 2). The distribution of heteromers on the gel is nearly identical to that predicted based on random association of mutant and WT monomers. Thus there is no evidence suggesting preferential association of either type of monomer. We previously observed similar random assembly of 11-mers when monomers from several other TRAP mutant proteins were mixed with WT subunits (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Assembly of WT and T25A subunits into hetero-11-mers creates two different types of tryptophan-binding sites, those with Thr at position 25 (from the WT subunits) and those with the Ala substitution at position 25 (from the T25A subunits) (Fig. 1). To characterize the tryptophan binding properties of WT-T25A heteromers, we developed an assay based on changes in the CD spectrum of TRAP upon tryptophan binding (Fig.3). The CD spectrum of WT TRAP in the absence of tryptophan (apo-TRAP) is typical of a protein composed predominately of β-sheet secondary structure, showing a negative peak near 215 nm (Fig. 3 A) (15Li P. Scott D. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the presence of tryptophan, a new positive peak appears near 228 nm. This spectral change occurs for all TRAP proteins that we tested that bind tryptophan but does not occur in the spectra of mutant TRAP proteins, such as T25A (data not shown), which are defective in tryptophan binding. These observations establish that this change is due to tryptophan binding to TRAP. Examining the CD228 of WT TRAP as a function of tryptophan concentration at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B) yielded an apparent S 0.5 of 24 μm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.2 (TableI), both values are similar to those derived previously from equilibrium dialysis of wild type TRAP at 5 °C (S 0.5 = 5–10 μm and n = 1.5–2.0) (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 17Yakhnin A. Trimble J.

These differences may be due to the different temperature used in the current studies.Table ITryptophan binding of WT-T25A heteromeric mixtures as measured by CD225 nm100% WT and 0% T25A75% WT and 25% T25A50% WT and 50% T25A25% WT and 75% T25A0% WT and 100% T25An1.2 ± 0.10.96 ± 0.060.94 ± 0.070.89 ± 0.09NASaturationaMaximal CD228nm for binding by WT TRAP is normalized to 100%.100%69 ± 1%52 ± 2%21 ± 2%0%S 0.5 (total)bS 0.5, the apparent affinity for tryptophan, was determined by fitting data into the Hill equation with the Hill coefficient (n) fixed at 1.0.S 0.5 (total) is determined for the total TRAP concentration, and S 0.5 (WT) is normalized to the percentage of WT TRAP in the mixture.

We next examined the tryptophan binding properties of heteromeric mixtures composed of various ratios of WT and T25A subunits (Fig.3 B and Table I). We measured the number of tryptophan molecules/TRAP protein bound in these pools. To do so, we compared the saturation level of tryptophan binding to each pool to that of WT TRAP, which is known to bind 11 tryptophan molecules/11-mer (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because the heteromer pools contain mixtures of hetero-11-mers with different ratios of WT and mutant subunits, the values we measured represent weighted averages (and thus cannot be directly ascribed to any one member of the pool). We found that the saturation of tryptophan binding to the heteromeric mixtures depends directly on the percentage of WT subunits used in the pool (Table I). These findings were confirmed by equilibrium dialysis (data not shown). The simplest interpretation of these results is that assembly of hetero-11-mers composed of WT and T25A mutant subunits is random and that tryptophan-binding sites containing Thr25 contributed from WT subunits retain their ability to bind tryptophan, whereas those with the alanine substitution at residue 25 do not bind tryptophan under these conditions. We refer to the former type of binding sites as active binding sites and the latter as inactive binding sites. Thus in the presence of excess tryptophan, the hetero-11-mers created with different ratios of WT and T25A subunits can be considered to represent randomly assembled TRAP 11-mers with various numbers of tryptophan molecules bound, depending on their subunit composition. The observed affinity of the heteromeric pools for tryptophan (S 0.5 total)) decreased from 24 μm for the WT homo-11-mer to 67 μm for the pool composed of 25% WT and 75% T25A (Table I). However, if we assume that only the active binding sites within the hetero-11-mers bind tryptophan (as indicated above) and normalize the observed affinities to the fraction of active binding sites in the mixtures, we find that the affinity of the active sites (S 0.5 (WT)) does not change significantly within the hetero-11-mer pools (Table I). The Hill coefficient (n) decreases slightly from 1.2 to 0.89 as the percentage of WT subunit in the pool drops from 100 to 25%, suggesting that introduction of the mutant subunits interferes with the cooperativity of tryptophan binding. The Hill coefficient of 1.2–2.0 for WT TRAP binding 11 tryptophan molecules as determined by equilibrium dialysis (10Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S.

This is because the maximal possible value of n for fully cooperative binding in this system is 11, the total number of binding sites on the protein, and n equals 1.0 for noncooperative binding (21Segel I.H.

Biophysical Chemistry. III. W. H. Freeman and Company, 1980: 864Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a model in which, following tryptophan binding to one or mores sites on the TRAP 11-mer, two types of unoccupied tryptophan-binding sites are generated: “empty” and “activated” sites. The simplest model for the generation of cooperativity is that tryptophan binding to the first site activates only the neighboring site(s) and increases their affinity for tryptophan. However, we cannot rule out a model in which tryptophan binding to one site on TRAP moderately increases the affinities of the remaining 10 unoccupied sites. The most significant implication of our findings is that there may be conditions in vitro or in vivo where wild type TRAP binds to less than its full complement of 11 tryptophan molecules. We next addressed the question of how many bound tryptophans are required to activate the TRAP 11-mer for RNA binding? WT TRAP binds (GAGA"

It recognizes several VIP-related peptides and displays a very low affinity for secretin despite >70% homology between VIP and secretin. Conversely, the human secretin receptor has high affinity for secretin but low affinity for VIP. We took advantage of this reversed selectivity to identify a domain of the VPAC1 receptor responsible for selectivity toward secretin by constructing human VPAC1-secretin receptor chimeras. A first set of chimeras consisted of exchanging the entire N-terminal ectodomain or large parts of this domain. They were constructed by overlap PCR, transfected in COS-7 cells, and their ligand selectivity, expressed as the ratio of EC50 for secretin/EC50 for VIP (referred to as S/V), in stimulating cAMP production was measured. Two very informative chimeras respectively referred to as S144V and S123V were obtained by replacing the entire ectodomain or only the first 123 amino acids of the VPAC1 receptor by the corresponding sequences of the secretin receptor. Whereas S144V no longer discriminated between VIP and secretin (S/V = 1.2), S123V discriminated between the two peptides (S/V = 300) in the same manner as the wild-type VPAC1 receptor. The motif responsible for discrimination was determined by introducing small blocks or individual amino acids of secretin receptor in the 123–144 sequence of the S123V chimera. The data obtained from 14 new chimeras sustained that two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids, Gln135 Thr136 and Gly140Ser141 in the C-terminal end of the N-terminal VPAC1 receptor ectodomain constitute a selective filter that strongly restricts access of secretin to the VPAC1 receptor.

It belongs to a recently emerged subfamily within the superfamily of G protein-coupled heptahelical receptors, referred to as class II or family B (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P.

This subfamily of peptide receptors comprises receptors for VIP-related peptides including secretin, PACAP, GRF, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptides 1 or 2, and also receptors for peptides with no sequence homology with VIP, such as PTH, calcitonin, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) (1Laburthe M.

Class II receptors for peptides share several specific properties, the most important of which is the presence of a large N-terminal ectodomain that contains some highly conserved residues including a set of six cysteines that are necessary for ligand binding (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channel. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of a large part of the N-terminal ectodomain of human VPAC1 has recently been developed, suggesting the existence of an electronegative binding groove with an outspanning tryptophan shell at one end (7Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The current view of VIP binding to VPAC1 implies the interaction of the peptide with this N-terminal ectodomain binding groove and a still poorly characterized juxtamembrane domain comprising at least the junction between the N-terminal ectodomain and transmembrane domain (TM) I, the first extracellular loop, and the upper part of TM2 (4Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channel. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 8Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Nicole P. Endo. Series. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The human VPAC1 receptor binds VIP and PACAP with high affinities but also recognizes some VIP-related peptides with lower affinities,i.e. VIP = PACAP-27 > PACAP-38 > helodermin > GRF = PHI > secretin (4Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channel. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the observation that PHI has a much higher affinity for rat than for human VPAC1 receptors, chimeras between rat and human VPAC1 receptors have been constructed in order to identify the critical domain responsible for such selectivity. It has been shown that three nonadjacent amino acids at the junction of extracellular loop I and TM3 ensured low affinity of PHI for the human VPAC1 receptor (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This supports that domains involved in high affinity VIP binding and domains involved in the selectivity toward low affinity VPAC1 agonists may be functionally and topologically different (4Laburthe M.

In the present work, this subject was further pursued by investigating the molecular determinant(s) responsible for ensuring the very high selectivity of human VPAC1 receptor toward secretin, though VIP and secretin have 9 identical residues and 10 homologous residues out of 27. For this purpose we constructed a series of chimeras between human VPAC1 and secretin receptors based on the observation that the human VPAC1 receptor has a high affinity for VIP and very low affinity for secretin (10Couvineau A.

Commun. 1995; 207: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that a motif composed of two nonadjacent pairs of residues at the C-terminal end of the N-terminal ectodomain is involved in the ability of the human VPAC1 receptor to restrict access to secretin. Restriction enzymes and culture medium were obtained from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France). DNA sequenase kit and radioactive reagents were from Amersham Biosciences (Les Ulis, France). Cloned Pfu DNA polymerase and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, Ca, United States) and Promega (Charbonnière, France), respectively. The transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, Ca, United States). Synthetic peptides were from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). 125I-VIP, 125I-secretin, and 125I-cAMP were prepared and purified in our laboratory as previously described (12Laburthe M. Rousset M.

Other highly purified chemicals used were from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France). The human secretin-VPAC1 chimeric receptors were designed to replace portions of one wild-type receptor cDNA with the corresponding portions of the other receptor according to the amino acid sequence alignment of the two receptors (10Couvineau A.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The strategies included overlap PCR and site-directed mutagenesis. The coding sequence of all the receptor constructs were modified at the 5′ and 3′ ends by adding the EcoRI site and were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) with a marker dodecapeptide sequence (Tag) at the C terminus as described (9Couvineau A.

The polymerase chain reactions were performed withTaq polymerase or Pfu polymerase using a “hot start” procedure: 95 °C for 5 min, one cycle; 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3min, 94 °C for 30 s for 15 cycles (first step) or 10 cycles (second step); followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and purified by Nucleotrap extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Ilkirch, France). Successful construction of chimeras was confirmed by sequencing. Additional chimeric receptors were the following: S127V, secretin receptor (1–127), VPAC1 receptor (128–457); S131V, secretin receptor (1–131), VPAC1 receptor (132–457); S134V, secretin receptor (1–134), VPAC1 receptor (135–457); S139V, secretin receptor (1–139), VPAC1 receptor (140–457); S140V, secretin receptor (1–140), VPAC1 receptor (141–457); S141V, secretin receptor (1–141), VPAC1 receptor (141–457); and S142V, secretin receptor (1–142), VPAC1 receptor (142–457). They were constructed by several steps of oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of the S123V chimera (see above) as previously reported (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P.

The double-strand chimeric receptors' cDNA cloned in expression vector pcDNA1 was used as template. Synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GGGAGACCCACGCGTGGTACCGAG-3′ or 5′-GGGAGACCCAAGCTTGGTACCGAG-3′ was used as selection primer, which switches a unique restriction site on the vector fromHindIII to MluI or from MluI toHindIII, respectively. The sequencing confirmed mutants were directly used for subsequent transfection into COS cells. Other mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis exactly as reported (10Couvineau A.

Receptor constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells by electroporation as previously described (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol.

Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were preincubated on ice for 5 min with 15 μg of vector construction in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After electroporation (330 V, 500 μF, infinite resistance), cells were put on ice for 5 min and then transferred into culture medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin before seeding in 12-well trays for cAMP assay, 10 mm Petri dishes for ligand binding assay, or on glass slides in 24-well trays for immunofluorescence studies. The cells were used 48 h after transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were grown in 12-well trays as described above. The culture medium was discarded, and adherent cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. They were then incubated without or with peptides under continuous agitation in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described (9Couvineau A.

At the end of incubation (30 min at 25 °C) the medium was removed and cells were lysed with 1 m perchloric acid. The cAMP present in the lysate was measured by radioimmunoassay as described (12Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol.

Cell number was determined in parallel wells, and data were calculated as picomoles of cAMP/106 cells and shown as percentages of maximum stimulation elicited by 10 μm VIP or secretin. Assays were performed in triplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. The concentration of peptides eliciting half-maximal stimulation of cAMP production (EC50) was determined by computer analysis using the Prism software suite (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and the ratio EC50 for secretin/EC50 for VIP was calculated. Membrane homogenate (200 μg of protein/ml) prepared from transfected cells was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, 0.05 nm125I-VIP or 125I-secretin in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled VIP or secretin.

Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess of unlabeled VIP or secretin (10 μm). The specific binding was calculated as the difference between 125I-peptide totally bound and the nonspecific binding. The Ligand computer program (13Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 197: 220-239Crossref Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) was used to analyze binding data and to determine the concentrations of VIP or secretin that elicited half-maximal inhibition of specific125I-peptide binding (IC50). Cellular expression of all chimeras was determined by indirect-immunofluorescence experiments of tagged receptor constructs after transfection of COS-7 as previously reported (9Couvineau A.

All chimeras described in this study were expressed at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. As previously reported for native receptors (14Salomon R. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Voisin T. Lavallee D. Blais A. Darmoul D. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E294-E300PubMed Google Scholar, 15Robberecht P., De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Camus J.C. Scemama J.L. Fourmy D. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Christophe J. Pancreas. 1988; 3: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the recombinant human VPAC1 receptor displays high affinity for VIP and low affinity for secretin, whereas the recombinant human secretin receptor has a reversed selectivity with high affinity for secretin and low affinity for VIP (Fig. 1). This was clear from binding experiments using 125I-VIP or125I-secretin as tracers and also from experiments in which cAMP production upon VIP or secretin challenges was measured (Fig. 1). To further characterize the phenotype of receptors, we measured the EC50 of VIP and secretin in stimulating cAMP production and calculated the ratio EC50 for secretin/EC50 for VIP, which is referred to as S/V (TableI). The ratios for VPAC1 receptor and secretin receptor were 500 and 7.1 × 10−4, respectively. A first set of receptor chimeras consisted of exchanging the entire N-terminal extracellular domain. The secretin receptor having the N-terminal domain of the VPAC1 receptor (V144S construct) construct was still able to discriminate between secretin and VIP [S/V ratio = 34], though to a lower extent than the wild-type secretin receptor (Fig. 1 and Table I). In contrast, the VPAC1 receptor having the N-terminal domain of the secretin receptor (S144V construct) no longer discriminated between VIP and secretin (Fig. 1) with a S/V ratio of 1.2 (Table I). We therefore decided to determine which motif in the N-terminal domain of the VPAC1 receptor ensures the discrimination of secretin versus VIP. In this context a very informative chimera was obtained by replacing only the first 123 amino acids of the VPAC1 receptor by the corresponding sequence of the secretin receptor. Indeed, this chimera (S123V) discriminated very well between VIP and secretin (Fig. 1) with a S/V ratio of 300, very close to that of the wild-type VPAC1 receptor (Table I). This data suggested that the relevant motif is present in the 123–144 sequence that connects the N-terminal ectodomain to the first transmembrane domain of the VPAC1 receptor. This sequence was further explored by introducing small blocks of secretin receptor amino acids in the 123–144 sequence of the S123V chimera (Fig. 2). This resulted in the construction of seven new chimeras between S123V and S144V (Fig.2). It appeared that three sets of chimeric receptors could be identified. One set consisted of receptor chimeras, S123V to S139V, having S/V ratios >100, which were very similar to the S/V ratio of the S123V chimera (Table II) or to the wild-type VPAC1 receptor (Table I). A second set consisted of the S140V chimeric receptor having a S/V ratio of 18. Finally, a third set consisted of the receptor chimeras S141V and S142V having a S/V ratio of 1.6 and 2.8, respectively, i.e. very close to the S/V ratio of the S144V chimera (Table II). These data supported the idea that a structural determinant responsible for impeding a high affinity of secretin consisted of the Gly140Ser141 pair of amino acids in the VPAC1 receptor, which are replaced by LK in the secretin receptor (Fig. 2).Table IParameters of VIP- or secretin-stimulated cAMP production for wild-type VPAC1, secretin, or chimeric receptors S144V, V144S, and S123V after transfection of cDNAs into COS cellsEC50VIP(nM)1-aEC50 was determined as described under Experimental Procedures section.EC50Sec(nM)1-aEC50 was determined as described under Experimental Procedures section.S/V1-bS/V was the ratio of EC50 for secretin/EC50for VIP.VPAC10.80 ± 0.06400 ± 250500SecretinR121 ± 450.28 ± 0.130.02S144V5.69 ± 1.096.73 ± 1.091.18V144S12 ± 5400 ± 22034S123V3.02 ± 0.80900 ± 473300Results are means ± S.E. of three experiments.1-a EC50 was determined as described under Experimental Procedures section.1-b S/V was the ratio of EC50 for secretin/EC50for VIP.

Further experiments were conducted in order to determine whether or not the LK pair of amino acids is sufficient to ensure high affinity of secretin to the VPAC1 receptor. The S123V chimera in which the Gly140 Ser141 pair of amino acids was replaced with LK (S123V-LK construct) has a S/V ratio of 23.4 (Fig.3), suggesting that an additional motif is present in the 123–144 sequence. The S134V chimera in which the Gly140 Ser141 pair of amino acids was replaced with LK (S134V-LK construct) has a S/V ratio <10 (Fig. 3), suggesting that such an additional site may lie within the 134–139 sequence. To further explore this sequence, the phenotype of two other constructs was determined, e.g. S123V-SYLLK and S123V-KRHSYLLK (Fig.3). The S/V ratios were 18.4 and 5.2, respectively. Altogether, these data supported that the Gln135 Thr136 pair associated with the Gly140 Ser141 pair in the VPAC1 receptor sequence is important for impeding a high affinity of secretin. This was clearly confirmed by the fact that the S123V-RH-LK construct had a S/V ratio of 1.7 (Fig. 3). Two further constructs S123V-R-LK and S123V-H-LK had S/V ratios >10 (Fig. 3), supporting the idea that two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids Gln135Thr136 and Gly140 Ser141 impeded the binding of secretin with high affinity to the S123V chimeric receptor. Their respective substitution by the corresponding RH and LK pairs of amino acids of the secretin receptor shifted the S/V ratio from 300 to 1.7 (Fig. 3). To further validate our data, all receptor constructs were analyzed by radioligand binding studies, providing evidence for the following: (i) a similar density of all receptors in transfected COS cell membranes in the range between 400 and 570 fmol/mg protein; (ii) a good correlation between EC50 values for VIP or secretin for stimulating cAMP production and their K d or IC50values in binding studies (Fig. 4). In this paper we demonstrate that a motif consisting of two nonadjacent pairs of amino acids Gln135 Thr136and Gly140 Ser141 in the C-terminal end of the N-terminal ectodomain of the human VPAC1 receptor is involved in the high selectivity of the receptor toward secretin. This motif constitutes a selectivity filter that enables the human VPAC1 receptor to restrict access of the inappropriate ligand secretin even though secretin exhibits >70% sequence homology with VIP. This is a highly relevant task for members of the class II family of G protein-coupled receptors for VIP-related peptides, because these peptides exhibit considerable sequence homologies (16Laburthe M. Kitabgi P. Couvineau A. Amiranoff B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1993; 106: 133-176Crossref Google Scholar). In a previous report (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we showed that the human VPAC1 receptor is equipped with another selectivity filter toward the VIP-related peptide PHI (see Fig.5), which exhibits 90% homology with VIP. A few studies have reported the construction of chimeras between VIP receptor and secretin receptors from rats (17Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

The rat secretin-VIP chimeric receptor approach indicated that 10 residues at the N terminus of the secretin receptor together with two residues in the first extracellular loop and four residues in the second extracellular loop are critical determinants for secretin binding (17Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Conversely, chimeras between rat VIP and secretin receptors provided evidence indicating that the N-terminal extracellular domain of the rat VPAC1 receptor plays a key role in agonist recognition (18Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and potent cyclic AMP response to VIP (20Park C.G. Ganguli S.C. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 682-688PubMed Google Scholar), this domain being the key element for discrimination between VIP and secretin (19Vilardaga J.P., De Neef P., Di Paolo E. Bollen A. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our data with human receptors are consistent with the idea that the N-terminal ectodomain of the VPAC1 receptor is critical for discrimination between VIP and secretin. Thanks to site-directed mutagenesis and the construction of a large series of chimeric receptors within the N-terminal ectodomain (see under “Results”), a clue to the relevant motif could be found within this large 144-residue domain. The selective filter for restricting access of secretin to the human VPAC1 receptor is present at the C-terminal end of the N-terminal ectodomain, which connects this domain to the first TM (see Fig. 5), and consists in two nonadjacent amino acid pairs, e.g. Gln135Thr136 and Gly140 Ser141. Both the juxtamembrane location of this filter and its amino acid composition made of nonadjacent residues within a small sequence are reminiscent of the properties of a selectivity filter toward PHI, a low affinity VIP agonist previously characterized in the human VPAC1 receptor (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Indeed, based on the observation that PHI has a much higher affinity for rat than for human VPAC1 receptors (21Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the construction of chimeras between rat and human VPAC1 receptors showed that the critical domain for PHI recognition is present within a sequence comprising part of the first extracellular loop and third TM (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of this sequence further indicated that three nonadjacent amino acids are responsible for restricting access of PHI to the human VPAC1 receptor, e.g. Gln207, Gly211, and Met219 (see Fig. 5). Although they share some properties, the selectivity filters for secretin and PHI are nonetheless quite distinct motifs. Whether the view of distinct selectivity filters, which more or less restrict the access of natural VIP agonists to the human VPAC1 receptor, can be extended to other VIP-related peptides remains to be determined. This is important because discrimination between highly homologous natural peptides is clearly a biologically relevant issue as the human VPAC1 receptor binds several natural peptides with the following order of affinity: VIP = PACAP-27 > PACAP-38 > helodermin > GRF = PHM > secretin (see Ref. 4Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channel. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar for a review). On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that the molecular motifs ensuring the function of selectivity filters are not responsible for the high affinity binding of the cognate peptide ligands. For instance, the S123V chimera and the S123V-RH-LK construct have similar affinity for VIP, whereas they display dramatic differences in their affinity for secretin (Fig. 3). Similarly, the native human VPAC1 receptor and the triple mutant (in which Gln207, Gly211, and Met219 have been respectively substituted for His, Ala, and Val) have identical affinity for VIP, whereas they display important differences in their affinity for PHI (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These observations are in good agreement with the current view of VIP binding to the human VPAC1 receptor, which implies the interaction of the peptide with two receptor domains: the N-terminal ectodomain where a putative electronegative binding groove with an outspanning tryptophan shell at one end has been identified (7Lins L. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Maoret J.J. Benhamed M. Brasseur R. Thomas A. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and a still poorly characterized binding domain on the core of the receptor that may consist of at least the first and second extracellular loops and the upper part of the second transmembrane helix as viewed from the outside of the cell (see Ref. 4Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Marie J.C. Recept. Channel. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar for a review). In conclusion, this work characterizes the molecular motif ensuring the function of a selectivity filter toward secretin in the human VPAC1 receptor. It further substantiates the notion of selectivity filters in human VPAC1 receptor that restrict access of inappropriate ligands, a notion that was previously documented for discrimination between VIP and its related peptide PHI (9Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This concept of selective filters also received experimental evidence in studies of PTH and secretin receptors (21Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), two other class II G protein-coupled receptors (1Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Nicole P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, PTH and secretin display no sequence homology with one another, and neither ligand cross-reacts with the other's receptor. However, mutation of a single amino acid in the second transmembrane helix of the secretin receptor to the corresponding residue in the PTH receptor results in a receptor that binds and signals in response to PTH (21Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Quite interestingly, the reciprocal mutation in the PTH receptor likewise unmasks responsiveness to secretin (21Turner P.R. Bambino T. Nissenson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9205-9208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To understand the physicochemical basis whereby selectivity filters in class II G protein-coupled receptors restrict access to inappropriate ligands will be of great interest for further development in the design of selective ligands of the members of this class of receptors.
