https://openalex.org/W2118706537,"We present a method for learning nonlinear systems, echo state networks (ESNs). ESNs employ artificial recurrent neural networks in a way that has recently been proposed independently as a learning mechanism in biological brains. The learning method is computationally efficient and easy to use. On a benchmark task of predicting a chaotic time series, accuracy is improved by a factor of 2400 over previous techniques. The potential for engineering applications is illustrated by equalizing a communication channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1965681567,"Neural stem cells are reported to lie in a vascular niche, but there is no direct evidence for a functional relationship between the stem cells and blood vessel component cells. We show that endothelial cells but not vascular smooth muscle cells release soluble factors that stimulate the self-renewal of neural stem cells, inhibit their differentiation, and enhance their neuron production. Both embryonic and adult neural stem cells respond, allowing extensive production of both projection neuron and interneuron types in vitro. Endothelial coculture stimulates neuroepithelial cell contact, activating Notch and Hes 1 to promote self-renewal. These findings identify endothelial cells as a critical component of the neural stem cell niche."
https://openalex.org/W2168629258,"X-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray Raman scattering were used to probe the molecular arrangement in the first coordination shell of liquid water. The local structure is characterized by comparison with bulk and surface of ordinary hexagonal ice Ih and with calculated spectra. Most molecules in liquid water are in two hydrogen-bonded configurations with one strong donor and one strong acceptor hydrogen bond in contrast to the four hydrogen-bonded tetrahedral structure in ice. Upon heating from 25 degrees C to 90 degrees C, 5 to 10% of the molecules change from tetrahedral environments to two hydrogen-bonded configurations. Our findings are consistent with neutron and x-ray diffraction data, and combining the results sets a strong limit for possible local structure distributions in liquid water. Serious discrepancies with structures based on current molecular dynamics simulations are observed."
https://openalex.org/W1972275518,"In adult mammals, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin acts on the brain to reduce food intake by regulating the activity of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH). Here, we report that neural projection pathways from the ARH are permanently disrupted in leptin-deficient (Lep ob /Lep ob ) mice and leptin treatment in adulthood does not reverse these neuroanatomical defects. However, treatment of Lep ob /Lep ob neonates with exogenous leptin rescues the development of ARH projections, and leptin promotes neurite outgrowth from ARH neurons in vitro. These results suggest that leptin plays a neurotrophic role during the development of the hypothalamus and that this activity is restricted to a neonatal critical period that precedes leptin's acute regulation of food intake in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2073489229,"Because ethical restrictions limit in vivo studies of the human hemato-lymphoid system, substitute human to small animal xenotransplantation models have been employed. Existing models, however, sustain only limited development and maintenance of human lymphoid cells and rarely produce immune responses. Here we show that intrahepatic injection of CD34 + human cord blood cells into conditioned newborn Rag2 –/– γ c –/– mice leads to de novo development of B, T, and dendritic cells; formation of structured primary and secondary lymphoid organs; and production of functional immune responses. This provides a valuable model to study development and function of the human adaptive immune system in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2125844894,"By coupling a single-electron transistor to a high–quality factor, 19.7-megahertz nanomechanical resonator, we demonstrate position detection approaching that set by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle limit. At millikelvin temperatures, position resolution a factor of 4.3 above the quantum limit is achieved and demonstrates the near-ideal performance of the single-electron transistor as a linear amplifier. We have observed the resonator's thermal motion at temperatures as low as 56 millikelvin, with quantum occupation factors of N TH = 58. The implications of this experiment reach from the ultimate limits of force microscopy to qubit readout for quantum information devices."
https://openalex.org/W2150587707,"The complex containing the Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 proteins (MRN) is essential for the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, integrating DNA repair with the activation of checkpoint signaling through the protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). We demonstrate that MRN stimulates the kinase activity of ATM in vitro toward its substrates p53, Chk2, and histone H2AX. MRN makes multiple contacts with ATM and appears to stimulate ATM activity by facilitating the stable binding of substrates. Phosphorylation of Nbs1 is critical for MRN stimulation of ATM activity toward Chk2, but not p53. Kinase-deficient ATM inhibits wild-type ATM phosphorylation of Chk2, consistent with the dominant-negative effect of kinase-deficient ATM in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2154492443,"Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by the accumulation of a pathogenic protein, Huntingtin (Htt), that contains an abnormal polyglutamine expansion. Here, we report that a pathogenic fragment of Htt (Httex1p) can be modified either by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)–1 or by ubiquitin on identical lysine residues. In cultured cells, SUMOylation stabilizes Httex1p, reduces its ability to form aggregates, and promotes its capacity to repress transcription. In a Drosophila model of HD, SUMOylation of Httex1p exacerbates neurodegeneration, whereas ubiquitination of Httex1p abrogates neurodegeneration. Lysine mutations that prevent both SUMOylation and ubiquitination of Httex1p reduce HD pathology, indicating that the contribution of SUMOylation to HD pathology extends beyond preventing Htt ubiquitination and degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2135114065,"Myofibroblasts are present at the invasion front in colon cancer. In an attempt to understand their putative proinvasive activity, we have developed an in vitro model. Myofibroblasts isolated from colon cancer tissue or obtained through transdifferentiation of colon fibroblasts by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta stimulate invasion of colon cancer cells into collagen type I and Matrigel. We identified two convergent proinvasive agents secreted by myofibroblasts: namely scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) and the TGF-beta-upregulated extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-C (TNC), each of which is necessary though not sufficient for invasion. Myofibroblast-stimulated invasion into collagen type I is characterized by a change from a round, nonmigratory morphotype with high RhoA and low Rac activity to an elongated, migratory morphotype with low RhoA and high Rac activity. RhoA inactivation is determined by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats of TNC through EGF-receptor signaling that confers a permissive and priming signal for the proinvasive activity of SF/HGF that activates Rac via c-Met. We confirmed the validity of this mechanism by using pharmacological modulators and dominant negative or constitutive active mutants that interfere with RhoA-Rho kinase and Rac signaling. Our in vitro results point to a new putative proinvasive signal for colon cancer cells provided by myofibroblasts in the tumor stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2089239248,"Fischer-Tropsch type (FTT) synthesis has long been proposed to account for the existence of hydrocarbons in hydrothermal fluids. We show that iron- and chromium-bearing minerals catalyze the abiotic formation of hydrocarbons. In addition to production of methane (CH 4aq ), we report abiotic generation of ethane (C 2 H 6aq ) and propane (C 3 H 8aq ) by mineral-catalyzed hydrothermal reactions at 390°Cand 400 bars. Results suggest that the chromium component in ultramafic rocks could be an important factor for FTT synthesis during water-rock interaction in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. This in turn could help to support microbial communities now recognized in the subsurface at deep-sea vents."
https://openalex.org/W2136755383,"Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles secreted by various cells, with potentially diverse roles in physiology. Although emphasis has been placed on their involvement in immune modulation, their potential for more wide-ranging biological effects has not been appreciated. A common exosome feature is the expression of adhesion molecules, which include the integrin family. We have for the first time addressed the possible function of B cell-derived exosome-integrins by examining adhesive interactions of exosomes (immobilized onto beads) with extracellular matrix (ECM) components and cytokine-treated fibroblasts. Integrin (beta1 and beta2) expression was demonstrated by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Binding studies (with blocking antibodies) demonstrated their function in adhesion to collagen-I, fibronectin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-activated fibroblasts. Exosome adhesion to TNF-alpha-activated fibroblasts also triggered integrin-dependent changes in cytosolic calcium, measured by single cell imaging. Thus, B cell-derived exosomes express functional integrins, which are capable of mediating anchorage to ECM and cell-surface adhesion molecules, and may be a novel mode of delivering adhesion signals at distances beyond that of direct cell-cell contact during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2078651829,"Cohesins keep sister chromatids associated from the time of their replication in S phase until the onset of anaphase. In vertebrate cells, two distinct pathways dissociate cohesins, one acts on chromosome arms and the other on centromeres. Here, we describe a third pathway that acts on telomeres. Knockdown of tankyrase 1, a telomeric poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase caused mitotic arrest. Chromosomes aligned normally on the metaphase plate but were unable to segregate. Sister chromatids separated at centromeres and arms but remained associated at telomeres, apparently through proteinaceous bridges. Thus, telomeres may require a unique tankyrase 1–dependent mechanism for sister chromatid resolution before anaphase."
https://openalex.org/W2076363142,"We report direct determination of the structures and dynamics of interfacial water on a hydrophilic surface with atomic-scale resolution using ultrafast electron crystallography. On the nanometer scale, we observed the coexistence of ordered surface water and crystallite-like ice structures, evident in the superposition of Bragg spots and Debye-Scherrer rings. The structures were determined to be dominantly cubic, but each undergoes different dynamics after the ultrafast substrate temperature jump. From changes in local bond distances (OH··O and O···O) with time, we elucidated the structural changes in the far-from-equilibrium regime at short times and near-equilibration at long times."
https://openalex.org/W1968990406,"Protein deposition diseases involve the aggregation of normally soluble proteins, leading to both fibrillar and amorphous deposits. The aggregation of alpha-synuclein is associated with Parkinson's disease, and the aggregation of the Abeta peptide is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that L-dopa, dopamine, and other catecholamines dissolve fibrils of alpha-synuclein and Abeta peptide generated in vitro. The catecholamines also inhibited the fibrillation of these proteins. In addition, intraneuronal alpha-synuclein deposits formed in a mouse model were dissolved by incubation of tissue slices with L-dopa. These catecholamines are susceptible to oxidative breakdown, and we show that oxidation products are more effective than the parent compounds in inhibition. The ability to dissolve fibrils provides a new approach for studying mechanisms and consequences (e.g., the relationship between fibril formation and neurodegeneration) of protein aggregation. It is also likely to help in the development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of protein deposition diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1556220133,"Today's technologies for storing data have vexing limitations: Dynamic random access memory chips only retain data for short times, hard disk drives are slow relative to processor speed, and flash memory (like that in digital cameras) is expensive. Researchers are thus searching for a fast, inexpensive memory technology that retains data even when the power is off. As [Scott][1] discusses in his Perspective, the search has identified several interesting avenues that are being actively pursued. But the real-world challenges are severe, and proponents of nonvolatile memory need to take a hard look at the practical realities before declaring success.

https://openalex.org/W2033233627,"The mechanisms that initiate allergic lung inflammation are relevant to expression of diseases such as asthma, but the factors underlying resolution of inflammation are equally important. Previously, we demonstrated the importance of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) for airway egression of lung eosinophils, a critical anti-inflammatory mechanism without which mice are rendered highly susceptible to lethal asphyxiation. Here we show that leukocyte MMP9 is the dominant airway MMP controlling inflammatory cell egression. The allergic lung phenotype of MMP9-/- mice was similar to WT and was not altered by concomitant deletion of the MMP2 gene (double knockout; dko). However, inflammatory cells accumulated aberrantly in the lungs of allergen-challenged MMP9-/- and dko mice and fewer eosinophils and neutrophils were present in bronchoalveolar lavage. These aberrant cellular trafficking patterns were explained by disruption of transepithelial chemokine gradients, in MMP2-/- mice affecting only eotaxin (CCL11), but in MMP9-/- and dko mice involving eotaxin, MARC (CCL7), and TARC (CCL17). Thus, by establishing multiple transepithelial chemokine gradients, MMP9 is broadly implicated in the resolution of allergic inflammation, an essential protective mechanism that overlaps with a more limited role played by MMP2."
https://openalex.org/W2164675880,"The first step in the generation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposited in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the processing of the larger Abeta precursor protein (APP) by an integral membrane aspartyl protease named the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE). We present the genomic organization of the BACE gene. BACE mRNAs are synthesized as nine exons and eight introns from a 30.6 kb region of chromosome 11q23.2-11q23.3. Regulation of BACE may play an important role in regulating the levels of Abeta produced and is therefore likely to play an important role in AD. Herein, we report the cloning and detailed analysis of 3765 nucleotides of the promoter region of BACE and 364 nucleotides of the 5' untranslated region of the BACE mRNA (5' UTR). Characteristic ""CAAT"" and ""TATA"" boxes are absent within 1.5 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). The promoter region and 5' UTR contain multiple transcription factor binding sites, such as activator protein (AP)1, AP2, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), estrogen responsive element (ERE), glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE), ""GC"" box, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1, stimulating protein (SP)1, metal-regulatory elements, and possible Zeste binding sites. Limited interspecies similarity was observed between the human sequence and corresponding genomic DNA from the rat and mouse sequences, but several transcription factor-binding sites are conserved. Thus, the BACE gene contains basal regulatory elements, inducible features and sites for regulated activity by various transcription factors. These results identify the important regions for functional analysis of the binding domains and neuron-specific expression (1). Such a study will allow us to further examine the possible role of changes in the promoter of BACE in AD pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2079586552,"Interactions between CD44 and hyaluronan are implicated in the primary adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium at inflammatory locations. Here we show that preincubation of hyaluronan with full-length recombinant TSG-6 or its Link module domain (Link_TSG6) enhances or induces the binding of hyaluronan to cell surface CD44 on constitutive and inducible cell backgrounds, respectively. These effects are blocked by CD44-specific antibodies and are absent in CD44-negative cells. Enhancement of CD44-mediated interactions of lymphoid cells with hyaluronan by TSG-6 proteins was seen under conditions of flow at shear forces that occur in post-capillary venules. Increases in the number of rolling cells were observed on substrates comprising TSG-6-hyaluronan complexes as compared with a substrate containing hyaluronan alone. In ligand competition experiments, cell surface-bound TSG-6-hyaluronan complexes were more potent than hyaluronan alone in inhibiting cell adhesion to immobilized hyaluronan. Link_TSG6 mutants with impaired hyaluronan binding function had a reduced ability to modulate ligand binding by cell surface CD44. However, some mutants that exhibited close to wild-type hyaluronan binding were found to have either reduced or increased activity, suggesting that some amino acid residues outside of the hyaluronan binding site might be involved in protein self-association, potentially leading to the formation of cross-linked hyaluronan fibers. In turn, cross-linked hyaluronan could increase the binding avidity of CD44 by inducing receptor clustering. The ability of TSG-6 to modulate the interaction of hyaluronan with CD44 has important implications for CD44-mediated cell activity at sites of inflammation, where TSG-6 is expressed.

https://openalex.org/W2009423065,"Yersinia bacteria can take control of the host cell by injecting so-called Yop effector proteins into the cytosol of the cells to which they adhere. Using Yersinia enterocolitica strains that are deficient for one or more Yops, we could show that YopE and, to a lesser extent, YopT interfere with the caspase-1-mediated maturation of prointerleukin-1β in macrophages. In addition, overexpression of YopE and YopT was shown to prevent the autoproteolytic activation of caspase-1 in a way that is dependent on their inhibitory effect on Rho GTPases. Expression of constitutive-active or dominant-negative Rho GTPase mutants or treatment with Rho GTPase inhibitors confirmed the role of Rho GTPases and, in particular, Rac1 in the autoactivation of caspase-1. Rac1-induced caspase-1 activation was mediated by its effect on LIM kinase-1, which is targeting the actin cytoskeleton. Rac-1 and LIM kinase-1 dominant-negative mutants were shown to inhibit caspase-1 activation induced by overexpression of Asc, which is a caspase-1-activating adaptor protein. Moreover, Rac1 as well as YopE and YopT significantly modulated caspase-1 oligomerization.

IntroductionA number of Gram-negative pathogens subvert the innate immune system of their host by a virulence mechanism known as the type III secretion system. In the archetypal Yersinia (Yersinia pestis, an agent of bubonic plague, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica), the type III secretion system is encoded on a 70-kb virulence plasmid (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By this mechanism, Yersinia bacteria adhering at the surface of eukaryotic cells inject proteins called Yops across cellular membranes into the cytosol of these cells. Yop proteins (YopE, YopT, YopH, YopM, YopO, and YopP) are powerful effectors that take control of the host cell by hijacking the intracellular machinery in order to interfere with the inflammatory response and phagocytosis (2Cornelis G.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 742-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The Yop effectors can be subdivided into three functional groups. The first functional group includes YopE, YopT, YopO/YpkA, and YopH, which cooperatively lead to the destruction of the actin cytoskeleton and, by doing so, prevent phagocytosis. YopE and YopT target Rho GTPase family members, which are key players in cytoskeletal reorganization (3Cotteret S. Chernoff J. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar). YopE is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; IL, interleukin; CARD, caspase-recruitment domain; Asc, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; LIMK1, LIM kinase 1; M, mutant; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; WT, wild type; DN, dominant-negative; CA, constitutive-active. for the Rho GTPase family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) (4Black D.S. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 515-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), switching off Rho GTPases by accelerating GTP hydrolysis. YopT is a cysteine protease that cleaves off the C-terminal prenyl membrane anchor from Rho GTPases and releases them into the cytosol where they are inactive (5Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). YopO is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that becomes autophosphorylated upon contact with actin and modulates cytoskeleton dynamics. Its real cellular target is still unknown but possible candidates are RhoA and Rac1, which were shown to interact with the C terminus of YopO (6Dukuzumuremyi J.M. Rosqvist R. Hallberg B. Akerstrom B. Wolf-Watz H. Schesser K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35281-35290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second functional group consisting of YopP and again YopH prevents the onset of the inflammatory response (7Ruckdeschel K. Harb S. Roggenkamp A. Hornef M. Zumbihl R. Kohler S. Heesemann J. Rouot B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). YopP prevents the activation of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family and of IκB kinase-β (7Ruckdeschel K. Harb S. Roggenkamp A. Hornef M. Zumbihl R. Kohler S. Heesemann J.

Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). As a result, YopP efficiently shuts down NF-κB-dependent signaling pathways, preventing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In addition, because of the action of YopP, macrophages undergo cell death with the rapid generation of proapoptotic tBid (11Denecker G. Declercq W. Geuijen C.A. Boland A. Benabdillah R. van Gurp M. Sory M.P. Vandenabeele P. Cornelis G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19706-19714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). YopH also belongs to this second functional group because, besides its anti-phagocytic role, it also prevents the release of the macrophage monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by blocking the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway (12Sauvonnet N. Lambermont I. van der Bruggen P. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, the third group consists of YopM whose exact function remains unknown, although YopM is required for full virulence of Yersinia as demonstrated in mouse infection models (13Leung K.Y. Reisner B.S. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Recently, it was shown that YopM binds and promotes the kinase activity of protein kinase C-like 2 and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (14McDonald C. Vacratsis P.O. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18514-18523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which could explain the effect of YopM on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth (15Sauvonnet N. Pradet-Balade B. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Cornelis G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25133-25142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).One of the most important inflammatory responses upon infection is the production of IL-1β, which is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in the regulation of both the innate and the acquired immune response (16Fitzgerald K.A. O'Neill L.A. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). IL-1β expression in macrophages is inducible in a NF-κB-dependent way (17Goto M. Katayama K.I. Shirakawa F. Tanaka I. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is synthesized as an inactive proIL-1β precursor whose proteolytic maturation is controlled by the cysteine protease caspase-1 (18Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. et al.Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The latter itself is present in the cytosol as a 45-kDa precursor, which can be induced to undergo a series of processing events necessary for its activation. Although the mechanism of caspase-1 activation is still unclear, a multiprotein complex (named the “inflammasome”) that is involved in the activation of procaspase-1 upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation was identified recently (19Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar). The inflammasome consists of caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and pyrin domain containing proteins including Asc (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), which mediate the oligomerization of procaspase-1 to facilitate its activation process (20Srinivasula S.M. Poyet J.L. Razmara M. Datta P. Zhang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21119-21122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The CARD of Asc binds the CARD of procaspase-1, whereas the pyrin domain of Asc can interact with the pyrin domain of a subset of proteins belonging to the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein family, which has been implicated recently in innate recognition of bacteria and the induction of inflammatory responses (21Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar).In this work, we addressed the question of whether specific Yersinia Yop effector proteins can interfere with the caspase-1-mediated maturation of proIL-1β. Therefore, we investigated the effect of several Yop-deficient Yersinia strains on the production of mature IL-1β by infected macrophages. Our results point out a novel role for YopE in modulating the inflammatory response of the macrophage during infection. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time the involvement of Rho GTPases and, in particular, Rac1 in the regulation of caspase-1 activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Antibodies—Wild type (WT) YopE, YopT, and YopH were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the pYV40 plasmid from strain E40 (22Sory M.P.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant murine caspase-1 was prepared by the Centre d'Economie Rurale (Laboratoire d'Hormonologie Animale, Marloie, Belgium).Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli Top10 or MC1061 were used for standard manipulations. E. coli SM10 lambda pir+ was used to deliver mobile plasmids into Y. enterocolitica (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains were routinely grown at 37 °C in tryptic soy broth or on tryptic soy agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics. Y. enterocolitica bacteria were grown at 25 °C in brain-heart infusion (Difco) or on tryptic soy agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics. Y. enterocolitica E40 strains and derivatives have been described previously (24Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For infections, bacteria were diluted to an optical density of 0.1 in fresh brain-heart infusion medium and incubated at 25 °C for 120 min. Subsequently, Yop secretion was induced by incubation for 30 min in a shaking water bath (110 rpm) at 37 °C. Prior to infection, bacteria were washed with RPMI 1640 medium.Culture, Infection, and Transfection of Cells—The murine macrophage cell line Mf4/4 (27Desmedt M. Rottiers P. Dooms H. Fiers W. Grooten J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5300-5308PubMed Google Scholar) and the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T were cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 × 10–5 m β-mercaptoethanol. Prior to infection, Mf4/4 cells were seeded at 106 cells/6-well plates in medium without antibiotics. After 15 h, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 with the relevant Y. enterocolitica strains that were grown at 37 °C under conditions for moderate Yop induction (see above). Extracellular bacteria were killed 2 h after infection by adding gentamicin (50 μg/ml). HEK293T cells were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well and transiently transfected by calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation. 24 h after transfection, medium was removed and cells were lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-1 and anti-IL-1β antibodies (R&D systems), respectively, with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) or anti-E-tag-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactivity was revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (NEN™ Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Products). Lactate dehydrogenase release was assayed using Cytotox-one homogeneous membrane integrity assay as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). β-Galactosidase release was assayed using the Galactostar reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems).RESULTSYopE Inhibits the Release of IL-1β in Y. enterocolitica infected macrophages—Yersinia has previously been shown to prevent NF-κB activation in infected cells in a YopP-dependent manner (9Schesser K. Spiik A.K. Dukuzumuremyi J.M. Neurath M.F. Pettersson S. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be expected that the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes would be increased strongly in cells infected with a YopP-deficient strain (YopP–) compared with cells infected with WT Yersinia. To verify this theory, we compared the amount of IL-1β and IL-6 in the supernatant of Mf4/4 macrophages that were infected with either YopP– or WT Y. enterocolitica. To our surprise, only the levels of IL-6 but not those of IL-1β were increased in the supernatant of YopP–-infected cells (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, intracellular proIL-1β levels in the corresponding cell lysates were considerably higher in cells infected with the YopP– strain (Fig. 1A, inset). It should be mentioned that only the precursor form of IL-1β could be detected in these cell extracts. The above observations indicated a role for another Yop effector protein in the regulation of IL-1β maturation and its release in the cell supernatant. Therefore, we infected macrophages with a Y. enterocolitica strain that is deficient for all six Yop effectors (Fig. 1B, ΔHOPEMT), which indeed resulted in a large increase of IL-1β levels in the supernatant (Fig. 1B). All together, the above results demonstrate that, besides the YopP-mediated down-regulation of proIL-1β production at the transcriptional level, other Yop effectors could specifically inhibit the maturation and release of IL-1β. To analyze which Yop effector controls the release of IL-1β, we constructed five double knock-out Y. enterocolitica strains, which are negative for YopP and for any one of the five other Yops: YopPE–, YopPT–, YopPO–, YopPH–, or YopPM– strains. After infection of macrophages with each of these double-deficient bacteria, we analyzed again the secretion of IL-1β in the supernatant. IL-1β release was still strongly inhibited in macrophages infected with the double mutant bacteria YopPT–, YopPO–, YopPH–, and YopPM–, although a small but reproducible increase in IL-1β could be detected in YopPT–-infected cells (Fig. 1B). However, cells infected with the YopPE– strain released significant higher levels of IL-1β, suggesting that YopE is at least partially responsible for the inhibition of IL-1β release as seen upon infection with WT or YopP-deficient Yersinia. Because IL-1β levels released by YopPE–- and YopPT–-infected cells were still lower than those released from cells infected with the ΔHOPEMT mutant, one could expect that cells infected with a triple YopPET– mutant would release comparable amounts of IL-1β as those infected with the ΔHOPEMT mutant. However, we were unable to see a reproducible and significant difference between cells infected with YopPET– or YopPE– mutants (data not shown). YopE is a GAP for Rho GTPases, particularly Rac1 (28Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A. Wiedemann A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), switching them off by accelerating GTP hydrolysis. To analyze whether the GAP activity of YopE is required for inhibition of IL-1β release, we complemented the YopPE– strain with wild-type YopE (YopEWT) or with a mutant of YopE (YopEM) that lacks the GAP activity (Fig. 1C). Complementation of the YopPE– strain with YopEWT, but not with YopEM, restored the potential of Yersinia to prevent the release of IL-1β in the medium of infected macrophages. In contrast, intracellular expression levels of proIL-1β were independent of YopE (Fig. 1C). A previous report (29Viboud G.I. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5373-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) shows that installation of the Yersinia secretion apparatus into the cell membrane of the macrophage results in pore formation and the release of cytosolic proteins such as lactate dehydrogenase, which could be prevented by YopE. Moreover, a role for Rho GTPases and rearrangements of the cytoskeleton in the regulation of this pore formation was illustrated. In agreement with the latter observation, YopE deficiency also resulted in a significant increase of lactate dehydrogenase and proIL-1β release in our experiments (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively), which coincided with an apoptotic morphology of the cells (data not shown). However, also a clear band corresponding to mature active IL-1β could be seen in the supernatant of YopPE–-infected cells, implicating that YopE affects the release as well as the proteolytic maturation of IL-1β. This role of YopE was further confirmed by the fact that identical results could be obtained when the IL-1 levels in the supernatant were measured with a CTLL cell proliferation assay that detects specifically mature bioactive IL-1β (data not shown) (30Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Libert C. Fiers W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 135: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results indicate that the GAP activity of YopE is responsible for the inhibition of the maturation and secretion of IL-1β in Yersinia infected macrophages. Moreover, this also implies a role for Rho GTPases in the process of proIL-1β maturation and IL-1β release.Specific Yop Effector Proteins and Rho GTPases Regulate Procaspase-1 Activation—Because proIL-1β maturation is mediated by caspase-1, we next analyzed the effect of YopE on caspase-1-mediated proIL-1β maturation in HEK293T cells that were transiently transfected with procaspase-1 and proIL-1β. In these conditions, procaspase-1 is partially converted to an active p20/p10 form because of its autocatalytic processing upon overexpression, resulting in the maturation of the 33-kDa proIL-1β to the bioactive 17-kDa form (Fig. 2A). Moreover, caspase-1 autoactivation also results in the induction of cell death, which can be assayed by the release of cotransfected β-galactosidase into the medium (31Oral H.B. Arancibia-Carcamo C.V. Haskard D.O. George A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Schafer H. Schafer A. Kiderlen A.F. Masihi K.N. Burger R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additional coexpression of YopEWT, but not of the catalytically inactive mutant YopEM, inhibited the autocatalytic processing of procaspase-1 as well as the proteolytic maturation of proIL-1β. Furthermore, β-galactosidase release into the medium also was partially inhibited. This demonstrates that YopE can interfere with the autocatalytic processing of caspase-1 through its GAP activity, leading to a decrease in proIL-1β maturation and caspase-1-mediated cell death. Interestingly, coexpression of YopT had a similar inhibitory effect as YopE on the proteolytic activation of procaspase-1 and proIL-1β (Fig. 2A). YopT functions as a cysteine protease that cleaves off of the prenylated C termini of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, leading to their release from the plasma membrane and their irreversible inactivation (5Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A mutant of YopT (YopTM) that had lost its proteolytic activity on Rho GTPases was no longer able to prevent the processing of procaspase-1 and proIL-1β. In contrast to YopE and YopT, coexpression of the effector protein YopH, which is a tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to dephosphorylate proteins from focal adhesions and other signaling complexes (33Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 34Black D.S. Marie-Cardine A. Schraven B. Bliska J.B. Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), had no effect on caspase-1 activity. Although YopH can lead to a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (36Grosdent N. Maridonneau-Parini I. Sory M.P. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), an effect on Rho GTPases has not been reported. These experiments show that YopE and YopT can prevent the autocatalytic processing and the activation of caspase-1 by interfering with the function of Rho GTPases. The clear inhibitory effect of YopT expression on proIL-1β maturation is somewhat contradictory to the small increase in IL-1β release in cells infected with a YopPT– double knock-out as described in our previous experiments (Fig. 1B). Most probably, this can be explained by a difference in the Yop concentration in cells upon overexpression or infection, respectively. In this context, it should be mentioned that whereas YopE and YopT inactivate RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro or upon overexpression (5Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 28Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A. Wiedemann A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), when they are injected into cells by Yersinia, they are remarkably specific, inactivating selectively Rac1 and RhoA, respectively (28Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A. Wiedemann A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Aepfelbacher M. Trasak C. Wilharm G.

Therefore, the more potent effect of YopE deletion on proIL-1β maturation in infected cells suggests a major role for Rac1. To confirm the role of Rho GTPases and, in particular, Rac1 in the proteolytic activation of caspase-1, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with procaspase-1, proIL-1β, β-galactosidase, and constitutive-active (CA) mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. We hypothesized from our previous experiments that the constitutive-active Rho GTPases should promote the autocatalytic processing of procaspase-1 and the corresponding maturation and secretion of IL-1β. Indeed, IL-1β levels were significantly increased in the supernatant of cells overexpressing RhoACA, Cdc42CA, or Rac1CA. Serial dilution of the transfected plasmid DNA concentration clearly showed that Rac1CA is much more efficient than RhoA or Cdc42 (Fig. 2B), which is in agreement with the more pronounced release of IL-1β in YopPE–- versus YopPT–-infected cells (Fig. 1B) and the described preferential effect of YopE on Rac1 (28Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A. Wiedemann A. Heesemann J. Aepfelbacher M. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As expected, Rac1CA also enhanced the autoproteolytic activation of procaspase-1 and the release of β-galactosidase (Fig. 2C), whereas RhoACA and Cdc42CA did not (data not shown). Reversibly, transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of Rac1 (Rac1DN) resulted in a decrease of caspase-1 autoactivation and, consequently, in a decrease of IL-1β and β-galactosidase release (Fig. 2, D and E). It should be mentioned that the ectopic expression levels of Rac1 that are needed to affect caspase-1 activation are extremely low under the detection limit in the case of Rac1DN (Fig. 2E and data not shown). All together, the above observations imply an important role for Rho GTPases, especially Rac1, in the regulation of caspase-1 activity.Fig. 2Specific Yop effector proteins and Rho GTPases regulate procaspase-1 activation. A, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding procaspase-1 (100 ng), proIL-1β (200 ng), β-galactosidase (100 ng), and 4 ng of either empty vector (EV) or an expression vector encoding WT YopE, YopT, or YopH or the catalytically inactive mutants (M) YopER144A or YopTC139S, all fused N-terminally with an E-tag. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes. The blot was probed with polyclonal antibodies against caspase-1 and reprobed with anti-IL-1β. p20 and p22 represent specific processing products of caspase-1. The expression of YopE, YopT, and YopH was confirmed using the monoclonal anti-E-tag-HRP antibody. Cell death was measured 24 h after transfection by the release of β-galactosidase into the medium using the Galactostar reporter gene assay system, and values were expressed as the percentage of the amount that was released into the medium of cells that were only transfected with procaspase-1 and proIL-1β.

https://openalex.org/W2025740849,"One of the cellular mechanisms used to prevent continuous and enhanced activation in response to growth factors is the internalization and degradation of their receptors. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) degradation. In a previous work, we have shown that the adaptor protein Grb10 is a positive regulator of the VEGF signaling pathway. Indeed, VEGF stimulates Grb10 expression, and Grb10 overexpression induces an increase in the amount and the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGF-R2. In the present manuscript, we demonstrate that Grb10 stimulates VEGF-R2 expression by inhibiting the Nedd4-mediated VEGF-R2 degradation. First, we show that proteasome inhibition by MG132 induces an increase in VEGF-R2 amount, and that VEGF-R2 is ubiquitinated in response to VEGF. Expression of Nedd4, a HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligase, induces the disappearance of VEGF-R2 in cells, suggesting that Nedd4 is involved in VEGF-R2 degradation. To determine whether Nedd4 directly ubiquitinates VEGF-R2, we expressed a ubiquitin ligase-deficient mutant Nedd4C854S. In the presence of Nedd4C854S, VEGF-R2 is expressed and ubiquitinated. These results suggest that VEGF-R2 is ubiquitinated but that Nedd4 is not involved in this process. Finally, we show that Grb10 constitutively associates with Nedd4. Co-expression of Nedd4 and Grb10 restores the expression of VEGF-R2, suggesting that Grb10 inhibits the Nedd4-mediated degradation of VEGF-R2. In this study, we show that Grb10 acts as a positive regulator in VEGF-R2 signaling and protects VEGF-R2 from degradation by interacting with Nedd4, a component of the endocytic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2067957598,"Serum mannose-binding protein (MBP) neutralizes invading microorganisms by binding to cell surface carbohydrates and activating MBP-associated serine proteases-1, -2, and -3 (MASPs). MASP-2 subsequently cleaves complement components C2 and C4 to activate the complement cascade. To analyze the mechanisms of activation and substrate recognition by MASP-2, zymogen and activated forms have been produced, and MBP·MASP-2 complexes have been created. These preparations have been used to show that MBP modulates MASP-2 activity in two ways. First, MBP stimulates MASP-2 autoactivation by increasing the rate of autocatalysis when MBP·MASP-2 complexes bind to a glycan-coated surface. Second, MBP occludes accessory C4-binding sites on MASP-2 until activation occurs. Once these sites become exposed, MASP-2 binds to C4 while separate structural changes create a functional catalytic site able to cleave C4. Only activated MASP-2 binds to C2, suggesting that this substrate interacts only near the catalytic site and not at accessory sites. MASP-1 cleaves C2 almost as efficiently as MASP-2 does, but it does not cleave C4. Thus MASP-1 probably enhances complement activation triggered by MBP·MASP-2 complexes, but it cannot initiate activation itself."
https://openalex.org/W2044021980,"Sodium-calcium exchangers have long been considered inert with respect to monovalent cations such as lithium, choline, and N-methyl-d-glucamine. A key question that has remained unsolved is how despite this, Li+ catalyzes calcium exchange in mammalian tissues. Here we report that a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX cloned from human cells (known as FLJ22233), is distinct from both known forms of the exchanger, NCX and NCKX in structure and kinetics. Surprisingly, NCLX catalyzes active Li+/Ca2+ exchange, thereby explaining the exchange of these ions in mammalian tissues. The NCLX protein, detected as both 70- and 55-KDa polypeptides, is highly expressed in rat pancreas, skeletal muscle, and stomach. We demonstrate, moreover, that NCLX is a K+-independent exchanger that catalyzes Ca2+ flux at a rate comparable with NCX1 but without promoting Na+/Ba2+ exchange. The activity of NCLX is strongly inhibited by zinc, although it does not transport this cation. NCLX activity is only partially inhibited by the NCX inhibitor, KB-R7943.

Identification of this novel member of the Na+/Ca2+ superfamily, with distinct characteristics, including the ability to transport Li+, may provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchange is an important element in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. It has been extensively investigated in mammals, especially in cardiac and neuronal tissues (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), where this mechanism is essential for regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. Na+/Ca2+ exchange also plays a key role in many other organs and tissues by modulating the intracellular Ca2+ response (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). The Na+/Ca2+ exchangers described to date are members of four major families (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Of these, only NCX1–3 and NCKX1–4 are found in mammalian cells, whereas the other two are expressed in plants, yeast, and bacteria. The stoichiometry of NCX exchangers is based on 3–4Na+/1Ca2+, and the protein is structurally organized as nine transmembrane helixes divided by a large cytoplasmic loop (3Khananshvili D. Advances in Molecular and Cellular Biology. 23. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 311-358Google Scholar). NCKX family proteins have a stoichiometry of 4Na/1Ca/1K, and their topology is thought to consist of two sets of five membrane helixes divided by a cytoplasmic loop and NH2-terminal extracellular domain (4Schnetkamp P.P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 6: 6Google Scholar). The two families share several important functional and structural motifs: a structural hallmark of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily is the presence of two regions of sequence similarity, called α1 and α2, which are considered necessary and sufficient for generating exchange activity (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

Functionally, these exchangers are considered catalytically inert to inorganic and organic monovalent cations such as Li+, NMG+, 1The abbreviation used is: NMG, N-methyl-d-glucamine. and choline+, which are often used in “sodium-free” solutions to reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Although Li+ ions are not transported by either NCX or NCKX, numerous physiological studies have reported a significant effect of this ion on Ca2+ exchange (6Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen.

Earlier studies, conducted on squid axons and barnacle muscle, observed an inhibitory effect on intracellular Li+, whereas extracellular Li+ accelerated 45Ca efflux (9Baker P.F. Blaustein M.P.

More recent studies, conducted on striated muscle, have suggested that Li+ may catalytically participate in Li+/Ca2+ exchange mediated by an unidentified exchanger that is distinct from NCX and NCKX (11Deval E. Raymond G. Cognard C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). During our search for candidates for the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger gene (12Ohana E. Segal D. Palty R. Ton-That D. Moran A. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 27: 27Google Scholar), we cloned the full open reading frame of the FLJ22233 gene from HEK293 cells and analyzed its activity with respect to ion transport. While this work was in progress, it was reported (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) that the full-length FLJ22233 protein, heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and therefore, is non-functional. A mouse spliced isoform with a disrupted α2 repeat was shown to mediate active K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Our findings, however, indicate that the full-length protein encoded by the human FLJ22233 gene, is in fact, functional, mediating Na+/Ca2+ exchange independent of K+. We further demonstrate that FLJ22233 is distinct from both NCX and NCKX in its ability to catalyze Li+/Ca2+ exchange. The protein is highly selective for Ca2+ and does not catalyze either Ba2+ or Zn2+ transport. We therefore propose that FLJ22333, named here NCLX, is a novel member of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family with distinct ion selectivity. Cloning of the Human NCLX—The conserved sequences of α1 and α2 repeats from AtMHX1 and from six different members of the human Na+/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily (NCX1–3, NCKX1–3) were used to screen the human genome sequence protein data base using BLAST software (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). This search revealed a hypothetical protein, FLJ22233 (GenBank™ accession number NP_079235). Based on the NCBI assembly sequence annotation (using RefSeq, at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly), one set of primers was designed to enhance the longest deduced open reading frame of this gene using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells using RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen), and mRNA was further purified using Poly Tract mRNA isolation system III (Promega). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with a one-step reverse transcriptase-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using 200 ng of mRNA and the following primers: (forward primer) 5′-CCAGCTGTTTGGAACTGAGC-3′ and (reverse primer) 5′-TCACATGCTTTTCAGGTGAATCACTCCAA-3′. Two transcripts of 1656 and 1824 bp were amplified and ligated into a pGEM-T cloning vector. Both strands of the two clones were sequenced (Sequencing Unit, Biological Core Facility at the Institute for Applied Sciences at Ben-Gurion University). The long and short transcripts were excised from pGEM-T vector (Promega), ligated into a pCDNA3.1+ vector using EcoRI endonuclease, and termed NCLX and s-NCLX for the full-length and the shorter isoform, respectively. Two opposite orientations for each transcript were selected using the reverse-oriented transcript as control. Plasmids were purified using the Hi-Speed plasmid purification kit (Qiagen). Cell Cultures and Plasmid Transfection—HEK293-T cells (human embryonic kidney cell line) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (15Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with 8 μg of NCLX, control, or rat NCX1 (kindly provided by Dr. Hanna Rahamimoff, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel) using standard calcium phosphate (CaPO4) precipitation as described previously (12Ohana E. Segal D. Palty R. Ton-That D. Moran A. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 27: 27Google Scholar). The EYFP (0.35 μg) plasmid (Clontech) was added as a fluorescent reporter for the identification of transfected cells. Transport experiments or cell harvesting were carried out 25–35 h following transfection. Fluorescent Imaging of Ion Transport—Two imaging systems were used. The first consisted of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (Zeiss) and the second consisted of an Olympus IX (Olympus) inverted microscope, Polychrome II monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (PCO Imaging) as described previously (15Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Grossman N. Sekler I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11749-11754Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Fluorescent imaging measurements were acquired using Axon Imaging Workbench 2 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). HEK293-T cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (TEF Labs, Austin, TX) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in sodium Ringer's solution (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm CaCl, at pH 7.4). Following dye loading, the cells were washed in sodium Ringer's solution, and the coverslips were mounted in a chamber that allowed the perfusion of cells. Fura-2 was excited at 340- and 380-nm wavelength light and imaged with a 510-nm-long pass filter. Influx assays were performed by perfusing the cells with Na+-free Ringer's solution such that Na+ was iso-osmotically replaced by NMG+ with or without 5 mm KCl. Active calcium efflux was monitored by first loading the cells with Ca2+ by perfusion with the NMG+ or choline+-reversal medium and then switching to a Na+- or Na+-free (NMG+-, Li+-, or choline+-containing) Ringer's solution. Zinc and barium transport mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was monitored using the influx assay using NMG+-reversal medium in which Ca2+ was replaced with 400 μm Zn2+ or 1 mm Ba2+. The effect of inhibitors on calcium influx rate mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was assessed in the same manner while adding different inhibitors to Ca2+-containing NMG+ Ringer's solution. The results shown are the means of 5–6 independent experiments, with averaged responses from 20–40 cells in each experiment. Generation of NCLX Antibody—The peptide CPVTPEILSDSEEDR, located at the start of the putative cytoplasmic loop of NCLX, was synthesized in the Peptide Core Facility at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The peptide (4 mg) was conjugated to maleimide KLH (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits according to standard procedures (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 71-80Google Scholar). Sample Preparation and Immunoblot Analysis—Rats were deeply anesthetized and killed according to the protocol approved by the Committee for the Ethical Care and Use of Animal in Experiments at the Faculty of Health Sciences at Ben-Gurion University. Appropriate tissues were placed in cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.32 m sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm EGTA with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and briefly sonicated three times using a tip-sonicator for 30 s (17Nitzan Y.B. Sekler I. Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Silverman W.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain. Res. 2002; 137: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After brief centrifugation, supernatants were collected and frozen at -70 °C until use. HEK293-T cells expressing NCLX or control were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution, scraped from the plate using a rubber policeman, and placed into radioimmune precipitation buffer. Protein was quantified by the Bradford dye binding procedure (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblot analysis was carried as described previously (17Nitzan Y.B. Sekler I. Hershfinkel M. Moran A. Silverman W.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain. Res. 2002; 137: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), using the NCLX-antiserum (or the pre-immune serum) at a 1/2500 dilution. Na+/Ca2+ Exchange Mediated by NCLX—We have cloned the FLJ22233 gene during our search for cation transporters expressed in HEK293 cells (12Ohana E. Segal D. Palty R. Ton-That D. Moran A. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 27: 27Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame was obtained and inserted into a pCDNA-3 mammalian expression vector. The activity of this putative transporter was determined by monitoring intracellular Ca2+ changes in HEK293-T cells heterologously expressing the FLJ22233 gene product, loaded with Fura-2 AM. Cells were superfused with Ringer's solution, which was replaced with NMG+ Ringer's solution (NMG+ iso-osmotically substituting for Na+), as shown in Fig. 1. The removal of Na+ was followed by robust Ca2+ influx. The subsequent addition of Na+ into the Ringer's solution induced a rapid efflux of Ca2+. This Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was not monitored in control HEK293-T cells (transfected with vector containing a reverse-oriented insert). The exchange activity was compared with the activity mediated by NCX1. For both exchangers, a significant Ca2+ influx was monitored at the absence of Na+, which was replaced by NMG+, and active Ca2+ efflux was subsequently monitored when Na+ was reintroduced. Our results indicate that the full-length NCLX codes for a functional Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. K+ Dependence of NCLX—To determine the K+ dependence of NCLX, we applied the paradigm described in Fig. 1 while using either choline+ or NMG+ (Fig. 2) in the reversal solution to verify that the exchange activity is not affected non-specifically by either NMG+ or choline+. If the exchanger is K+-dependent, a robust reduction in the Ca2+ influx rate in the absence of K+ would be expected using the reversal mode. As shown in Fig. 2, rates of Ca2+ influx were similar in the presence or absence of K+, using either choline+ or NMG+. Our results, therefore, indicate that the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mediated by NCLX is not K+-dependent. Li+/Ca2+ Exchange Mediated by NCLX—Lithium has often been used as an inert ion to study the reversal of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. We have, therefore, employed Li+ as an additional control for the activity of the NCLX as compared with NCX1, again employing the same paradigm as shown in Fig. 1. In NCX1-expressing cells, an enhanced Ca2+ influx was observed, consistent with the reversal of the exchanger activity. Unexpectedly, NCLX-expressing cells showed a much slower rate of Ca2+ influx in the presence of Li+ (Fig. 3). This striking difference between the two exchangers suggests that although NCX1 is inert to Li+ transport, this ion is either inhibitory to Na+/Ca2+ exchange or transported by NCLX. To distinguish between the two mechanisms, Ca2+ was loaded into cells expressing NCLX using NMG+-Ringer's, and the rate of active Ca2+ efflux was compared in the presence of Na+, NMG+,orLi+. As shown in Fig. 4, whereas rates of Ca2+ efflux were somewhat slower in the presence of Li+ as compared with Na+ (1.6 ± 0.5-fold), Li+ ions were strikingly more effective (8 ± 1-fold) as compared with NMG+ in promoting active Ca2+ efflux. The small, residual efflux activity observed in the presence of NMG+ may be related to the activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Taken together, the failure of Li+ to promote Ca2+ influx in the reverse mode on the one hand and the acceleration of efflux in cells loaded with Ca2+ on the other indicate that Li+ is transported by NCLX. Thus, this exchanger can mediate either Li+ or Na+ calcium exchange. Cation Dose Dependence of the Exchange Mediated by NCLX—The Ca2+ influx dose dependence of NCLX was determined using the reversal mode of the exchanger while changing extracellular Ca2+ concentration and yielded an apparent Hill coefficient of 1.5 +-0.4 and an apparent affinity of 0.8 ± 0.2 mm for Ca2+, well within the physiological range (Fig. 5a). To determine the Na+ dependence of Ca2+ efflux mediated by NCLX-expressing cells, the cells were first loaded with Ca2+, using the reversal of NCLX, and then extracellular Na+ was gradually iso-osmotically replaced with NMG+, and the rates of Ca2+ efflux were monitored. As shown in Fig. 5b, Ca2+ efflux rates increased with external Na+ concentrations, fitting a Michaelis-Menten equation with an apparent half-maximal rate at 60 ± 5mm Na+ and a 3.5 ± 1 Hill coefficient. Similar to other members of the NCX and NCKX family, the NCLX exchanges 3–4 Na+ ions per 1 Ca2+ ion. The apparent affinities of both extracellular Ca2+ (influx mode) and Na+ (efflux mode) for NCLX are also within the range previously monitored for NCX1 (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Since Li+ was transported by NCLX in the absence of Na+, we further studied whether Li+ will functionally replace Na+ at physiological concentrations. The same experimental paradigm described for Na+/NMG+ replacement was applied for Na+/Li+. Remarkably, only a slight change in Ca2+ efflux rate is observed over the whole range, beginning with 140 mm Na+ and gradually changing to 140 mm Li+. Our results clearly indicate that Li+ and Na+ act additively in catalyzing Ca2+ efflux mediated by NCLX. As the Na+-dependent exchange activity of other cations such as Ba2+,Mg2+, and Zn2+ has been previously functionally described (12Ohana E. Segal D. Palty R. Ton-That D. Moran A. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 27: 27Google Scholar, 18Feray J.C. Garay R. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1988; 338: 332-337Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the cation selectivity of the NCLX in its reversal mode. Rates of Ba2+ or Zn2+ transport by NCLX are negligible (not shown), indicating that at least with respect to these cations, NCLX activity is specific to Ca2+. Inhibitors for NCLX Activity—The use of inhibitors is an important tool for the functional identification and characterization of an ion exchanger. We have, therefore, studied the sensitivity of the NCLX to various inhibitors of cation transporters. As shown in Fig. 6, a–c, the application of KB-R7943, a potent inhibitor of NCX with K½ of 10 μm (19Elias C.L. Lukas A. Shurraw S. Scott J. Omelchenko A. Gross G.J. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1334-H1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted only in partial inhibition of NCLX activity to ∼40% at a KB-R7943 concentration of 50 μm, and a further increase in KB-R7943 concentration to 100 μm did not result in additional inhibition of the exchange activity. Zinc ions, which are known to inhibit NCX1 non-selectively (using 30 μm (20Colvin R.A. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 3091-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), were slightly more effective in inhibiting NCLX activity with maximal inhibition of ∼75% at 200 μm and an apparent half-maximal inhibition at ∼10 μm. In contrast, even a high concentration of verapamil (100 μm), a Ca2+ antagonist that efficiently blocks Ca2+ channels, had a weak effect on NCLX activity, reducing Ca2+ influx rate by only ∼20% as compared with that of control. NCLX Short Splice Isoform—We cloned an additional splice isoform of the FLJ22233 gene from HEK293 cells, a humanderived cell line, referred to here as s-NCLX (short-NCLX isoform, see Fig. 7, inset). This splice isoform lacks exon 7, resulting in a deletion of 54 amino acids in the primary human sequence and a predicted molecular mass based on the primary amino sequence of 58 KDa, whereas the full-length NCLX gene has a predicted molecular mass of 64 KDa. The region of deletion encompasses the putative transmembrane domains 3 and 4 in NCLX. Since the domains truncated in this splice isoform have been shown to play a role in ion transport (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar), we compared the activity, K+ dependence, and Li+ transport of this splice isoform to the full-length NCLX. The deletion did not change s-NCLX activity as compared with that of the fulllength NCLX in all of these aspects (Fig. 7). NCLX Tissue Distribution—To determine the tissue distribution of NCLX, we generated a polyclonal antibody using a peptide derived from the putative intracellular domain specific to NCLX and not shared by known members of the NCKX or NCX protein families. Western blot analysis was performed using protein extracts from HEK293-T cells, heterologously expressing s-NCLX or NCLX (full-length NCLX). The NCLX antibody specifically stained a major band of ∼70 KDa and a weaker one at ∼55 KDa (Fig. 8a). Protein extract from control cells did not react with the antibody. These results indicate that the antibody specifically recognizes the full-length NCLX and s-NCLX. The small shift in the molecular weight of s-NCLX is consistent with the small truncation of ∼50 amino acids. Finally, as our antibody was designed to cross-react with the rat full-length and short isoforms of NCLX, we analyzed tissues from rat for the presence of the exchanger. Again, the NCLX antibody specifically stained two major bands, at ∼70 and ∼55 KDa (Fig. 8b). In their study, Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) reported that NCLX transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in rat tissues; our findings indicate that NCLX protein expression is more restricted. We show here that the reactivity is most intense on proteins from rat pancreas, skeletal muscle, and stomach. As a control, we also studied mouse heart extracts. In this tissue, both forms (∼70 and ∼55-KDa) are observed, as has been noted previously (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that NCLX is kinetically distinct from both the NCX and NCKX. Although both NCX and NCKX are totally inert to Li+ transport, NCLX catalyzes Li+/Ca2+ exchange at a rate that is only slightly slower than Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Moreover, our data suggest that Li+ and Na+ act additively in catalyzing Ca2+ exchange. In further contrast to NCX proteins, NCLX does not significantly catalyze Na+/Ba2+ exchange, indicating that in this aspect, it is similar to NCKX (4Schnetkamp P.P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 6: 6Google Scholar, 21Condrescu M. Chernaya G. Kalaria V. Reeves J.P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 7: 7Google Scholar). However, although NCLX shares somewhat greater sequence similarity with NCKX (21% for NCKX1) than with NCX (11% for NCX1), Na+/Ca2+ exchange catalyzed by NCLX is not, as suggested previously, K+-dependent (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). NCLX, unlike NCKX, is also partially sensitive to KB-R7943 (4Schnetkamp P.P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 6: 6Google Scholar, 23Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Key residues, highly conserved in both NCX and NCKX, are surprisingly different in the NCLX primary sequence. Most notable are changes in the α-repeat domains, suggesting alterations in the cation selectivity of this exchanger (1Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). Indeed, phylogenetic analysis of NCLX has revealed that it is somewhat more related to NCKX, although it has also diverged at an early stage from these proteins (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). Taken together with our functional analysis, we propose that NCLX is a novel Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with characteristics distinct from either the NCX or the NCKX families. The full-length FLJ22233 gene product tagged with FLAG epitope at the NH2-terminal domain was described by Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) as non-functional when expressed in HEK293 cells. The use of Li+ as an inert cation for the reversal of the exchanger activity may have yielded an apparent non-functional phenotype. Immunoblot and histochemical analysis by Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) suggested that FLJ22233 is expressed in HEK293 cells as a 55-KDa protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. We found, in contrast, that heterologous expression of NCLX in HEK293-T cells resulted in a fully functional protein. It is possible that the tagging by the FLAG epitope interfered with the proper sorting of the mouse gene described by Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated that NCLX migrated as a major band of 70 KDa in addition to a much weaker 55-KDa protein. In native tissue, however, both the study of Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) and our study have identified both forms. It may be possible, therefore, that post-translational modifications have yielded the differences in molecular weight and functionality between our respective studies (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar). Another major difference between our findings is the K+ dependence of Ca2+ exchange. Thus, we found that NCLX is K+-independent; the spliced short mouse isoform studied by Cai et al. (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar) was K+-dependent and was inert to Li+. This discrepancy may be linked to structural differences between the full-length human gene and the short mouse isoform, which has a putatively disrupted second α-repeat and a long intracellular tail. We did not find a similar isoform to the mouse in human. It remains to be seen whether these changes in the primary sequence of the mouse gene are converting this isoform to a K+-dependent and Li+-inert Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. We were able to clone a human isoform lacking exon 7, which results in the deletion of the transmembrane domains 3 and 4. These domains are highly conserved in NCX and NCKX families. Although in NCKX2, mutations of several amino acids located in this region have resulted in the loss of activity (24Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Kinjo T.G. Kang K. Perizzolo M. Eisner L. Schnetkamp P.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we find that the truncation of this region from NCLX, manifested in s-NCLX, had no effect on activity. It was previously shown that although NCX1 does not transport Li+, a single point mutation of Thr-103/Val-103 did activate Li+/Ca2+ exchange that was mediated by canine NCX1 (25Doering A.E. Nicoll D.A. Lu Y. Lu L. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 778-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This threonine residue is conserved among all members of NCX, NCKX, and NCLX. Interestingly however, and only in NCLX, the amino acid preceding threonine is valine. Whether this specific residue or its domain is responsible for Li+/Ca2+ exchange, or whether other regions participate in Li+/Ca2+ exchange mediated by NCLX, is an intriguing and open question. Although mRNAs for FLJ22233 are found in many tissues (13Cai X. Lytton J. Dong H. Dunn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 18: 18Google Scholar), the expression level of the protein varies markedly in these tissues. In rat, the protein is highly expressed in the pancreas, skeletal muscle, and stomach, and to lesser extent, in cardiac tissue, brain, spleen, and skin. In human, the protein is highly expressed in the brain and skeletal muscle, and low expression levels are observed in the pancreas (data not shown). The lower expression of NCLX in human tissues, especially in the pancreas, should be taken with a degree of caution, considering the high content of proteolytic enzymes that exist there and that may be activated in a cadaver. In the rat pancreas, we have found that NCLX is primarily found in the exocrine part (data not shown). In this regard, Na+/Ca2+ exchange in pancreatic ducts was reported previously to be more intense than in acini where the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump is the primary transporter for Ca2+ efflux (26Bayerdorffer E. Haase W. Schulz I. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 87: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In mouse brain, NCX2 was recently shown to play a role in synaptic transmission, and specifically, in the context of learning and memory (27Jeon D. Yang Y.M. Jeong M.J. Philipson K.D. Rhim H. Shin H.S. Neuron. 2003; 38: 965-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The importance of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in skeletal muscle was recently demonstrated by the effect of NCX3 knockout on muscle activity (28Sokolow S. Manto M. Gailly P. Molgo J. Vandebrouck C. Vanderwinden J.M. Herchuelz A. Schurmans S. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The potential physiological importance of NCLX is highlighted by numerous reports on observed effects of Li+ on Ca2+ exchange. Both voltage sensitivity and magnitude of Na+/Ca2+ exchange have been described as depending on the presence of Li+ as opposed to NMG+ (replacing Na+) (6Miura Y. Kimura J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 1129-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Gadsby D.C. Noda M. Shepherd R.N. Nakao M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence, particularly in skeletal muscle, suggests that Li+ ions may directly participate in Ca2+ exchange (11Deval E. Raymond G. Cognard C. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Since neither NCX nor NCXK family members transport Li+, it has been conjectured that an as yet unidentified exchanger may be involved in this mode of transport. The Li+ transport mediated by NCLX, taken together with its high abundance in skeletal muscle, is consistent with the conclusion that NCLX is that mediator of Li+/Ca2+ exchange. Since Li+/Ca2+ exchange is slower than Na+/Ca2+ exchange mediated by NCLX, it may well be that the exchange activity of NCLX regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is underestimated. Expression of NCLX in cardiac muscle may also explain the significant residual activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchange found in cardiomyocytes cultured from NCX1-null embryos (29Conway S.J. Kruzynska-Frejtag A. Wang J. Rogers R. Kneer P.L. Chen H. Creazzo T. Menick D.R. Koushik S.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 268-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Future studies combining the silencing of specific members of the Na+/Ca2+ exchangers superfamily, together with functional studies comparing the role of Li+ or Na+ in Ca2+ exchange, can now be undertaken to determine whether the activity of NCLX is related to this intriguing effect. We thank Dr. Hanna Rahamimoff (Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel) for providing the NCX plasmids."

This functional diversity was achieved with a humeral architecture that was remarkably conserved during the Devonian."
https://openalex.org/W2009864037,"We report the cloning and molecular analysis of Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor B2 (d-mt-TFB2), a protein that plays a role in mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication in Drosophila. An RNA interference (RNAi) construct was designed that reduces expression of d-mtTFB2 to 5% of its normal level in Schneider cells. RNAi knock-down of d-mtTFB2 reduces the abundance of specific mitochondrial RNA transcripts 2- to 8-fold and decreases the copy number of mtDNA ∼3-fold. In a corollary manner, we find that overexpression of d-mtTFB2 increases both the abundance of mitochondrial RNA transcripts and the copy number of mtDNA. In a comparative experiment, we find that overexpression of Drosophila mitochondrial transcription factor A (d-TFAM) increases mtDNA copy number with no significant effect on mitochondrial transcripts. This argues for a direct role for mtTFB2 in mitochondrial transcription and suggests that, if TFAM serves a role in transcription, its endogenous level limits mtDNA copy number but not transcription. Furthermore, we suggest that mtTFB2 increases mtDNA copy number by increasing the frequency of initiation of DNA replication, whereas TFAM serves to stabilize and package mtDNA in mitochondrial nucleoids. Our work represents the first study to document the function of mtTFB2 in vivo, establishing a dual role in regulation of both transcription and replication, and provides a benchmark for comparative biochemical studies in various animal systems.

TFAM contains two high mobility group boxes and was shown in organello to bind nonspecifically at regularly phased intervals to the control region of human mtDNA (18Ghivizzani S.C. Madsen C.S.

The yeast homologue of TFAM is Abf2p, an abundant protein whose primary role is to stabilize and compact mtDNA (21Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T. Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both human mtTFB1 and mt-TFB2 have been shown to activate transcription from mitochondrial promoters in vitro, although their specific roles in mitochondrial transcription remain unclear (14McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat.

Recent studies indicate that h-mtTFB1 has rRNA methylase activity (26Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that its in vitro transcriptional activation and methylase activities can be differentially inactivated by mutation (25McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5816-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the three animal mitochondrial transcription factors in vivo are very limited, and to date, only studies of TFAM have been reported. Gene-targeted disruption of mouse TFAM results in loss of mtDNA (27Larsson N.G. Wang J. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), and its overexpression in chicken DT40 cells increases the copy number of mtDNA (28Matsushima Y. Matsumura K. Ishii S. Inagaki H. Suzuki T. Matsuda Y. Beck K. Kitagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31149-31158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Depletion of Drosophila TFAM in cell culture by double-stranded RNAi results in a marked reduction of mtDNA content, without significant inhibition of mitochondrial transcription (29Goto A. Matsushima Y. Kadowaki T. Kitagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, these physiological data support an important role for TFAM in mtDNA maintenance. Here, we report the cloning and overexpression of Drosophila mtTFB2, and the knock-down phenotype of Drosophila Schneider cells treated with d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi. Our results argue strongly that d-mtTFB2 is required both for efficient mitochondrial transcription and for maintenance of mtDNA. Identification and Sequence Analysis of d-mtTFB2 cDNA—The amino acid sequence of d-mtTFB1 was used to search the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database. One sequence (CG3910) was identified that has a high level of homology to d-mtTFB1. Full-length cDNA was prepared using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), total RNA from Drosophila Schneider S2 cells, and the following primers: 5′-TTACCCAACTTGCTACTCTTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGCTCGAGGCACCTTGGCTATGAATTTGTGCTC-3′ for 5′ RACE, and 5′-CAAAATGGACGGTGGTTCCAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGAATTCCTTCAAGCACTTGATCAACTCC-3′ for 3′ RACE. RACE products were purified from an agarose gel and sequenced, and sequence analysis was performed using MacDNASIS version 3.7 (Hitachi Software). Similarity searches against the nonredundant GenBank™ data base were performed using BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence was checked for targeting signal peptides using iPSORT (31Horton P. Nakai K. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1997; 5: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar) and MITPROT (32Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Bacterial Overexpression of d-mtTFB2 and Preparation of d-mtTFB2 Antibody—To express d-mtTFB2 in Escherichia coli, a PCR fragment of d-mtTFB2 cDNA encoding amino acid residues Ala-13 to Ser-252 was cloned into pET-28a (Novagen) cleaved with BamHI and EcoRI. Bacterial cells harboring the plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside. The C-terminal hexahistidine tag was utilized for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification of recombinant d-mt-TFB2 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Rabbits were immunized by injection of column-purified d-mtTFB2 in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by secondary immunization in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. To prepare affinity-purified antiserum, purified d-mtTFB2 (100 μg) was bound to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the filter was preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in PBS, incubated for 1 h with crude antiserum (1 ml in 5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.4 (∼5 ml). The eluted antibody was neutralized with 1 m Tris base. Preparation of Inducible Plasmids Expressing d-mtTFB2-, d-TFAM-, and d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi—The plasmid pMt/mtTFB2/Hy, in which d-mtTFB2 cDNA is regulated by the metallothionein promoter, was constructed as follows: a fragment of d-mtTFB2 cDNA was amplified by PCR using as 5′-primer 5′-GGGCTCGAGAAAAATCTTAAGAAATGCTG-3′ and as 3′-primer 5′-GCGCACTAGTCTAAGAACTGGCTTTCCTG-3′. The PCR fragment was cleaved by XhoI and EcoRI and subcloned. The plasmid pMt/TFAM/Hy, in which d-TFAM cDNA is regulated by the metallothionein promoter, was constructed as follows: a fragment of d-TFAM cDNA was amplified by PCR using as 5′-primer 5′-GGGCTCGAGCAGGTTCGCCATTGAGATC-3′ and as 3′-primer 5′-GCGCACTAGTGTGAATTATGTGATGGAAGAG-3′. The PCR fragment was cleaved by XhoI and SpeI and subcloned. The plasmid pMt/invB2/Hy carries an inverted repeat of a nucleotide sequence from d-mtTFB2 cDNA that is transcribed from the metallothionein promoter. The insert in pMt/invB2/Hy was generated from two PCR-amplified fragments of d-mtTFB2 cDNA. One fragment has terminal XhoI and EcoRI sites and was prepared using the following pair of primers: 5′-GCGCCTCGAGACTAGTAAGGTGCAGTCCATCAATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCGAATTCGGGATCGATTAGCGTCAGAATCTGACTGG-3′ (reverse). A second fragment has terminal SpeI and EcoRI sites and was prepared using the primers 5′-GCGCCTCGAGACTAGTAAGGTGCAGTCCATCAATCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGCGAATTCAAAAAGCTTTAGCGTCAGAATCTGACTGG-3′ (reverse). The two PCR products were ligated and cloned into the pMt/Hy vector cleaved with XhoI and SpeI. Generation and Induction of Stable Cell Lines—Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Drosophila Schneider Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, with the exception of the uninduced culture carrying the overexpression construct oexB2, which was grown in the presence of 0.5% fetal bovine serum to suppress leaky expression from the metallothionein promoter (see Fig. 5, lane 5). Cells were subcultured to 3 × 106 cells/ml every third day. Cells were transfected using Effecten (Qiagen). Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected with 200 μg/μl hygromycin. Cells were passaged at least five times in hygromycin-containing medium and then cultured in standard medium. The cell lines were grown to a density of 3 × 106/ml and then treated with 0.4 mm CuSO4 to induce high level expression from the metallothionein promoter (34Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Low level expression was effected by growth of cell cultures in the presence of 0.04 mm CuSO4 (see Fig. 6).Fig. 6mtRNA and mtDNA abundance in Schneider cells overexpressing d-TFAM or d-mtTFB2. Schneider cells (control) or Schneider cells carrying pMt/TFAM/Hy (oexA) (A–C) or pMt/mt-TFB2/Hy (oexB2) (D–F) were grown for 10 days under low level induction conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A and D, immunoblot analysis of d-TFAM and d-mtTFB2 was carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. B and E, Northern blot analysis using probes for 12S rRNA, ND4, Cytb, and Rp49 was carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3. C and F, Southern blots were probed with radiolabeled mtDNA probe (top panel) or control probe (lower panel). mtDNA abundance was determined as described in legend to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoblotting—Total cellular protein (20 μg per lane) was fractionated by 10.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in PBS, followed by incubation for 1 h with d-mtTFB2 antibody (1:25 ml in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). Filters were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (BIO-RAD), and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Protein bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibody against Drosophila TFAM was prepared and used as described in a previous study (29Goto A. Matsushima Y. Kadowaki T. Kitagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Northern and Southern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). RNA (5 μg per lane) was fractionated in a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to 32P-labeled probes for each of the following four genes: ribosomal protein 49 (Rp49), cytochrome b (Cytb), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4), or 12S rRNA. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 42 °C in 5× SSPE (150 mm NaCl/10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4/1 mm EDTA), 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 50% formamide. The membrane was washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.1%, and twice with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 55 °C, and then analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The signal for RP49 was used to normalize mitochondrial transcripts. Genomic DNA was purified from Drosophila Schneider S2 cells by standard methods. DNA (5 μg per lane) was cleaved with XhoI, fractionated in a 0.8% agarose gel/TBE and transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed as above. Filters were washed three times for 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, once for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with radiolabeled DNAs for the mitochondrial gene Cytb and the nuclear histone gene cluster. The ratio of the signals for these two genes was used to estimate the relative copy number of mtDNA. Cloning of Drosophila melanogaster mtTFB2—Two conserved proteins, h-mtTFB1 and h-mtTFB2, function in human mitochondrial transcription in vitro (14McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol.

The sequence of a putative d-mtTFB1 (14McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was used to search the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database for a Drosophila homologue of h-mtTFB2. The search identified a predicted protein, CG3910, whose nucleotide sequence was used to identify and clone a full-length cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA clone obtained is 1506 nucleotides and encodes a predicted polypeptide of 452 amino acids. Protein sequence analysis with MitoProt II and iPSORT indicate a high probability of mitochondrial localization via a 30-amino acid N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide, with the full-length and processed forms of d-mtTFB2 predicted to be 52.2 and 48.6 kDa, respectively. d-mtTFB2 was found to be 34% homologous to human mtTFB2 and 36% homologous to mouse mtTFB2 (Fig. 1). As was shown previously (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), we found bacterial rRNA methyltransferase to be a member of the same protein family (data not shown). Rabbit antiserum was raised against a recombinant, truncated form of d-mtTFB2 (Ala-13 to Ser-252). The antibody detects a single polypeptide in protein extracts from Drosophila Schneider cells with an electrophoretic mobility corresponding to an approximate molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions of Drosophila Schneider cells demonstrated that d-mtTFB2 is localized to the mitochondria (data not shown). RNAi-dependent Knock-down of d-mtTFB2 Reduces Cell Growth and Mitochondrial Transcription and Induces mtDNA Depletion—The abundance of d-mtTFB2 was reduced by expressing a metallothionein-inducible d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi species (35Hammond S.M.

Previous studies indicate that dsRNA hairpins are efficient RNAi inhibitors (38Lam G. Thummel C.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 957-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Nat.

Cells stably expressing pMt/invB2/Hy or the control plasmid pMt/Hy were cultured for 10 days in the absence or presence of 0.4 mm CuSO4. Immunoblot analysis of copper-treated cells showed that cells carrying pMt/invB2/Hy expressed 20-fold less d-mtTFB2 than cells carrying the control vector (Fig. 2B). Basal, uninduced expression from pMt/invB2/Hy (which results from metal contamination in the fetal bovine serum, see “Experimental Procedures”) also suppressed expression of d-mtTFB2 by 5-fold. In contrast, expression of the catalytic subunit of Drosophila mitochondrial DNA polymerase, pol γ-α, was unchanged under all four experimental conditions. Furthermore, the level of transcripts from d-mtTFB1 was unchanged by d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi (data not shown). Likewise, copper-treated cells carrying pMt/invB2/Hy grew poorly and demonstrated reduced viability, but copper treatment had no adverse effects on growth of control cells (data not shown). The biological function of d-mtTFB2 was examined in cells expressing d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi. Transcription of several mitochondrial genes and mtDNA copy number were measured in cells carrying no plasmid, pMt/Hy or pMt/invB2/Hy. Northern blots were used to quantitate relative expression of the Cytb, ND4, and 12S rRNA genes in cells grown for 10 days in the presence or absence of copper. Basal expression of d-mt-TFB2-targeted RNAi reduced the transcript levels for Cytb, ND4, and 12S rRNA to 61%, 34%, and 70% of their level in control cells, respectively (Fig. 3); after induction in the presence of copper, transcript levels were further reduced to 13%, 16%, and 57% of control cells, respectively. In contrast, the level of transcripts from the nuclear gene RP49 was unchanged by d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi. These results show that d-mt-TFB2 is critical for transcription of both strands of Drosophila mtDNA, because Cytb is encoded on the opposite strand from ND4 and 12S rRNA. The copy number of mtDNA was also reduced in cells expressing d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi. Total cellular DNA was isolated from cells carrying no plasmid, pMt/Hy or pMt/invB2/Hy, cleaved with XhoI, and analyzed by Southern blot. Blots were hybridized sequentially with probes for the nuclear histone gene cluster and for the mitochondrial gene CytB (Fig. 4A). Relative mtDNA copy number was estimated from the ratio of CytB hybridization to histone cluster hybridization (Fig. 4B). After induction of d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi for 10 days, relative mtDNA copy number was 38% of the control; without induction, the basal level of d-mtTFB2-targeted RNAi reduced the mtDNA copy number to 64% of control. This result suggests that d-mtTFB2 is also required for synthesis of RNA primers during replication of mtDNA. Overexpression of d-mtTFB2 Increases Mitochondrial Transcription and mtDNA Copy Number—d-mtTFB2 was subcloned into the inducible expression vector pMt/Hy under the control of the metallothionein promoter. The resulting expression vector, pMt/mtTFB2/Hy, was introduced into Schneider cells, and stable cell lines harboring this plasmid were cultured in media with or without 0.4 mm CuSO4. After 10 days of incubation in the presence of copper, immunoblot analysis indicated a 40-fold increase in d-mtTFB2 relative to that in the uninduced control (Fig. 5A). Drosophila pol γ-α was not overexpressed under the same conditions. In contrast to the deleterious effect of reduced expression of d-mtTFB2, overexpression had no effect on cell growth or viability (data not shown). The effect of d-mtTFB2 overexpression on mitochondrial transcript abundance was evaluated by Northern blots. Blots were probed for transcripts from the mitochondrial ND4, Cytb, and 12S rRNA genes and for nuclear RP49 as a control (Fig. 5B). The results demonstrate that the level of all three mitochondrial RNA transcripts increases ∼2-fold in cells that overexpress d-mtTFB2, whereas the level of nuclear RP49 transcript is unchanged. Relative copy number of mtDNA was also increased ∼2-fold in cells that overexpress d-mtTFB2 (Fig. 5C). Functional Differences between d-TFAM and d-mtTFB2 in Mitochondrial Regulation—To compare the roles of d-TFAM and d-mtTFB2 in mitochondrial regulation, we established a cell line that expresses d-TFAM under the control of the metallothionein promoter. After 10 days of low level induction in the absence and presence of 0.04 mm CuSO4, immunoblot analysis indicated 1.5- and 2.6-fold increases in d-TFAM, respectively, relative to the control, with no significant change in the level of d-mtTFB2 (Fig. 6A). The effect of d-TFAM overexpression on mitochondrial transcript abundance was evaluated by Northern blots. Blots were probed for transcripts from the mitochondrial ND4, Cytb, and 12S rRNA genes and for nuclear RP49 as a control (Fig. 6B). The results demonstrate that the level of all three mitochondrial transcripts is unchanged, arguing that endogenous levels of d-TFAM are in excess of that required for its role in transcription, if any. In contrast, the relative copy number of mtDNA was increased by 1.5- and 1.9-fold, corresponding directly with the 1.5- and 2.6-fold increases in d-TFAM, respectively (Fig. 6C). By comparison, after 10 days of low level induction of d-mtTFB2, immunoblot analysis indicated 1.6- and 5-fold increases in d-mtTFB2 relative to the control (Fig. 6D), with no significant change in the level of d-TFAM. However, d-mtTFB2 overexpression resulted in both corresponding increases in mitochondrial transcripts in the range of 1.3- to 1.4-fold and 2.1- to 2.2-fold (Fig. 6E) and in mtDNA copy number of 1.2- and 2.1-fold (Fig. 6F), at the two elevated levels of d-mtTFB2, respectively. Drosophila mtTFB2 shares homology with human mtTFB2 that has been shown to be important for mitochondrial transcription in vitro (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In Drosophila Schneider cells treated with RNAi, d-mtTFB2 is expressed at 5% of the endogenous level and induces cellular phenotypes of slow growth, reduced viability, 2- to 8-fold reduction in abundance of specific mitochondrial transcripts, and 3-fold reduction in mtDNA copy number. Overexpression of d-mtTFB2 modestly stimulates transcription of mitochondrial genes and increases mtDNA copy number 2-fold. These data provide the first evidence that animal mtTFB2 plays an important role in both mitochondrial transcription and mtDNA replication in vivo. We found that mitochondrial transcript levels depend both on the abundance of d-mtTFB2 and on the specific mitochondrial gene examined. Basal-level expression of RNAi in Schneider cells was sufficient to reduce 4-fold the level of d-mtTFB2, whereas its induced expression reduced d-mtTFB2 levels by 20-fold. By comparison, mitochondrial mRNA abundance was reduced 1.6- to 3-fold under basal conditions and 6- to 8-fold under induced conditions. Under both induced and uninduced conditions, the level of the 12S rRNA transcript was substantially less sensitive to the abundance of d-mtTFB2 than were the levels of two mRNA species. The reason for this pattern is not clear, but it may indicate a faster turnover of mitochondrial mRNA as compared with mitochondrial rRNA (41Gelfand R. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although information on transcriptional mechanism in Drosophila remains limited, several polycistronic transcripts were identified and mapped by Berthier et al. (42Berthier F. Renaud M. Alziari S. Durand R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4519-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting that Drosophila mtDNA is transcribed polycistronically as in other organisms, and similar to mammals, mitochondrial rRNAs were found to be more abundant than mRNAs (42Berthier F. Renaud M. Alziari S. Durand R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4519-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, Drosophila mitochondrial transcription termination factor was identified that mediates termination of transcription of the ribosomal unit, accounting for the excess production of mitochondrial rRNAs (43Roberti M. Polosa P.L. Bruni F. Musicco C. Gadaleta M.N. Cantatore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overall, we found that mRNA levels were reduced more than the levels of mtDNA, and this, too, may reflect a higher turnover rate for mRNAs as compared with that of mtDNA. Interestingly, a similar result was obtained in an RNA knock-down analysis of mitochondrial RNA polymerase in trypanosomes (44Grams J. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Wang Z. Englund P.T. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16952-16959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In any case, because of the differential effects we observed on mtDNA copy number and transcription in the overexpression analyses of d-mtTFB2 and d-TFAM, it is apparent that the effect of d-mtTFB2 on transcription is not a simple consequence of mtDNA dose. We found that the abundance of d-mtTFB2 influences modestly the efficiency of mtDNA replication, where 2- to 3-fold effects were observed over a broad range of 20-fold underexpression to 40-fold overexpression. In human and mouse cells, initiation of mtDNA replication was proposed to involve synthesis of an RNA primer by transcription from the light strand promoter, followed by RNA processing and then extension of the RNA primer by DNA polymerase γ in a unidirectional and strand asymmetric manner (45Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 46Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that d-mTFB2 is involved in the synthesis of RNA primer(s) for mtDNA replication, because mtDNA copy number changes in parallel with both increasing and decreasing the levels of d-mtTFB2, and this is accompanied by corresponding changes in mitochondrial transcripts. Relatively little is known about the mechanism of mtDNA replication in Drosophila (47Goddard J.M. Wolstenholme D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3886-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and new experimental approaches have led to a reconsideration of the long standing model proposed for mouse and man (48Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 355-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 49Bogenhagen D.F. Clayton D.A. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2003; 28: 404-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the recent model, mtDNA replication is proposed to initiate bidirectionally within a broad zone and proceed symmetrically, becoming unidirectional when one fork encounters a barrier in the vicinity of the previously designated leading strand origin (51Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 52Bowmaker M. Yang M.Y. Yasukawa T. Reyes A. Jacobs H.T. Huberman J.A. Holt I.J.

Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In considering both models, it remains possible that only one primer is made for leading and one for lagging DNA strand synthesis, or that multiple primers are synthesized on one or both DNA strands. Whatever the case, our data would suggest that at least one of these is made by mtRNA polymerase functioning together with d-mTFB2, either at a promoter or elsewhere. Because we find d-mTFB2 abundance regulates mtDNA copy number, we would suggest that this priming event is likely critical to initiation of mtDNA replication. In vitro studies show that both mtTFB1 and mtTFB2 support transcription from human mitochondrial promoters (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but their relative importance and specific roles are not well understood. That RNAi knock-down of d-mtTFB2 lowers the efficiency of mitochondrial transcription in Drosophila-cultured cells is particularly significant, because the data argue strongly that endogenous mtTFB1 cannot complement a deficiency in mtTFB2. Thus, mtTFB1 is not functionally redundant with mtTFB2, pointing to specialized roles for the two transcription factors in vivo. In this regard, it has been reported that h-mtTFB1 has rRNA methyltransferase activity (26Seidel-Rogol B.L. McCulloch V. Shadel G.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and that h-mtTFB2 is at least one order of magnitude more active in promoting transcription in vitro than h-mtTFB1 (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The physiological role of TFAM in mitochondrial transcription is less clear. Our data show that overexpression of d-TFAM increases mtDNA copy number without increasing mitochondrial transcripts, consistent with the finding of Kitagawa and colleagues (29Goto A. Matsushima Y. Kadowaki T. Kitagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), who showed that deficiency of d-TFAM reduces markedly mtDNA copy number without significant inhibition of mitochondrial transcription in Drosophila cultured cells. One possible explanation for these results is that the endogenous level of d-TFAM is in excess of that needed for mitochondrial transcription but limits mtDNA copy number, such that its residual level upon RNA knock-down is sufficient to support constitutive levels of transcription but is insufficient for mtDNA maintenance. In this regard, recent studies show that the h-TFAM:mtDNA ratio is 1700:1 in human HeLa cells (54Takamatsu C. Umeda S. Ohsato T. Ohno T. Abe Y. Fukuoh A. Shinagawa H. Hamasaki N. Kang D. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), yet it fully activates promoter-specific transcription in the presence of either h-mtTFB1 or B2 in vitro at a level corresponding to a h-TFAM:DNA template ratio of 10–100:1 (15Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). An alternate explanation is that, in Drosophila mitochondrial transcription, d-TFAM does not function together with d-mtTFB2 (or B1), reminiscent of the case in yeast, in which Abf2p (sc-TFAM), which is required for mtDNA stability and packaging (21Fisher R.P. Lisowsky T. Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3358-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Parisi M.A. Xu B. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), is not required for transcription of yeast mtDNA (24Xu B. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In any case, our data suggest differential roles for mtTFB2 and TFAM in mtDNA maintenance, with mtTFB2 regulating the frequency of initiation of replication and TFAM stabilizing and packaging mtDNA via dynamic, histone-like interactions in mitochondrial nucleoids. Clearly, more detailed physiological and biochemical studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription, mtDNA replication, and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Such studies will help to differentiate the functional roles of the three animal mitochondrial transcription factors. We thank Carol Farr for assistance with the figures."
https://openalex.org/W2109878627,"Because adverse effects of glucose were attributed to its increased routing through the hexosamine pathway (HBP), we inquired whether HBP activation affects pancreatic beta-cell survival. Exposure of human islets to high glucose resulted in increased apoptosis of beta-cells upon serum deprivation that was reversed by azaserine. Also, glucosamine, a direct precursor of the downstream product of the HBP, increased human beta-cells apoptosis upon serum deprivation, which was reversed by benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-galactopyranoside (BADGP), an inhibitor of protein O-glycosylation. These results were reproduced in RIN rat beta-cells. Glucosamine treatment resulted in inhibition of tyrosine-phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR), IRS-1, and IRS-2, which was associated with increased O-glycosylation. These changes caused impaired activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt survival signaling that resulted in reduced GSK-3 and FOXO1a inactivation. BADGP reversed the glucosamine-induced reduction in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, GSK-3, and FOXO1a. Impaired FOXO1a inactivation sustained expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, without affecting Bad, Bcl-XL, or Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that hyperglycemia may increase susceptibility to apoptosis of human and rat beta-cell through activation of the HBP. Increased routing of glucose through this metabolic pathway results in impaired activation of the IR/IRSs/PI3-kinase/Akt survival pathway by induction of O-glycosylation of signaling molecules."

The human La protein contains a nuclear localization sequence at the very C-terminal end, and the staining for endogenous La as well as the distribution of GFP-tagged La reveal a predominantly diffuse nuclear staining, although this may appear different under certain conditions or treatments (31Deng J.S.

A regulated, nonhomogeneous nuclear distribution of La may also be predicted from the distinct nuclear distribution of its various RNA interaction partners. For instance, pre-tRNAs are most likely synthesized in the nucleoplasm (38Pombo A. Jackson D.A. Hollinshead M. Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Cook P.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2241-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) but are processed, at least in part, in the nucleolus (39Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 40Wolin S.L. Matera A.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast the La-associated precursor of U3 snoRNA is probably processed in the nucleolar body and nucleolus (20Verheggen C. Lafontaine D.L. Samarsky D. Mouaikel J. Blanchard J.M. Bordonne R. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2736-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, interactions with precursor RNAs in different nuclear compartments implicate a highly dynamic and regulated nuclear distribution of La. Although a nucleolar localization of La has been reported (for review see Ref. 9Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 41-57PubMed Google Scholar), the hLa protein was not identified among the recently resolved protein composition of the nucleolus (41Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Understanding the nuclear distribution of La and its dynamics requires a more detailed knowledge of its functional domains engaged in RNA binding and localization. Thus far it is known that the human La protein contains three RRMs differently involved in the binding of RNAs (for review see Ref. 8Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Two conserved amino acid signatures within the RRMs, referred to as RNP-1 and RNP-2 (RNP consensus sequence), are essential for RNA binding (42Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the RNP-2 of RRM2 in hLa is required for binding of hepatitis B virus RNA (43Horke S. Reumann K.

La interacts with RNA polymerase III products by binding the poly(U) stretch at the 3′-end common to this class of transcripts (44Stefano J.E. Cell. 1984; 36: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or, in the case of the RNA polymerase II product U3 snoRNA, after partial processing exposing a poly(U) stretch (17Kufel J.

Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable to assume that hLa bears such a signal to ensure its interaction with pre-tRNAs, for example, in the nucleolus besides the binding of pre-U3 snoRNA or U6 snRNA in the nucleoplasm. In this report we identified a yet unknown nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in the C-terminal region of hLa, and we show that it functions in a heterologous context. In addition, we demonstrate the accumulation of hLa mutants deficient in interaction with pre-tRNA in vivo in the nucleolus. Based on these and additional data, we propose a model for the dynamic intranuclear distribution of hLa which is consistent with the complex network of functional interactions between La and precursor transcripts occurring in various subnuclear compartments. Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—Expression plasmid pET28a(+)-hLa-Δ2 was described previously (43Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmids described herein were produced with the same strategy. Oligonucleotides used are as follows: for hLa-Δ6.3, 5′-TTG GTC TTC TAT TAT TTT CTT CAG TGC-3′ and 5′-GTA CAG TTT CAG GGC AAG-3′; for hLa-F118A, 5′-GTA AAA AAC AGA TCT GTT TAT ATT AAA GGC GCC CCA ACT GAT GCA ACT C-3′ and 5′-GAG TTG CAT CAG TTG GGG CGC CTT TAA TAT AAA CAG ATC TGT TTT TTA C-3′. For expression of hLa mutants as GFP fusion proteins by a eukaryotic expression vector, the respective hLa DNAs were amplified from the pET28a(+)-hLa plasmids mentioned above via PCR by using the primers 5′-AGA TCT CGAGCTCAA ATG GCT GAA AAT GGT GAT-3′ and 5′-GCT CCC AAGCTT GCC CCG CAA ACA AAA GTC G-3′, containing SacI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. Purified PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the HindIII and SacI linearized vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) by using the rapid ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). Finally, in-frame cloning was controlled by sequencing. For fusion of hLa amino acids 323-354 to the N terminus (hLa-NoLSPTB-GFP) or C terminus (PTB-hLa-NoLS-GFP) of PTB cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector EGFP-N1 ((Clontech), PTB-GFP), the respective hLa sequence was amplified by PCR from the pET-28a(+)-hLa plasmid using the following primers: 5′-CCT ACA CTCGAGGCCACCATG CAA GAA TCC CTA AAC AAA TGG-3′ (containing an XhoI restriction site (underlined), a Kozak sequence (underlined), and a start codon (boldface), respectively) and 5′-CCT ACA AAGCTT TTT TCC TTT ACC AGA CCC AGG-3′ (containing a HindIII restriction site (underlined)), or 5′-CCT ACA GAATTC TAC AAG AAT CCC TAA ACA AAT GG-3′ (containing an EcoRI restriction site (underlined)) and 5′-CCT ACA GTCGAC GCT TTT CCT TTA CCA GAC CCA GG-3′ (containing a SalI restriction site (underlined)). PCR was performed, and purified products were digested with XhoI and HindIII for N-terminal fusion to PTB-GFP cDNA or with EcoRI and SalI for C-terminal fusion and cloned into the linearized, respective PTB-GFP vector. In the case of PTB-hLa-NoLS-GFP an extra alanine or leucine was added for in-frame cloning at both fusion sites. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—His-tagged recombinant WT and hLa mutant proteins were purified and analyzed as described previously (43Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoblot signals were quantified with the Fluor-S MultiImager system (Bio-Rad) to ensure that equal amounts were used in subsequent experiments. For all experiments at least 2 to 3 different protein preparations were used. In Vitro Transcription and UV Cross-linking Assays—DNA templates used for in vitro transcription of pre-tRNAVal were produced by PCR as described previously (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid HtV1 (a kind gift of H. Beier, Institute for Biochemistry, University of Würzburg, Germany (53Arnold G.J. Schmutzler C. Thomann U. van Tol H. Gross H.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) containing the complete tRNAVal sequence served as template, and the primers used for generation of pre-tRNAVal DNA template were 5′-CCATCGATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGT TGG TTT CCG TAG TGT AGT GG-3′ containing a ClaI restriction site (underlined) and the T7-RNA polymerase promotor (boldface), and 5′-AAA GCG ACT CTC TTT GTT TCC-3′. In vitro transcription was performed as mentioned elsewhere (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For UV cross-links, recombinant hLa proteins (amounts as indicated in Fig. 2A) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with excess amounts of 32P-labeled (300,000 cpm) and in vitro transcribed pre-tRNAVal in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ETDA, and 2 μg of poly(rC) (Sigma). Afterward, cross-linking occurred with 0.6 J in a Stratalinker-1800 (Stratagene), followed by RNase A (15 μg) treatment for 20 min at 40 °C, addition of loading buffer, incubation at 60 °C for 5 min, and electrophoretic separation in 12.5% SDS-PAGE. After drying of gels, signals were evaluated by PhosphorImager analysis using a FujiX-BAS 2000 system (Fuji, Germany), provided with the Tina2.0d software (Raytest, Germany). Cell Culture, Transfection Procedures, Immunofluorescence, and Co-immunoprecipitation—4 × 104 Huh7, U2OS, or HeLa cells per well of a 24-well plate were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of GFP plasmids (1 μg each) was performed using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), and subsequent experiments were performed 1 day after transfection. For fixation, cells grown on coverslips were immediately placed on ice, washed twice with chilled PBS buffer (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), incubated 5 min with chilled methanol and 30 s with chilled acetone, and dried at room temperature. After rehydration with PBS buffer, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary monoclonal mouse-α-NOH61 antibody (kindly provided by M. S. Schmidt-Zachmann, Deutsches Krebsforschungzentrum, Heidelberg, Germany (54Zirwes R.F. Eilbracht J. Kneissel S. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1153-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), washed three times for 10 min with PBS buffer, incubated with secondary goat α-mouse rhodamine Alexa-Fluor 594 antibody (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst-staining solution (4 ng/ml, Sigma) for 1 h, washed three times with PBS buffer, and mounted with Mowiol-mounting solution (Calbiochem). Fluorescence images were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with the AxioVision 3.0.6.38 software. For co-immunoprecipitation, 1.7 × 106 293T cells were plated and transfected with GFP-hLa expression plasmids according to Ca2+-phosphate standard procedures. The next day, cells were washed twice with PBS buffer and resolved in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20% protease/inhibitor mix Complete™ (Roche Applied Science), 100 units/ml RNasin (Promega, Germany), 0.4% vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysate was cleared, and 2 mg of cell extract was incubated with 5 μg of the respective antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science) and mouse monoclonal isotype control IgG2a (Dianova, Germany) were used. After addition of 50 μl of protein A-G-agarose+ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mixtures were incubated by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 12 h. Agarose beads were pelleted and washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% deoxycholate, 10% protease/inhibitor mix, 100 units/ml RNasin, 0.4% vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 1 mm dithiothreitol) each with 1 ml and 10 min end-over-end rotation. Pellets were dissolved in SDS loading buffer, electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred, and hLa was visualized with mouse monoclonal α-hLa 3B9. RNA was extracted using TriPure reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions except for the following: (i) pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of lysis buffer and digested with 30 μg of proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 50 °C with addition of 0.1% SDS; (ii) 20 μg of each glycogen (Roche Applied Science) was added for precipitation. RNAs were separated on 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, blotted to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Bioscience), and detected with radioactively end-labeled oligonucleotides (pre-tRNATyr,5′-GGA TGT CTC CTG CTG AGG AAG TAG CTA C-3′; mature tRNATyr, 5′-GGA TGT CTC CTG CTG AGG AAG TAG CTA C-3′). Signals were quantified using a Fuji-X BAS 2000 PhosphorImaging system (Fuji). Note, the estimated transfection efficiency of 293T cells was ∼80% in contrast to ∼15% for HeLa/Huh7 cells because of different cell lines and transfection procedures. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Analysis—HeLa cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells in Lab-Tek double chamber systems (Nunc, Germany) and transfected as mentioned above, and FRAP analysis was performed 1 day after transfection on a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) using the 488 nm laser line of the built-in argon laser (nominal output 65 milliwatts). A time resolution of 657 ms per interval was chosen, and five images were taken before bleaching, followed by a triple bleach pulse at 488 nm in the indicated area and subsequent image collection for at least 30 s. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity detected in a region of interest was normalized to the loss in total fluorescence because of bleaching and imaging as described by others (55Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) using the Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 software. Consistent results were obtained in three independent experiments with at least 10 cells measured for each of the described hLa proteins. Results shown indicate representative experiments. As a control, the temperature was decreased to 24 °C before and during analysis (not shown). RRM2 of Human La Is Essential for RNA Binding—To identify hLa domains required for subnuclear localization, we tested whether its broad RNA binding activity might play a role for its localization. First, we studied by UV cross-linking assays the binding of recombinant wild-type (WT) and mutant hLa (outlined in Fig. 1) to 32P-labeled and in vitro transcribed pre-tRNAVal. The specificity of interaction is demonstrated by much weaker binding of mature tRNA (data not shown); this as well as the analysis of additional hLa mutants will be substantiated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and BIAcore surface plasmon resonance experiments. 2S. Horke, K. Reumann, C. Schulze, F. Grosse, H. Will, and T. Heise, manuscript in preparation. Recently, we have reported (43Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that the RNP-2 consensus sequence of RRM2 is essential for hepatitis B virus RNA binding. Here we tested the ability of this RNP-2 deletion mutant (referred to as hLa-Δ2, Fig. 1A) and of a mutant protein with a single amino acid substitution (referred to as hLa-F118A; Fig. 1A) to bind pre-tRNAValin vitro (Fig. 2A). As expected, incubation of recombinant hLa-WT with labeled pre-tRNAVal followed by UV cross-linking and electrophoretic separation led to a dose-dependent formation of hLa-WT·pre-tRNAVal complexes as shown in Fig. 2A (upper left panel). However, deletion of the RNP-2 motif of RRM2, referred to as hLa-Δ2, revealed that amino acids 113VYIKGF118 are essential for binding to pre-tRNAVal (Fig. 2A, upper right panel). With this mutant, no RNA binding was detectable independent of the amount of protein or the technique used (data not shown). Because aromatic residues are likely to be important for RRM-mediated RNA binding (42Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar), we substituted phenylalanine 118 by alanine and studied the ability of this mutant (hLa-F118A) to bind pre-tRNAValin vitro. As shown in Fig. 2A (lower left panel), this mutation caused a strong decrease in RNA binding activity (∼50% when compared with hLa-WT), indicating that phenylalanine 118 contributes to efficient pre-tRNA recognition. Taken together, we found that RNP-2 of RRM2 is essential for the interaction with RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as pre-tRNAVal. Recently, we have reported that this is also the case for hepatitis B virus RNA (43Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34949-34958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a RNA polymerase II transcript, indicative of the general importance of RRM2 for RNA binding of human La. Human La Defective in RNA Binding Accumulates in Nucleoli—We have identified hLa mutants with complete or partially reduced RNA binding activity in vitro. To study the cellular localization of those hLa mutants, we cloned EGFP fusion proteins, referred to as GFP-hLa-WT, GFP-hLa-Δ2, and GFP-hLa-F118A. To show no interference of the GFP tag in RNA binding and to confirm the in vitro binding results, we first performed co-immunoprecipitations, thereby analyzing the RNA binding capability of the respective GFP-hLa proteins in vivo. Hence, the eukaryotic expression plasmids were transiently transfected, and anti-GFP antibodies were used for co-immunoprecipitations. Specific GFP-hLa precipitation was confirmed by immunoblotting using La-specific antibodies (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and co-precipitated pre-tRNAs were detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Our results indicate an efficient and specific GFP-hLa immunoprecipitation without detectable contaminations by endogenous hLa and, most important, that GFP-hLa is capable of pre-tRNA binding, because pre-tRNATyr (as well as processing intermediates thereof) but not mature tRNATyr can be co-precipitated as would be expected for endogenous hLa. Concerning the hLa mutants, this experiment revealed that GFP-hLa-WT but not GFP-hLa-Δ2.0 was associated with pre-tRNATyrin vivo, thereby reflecting the results obtained in UV cross-links. These data signify that deletion of the RNP-2 motif abolishes the interaction of hLa with pre-tRNATyr and point out the importance of RRM2 in hLa for pre-tRNA binding in vivo. In the case of co-immunoprecipitations with hLa-Δ2 or IgG control, where virtually no RNA was precipitated signal intensities of pre-tRNAs in supernatants were unexpectedly weaker than those in starting material and probably result from minor degradation during the experiment. Next, the subcellular localization of hLa mutants GFP-hLa-WT, GFP-hLa-Δ2, and GFP-hLa-F118A were analyzed in human cell lines Huh7, HeLa, or U2OS by transient transfection and fluorescence microscopy. The GFP-hLa-WT signal was compared with immunostained endogenous hLa in nontransfected cells. In both cases a diffuse and a minor granular nuclear distribution pattern was obtained for all three cell lines (representatively shown for HuH7 cells, Fig. 3A). Of note, to reduce the risk of artifacts caused by overexpression, we chose cells with low expression levels of GFP fusion proteins; however, we observed comparable phenotypes (see below) in all cases. We conclude that the nuclear distribution of endogenous hLa is indistinguishable from exogenously overexpressed GFP-hLa fusion protein. In order to analyze the effect of RNA binding activity of La on its cellular localization, distribution of GFP-hLa-Δ2 and GFP-hLa-F118A was monitored. Merging the GFP-hLa-Δ2 and GFP-hLa-F118A signals with that of nucleolus specific NOH61 revealed that both mutants accumulate in nucleoli (Fig. 3B). To show that ongoing transcription has no detectable effect on the subnuclear distribution of hLa, we treated GFP-hLa-WT transfected cells with actinomycin D (2.5 and 5 μg per ml) for up to 8 h. No change in the distribution of the GFP-hLa proteins within the nucleus compared with nontreated cells was observed (data not shown). In addition to the prominent nucleolar localization, GFP-hLa-Δ2 and GFP-hLa-F118A were to a minor extent visible in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B), which might indicate that RNA binding contributes to an efficient nuclear import (or retention) of hLa. We conclude from these data that hLa mutants with a reduced or lacking pre-tRNA binding activity in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2, A and B) accumulate or are retained in the nucleolus, which argues for a role of the RNA binding competence of hLa for maintenance of the predominant nuclear diffuse distribution pattern. Identification of the NoLS of hLa—The C-terminal part of La contains the following functional motifs: a proposed dimerization domain (43Horke S. Reumann K. Rang A. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem."

Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform 1 performs the crucial last step modification in the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate. This enzyme transfers the sulfuryl group (SO3) from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to the 3-OH position of a glucosamine residue to form the 3-O-sulfo glucosamine, a structural motif critical for binding of heparan sulfate to antithrombin. In this study, we report the crystal structure of 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform 1 at 2.5-Å resolution in a binary complex with 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate. This structure reveals residues critical for 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate binding and suggests residues required for the binding of heparan sulfate. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis analyses suggest that residues Arg-67, Lys-68, Arg-72, Glu-90, His-92, Asp-95, Lys-123, and Arg-276 are essential for enzymatic activity. Among these essential amino acid residues, we find that residues Arg-67, Arg-72, His-92, and Asp-95 are conserved in heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferases but not in heparan N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, suggesting a role for these residues in conferring substrate specificity.

It has diverse roles in development, assisting viral infections, and homeostasis (1Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 2Rosenberg R.D. Showrak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin.

HS is a highly sulfated polysaccharide consisting of 1-4-linked sulfated glucosamine and sulfated glucuronic/iduronic acid residues. The specific sequences of sulfated saccharide in HS determine its various functions. Synthesis of biologically active HS is accomplished through a complex biosynthetic pathway. HS is initially synthesized as a copolymer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylated glucosamine by d-glucuronyl and N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase followed by various modifications in the Golgi apparatus (4Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). These modifications include N-deacetylation and N-sulfonation of glucosamine, C5 epimerization of glucuronic acid to form iduronic acid residues, and 2-O-sulfonation of iduronic and glucuronic acid residues as well as 6-O-sulfonation and 3-O-sulfonation of the glucosamine units. The stepwise sulfonation reactions are illustrated in Fig. 1. All of the enzymes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of HS have been cloned and characterized (5Kuberan B. Lech M.Z. Beeler D.L. Wu Z.L. Rosenberg R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The blood coagulation pathway is composed of a cascade of proteolytic reactions ultimately generating fibrin thrombi. The proanticoagulant activity of this cascade is balanced by several natural anticoagulant mechanisms. Binding of HS to antithrombin (AT) represents the most important of these mechanisms. HS achieves its anticoagulant activity by interacting with AT, which undergoes a conformation change, generating the active form of AT to inhibit blood coagulation factors Xa and thrombin. This anticoagulant process prevents the formation of deleterious blood clots. Heparin, a specialized HS found in mast cells, is the most commonly used anticoagulant drug. Anticoagulant HS and heparin contain structurally defined AT binding pentasaccharide sequences with the structure, -GlcNS(or Ac)6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S- (GlcUA is glucuronic, and IdoUA is iduronic acid) (Fig. 1) (6Atha D.H. Lormeau J.-C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The 3-O-sulfo glucosamine unit (GlcNS3S±6S) in this binding site is essential for interaction with AT. The lack of a 3-O-sulfo group in this unit decreases AT binding affinity by 18,000-fold (6Atha D.H. Lormeau J.-C. Petitou M. Rosenberg R.D. Choay J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A recently approved anticoagulant drug, Arixtra, prepared by organic synthesis is based on this pentasaccharide scaffold. The recently reported enzymatic synthesis of a similar pentasaccharide utilizes 3-OST-1 in the last modification step (5Kuberan B. Lech M.Z. Beeler D.L. Wu Z.L. Rosenberg R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1343-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and opens up a new approach to preparation of such anticoagulants. The essential physiological role of 3-O-sulfo HS (or anticoagulant HS) in blood coagulation is best demonstrated through the study of AT and AT mutants. A severe thrombosis phenotype is observed in mice carrying an AT mutant defective in heparin binding, suggesting a key role for HS-AT interaction in balancing procoagulant and anticoagulant activities in vivo (7Dewerchin M. Herault J.-P. Wallays G. Petitou M. Schaeffer P. Millet L. Weitz J.I. Moons L. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Herbert J.-M. Cir. Res. 2003; 93: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additionally, patients with AT mutants defective in heparin and HS binding suffer from thrombosis (8Koide T. Odani S. Takahashi K. Ono T. Sakuragawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9van Boven H.H. Lane D.A. Semin. Hematol. 1997; 34: 188-204PubMed Google Scholar, 10Boyer C. Wolf M. Vedrenne J. Meyer D. Larrieu M.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 56: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that complete ablation of AT-HS binding is required to reveal the full physiological role of anticoagulant HS in vivo (11Weitz J.I. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 952-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The final step in the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS can be catalyzed by either 3-OST-1 or 3-OST-5 isoforms (12Liu J.

Gene redundancy in the biosynthesis of anticoagulant HS helps to explain why 3-OST-1 knockout mice failed to exhibit a prothrombotic phenotype (14HajMohammadi S. Enjyoji K. Princivalle M. Christi P.

Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) is present in at least six different isoforms that have unique expression patterns in human tissues (15Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. Taniguchi N. Fukuda M.

The amino acid sequences of the different isoforms have 50-80% homology in their sulfotransferase domains (15Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. Taniguchi N. Fukuda M. Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Their Related Genes. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2002: 475-483Google Scholar). These different 3-OST isoforms transfer sulfuryl groups to the 3-OH position of glucosamine units residing within the context of different saccharide sequences. As a result, the HS products generated by these different isoforms exhibit unique and distinctive biological activities. It is known that HS modified by 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-5 display anticoagulant activity, whereas HS modified by 3-OST-3 and 3-OST-5 serve as entry receptors for herpes simplex virus-1 (12Liu J.

The structural features of 3-OST isoforms that dictate substrate specificity are currently unknown. The sulfotransferase family can be organized into two categories based on the sub-cellular localizations; they are cytosolic and Golgi sulfotransferases (18Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13117-13126Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of different sulfotransferases reveal structural similarity in their PAPS binding sites between the cytosolic and Golgi sulfotransferases, suggesting that different sulfotransferases probably follow similar mechanisms in the transfer of the sulfuryl group even though they exhibit high selectivity in substrate binding (20Kakuta Y.

The structures of a number of cytosolic sulfotransferases complexed with acceptor substrates have been solved, providing clues that have led to a better understanding of their catalytic mechanism and mode of substrate recognition (22Kakuta Y.

The crystal structure of the binary complex of the sulfotransferase domain of the HS N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NST-1) and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) was solved by Kakuta et al. (21Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This represents the first and only structure of a HS sulfotransferase previously determined. In this study, we report the crystal structure of a binary complex of mouse 3-OST-1 and PAP. The structure of this enzyme is very similar to NST-1 but with unique structural features in the HS binding cleft. Results from mutational analysis of amino acid residues at and around the active site in 3-OST-1 reveal a series of amino acid residues that is critical for sulfotransferase activity. These results, when combined with a structural alignment to NST-1 and sequence alignments to other isoforms of 3-OST, provide insight into the role certain residues may play in catalysis and dictating substrate specificity for these HS sulfotransferases. Materials—Full-length mouse 3-OST-1 cDNA (m3-OST-1-pcDNA3) was purified from a mouse L-cell cDNA library (25Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). [35S]PAPS was prepared by incubating 0.4-2 mCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (carrier-free, MP Biomedical) and 16 mm ATP with 5 mg/ml dialyzed yeast extract (Sigma) (26Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HS from bovine kidney was purchased from MP Biomedical (Irvine, CA). PAP was purchased from Sigma. Preparation of 3-OST-1 Bacterial Expression Plasmid (b3-OST-1-pET28)—The cDNA fragment encoding the catalytic domain of 3-OST-1 (G48-H311) was amplified from m3-OST-1-pcDNA3 with a 5′ overhang containing an NdeI site and a 3′ overhang containing an EcoRI site. This construct was inserted into the pET28a vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites to produce a His6-tagged protein. The resultant plasmid (b3-OST-1-pET28) was sequenced to confirm the reading frame and the lack of mutations within the coding region (University of North Carolina, DNA sequencing core facility). The plasmid, b3-OST-1-pET28, was transformed into BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene) for the expression of 3-OST-1. Protein Expression and Purification—Cells containing the b3-OST-1-pET28 were grown in 12 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks containing 1 liter of LB media with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. When the A600 reached 0.6-0.8, the temperature was lowered to 22 °C for 15 min. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the cells were allowed to shake overnight. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 120 ml of sonication buffer, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted by sonication then spun down. The supernatant was applied to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) in batch and washed with sonication buffer. The resin was loaded onto a column, and the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient from 10 to 250 mm. The protein was dialyzed then concentrated to 16 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 4 mm PAP. A total of 28 mg of protein was obtained. Protein Crystallization and Structure Solution—Crystals of 3-OST-1 were grown using the hanging drop method at 4 °C by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution with 2 μl of the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m citrate, pH 5.5, and 11% polyethylene glycol 4000. Before data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing 0.1 m citrate, pH 5.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m NaCl, 4 mm PAP, and 12.5% ethylene glycol. The crystals were mounted in a loop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at -180 °C on a RaxisIV area detector for the low resolution data set. A high resolution data set was collected on another crystal at the Advanced Photon Source on SERCAT beamline 22 using a MAR225 area detector. Both data sets were processed using HKL2000 (Table I) (27Otwinowski Z. Minor V. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). A model of NST-1 (21Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) consisting of residues 603-632, 642-664, 670-736, 744-868, and PAP was used as a search molecule for molecular replacement using Molrep in CCP4 with the low resolution data set (28Bailey S.

The positions of two (A and B) of the three final molecules in the asymmetric unit were found by molecular replacement. These two molecules were refined in CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

At this point, sparse electron density became visible for the third molecule (C). A copy of molecule A was manually inserted into the density and refined. Density for molecule C was very poor, and the B-factors were very high, so refinement was carried out using non-crystallographic restraints between the third molecule and the first molecule. Residues for molecule C, which contained no electron density, were deleted. Refinement of molecule C dropped the Rfree to 31%. The final model was obtained by iterative cycles of model building and refinement of the three molecules against the high resolution data set. The final molecule contains residues 54-311 for molecule A and B and 54-269 and 281-311 for molecule C.Table ICrystallographic data statisticsData set3-OST-1 (high)3-OST-1 (low)Unit cell dimensionsa = b = 300.14 c = 84.20a = b = 298.69 c = 83.82α = β = γ = 90°α = β = γ = 90°Space groupI4 (1) 22I4 (1) 22No. of observations741,873180,101Unique reflections63,92843,945Rsym (%) (last shell)aRsym=∑(|Ii−⟨I⟩|)/∑(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the Ith observation, and ⟨I⟩ is the mean intensity of the reflection.11.6 (37.1)13.7 (61.5)I/σI (last shell)7.4 (1.7)6.7 (1.4)Mosaicity0.410.62Completeness (%) (last shell)96.7 (83.6)93.9 (82.4)Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)25.0-2.525.0-2.8Rcryst (%)bRcryst=∑||Fo|−|Fo||∑|Fo| calculated from working data set.24.3Rfree (%)cRfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinement.26.4No. of water178Mean B value (Å)58.3For:Complex AComplex BComplex CProtein43.0639.17100.69PAP31.2333.1869.76Root mean square deviation from ideal valuesdRamachandran results were determined by MolProbity.Bond length (Å)0.009Bond angle (°)1.4Dihedral angle (°)22.4Improper angle (°)0.95Ramachandran statistics94.57% residues are in favored (98%) regions99.74% residues are in allowed (>99.8%) regionseTwo residues from complex C, which lie outside this region, are in allowed regions based on PROCHECK (28).a Rsym=∑(|Ii−⟨I⟩|)/∑(Ii) where Ii is the intensity of the Ith observation, and ⟨I⟩ is the mean intensity of the reflection.b Rcryst=∑||Fo|−|Fo||∑|Fo| calculated from working data set.c Rfree was calculated from 5% of data randomly chosen not to be included in refinement.d Ramachandran results were determined by MolProbity.e Two residues from complex C, which lie outside this region, are in allowed regions based on PROCHECK (28Bailey S.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of 3-OST-1 Mutant Plasmids—A total of 28 point mutants of 3-OST-1 were prepared using b3-OST-1-pET28 as the template and the Gene Tailor site-directed mutagenesis kit from Invitrogen. The lengths and sequences of the primers for preparation of those mutants were designed based on the manufacturer's protocol for this mutagenesis kit and were synthesized by Invitrogen. The resultant constructs were sequenced to confirm the anticipated mutation (University of North Carolina, DNA sequencing core facility). Expression and Purification of 3-OST-1 Mutants—The expression plasmids for various 3-OST-1 mutants were transformed individually into BL21(DE3)RIL cells (Stratagene). Each mutant construct was grown in 100 ml of LB broth and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described above. The bacteria cells were harvested and solubilized in sonication buffer before sonication. The lysate was subjected to a 400-μl nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (0.75 × 1 cm) followed by a 5-ml of wash with sonication buffer. Mutant proteins were eluted with 1 ml of elution buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Approximately 25 μl of the eluent was subjected to the analysis on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), and the gel was stained by Coomassie Blue. The expression level of the mutant protein was estimated by determining the intensity of the Coomassie-stained protein band near 30 kDa. As a positive control, we expressed wild type 3-OST-1 (b3-OST-1-pET28) along with the mutants. The expression levels and the sulfotransferase activity of mutant proteins were normalized to those of wild type protein. Several clones harboring mutant proteins, including R67E, K68A, R72E, E90Q, K123A, and R276A, were grown in 2-4-liter cultures to obtain sufficient amounts of protein for analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Procedures for expression and purification of these mutants were essentially identical to those for the wild type 3-OST-1. Mutant protein was purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, and purity was estimated to be greater than 80% by a 16.5% Tris-Tricine PAGE gel. Determination of the Sulfotransferase Activity—Sulfotransferase activity was determined by incubating ∼5 μl (10-100 ng) of purified mutant or wild type 3-OST-1 proteins with 10 μg of HS (from bovine kidney, ICN) and 5-10 × 104 cpm of [35S]PAPS (∼10 μm) in 50 μl of buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2,5mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by the addition of 6 m urea and 100 mm EDTA. The sample was then subjected to a 200-μl DEAE-Sepharose chromatography to purify the [35S]HS. The quantity of [35S]HS was then determined by liquid scintillation counting. The negative control contained all the components with the exception of 3-OST-1 proteins. Determination of the Binding of AT and 3-O-Sulfated HS—Approximately 5 × 106 cpm of [35S]HS was incubated with 5 μg of human AT (Cutter Biological) in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm dextran sulfate, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.0004% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. 60 μl of 1:1 slurry of pretreated concanavalin A-Sepharose (from Sigma) was added, and the reaction was agitated for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The gel was washed three times with the buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Mn2+, 1 mm Mg2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm dextran sulfate, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.0004% Triton X-100, and the bound [35S]HS was eluted with the same buffer containing 1000 mm NaCl. ITC—ITC was performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC. Solutions were cooled to 10 °C and degassed under vacuum before use. Experiments were conducted using 17-21 μm protein in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl at 10 °C. Titrations were performed by injecting 5 μl of 4 mm PAP in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Data analysis was completed using Origin software. Determination of PAP Binding Affinity Using PAP Chromatography—To determine the binding affinity of the wild type and mutant proteins to PAP, 3′,5′-ADP-agarose chromatography (Sigma) was used. Approximately 200 μg of proteins, including wild type 3-OST-1, K68A, H92F, and D95N and R276A, in 5 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl was loaded onto a 3′,5′-ADP-agarose column (7 × 52 mm) pre-equilibrated with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Unbound material was removed by washing with 5 ml of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 100 mm to 1 m in 10 ml. The samples from the collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Overall Fold—The catalytic domain of mouse 3-OST-1 (G48-H311) was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The catalytic domain has higher solubility than the full-length protein, making it more amenable to crystallization. The 3-OST-1 protein crystallized in the space group I4122 with 3 protein molecules (A, B, and C) in the asymmetric unit. Each molecule of 3-OST-1 contains one molecule of PAP bound. Two of the protein molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit stack together, forming hollow channels with the long dimension running parallel to the c axis of the unit cell. The rim of the channel is composed of 4 molecules of both A and B. The hollow inner solvent channel has a diameter of ∼62 Å. The third molecule (C) is involved in cross-linking these channels by interacting with molecules B and a molecule C coming from another channel. This packing arrangement creates a cell with an overall solvent content of 76% and a Matthews coefficient of 5.5 (32Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar). Molecules A and B are well ordered and have similar overall B-factors (Table I). Molecule C, however, is highly disordered, with overall B-factors ∼2.5 times greater than molecules A and B, suggesting it may bind in slightly different orientations or have only partial occupancy in the crystal lattice. Because molecule C is highly disordered, the discussion of the structure will focus on molecules A and B. The crystal structure of the 3-OST-1·PAP complex (Fig. 2a)is roughly spherical and contains a large open cleft. The structure is centered around an α/β motif common to all sulfotransferases (18Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This motif consists of a five-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked on both sides by α helices. At the heart of the fold is a strand-loop-helix motif (Thr-61-Ser-79) consisting of the first β-strand (The-61-Ile-64) and the first α-helix (Thr-71-Ser-79), which contains the phosphosulfate binding (PSB) loop (Gly-65-Gly-70) (22Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This loop is very similar in structure to the P-loop found in protein kinases and forms extensive interactions with the 5′-phosphate of the PAP (Fig. 2b). As in other sulfotransferases, the helix that runs across the top of the PAP binding pocket and into the open cleft is also present. The C-terminal portion of the enzyme consists of a short three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Strands 2 and 3 of this sheet are stabilized by a disulfide bond (Cys-260-Cys-269). A coil consisting of residues 270-281 connects this sheet to the C-terminal helix. This coil practically buries the PAP molecule in the active site and may be susceptible to a conformational change since it is ordered in molecules A and B and there is no electron density visible for it in molecule C. The overall fold of 3-OST-1 is most similar to that of the sulfotransferase domain of NST-1 (21Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). The root mean square of 230 structurally equivalent Cαs is 1.3 Å, as determined by the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). All of the significant secondary structural features are conserved between the two enzymes. The major differences occur in the loop regions as described below. PAP Binding Site—A number of hydrogen-bonding interactions are involved in positioning the PAP molecule within the active site (Fig. 2b). Side chains from residues Lys-68 and Thr-71 of the PSB loop and Lys-274 of the coil that buries the PAP both form interactions with the 5′-phosphate (Table II). In addition, backbone amide nitrogens from the PSB loop (Gly-70, Thr-71, and Arg-72) are also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the 5′-phosphate. Although there are no protein interactions with the ribose ring, atom N6 of the adenosine base is"

It has also been demonstrated that this multimerization is likely due to PDZ domain-interacting partners. Here we demonstrate that although CFTR in vitro can self-associate into multimers, which depends on PDZ-based interactions, this may not be the case in cell membrane. Using chemical cross-linking, we demonstrated that CFTR exists as a higher order complex in cell membrane. However, this higher order complex is predominantly CFTR dimers, and the PDZ-interacting partners (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1) and NHERF2) constitute ∼2% of this complex. Interestingly solubilizing membrane expressing CFTR in detergents such as Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, deoxycholate, and SDS tended to destabilize the CFTR dimers and dissociate them into monomeric form. The dimerization of CFTR was tightly regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation and did not depend on the active form of the channel. In addition, the dimerization was not influenced by either the PDZ motif or its interacting partners (NHERF1 and NHERF2). We also demonstrated that other signaling-related proteins such as Gβ and syntaxin 1A can be in this higher order complex of CFTR as well.

Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M. Iannuzi M. Collins F.S. Tsui L-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Google Scholar). An elegant functional study using electrophysiological measurements to identify microdomains under the apical membrane that transmit the signaling of CFTR via the adenosine receptor has been reported by Huang et al. (3Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Google Scholar) who have demonstrated that signaling elements compartmentalized at both extracellular and intracellular surfaces of apical cell membrane activate apical CFTR-dependent Cl- conductance in airway epithelial cells. We recently have shown that β2 adrenergic receptor interacts with CFTR via Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF1, also called EBP50; Ref. 4Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Google Scholar) through their PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) motifs, forming a macromolecular complex present at the apical surface of airway epithelial cells (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). Deleting the PDZ motif from CFTR uncouples the channel from β2 adrenergic receptor both physically and functionally, and this uncoupling is specific to β2 adrenergic receptor and does not affect CFTR coupling to other receptors (e.g. adenosine receptor pathway) (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the assembly of the complex is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation, and deleting the regulatory domain of CFTR abolishes cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulation of the complex assembly (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). Using co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking, Zhu et al. (6Zhu T. Dahan D. Evagelidis A. Zheng S.-X. Luo J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29102-29107Google Scholar) reported that type 2C protein phosphatase is closely associated with CFTR in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably expressing CFTR, suggesting that CFTR and type 2C protein phosphatase co-exist in a stable regulatory complex. The metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase was found to interact directly with CFTR in vitro as well as in vivo (7Hallows K.R. Raghuram V. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1711-1721Google Scholar, 8Hallows K.R. Kobinger G.P. Wilson J.M. Witters L.A. Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1297-C1308Google Scholar). Controversy remains regarding the quaternary structure of CFTR Cl- channel at the apical surface of epithelial cells. Marshall et al. (9Marshall J. Fang S. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C.R. Ferrara D. Amara J.F. Hoppe IV, H. Scheule R.K. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2987-2995Google Scholar) concluded that CFTR exists primarily as a monomer in membrane since co-expressed full-length and C-terminal truncated forms of CFTR could not be co-immunoprecipitated in detergent-solubilized extract (Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, digitonin, or CHAPSO). Using sucrose gradient centrifugation and co-expression of different epitope-tagged CFTR or wild-type and ΔF508 CFTR, Riordan's group (10Chen J.H. Chang X.B. Aleksandrov A.A. Riordan J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 55-71Google Scholar) demonstrated that CFTR polypeptide was a monomer in detergent-solubilized extract as well (Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, or SDS), while more and more compelling evidences suggest the existence of dimeric CFTR in plasma membrane (11Eskandari S.

The cross-sectional area of the freeze-fracture particles corresponding to the area of the transmembrane domains of the recombinant CFTR in Xenopus oocytes showed that CFTR particle area corresponded more closely to 24 than to 12 packed helices, suggesting that CFTR channel may be dimeric in the membrane (11Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Google Scholar). A heterodimer consisting of a wild-type CFTR and a mutant CFTR (ΔR-CFTR) showed mixed gating properties of the wild-type and the mutant CFTR channels, implying that two CFTR molecules interact to form a single conductance pore for chloride ions (12Zerhusen B. Zhao J. Xie J. Davis P.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7627-7630Google Scholar). A study by Raghuram et al. (13Raghuram V. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Google Scholar) suggested that CFTR channel is a homodimer of CFTR molecules containing two PDZ domain binding sites whose gating is regulated by bivalent NHERF PDZ domains through cross-linking the C-terminal tails of the dimeric CFTR polypeptides. Recently, using gel filtration, non-dissociative gel electrophoresis, and chemical cross-linking, Ramjeesingh et al. (14Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.-J. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10700-10706Google Scholar, 15Ramjeesingh M. Kidd J.F. Huan L.J. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 793-797Google Scholar) reported that monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric CFTRs can be detected in Sf9 insect cells, and dimeric CFTR exists in the plasma membrane in mammalian cells. In our present work, using a series of biochemical techniques, we focused on CFTR on native cell membrane. We found that, although CFTR can self-associate into multimers in a PDZ-based interaction-dependent manner, it exists as a dimer in native membrane and can be dissociated into a monomer upon solubilization of the membrane with detergents (e.g. Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40). The PDZ-interacting partners NHERF1 and NHERF2 (also called E3KARP, SIP-1, or TKA-1; Ref. 16Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Google Scholar) contribute ∼2% to this CFTR dimer-dominant complex, and this dimerization is PDZ motif-independent and channel activity-insensitive but cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation-dependent. Our study also showed that other proteins (such as G-protein β subunit (Gβ) and syntaxin 1A) can be associated with CFTR and may function in an integrated and regulatory pattern in the highly compartmentalized microdomains in the apical surface of epithelial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—Calu-3 cells (serous gland epithelial cells) and COS-7 cells (African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Calu-3 cells were cultured as described previously (17Tabcharani J.A. Low W. Elie D. Hanrahan J.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 157-164Google Scholar). COS-7 cells and HT29-CL19A cells (human colonic epithelial origin) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. BHK cells stably expressing CFTR (BHK-CFTR) and C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged CFTR (BHK-CFTRHis10) were grown as described previously (6Zhu T. Dahan D. Evagelidis A. Zheng S.-X. Luo J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29102-29107Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instruction (for transfection of β2 adrenergic receptor, NHERF1, ΔTRL-CFTR, and HA-tagged CFTR). BHK-CFTR or BHK-CFTRHis10 cells were transiently transfected with syntaxin 1A ΔC (deletion of the C-terminal membrane anchor) using a vaccinia virus expression system (18Naren A.P. Quick M.W. Collawn J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Google Scholar). Antibodies and Reagents—CFTR monoclonal antibodies R1104 mAb recognizing the regulatory domain of CFTR (epitope at amino acids 722-734), GA1 mAb (amino acids 1440-1460), and NBD-R (amino acids 521-828) polyclonal antibody have been described previously (19Naren A.P. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 175-186Google Scholar). Anti-CFTR IgG MM13-4 was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-NHERF1, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and BIR repeat containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Affinity-purified anti-syntaxin 1A IgG (14D8) has been described previously (20Naren A.P. Di A. Cormet-Boyaka E. Boyaka P.N. McGhee J.R. Zhou W. Akagawa K. Fujiwara T. Thome U. Engelhardt J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 377-386Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Gβ IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-NHERF2 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Emanuel Strehler (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Ref. 21DeMarco S.J. Chicka M.C. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10506-10511Google Scholar). HA-tagged CFTR cDNA (pIRES2-EGFP-HA-CFTR) was a kind gift from Dr. David Gadsby (Rockefeller University). cpt-cAMP, forskolin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine were from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Irvine, CA). N-[2-((p-Bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, 2HCl (H89) and diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) were from Calbiochem. Biotin-XX-hydrazide, sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and cross-linkers were obtained from Pierce. Cross-linkers used in the present study were: dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; spacer arm, 12.0 Å; membrane-permeable, cleavable by thiols), 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB; spacer arm, 3.0 Å; membrane-permeable, not cleavable by thiols), disuccinimidyl tartarate (spacer arm, 6.4 Å; membrane-permeable, cleavable by periodate), dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobis(propionimidate) (DTBP; spacer arm, 11.9 Å; membrane-impermeable; cleavable by thiols), 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP; spacer arm, 12.0 Å; membrane-impermeable; cleavable by thiols), and ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS; spacer arm, 16.1 Å; membrane-permeable; cleavable by hydroxylamine). CFTR Multimer Assembly—This assay was performed by using maltose-binding protein (MBP)-CFTR-C-tail fusion protein (0-1 μm) immobilized on amylose beads (20 μl) and incubated with NHERF1 or NHERF2 (either with glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag or cleavage of the GST portion with thrombin). This step, which is called pairwise binding, was done in 200 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and mixed at 22 °C for 60 min. For pairwise binding, the protein was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blot using anti-NHERF1 or anti-NHERF2 antibodies. For multimer assembly assay, the complex was washed once with the same buffer and allowed to bind CFTR or CFTRHis10 from BHK cell lysates. The binding was done at 4 °C for 3 h with constant mixing. The complex was washed twice with lysis buffer, and the amylose beads were eluted with sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting using R1104 mouse monoclonal CFTR antibody. Pull-down Assay—The pull-down assay was performed as described before (19Naren A.P. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 175-186Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 (unless otherwise stated) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After 16,000 × g centrifugation of cell lysates, and GST or GST fusion proteins (e.g. NHERF1, NHERF2, or syntaxin 1A ΔC) were added to aliquots of the supernatants. 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% slurry in H2O) were added after mixing for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was rotated for another 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with the same lysis buffer, the proteins were eluted from beads with sample buffer (containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). Eluates were separated on a 4-15% gel and immunoblotted with anti-CFTR (R1104), anti-Gβ, or anti-syntaxin 1A (14D8) antibodies. Chemical Cross-linking of CFTR Polypeptides—Cells (Calu-3 or BHK) were washed three times with prewarmed (37 °C) PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-C/M). The cells were incubated with prewarmed, freshly made cross-linkers in PBS-C/M at 37 °C. Stocks were freshly prepared in Me2SO for cell-permeable cross-linkers and in PBS-C/M for cell-impermeable cross-linkers. Control cells were treated with prewarmed PBS-C/M (no cross-linkers). The reaction was stopped by incubating cells with chilled Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) for 1 min on ice. Cells were washed with PBS-C/M twice for 2 min each and then lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) or PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 supplemented with the protease inhibitors. For quantitation of CFTR and NHERF1 protein levels, Calu-3 cells were cross-linked with 1 mm DSP as above, lysed in RIPA buffer, and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with anti-NBD-R IgG. The immunoprecipitated complex was treated with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (βME) to dissociate the cross-linked complex and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Purified CFTRHis10 was used as a standard to quantitate CFTR, and GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 was used as a standard to quantitate the co-immunoprecipitated NHERF1 as described previously (20Naren A.P. Di A. Cormet-Boyaka E. Boyaka P.N. McGhee J.R. Zhou W. Akagawa K. Fujiwara T. Thome U. Engelhardt J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 377-386Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were cross-linked with DSP or DFDNB for 10 min at 37 °C and then lysed with RIPA buffer (+protease inhibitors) on ice for 20 min. The cell lysates were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce). For co-immunoprecipitation, CFTR polyclonal antibody (anti-NBD-R IgG, 1.0 μg) was cross-linked to 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described before (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). The supernatant was incubated and mixed with the cross-linked beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer before the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with sample buffer containing 2.5% β-ME. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated on a 4-15% gel and blotted using monoclonal NHERF1 antibody. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% gel for cross-linking experiments, 4-15% gel for other experiments), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted for CFTR, NHERF1, NHERF2, Gβ, syntaxin 1A, or HA tag using specific antibodies in combination with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Colocalization and Quantitation of CFTR and NHERF1—Fully polarized monolayers of Calu-3 cells were cross-linked with 1.0 mm DSP at 37 °C for 10 min. Next the cells were biotinylated apically by using 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at 4 °C for 30 min as described before (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). Monolayers from 12 permeable supports (24-mm diameter) were scraped off and homogenized, and the plasma membrane was separated on a sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation as described below (see “Preparation of Plasma Membrane and Other Subcellular Fractions”). Streptavidin-agarose beads (100 μl) were used to capture the biotinylated membranes, and the membranes were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-NBD-R IgG. The immunoprecipitated complex was treated with 2.5% βME to dissociate the cross-linked complex and resolved be 10% SDS-PAGE. The relative amount of CFTR and NHERF1 in the biotinylated plasma membrane was estimated using purified CFTRHis10 and GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 as standards as described above. Purification of Cross-linked His-tagged CFTR and HA-tagged CFTR—BHK-CFTRHis10 cells were incubated with 1 mm DSP for 10 min at 37 °C and lysed in RIPA buffer. CFTRHis10 was purified using 50 μl of Talon beads (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from beads with 100 mm imidazole containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using R1104 antibody. For purification of co-expressed His-tagged and HA-tagged CFTR, BHK-CFTRHis10 and BHK parental cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged CFTR as described previously (5Naren A.P. Cobb B. Li C. Roy K. Nelson D. Heda G.D. Liao J. Kirk K.L. Sorscher E.J. Hanrahan J. Clancy J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 342-346Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, purified using Talon beads, and eluted with imidazole as above. The eluted protein was resolved on a 5% gel and immunoblotted with anti-HA tag antibody. Cross-linking and Biotinylation of Cell Surface CFTR—Calu-3 cells were cross-linked with 1 mm DSP or DFDNB as described above. Cell surface biotinylation of glycoproteins was performed as described previously (22Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Google Scholar). Briefly, after cross-linking, the cells were incubated with 10 mm sodium m-periodate in PBS-C/M at 4 °C in the dark for 60 min. After two washings with PBS-C/M and one wash with 100 mm sodium acetate containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (NaAc-C/M, pH 5.5), cells were surface-biotinylated with 0.5 mg/ml biotin-XX-hydrazide (in NaAc-C/M) at 4 °C in the dark for another 60 min. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS-C/M and lysed in RIPA buffer. CFTR was immunoprecipitated using anti-NBD-R IgG and subjected to 5% SDS-PAGE. The blot was first probed using streptavidin-HRP (0.2 μg/ml), and the same blot was stripped and reprobed for CFTR (R1104). Velocity Gradient Centrifugation—Sucrose gradient sedimentation was performed according to published protocols (10Chen J.H. Chang X.B. Aleksandrov A.A. Riordan J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 188: 55-71Google Scholar). Briefly Calu-3 cells were incubated with or without prewarmed 1 mm DSP or DFDNB in PBS-C/M at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were scraped into homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture) and then subjected to 20 strokes in a tight fitting Pyrex homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged first at 6500 × g for 5 min, and microsomal membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were solubilized in 1 ml of PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 or RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and mixed for 10 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of membrane extract was layered on top of an 11-ml linear, continuous 10-36% sucrose gradient containing the respective detergent buffers. The sucrose gradient was formed by a gradient former (Bio-Rad) and layered from the bottom to the top using a peristaltic pump (Amersham Biosciences). Following centrifugation at 260,000 × g in an SW41 Ti rotor for 12 h, 24 500-μl fractions were collected from the bottom, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with CFTR monoclonal antibody R1104. The sedimentation of molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), and equine myoglobin (17 kDa) was performed as above after dilution in 1 ml of PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 or RIPA buffer. 24 500-μl fractions were collected, resolved by 4-15% SDS-PAGE, and stained with GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Pierce). The sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined by a handheld 0-10° Brix refractometer (Fisher) after a 1:3 sample dilution. Preparation of Plasma Membrane and Other Subcellular Fractions—Plasma membrane and other subcellular fractions were prepared according to methods described previously (23Inoue G. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14919-14924Google Scholar). In brief, cells were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), applied on a 1.16 m sucrose cushion in buffer B, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Plasma membrane appeared as a white band on top of the cushion that was diluted in buffer B and pelleted at 16,000 × g and resuspended in buffer A. Supernatant of post-16,000 × g homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in buffer A, and the 200,000 × g supernatant was considered the cytosolic fraction. Short Circuit Current Measurements—Calu-3 and HT29-CL19A polarized cell monolayers were grown to confluency on Costar Transwell permeable supports. Filters were cross-linked with 0.5 mm DSP and then mounted in an Ussing chamber, and short circuit current measurement was carried out as described previously (24Smith J.J. Karp P.H. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 307-311Google Scholar). Epithelia were bathed in Ringer's solution (basolateral: 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.36 mm K2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2, [Cl-] = 149 mm), and low Cl- Ringer's solution (apical: 133.3 mm sodium gluconate, 5 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mm NaCl, 0.36 mm K2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm mannitol, pH 7.2, [Cl-] = 14.8 mm) at 37 °C, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Bio-Rad). Briefly Calu-3 cells were cross-linked with 1 mm DSP as above followed by lysis with RIPA buffer. CFTR was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-CFTR antibody (MM13-4) or normal mouse IgG immobilized on Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) through constant mixing at 4 °C overnight. 7-cm immobilized pH gradient strips were rehydrated with 150 μl of CFTR proteins extracted with Sequential Extraction Reagent II (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10) supplemented with 2 mm tri-butyl phosphine at 20 °C for 12-16 h. Isoelectric focusing was performed at 20 °C in an isoelectric focusing tray using the following program: 250 V for 15 min, linear ramp, S3 = 4000 V until 20,000 V-h were reached. The strips were equilibrated for 10 min in a solution containing 6 m urea, 3% SDS, 375 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) dithiothreitol. A second equilibration step was carried out for another 10 min in the same solution containing 3% (w/v) iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol. The proteins in the strip were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with affinity-purified anti-Gβ IgG or anti-syntaxin 1A IgG (14D8). A molecular marker gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain reagent (Pierce), and images were acquired and analyzed with Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Other Methods and Data Analysis—Iodide efflux was performed as described before (25Chang X.B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

Curve generation was carried out using Origin software (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). CFTR Can Form a PDZ Domain-dependent Multimer in Vitro—Several groups using electrophysiological techniques have suggested that the active form of CFTR Cl- channel is a multimer and that multimerization is due largely to PDZ domain-interacting proteins (13Raghuram V.

https://openalex.org/W2047412274,"Peptide vaccines able to induce high affinity and protective neutralizing antibodies must rely in part on the design of antigenic epitopes that mimic the three-dimensional structure of the corresponding region in the native protein. We describe the design, structural characterization, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential of antibodies elicited by conformational peptides derived from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) gp21 envelope glycoprotein spanning residues 347–374. We used a novel template design and a unique synthetic approach to construct two peptides (WCCR2T and CCR2T) that would each assemble into a triple helical coiled coil conformation mimicking the gp21 crystal structure. The peptide B-cell epitopes were grafted onto the ϵ side chains of three lysyl residues on a template backbone construct consisting of the sequence acetyl-XGKGKGKGCONH2 (where X represents the tetanus toxoid promiscuous T cell epitope (TT) sequence 580–599). Leucine substitutions were introduced at the a and d positions of the CCR2T sequence to maximize helical character and stability as shown by circular dichroism and guanidinium hydrochloride studies. Serum from an HTLV-1-infected patient was able to recognize the selected epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mice immunized with the wild-type sequence (WCCR2T) and the mutant sequence (CCR2T) elicited high antibody titers that were capable of recognizing the native protein as shown by flow cytometry and whole virus ELISA. Sera and purified antibodies from immunized mice were able to reduce the formation of syncytia induced by the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-1, suggesting that antibodies directed against the coiled coil region of gp21 are capable of disrupting cell-cell fusion.

Our results indicate that these peptides represent potential candidates for use in a peptide vaccine against HTLV-1. The efficacy of potential peptide vaccines for bacterial, parasitic, and viral diseases as well as cancer depends partly on the induction of broadly protective, high affinity neutralizing antibody responses. Such responses rely on the design of epitopes able to mimic the three-dimensional structure of the respective B cell epitope in the native protein as well as the activation of the helper T cell component of the immune response. Over the last several years, our laboratory has conceptualized and implemented several approaches to engineer conformational epitopes in tandem with a chimeric strategy to deliver potential vaccine candidates. The design involves selecting surface-oriented antigenic epitopes that display certain secondary structural attributes (α-helix, β-turn, and loop) that are then linked to a “promiscuous” T-helper cell epitope via a four-residue turn sequence (GPSL). These chimeric peptides allow independent folding of the B-cell and T-cell epitope and are very effective in overcoming major histocompatibility complex restriction in various strains of mice and in eliciting high titered and high affinity antibody responses (1Frangione-Beebe M.

Additionally, the incorporation of a promiscuous T-helper epitope was effective in generating the required “help” for the induction of antigen specific antibodies without the problems associated with coupling peptides to carrier proteins. Furthermore, to construct epitopes in various defined orientations and conformations, a novel single-matrix multicomponent template strategy was developed previously (3Kaumaya P.T.P. Kobs-Conrad S.

In this approach, a core β-sheet template consisting of alternating Gly/Lys is synthesized such that the ϵ side chains of the lysine residues allow for the growth of individual epitopes in varying permutations.

Gazdar A.F. Bunn P.A. Minna J.D. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7415-7419Google Scholar) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (11Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Google Scholar). It has also been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases, including pediatric infectious dermatitis (12Lagrenade L. Hanchard B. Fletcher V. Cranston B. Blattner W. Lancet. 1990; 336: 1345-1347Google Scholar), uveitis (13Mochizuki M. Yamaguchi K. Takatsuki K. Watanabe T. Mori S. Tajima K. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1110Google Scholar), and some cases of arthropathy (14Ijichi S. Matsuda T. Maruyama I. Izumihara T. Kojima K. Niimura T. Maruyama Y. Sonoda S. Yoshida A. Osame M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1990; 49: 718-721Google Scholar) and polymyositis (15Morgan O. Rodgers-Johnson P. Mora C. Char G. Lancet. 1989; ii: 1184-1186Google Scholar). HTLV-1 transmission occurs mainly via fusion between infected Env-expressing cells and receptor-bearing cells because infection by cell-free HTLV-1 virus is inefficient in vitro and in vivo. The HTLV-1 envelope proteins expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells and on viral particles are the first to be recognized by the host in the course of a natural immune response (16Palker T.J.

Cancer. 1983; 32: 321-328Google Scholar). Several studies have focused on linear and conformational immunodominant regions of the surface-exposed glycoprotein subunit to elicit neutralizing antibody responses against HTLV-1 for the purpose of vaccine development and diagnostic screening (18Baba E.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 399-412Google Scholar). However, there has been far less focus on the gp21 transmembrane (TM) subunit. Recent data has shown that the transmembrane gp21 domain plays a critical role in the postbinding steps during infection that is required for the viral core to be delivered into the target cell cytoplasm (27Rosenberg A.R. Delamarre L. Pique C. Pham D. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7180-7186Google Scholar). Peptides derived from the gp21 region encompassing amino acids 361–430 showed specific reactivity to sera from HTLV-1-infected individuals (28Hadlock K.G. Goh C.J. Bradshaw P.A. Perkins S. Lo J. Kaplan J.E. Khabbaz R. Foung S.K. Blood. 1995; 86: 1392-1399Google Scholar). Likewise, later studies with overlapping synthetic peptides revealed the importance of amino acids 400–429 in inhibiting the formation of syncytia between infected cells (29Sagara Y. Inoue Y. Shiraki H. Jinno A. Hoshino H. Maeda Y. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1564-1569Google Scholar). There is little structural homology between the surface-exposed subunits of various retroviral envelope proteins. However, the TM subunits of retroviruses display remarkable homology with conserved spatial conformations (30Pancino G. Ellerbrok H. Sitbon M. Sonigo P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 188: 77-105Google Scholar). In general, they can be divided into an N-terminal hydrophobic fusion peptide, an adjacent leucine zipper-like motif that is capable of self-assembly into a coiled coil, and a disulfide-bonded region followed by a C-terminal region that contains α-helical segments. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail regions are located at the C terminus. The recently solved crystal structure of the central segment of the HTLV-1 transmembrane subunit as a chimera with maltose-binding protein shows that the HTLV-1 TM does not deviate from the conserved spatial organization and general organization (31Kobe B. Center R.J. Kemp B.E. Poumbourios P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4319-4324Google Scholar). The gp46 subunit is believed to be responsible for the recognition of the cellular receptor. After receptor recognition, conformational changes in the transmembrane region exposes the fusion peptide, which brings the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity, allowing fusion to occur. Fusion is required for the introduction of the viral core into the cytoplasm of target cells. Although there is limited information regarding the precise mechanism of envelope-mediated fusion and the role of the TM glycoproteins, their critical role in the fusion process is suggested by their similarity in sequence and structure (32Rosenberg A.R. Delamarre L. Preira A. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7609-7614Google Scholar). Mutational studies have defined certain regions such as the coiled coil segment and the disulfide-bonded region of chain reversal C-terminal to the coiled coil segment as being critically involved during the later stages of the fusion process after receptor binding (27Rosenberg A.R. Delamarre L. Pique C. Pham D. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7180-7186Google Scholar, 33Maerz A.L. Center R.J. Kemp B.E. Kobe B. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6614-6621Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that a rationally designed vaccine consisting of B-cell epitopes derived from these important regions of the TM subunit should elicit antibodies that could interfere with the fusion process by binding to the relevant region on the envelope glycoprotein. We focused on a B-cell epitope derived from the central coiled coil region for our studies that is critical for fusion. This report describes the structural characterization and immunogenicity studies of peptides derived from the central region of the TM subunit (residues 347–374) that required a new template design and a different synthetic approach to synthesize a peptide that would assemble into a triple helical coiled coil conformation mimicking the gp21 solved crystal structure. The rationale for this design was to constrict the three strands at one end and also to bring them in close proximity to promote interactions between the hydrophobic residues at the a and d positions to form a trimeric coiled coil. Leucine substitutions at the a and d positions of the heptad repeat were also made to maximize hydrophobic interactions between these residues that would potentiate the triple helical coiled-coil formation. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements of the mutated coiled coil peptide revealed a stable α-helical structure that was concentration-independent. The wild type peptide, on the other hand, was less helical under similar conditions. Serum of a HTLV-1-infected patient was able to recognize the selected epitopes by ELISA. Both peptides were highly immunogenic in outbred mice. Antibodies against both peptides were able to cross-react with the native envelope protein as determined by ELISA with the recombinant gp21 protein. Both peptides were shown to induce high antibody titers, which were capable of recognizing the native protein as shown by Flow cytometry and whole virus ELISA. Furthermore, antibodies to the leucine-substituted peptide bound with higher affinity to the native whole viral protein, indicating that the peptide folds in the native conformation. Competition experiments using various peptides as inhibitors revealed that antibodies against the leucine-substituted template peptide were highly specific to the conformation of the immunogen. Sera and purified antibodies from mice immunized with either peptide immunogen were able to reduce the formation of syncytia induced by the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-1. These results indicate that these two peptides represent potential candidates for future multivalent vaccine studies. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Template peptides were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis after Fmoc chemistry with benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole as a coupling reagent on a fully automated peptide synthesizer (Model 9600 Peptide Synthesizer MilliGen/Biosearch) as described previously (9Kobs-Conrad S. Lee H. DiGeorge A.M. Kaumaya P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25285-25295Google Scholar) with modifications. The template peptide backbone (GKGKGKG) (Fig. 1) with the Lys side chains protected (ivDde) was assembled on Rink-Amide-CLEAR Resin (substitution 0.41 mmol of amino groups/g (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) using Fmoc-Lys(ivDde) (Bachem, Torrance, CA)). The N terminus of the template peptide was acetylated using acetylimidazole (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) in N,N-dimethylformamide. The Lys side chain deprotection (ivDde) was achieved using 2% hydrazine hydrate in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 and 10 min, positive Kaiser test). The gp21 (residues 347–374) peptides were assembled on the template using the peptide synthesis protocol described above and acetylated at N terminus. The peptides were cleaved from support using Reagent R. The crude peptides were purified by semipreparative reversed phase HPLC using a C-4 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Analytical HPLC was performed using a Vydac column and a linear gradient of 90% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The identities of the peptides were confirmed by electrospray ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism measurements were performed on an AVIV model 62A DS CD instrument (Lakewood, NJ). All spectral measurements were obtained at 25 °C under continuous nitrogen purging of the sample chamber using a quartz cuvette of 0.1-cm path length. Spectral measurements of the peptides were obtained over a range of concentrations (25–100 μm) in water or in 50% trifluoroethanol (TFE). Water or 50% TFE blanks were subtracted from the CD spectra. Molar ellipticity values were calculated using the formula [θ]M,λ = (θ × 100 × Mr)/(n × c × λ), where θ is the recorded ellipticity (deg), Mr is the molecular weight of the peptide, n is the number of amino acid residues in peptide, c is the peptide concentration (mg/ml), and λ is the path length of the cuvette (34Kaumaya P.T.P. Berndt K. Heindorn D. Trewhella J. Kezd F.J. Goldberg E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 13-23Google Scholar). Helicity of the peptides was calculated according to the Chen equation (35Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Google Scholar), with reference to the mean residue ellipticity of polylysine for 100% α-helix (θ)222 nm = –33,000. Guanidinium Hydrochloride Denaturation—The structural stability of the synthesized coiled coil template peptides was determined by chemical denaturation experiments using guanidinium hydrochloride (GnHCl) as described previously (36Causton A.S. Sherman J.C. J. Pept. Sci. 2002; 8: 275-282Google Scholar). Peptide concentration was maintained at 50 μm, and the concentration of GnHCl was increased from 0 to 13 m in water. The ellipticity of the peptide was then measured at 222 nm, similar to that described above. Ellipticity was then normalized to the fraction folded by using the equation: ffolded = (θobserved – θunfolded)/(θfolded – θunfolded) (37Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Google Scholar). Animal Immunizations—Six-eight-week-old female ICR outbred mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Groups of 8–9 mice were immunized separately with 100 μg of peptide dissolved in water with 100 μg of a muramyl dipeptide adjuvant (N-acetylglucosamine-3 yl-acetyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine nor-MDP) and emulsified (50:50) in Squalene/Arlacel A oil (4:1) as described elsewhere (38Jones W.R. Bradley J. Judd S.J. Denholm E.H. Ing R.M. Mueller U.W. Powell J. Griffin P.D. Stevens V.C. Lancet. 1988; 1: 1295-1298Google Scholar). Booster immunizations were administered at 3, 6, and 9 weeks. Mice were bled retro-orbitally every week for antibody titer determination. Sera collected were complement-inactivated by heating at 56 °C for 30 min. High titrated sera were purified on a protein A/G-agarose column (Pierce), and eluted antibodies were concentrated and exchanged in PBS using 100-kDa cutoff centrifuge filter units (Millipore). Antibody concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). ELISA—Antibody titers were determined using ELISA as previously described (8Kaumaya P.T. VanBuskirk A.M. Goldberg E. Pierce S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6338-6346Google Scholar). Titers were defined as the highest dilution of sera with an absorbance greater than 0.2 after subtracting the background. All data represent the average of duplicate samples. Direct ELISA with HTLV-1-infected Patient Serum—Plates were coated with peptide immunogens and B-cell epitopes as described for direct ELISA. HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic patient serum was used as a primary antibody beginning with a 1:50 dilution. After a 2-h incubation, a 1:500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human secondary antibody was added (Pierce). Substrate development was preformed as described for the direct ELISA protocol. Competitive ELISA—Plates were coated with peptide/antigen and blocked as described for the direct ELISA. Primary antibody was added as 50 μl of a constant dilution (50% maximal binding as determined by ELISA) with 50 μl of a serially diluted competitive inhibitor, with concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 μm. Positive inhibitors were peptide/antigen for which the antibodies were specific. Inhibitor and antiserum were incubated for 2 h. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG addition and color development were performed as described for the direct ELISA protocol. Whole Virus ELISA—Reactivity of peptide antisera to native HTLV-1 whole viral lysate was determined using whole virus ELISA. A Vironostika HTLV-I/II Microelisa assay (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, modified for mouse serum. Antibody dilutions used were 1/100 for immune and preimmune negative control serum. A 1/2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgG (0.8 mg/ml) secondary antibody was used. Plates were read at 450 nm, and the data are represented as absorbance units. Cell Lines—HTLV-1-infected T-cell line ACH (39Kimata J.T. Wong F.H. Wang J.J. Ratner L. Virology. 1994; 204: 656-664Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For the ACH cells, 5% human interleukin 2 was also added to the culture medium. HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells were cultivated in the same medium described above but without interleukin-2 and supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. HeLa-Tat cells containing the human immunodeficiency virus Tat transactivator gene (a kind gift from C. Pique) previously described in (40Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Google Scholar) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. CosZ28 cells stably transfected with the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat promoter (a kind gift from C. Pique) and previously described by Dragic et al. (40Dragic T. Charneau P. Clavel F. Alizon M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4794-4802Google Scholar) were cultivated in same medium as HeLa-Tat cells, complemented with 300 μg/ml hygromycin. Flow Cytometry—Binding of peptide antibodies to HTLV-1 ACH-infected cells was tested by flow cytometry as adopted from Hudziak et al. (41Hudziak R.M. Lewis G.D. Winget M. Fendly B.M. Shepard H.M. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1165-1172Google Scholar). 0.5 × 106 cells were incubated with a 15 dilution of the peptide antibodies. The same dilution of preimmune serum was used as a negative control. HTLV-1-infected rabbit serum was used as a positive control. The cells were stained with primary antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C in 100 μl of PBS, 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and stained by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:50 dilution) for 45 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, then fixed in PBS, 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by coulter ELITE flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). A total of 10,000 gated events were collected, and final processing was performed. Debris, cell clusters, and dead cells were gated out by light scatter assessment before single parameter histograms were drawn. Syncytia Inhibition Assay—A β-galactosidase assay was used for the quantitative evaluation of syncytia formation. A three-cell line-based protocol modified from Kazanji et al. (42Kazanji M. Moreau J.P. Mahieux R. Bonnemains B. Bomford R. Gessain A. de The G. Virology. 1997; 231: 258-266Google Scholar), Blanchard et al. (43Blanchard S. Astier-Gin T. Tallet B. Moynet D. Londos-Gagliardi D. Guillemain B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9369-9376Google Scholar), and Delamarre et al. (44Delamarre L. Rosenberg A.R. Pique C. Pham D. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 259-266Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, in 24-well plates 5 × 104 MT-2 cells were incubated in 300 μl of MT-2 culture medium (containing a 1:50 dilution of donor herd horse serum (Invitrogen)) with 4-fold serial dilutions of mouse antisera and HTLV-1 asymptomatic patient sera beginning with 1:50 or three dilutions of purified antibody solution (250, 60, 1 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After incubation, 5 × 104 CosZ28 and 5 × 104 HeLa-Tat cells were added to each well in 600 μlof HeLa-Tat culture medium, bringing the final volume to 0.9 ml/well. All sera and purified antibody dilutions were preformed in triplicate. Plates were then incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed once with PBS, and β-galactosidase production was detected using the Galactolight® kit (Tropix) as described by Delamarre et al. (44Delamarre L. Rosenberg A.R. Pique C. Pham D. Dokhelar M.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 259-266Google Scholar). 90 μlof lysis buffer, as provided in the kit, was used to harvest the cells, and 20 μl of lysate per well was added to 96-well chemiluminescent detection plates (Costar) in triplicate and incubated for 30 min with substrate (as per the manufacturer's instructions). Plates were read using a Lmax® luminometer (Molecular Devices). After the injection of 100 μl/well of accelerator, plates were read for 10 s after a 2-s delay. The % of syncytia inhibition was defined as (luminescence of positive control wells without experimental sera – luminescence of experimental wells with sera)/(luminescence of positive control wells without sera) × 100. Positive control wells contained MT-2, CosZ28, and HeLa-Tat cells in the absence of experimental antibodies. The syncytia inhibition (ID50) titer was defined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution, resulting in a 50% or greater reduction of syncytia formation as compared with the positive control wells. Sera from HTLV-1-seropositive individuals were used as positive controls for the syncytia inhibition assay. Sera from HTLV-1 patients were titered using the gelatin-particle agglutination assay (Serodia HTLV-1 kit, Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Engineering of Template Peptides to Mimic Coiled Coil Conformation—It has been previously shown that the minimum peptide length for stable formation of a coiled coil was 29 residues (45Lau S.Y. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Google Scholar), which corresponds to ∼4 heptads with 7 residues/heptad. Coiled coils are usually made up of heptad (abcdefg) repeats that are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the a and d positions in the different strands (46Hodges R.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 133-154Google Scholar, 47Hodges R.S. Saund A.K. Chong P.C. St-Pierre S.A. Reid R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1214-1224Google Scholar). The HTLV-1 coiled coil segment consists of amino acids 340–392. We selected the region between amino acids 347 and 374, which spans the central region of the coiled coil and has four potential heptad repeats. To increase the proximity of the three peptide strands such that they interact with one another to form a coiled coil, the peptides were synthesized simultaneously through the ϵ-NH2 side chains of 3 lysyl residues separated by intervening glycine residues as depicted in Fig. 1. The three strands were each acetylated at the N terminus to limit charge repulsions between each strand. A promiscuous T-helper epitope derived from the tetanus toxoid protein (residues 580–599) was also synthesized colinear with the template backbone sequence at the N terminus. First, we synthesized the wild type sequence 347–374 designated WCCR2T. Additionally, another template construct designated CCR2T was designed with five substitutions at the a and d positions (V349L, I353L, I360L, N363L, and I370L). The ra"
https://openalex.org/W1998085149,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is caused by mutation of polycystin-1 or polycystin-2. Polycystin-2 is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel. Polycystin-1 is an integral membrane protein of less defined function. The N-terminal extracellular region of polycystin-1 contains potential motifs for protein and carbohydrate interaction. We now report that expression of polycystin-1 alone in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in PKD2-null cells can confer Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation currents. Co-expression of a loss-of-function mutant of polycystin-2 in CHO cells does not reduce polycystin-1-dependent channel activity. A polycystin-1 mutant lacking ∼2900 amino acids of the extracellular region is targeted to the cell surface but does not produce current. Extracellular application of antibodies against the immunoglobulin-like PKD domains reduces polycystin-1-dependent current. These results support the hypothesis that polycystin-1 is a surface membrane receptor that transduces the signal via changes in ionic currents.
https://openalex.org/W2127473413,"Pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Abeta is derived from the Abeta peptide precursor protein (APP) by gamma- and beta-secretases, the latter known as beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1, or herein BACE). We have also described potentially important regions in the promoter of BACE, which may regulate its activity (1). Herein, we have functionally dissected the regulatory regions within the BACE promoter into areas containing positive and negative regulatory elements. The 4.1 kb promoter region (-3765/+364, +1 being the transcription start site [TSS]) includes positive regulatory element in the -2975 to -2062 region flanked on either side by negative regulatory elements at -3764/-2975 and -2062/-1056. This is separated from the minimal promoter and 5' UTR by a neutral region of roughly 700 base pairs (bp). A 91 bp fragment (224/314) is the shortest region with a significant reporter gene activity and constitutes the minimal promoter element for BACE. Neuronal preference of the promoter was apparent in the 141 bp fragment (224/364) that contained the 91 bp fragment. Gel shift results also suggest the strongest signal of DNA-protein interaction with the 91 bp fragment in neuronal nuclear extracts. This interaction was strongly blocked by an activator protein (AP)2 binding oligomer. Super gel shift assays suggest that both the AP2-binding oligomer and the 91 bp fragment interfered with each other's binding capacity. An AP2 sequence is predicted to occur within the 91 bp fragment. We also found stimulating protein (SP)1-binding sites in this region of the promoter. Thus, functional and gel shift analysis indicate that the 91 bp fragment containing the AP2 and SP1 binding sites constitutes the core promoter region of BACE. Changes in the activity of this region could play an important role in regulating BACE activity in neurons."

Furthermore, as a result of this and previous work we have identified a new sub-family of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily recognizable by a specific amino acid motif outside of the Nudix box. We have been studying a superfamily of enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety, x. These “Nudix” hydrolases (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Google Scholar) are widely distributed in nature with representatives in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, archaea, viruses, and at least one mycoplasm. The identifying feature of the superfamily is a pattern of nine highly conserved amino acids called the Nudix box, embedded in a sequence of 23 amino acids, GX5EX7REUXEEXGUScheme 1 in which U is a hydrophobic amino acid, usually Ile, Leu, or Val, and X may be any amino acid. To date, more than 1800 open reading frames from over 360 species have been uncovered by BLAST searches (2Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) of the sequenced genomes, data banks, and expressed sequence tags. On the basis of their specificities, the individual members of the superfamily may be assigned to subfamilies active on various nucleoside triphosphates, nucleotide sugars, coenzymes such as NADH, FAD, or CoA, cell signaling molecules, e.g. dinucleoside polyphosphates, and toxic metabolites such as ADP-ribose and mutagenic and toxic nucleotides. The number of Nudix hydrolase genes varies widely among species, and there is presently neither a predictor nor algorithm foretelling how many of these genes might be expected in a given organism. In Table I, the number of Nudix genes, ascertained by examining open reading frames, is compared by genome size. Deinococcus radiodurans, the most radiation-resistant organism known, attracted our attention, because at that time it had the largest number of Nudix hydrolase genes of any organism, almost twice that of Escherichia coli, although D. radiodurans has a smaller genome. We cloned all 21 genes of D. radiodurans and expressed and partially characterized several interesting new enzymes of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily (3Xu W.-L. Shen J.-Y. Dunn C.A. Desai S.

Sixteen of these genes have been identified with enzymatic activities, including one not described previously. Furthermore, a new subfamily of Nudix hydrolases active on UDP-sugars has been recognized as a result of this work. The expression plasmids pET-24a(+) and pET-24d(+) (Kmr) and E. coli HMS174(DE3) were from Novagen (Madison WI), and the plasmid pGroESL, containing the E. coli groEL and groES genes, a T7 lac promoter and a chloramphenicol resistance gene, was a gift from George H. Lorimer (DuPont). The genomic DNA of B. cereus strain 14579 was from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, and restriction enzymes, kits for the polymerase chain reaction, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Substrates and common biochemicals were from Sigma or Invitrogen. The reagent for protein assays was from Bio-Rad. Cloning of the Nudix Genes of B. cereus into pET Expression Vectors—The genes were amplified from genomic DNA using DNA polymerase chain reaction. An NdeI or NcoI and a BamHI or HindIII site was incorporated at the start and the end of each gene according to the gene expression requirement and the restriction map of each gene, respectively. The amplified genes were purified, digested with corresponding enzymes, and ligated into pET-24 vectors placing the Nudix genes under the transcriptional control of the T7 lac promoter. The resultant plasmids were transformed into HMS174(DE3), the transformants were screened for the gene of interest, and the inserts were sequenced at the automatic sequencing facility of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The transformed strains containing each of the cloned genes were stored at -80 °C in 30% glycerol until further use. Expression of the Nudix Proteins—10 μl of a saturated culture of each of the transformed Nudix hydrolase expression strains was inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium containing suitable antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker to an A600 of 0.3. The cultures were transferred to 22 °C and grown to an A600 of 0.8 after which isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside stock solution was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were cultured for an additional 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed by suspension in isotonic saline, recentrifuged, suspended in 1.0 ml of TED (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol), and disrupted by sonication. The sonicate was centrifuged, the supernatant adjusted to ∼0.4 mg of protein/ml with TED containing 10% glycerol, and the extracts were stored at -80 °C until assayed. Enzyme Assays—The standard reaction mixture contained in 50 μl: 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.5, 5 mm Mg2+ or Mn2+, 2 mm substrate, 0.5 unit of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase for phosphatase-sensitive substrates such as deoxynucleoside triphosphates or 3 units of alkaline phosphatase for phosphatase resistant substrates, and 2 μl (about 0.8 μg) of each extract. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then stopped by the addition of EDTA or Norit, and the liberated inorganic orthophosphate was assayed by the colorimetric procedure of Fiske and Subbarow (7Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar) as modified by Ames and Dubin (8Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min. Cloning and Expression of the Genes—Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the 26 Nudix hydrolases of B. cereus in the region of their Nudix boxes. All of the inserted genes expressed proteins well, except for entry 10, NP_832475. Of the 25 expressed proteins, 21 were soluble as determined by their appearance in the supernatant of a low speed centrifugation. We transformed the four constructs producing insoluble proteins into a host over-expressing the chaperones GroES and GroEL, because we have had previous success in solubilizing intractable proteins by this procedure (9Conyers G.B. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1203-1206Google Scholar, 10Xu W.-L. Dunn C. Bessman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 753-758Google Scholar, 11Gaywee J. Xu W.-L. Radulovic S. Bessman M.J. Azad A.F. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 179-185Google Scholar). Fig. 2 represents SDS-PAGE of the soluble proteins in crude extracts of the expressed genes. New bands not present in the control extract are evident in all lanes except lane 10, and the molecular mass of all of the proteins ranged between 15 and 25 kDa, typical of members of the Nudix superfamily and agreeing well with their calculated values. The strong bands seen in lanes 14, 17, 19, and 26 are GroEL (58 kDa), and the new bands at about 24 kDa in these lanes represent chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the selection agent for the plasmid, pGroESL. No new proteins correlating with the size of the respective inserts were observed, and therefore expressing in the presence of excess chaperones was not effective in these cases. Thus, only 21 of the 26 genes expressed proteins suitable for further analysis.Fig. 2An SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (10-20%) of the 26 expressed proteins of B. cereus. Approximately 10 μg of soluble protein from each of the crude extracts, prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was applied to the gel.

Lanes marked C refer to control extracts from expressed cells transformed with pET-24 containing no insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of Enzymatic Activities—A major goal of our work with the Nudix hydrolase superfamily is to discover new members with different enzymatic activities. Because all Nudix hydrolases identified thus far catalyze the hydrolysis of a diverse series of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, our modus operandi is to assay each new candidate on an extensive collection of these compounds. In this way, we have identified more than 30 substrates. When this tactic was applied to the expressed proteins of B. cereus, 16 of them were found to hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphate derivatives; Table II shows the favored substrates of those enzymes. Fifteen had activities on compounds we had seen with other members of the super-family. However, number 6 (NP_831800) was unique, being highly active on cytidine diphosphate choline, a metabolite not recognized by any of the Nudix hydrolases described thus far. As an intermediate in phospholipid synthesis and catabolism, this compound is characteristic of that category of Nudix hydrolase substrates involved in intermediary metabolism. The kinetics, substrate specificity, metal requirements, etc., as well as the physical properties of this enzyme will be described after it is purified to homogeneity. 1W.-L. Xu, C. R. Jones, and M. J. Bessman, unpublished work. An unusual structural feature of the protein, as seen in Fig. 1, is the substitution of tyrosine for glutamic acid at position 9 and lysine for arginine at position 15. 2Because there is considerable variation in the position of the Nudix box in respect to the N terminus of individual members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it has become awkward to use the standard numbering system to specify amino acids within the conserved Nudix sequence when discussing different proteins. We suggest numbering the signature sequence separately and consecutively from 1 to 23 as follows: GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU. Amino acids in the Nudix box could then be designated as Gly-1N, X-5N, Glu-7N, Arg-15N, etc., and an amino acid substitution by alanine, for example, would be designated as G1NA, X5NA, E7NA, etc., according to standard conventions. Although rare, we have occasionally seen other examples of R15NK, but this is the first example of an active Nudix hydrolase with a substitution at Glu-7N. The “Nudix fold,” characterized by a loop-helix-loop motif, seen in all Nudix hydrolase structures determined so far is stabilized by a salt bridge between Glu-7N and Arg-15N (12Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. 2001; 8: 467-472Google Scholar). This interaction is not possible in the Y7NK variant, but it may be partially compensated for by the weaker hydrogen bond permissible between these amino acids.Table IIPrimary screening of the activities of the Nudix hydrolases of B. cereus Open table in a new tab It should be emphasized that the numerical values for the specific activities recorded in Table II are qualitative and are useful only for the identification of substrates. They should not be compared with each other, because the assays were performed on crude extracts having different levels of expression, and the actual catalytic constants, kcat, for each of the substrates will have to be measured with the purified proteins under optimal assay conditions for each enzyme. Comparison with B. anthracis—As noted in the Introduction, one of the objectives of this research was to shed light on the large number of Nudix hydrolase genes in the closely related organism, B. anthracis. Fig. 3 lists the 26 open reading frames of B. cereus alongside the orthologous, or cognate, members of B. anthracis. These pairings represent the best sequence alignments as determined by a CLUSTAL analysis (13Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar) of the individual open reading frames for each organism. The amino acid content of each entry is listed in parentheses. Many were identical in size, and most were within 90% of each other in amino acid sequence. It is highly likely that the enzyme activities we found for the B. cereus enzymes will be matched when/if the orthologous proteins in B. anthracis are examined. It is worth noting that NP_832447 (Fig. 3, entry 9) was annotated by the sequencing group (6Ivanova N.S.A. Anderson I. Galleron N. Candelon B. Kapatral V. Bhattacharyya A. Reznik G. Mikhailova N. Lapidus A. Chu L. Mazur M. Goltsman E. Larsen N. D'Souza M. Walunas T. Grechkin Y. Pusch G. Haselkorn R. Fonstein M. Ehrlich S.D. Overbeek R. Kyrpides N. Nature. 2003; 423: 87-91Google Scholar) as an open reading frame containing 185 amino acids. Using primers designed from their nucleotide sequence, we obtained a product of our polymerase chain reaction with the expected size, but the expressed protein was considerably shorter than the 185 amino acids reported. On further examination, we found one nucleotide difference in our sequence resulting in a frameshift that generated a stop codon 147 amino acids from the N terminus. We confirmed this result using an entirely new construct. Another sequenced strain of B. cereus (ATCC 10907) indicates that the homologous open reading frame contains 147 amino acids and the orthologous protein from B. anthracis, NP_656560, is 85% identical in amino acid sequence and is also 147 amino acids long. Thus it seems highly likely that the sequence reported for our strain (ATCC 14579) contains an insertion of one nucleotide resulting in the loss of the stop codon. Recognition of a New Subfamily of Nudix Hydrolases—Besides discovering new substrates for members of the superfamily, another goal is predicting the function of unidentified Nudix proteins from their amino acid sequences. All of the proteins have the same highly conserved signature sequence, the Nudix box (Scheme 1), representing the catalytic and nucleotide-binding site of the enzyme (12Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. 2001; 8: 467-472Google Scholar, 14Bullions L.C. Studies on the MutT Enzyme from E. coli and S. pneumoniae. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD1993Google Scholar, 15Lin J. Abeygunarwardana C. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1199-1211Google Scholar). Therefore, the different specificities toward the respective substrates must lie in a region or regions distal to this area. By aligning the sequences of different enzymes with similar specificities, we have identified specific landmarks outside the Nudix box, enabling us to classify some of the members of the superfamily into discrete subfamilies (16Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Google Scholar, 17Xu W.-L. Shen J-Y. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37492-37496Google Scholar). This contribution to “functional genomics” has been especially valuable to us and others, because we have been able to predict the enzymatic activity of unknown, newly discovered open reading frames of Nudix genes involved in physiological processes by recognizing specific telltale amino acid patterns peculiar to each subfamily. In this study, we found that five of the expressed proteins were UDP-sugar hydrolases. In previous work with D. radiodurans (3Xu W.-L. Shen J.-Y. Dunn C.A. Desai S. Bessman M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 286-290Google Scholar), we discovered three other Nudix hydrolases with this specificity. When the amino acid sequences of these eight enzymes were aligned, a distinct pattern emerged with a highly conserved NGD sequence downstream of the Nudix box and a conserved glycine at position 6N. 2Because there is considerable variation in the position of the Nudix box in respect to the N terminus of individual members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it has become awkward to use the standard numbering system to specify amino acids within the conserved Nudix sequence when discussing different proteins. We suggest numbering the signature sequence separately and consecutively from 1 to 23 as follows: GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU. Amino acids in the Nudix box could then be designated as Gly-1N, X-5N, Glu-7N, Arg-15N, etc., and an amino acid substitution by alanine, for example, would be designated as G1NA, X5NA, E7NA, etc., according to standard conventions.Fig. 4 shows an alignment of these eight proteins with 30 more candidates uncovered in a BLAST search. The checked (√) entries are those proteins assayed by us. The first seven have been positively identified as active on UDP-sugars with the respective sugar indicated in the last column. Entry 8 has not yet been identified with any activity and is either an exception or requires one of the several UDP-sugars not yet available to us. Other open reading frames listed are almost certainly members of the family. Entries 16, 17, 19, and 23 are B. anthracis orthologues with about 90% amino acid identity to their B. cereus counterparts positively identified as UDP-sugar hydrolases. From our previous experience in identifying other subfamilies of the Nudix hydrolases, it is likely that most, if not all, of the entries will prove to be active on UDP-sugars. An important issue that bears further investigation is the relationship of B. cereus NP_833078 to B. anthracis NP_6527256 (Fig. 3, entry 16). These proteins differ by 40 amino acids, yet the first 92 amino acids of each are 93% identical and 97% similar. Two other sequenced strains of B. anthracis (A2012 and Ames) are in agreement with the homologous open reading frame containing 108 amino acids, and so the difference in size is not due to a sequencing error. We have shown that the B. cereus protein is a UDP-galactose hydrolase. The B. anthracis homologue lacks the C-terminal 40 amino acids containing the NGD region signifying the UDP-sugar family. It would be of especial interest to assess the importance of the NGD triad by examining the activity of the expressed protein from B. anthracis. Finally, it should be noted that NP_656123, one of the four open reading frames in B. anthracis that is not represented in B. cereus (Fig. 3) is a member of the UDP-sugar family (Fig. 4, number 18). Thus, 27 of the 30 Nudix hydrolase genes can be accounted for in these closely related species."

The general topology of the present enzyme comprises two catalytic domains (one for each subunit) related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis and separated by a common α-helical zipper motif consisting of five N-terminal helices from each subunit; furthermore the C-terminal tail is shortened significantly with respect to the known Ac 1,2-CTD. The presence of two phospholipids binding in a hydrophobic tunnel along the dimer axis is shown here to be a common feature for this class of enzyme. The active site cavity presents several dissimilarities with respect to the known catechol-cleaving enzyme. The catalytic nonheme iron(III) ion is bound to the side chains of Tyr-134, Tyr-169, His-194, and His-196, and a cocrystallized benzoate ion, bound to the metal center, reveals details on a novel mode of binding of bidentate inhibitors and a distinctive hydrogen bond network with the surrounding ligands. Among the amino acid residues expected to interact with substrates, several are different from the corresponding analogs of Ac 1,2-CTD: Asp-52, Ala-53, Gly-76, Phe-78, and Cys-224; in addition, regions of largely conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic cleft show different shapes resulting from several substantial backbone and side chain shifts. The present structure is the first of intradiol dioxygenases that specifically catalyze the cleavage of chlorocatechols, key intermediates in the aerobic catabolism of toxic chloroaromatics.

The present structure is the first of intradiol dioxygenases that specifically catalyze the cleavage of chlorocatechols, key intermediates in the aerobic catabolism of toxic chloroaromatics. Halogenated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons are a major environmental concern because large amounts of such toxic chemicals, resistant to both chemical oxidation and biological degradation, have been released into the ecosphere in the last decades as pesticides, fire retardants, and solvents (1Ghosal D. You I.-S. Chatterjee D.K. Chakrabarty A.M. Science. 1985; 228: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Alexander M. Science. 1981; 211: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The substitution for hydrogen with xenobiotic halogens in readily biodegradable hydrocarbons has in fact led to substances with significantly decreased microbial decomposition and, consequently, to their environmental accumulation (3Haggblom M.M. Valo R. Young L.Y. Cerniglia C. Microbial Transformation and Degradation of Toxic Organic Chemicals. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.1995: 389-439Google Scholar). Specialized strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria have been discovered to use selected halogenated hydrocarbons as sole carbon and energy sources (1Ghosal D. You I.-S. Chatterjee D.K. Chakrabarty A.M. Science. 1985; 228: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Frantz B. Chakrabarty A.M. Gunsalus I.C. Sokatch J.R. Ornston L.N. The Bacteria. 10.

The aerobic catabolism of chloroaromatics usually occurs through two different pathways (5Reineke W. Knackmuss H.-J. Annu. Rev.

Compounds containing one or two chlorine atoms are usually converted to chlorocatechols and then catabolized through the modified ortho-cleavage pathway (10Tiedje J.M. Duxbury J.M. Alexander M. Dawson J.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1969; 17: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Duxbury J.M. Tiedje J.M. Alexander M. Dawson J.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1970; 18: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Aromatic compounds containing more than two chlorine atoms are converted to hydroxyquinol or chlorohydroxyquinols and then cleaved by specific intradiol dioxygenases (Scheme 1) (12Apajalahti J.H.A.

A few interesting exceptions have been observed (7van der Meer J.R. van Neerven A.R.W. de Vries E.J. de Vos W.M. Zehnder A.J.B. J.

Kasberg T. Muller D. Mars A.E. Janssen D.B. Reineke W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 296-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modified ortho-cleavage pathway is a central oxidative bacterial pathway that channels chlorocatechols, derived from the degradation of chlorinated benzoic acids, phenoxyacetic acids, phenols, benzenes, and other aromatics into the energy-generating tricarboxylic acid pathway (10Tiedje J.M. Duxbury J.M. Alexander M. Dawson J.E. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1969; 17: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 11Duxbury J.M. Tiedje J.M. Alexander M. Dawson J.E. J. Agric.

Food Chem. 1968; 16: 829-833Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). These chlorocatechols are degraded further by the addition of molecular oxygen and the subsequent cleavage between two adjacent hydroxyl groups catalyzed by nonheme Fe(III)-dependent metalloenzymes, classified as intradiol dioxygenases (19Bollag J.-M. Briggs G.G. Dawson J.E. Alexander M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1968; 16: 829-833Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Dioxygenases that cleave catechols in an intradiol fashion can be divided into two structurally different families: protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenases (3,4-PCDs) 1The abbreviations used are: 3,4-PCD, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase; 1,2-CCD, chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase; 1,2-CTD, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion.1The abbreviations used are: 3,4-PCD, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase; 1,2-CCD, chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase; 1,2-CTD, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase; MAD, multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion. and catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (1,2-CTDs). 3,4-PCDs, specific for hydroxybenzoates, are typically composed of two homologous subunits in large oligomeric complexes (αβFe3+)2-12 (22Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), 1,2-CTDs are dimers (αFe3+)2 with identical or very similar subunits and generally comprise enzymes with markedly different substrate specificities: catechol, alkylated catechols, hydroxyquinols (type I enzymes) (23Hammer A.

Mechanistic and structural details have also been gathered for one 1,2-CTD (42Vetting M.W Ohlendorf D.H. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 39: 429-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and several 3,4-PCDs (43Ohlendorf D.H. Lipscomb J.D. Weber P.C.

In particular the crystal structures of 3,4-PCDs revealed that the catalytic ferric ion is ligated by two histidine and two tyrosine residues plus a hydroxyl ion in a trigonal-bipyramidal geometry (43Ohlendorf D.H. Lipscomb J.D. Weber P.C. Nature. 1988; 336: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in all investigated intradiol dioxygenases. Further exhaustive studies by Lipscomb et al. (45Orville A.M. Lipscomb J.D. Ohlendorf D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10052-10066Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 46Elgren T.E. Orville A.M.

Recently, structural information on the 1,2-CTD family was obtained, although limited to a single enzyme, the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ADP1 (Ac 1,2-CTD hereafter). The structure of this enzyme differs markedly from those of 3,4-PCDs; it is characterized by the presence of a novel structural hydrophobic helical zipper motif as a subunit linker and shows that only one subunit is used to fashion each active site cavity (42Vetting M.W Ohlendorf D.H. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 39: 429-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore 1,2-CTD anaerobic adducts with catechol and 4-methylcatechol confirmed several observations seen in 3,4-PCDs such as iron tyrosinate displacement upon substrate binding (42Vetting M.W Ohlendorf D.H.

In this paper we report the crystal structure determination for Rho 1,2-CCD solved using a multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment and refined at 2.5 Å. This is the first dioxygenase that catalyzes the degradation of chlorocatechols for which the three-dimensional structure has been determined providing details on the conformation of the active site and providing information on which particular residues are involved in substrate selection for enzymes of the 1,2-CCD family.

Diffraction data extending to a maximum resolution of 2.5 Å were collected at the x-ray diffraction beamline at Elettra, Trieste. Data were collected using a MAR image plate detector and a wavelength of 1.0 Å. Crystals belong to the primitive hexagonal space group P6322 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 89.33, c = 313.39. Assuming one molecule/asymmetric unit, the solvent content is about 61% of the unit cell (VM = 3.13 Å3/Da) (21Mattews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar). For all the data collections, crystals of the native enzyme were cooled at 100 K adding 30% glycerol to the mother liquor solution as cryoprotectant. Because of the large unit cell dimensions an image plate detector was utilized to reach the maximal resolution of the crystal without having too many overlapping reflections. Structure Determination and Refinement—All molecular replacement attempts, using coordinates of known intradiol dioxygenase structures as a model, failed to provide a solution for Rho 1,2-CCD. The structure of the enzyme Rho 1,2-CCD has been solved by MAD using the weak anomalous signal of the two catalytic irons (1 Fe/257 amino acids). MAD data were collected at the BW7A beamline, EMBL, DESY, Hamburg. The data collected at three wavelengths (inflection, peak, remote) were processed and integrated with DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK, from the HKL program suite (55Terwillinger T.C. Berendzen J.

Open table in a new tab The program SOLVE (56Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar) was used to identify the two iron sites and for phases calculation. The 3.5 Å MAD phases were improved and extended to 2.5 Å by solvent flattening and histogram mapping using the program DM from the CCP4 program suite (57Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was of high quality and allowed the manual tracing of 440-514 amino acid residues using the program QUANTA (58Inc Accelrys QUANTA Software.

Refinement of the model, performed at 2.5 Å resolution, using the program Refmac 5.1.24 from the CCP4 program suite (57Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19728) Google Scholar), resulted in R factor and Rfree values of 21.4 and 28.7%, respectively. The electron densities corresponding to residues Met-A1, Met-B1 and to the side chains of Lys-A89, Lys-B66, Lys-B173, His-B256, and Gln-B255 were missing, and therefore the corresponding atoms and bonds were not modeled. Electron density resembling one benzoate molecule bound to the iron ions was found in both active sites. Because no benzoate-like compounds were added during the crystallization procedures a possible explanation could be that such compound is formed during cell growth. Inhibition tests revealed that benzoate is a weak competitive inhibitor for the present Rho 1,2-CCD. Electronic density corresponding to a Tris buffer molecule was also found in a surface crevice interacting with residues Thr-28, Tyr-31, Glu-32, and Met-35 (from subunit B, helix H2) and Pro-48, Asp-52, Glu-56 (subunit A, helices H3 and H4), Gln-75, Gly-76, and Pro-77 (subunit A, random coil). The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1S9A). Structure Analysis—The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed using the program PROCHECK (59Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot is of good quality; there are 430 nonglycine and nonproline residues; among these, 374 (87%) are in the most favored regions, 50 (11.6%) are in the additional allowed regions, 5 (1.2%) in the generously allowed regions, and 1 (His-B256) (0.2%) in disallowed regions. The secondary structure was defined utilizing the DSSP data base and program (60Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12169) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalX program (61Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Global structures superimpositions were carried out by utilizing the matching algorithm implemented into the HEX 4.1 program (62Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J.L. J. Comp. Chem. 1999; 20: 383-395Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Least squares fit of the active site regions was performed using the McLachlan algorithm as implemented in the program ProFit 2.2 (www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/) specifying as the fitting subset the four amino acid ligands to the catalytic iron ions (63McLachlan A.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1982; 38: 871-873Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Electrostatic potentials were estimated first transforming the Protein Data Bank coordinate file into a pqr file containing partial charges and radii for each atom by using the PDB2PQR web service and then solving the second order differential Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which relates the electrostatic potential in a dielectric to the charge density using the macroscopic electrostatics with atomic detail (MEAD) program package (64Nielsen J.E.

As observed previously, it was assumed that the substrates bind to the iron in a bidentate fashion and with orientations of their aromatic ring similar to those observed for catechol or 4-methyl catechol in Ac 1,2-CTD or for the benzoate ion in Rho 1,2-CCD (42Vetting M.W Ohlendorf D.H.

https://openalex.org/W2023100733,"Melanosomes are melanin-containing organelles that belong to a recently individualized group of lysosome-related organelles. Recently, numerous reports have dissected the molecular mechanisms that control melanosome transport, but nothing was known about the possible regulation of melanosome distribution by exogenous physiological stimulus. In the present report, we demonstrate that a physiological melanocyte-differentiating agent such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, through the stimulation of the cAMP pathway, induces a rapid centrifugal transport of melanosomes, leading to their accumulation at the dendrite tips of melanocytes. Interestingly, the small GTP binding proteins of the p21Rho family and one of their effectors, p160 Rho-associated kinase, but not PKA, play a key role in redistribution of melanosomes at the extremities of the dendrites. Further, we have investigated, at the molecular level, the effect of cAMP on the different proteins involved in the control of melanosome transport. We demonstrate that cAMP stimulates the expression of Rab27a and rapidly increases the interaction of the melanophilin/Slac2-a with actin. Thus, we propose that the stimulation of the interaction between melanophilin/Slac2-a and actin would allow the rapid accumulation of melanosomes in the actin-rich region of the dendrite extremities."

The ubiquitous presence of enzymes involved in the anomeric changes of monosaccharides highlights an importance of these activities in various cellular processes requiring efficient monosaccharide utilization. IntroductionThe α–β anomeric change of a monosaccharide involving a pyran configuration is considered very slow, e.g. the rate of glucose mutarotation is 0.015 min-1 in water (1Livingstone G. Franks F. Aspinall L.J. J. Solution Chem. 1977; 6: 203-216Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only known enzyme for such a process is galactose mutarotase (GalM of Escherichia coli), which accelerates the conversion between the α- and β-anomers of d-glucose and d-galactose (2Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) presumably by enhancing the efficiency of glycolysis. The enzymes involving sugar metabolism including glycosylation tend to be selective for the α- or β-anomer, and thus a slow anomeric conversion may cause a problem in utilizing sugar. There has been no report on proteins involving an α–β conversion of sugars other than glucose, perhaps because of the lack of a method for detecting mutarotation at equilibrium. The conventional methods can only detect a change in optical rotation caused by an equilibrium shift from either the α- or β-anomer, which requires a purified α- or β-anomer as a substrate (3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Monosaccharides in general have α- and β-anomers of pyranose (six-membered ring, e.g. l-fucose and l-rhamnose) and often have additional α- and β-anomers of furanose (five-membered ring). d-Ribose, a key sugar moiety for the component of nucleic acids and ATP, exists in four different forms in solution, α-pyranose (22%), β-pyranose (58%), α-furanose (7%), and β-furanose (12%), with its open-chain form constituting less than 1% of the total ribose in solution. Ribose is transported as a β-d-pyranoribose, which is the major form in solution and binds to the ribose-binding protein (RbsB) in the bacterial periplasm (5Mowbray S.L. Cole L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the ribokinase (RbsK) involved in the next step of ribose metabolism recognizes α-d-ribofuranose as a substrate (6Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An apparent discrepancy in the substrate specificities for uptake and phosphorylation may require a novel component converting sugar anomers.RbsD is a component of the rbs operon of E. coli (rbsDACBKR) (7Willis R.C. Furlong C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6926-6929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iida A. Harayama S. Iino T. Hazelbauer G.L. J.

Ahn T. Park C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), yet its function has not been clearly elucidated. The only clue to the biological function of RbsD was obtained with a mutant glucose transporter (ptsG) that allowed the uptake of ribose at a lower rate (11Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only when ribose is transported into E. coli by this inefficient transporter is the presence of RbsD critical. This is because the limited availability of ribose cannot support metabolism without RbsD. RbsD is weakly homologous to FucU, a component of the fucose operon, the function of which is also unknown. Both have been classified in the RbsD/FucU family of proteins. Members of this family are ubiquitous having been found in organisms from eubacteria to mammals (12Kim M.S. Shin J. Lee W. Lee H.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). YiiL is an open reading frame of E. coli found in the rhamnose operon without any suspected function even with its homologs in other organisms including archaebacteria and eukaryote.The mutarotase seems to be critical in supporting fast energy generation by an organism when the substrate preference of metabolic enzymes for import or isomerization/phosphorylation is biased toward a specific anomer. Indeed, an uptake preference was reported for an α-anomer of N-fluoro-N-deoxy-d-glucose derivatives, which is incorporated 2.5-fold times more rapidly than its β-anomer (13O'Connell T.M. Gabel S.A. London R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10985-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although sugar utilization is crucial for the survival of the cell, nothing is known about the anomeric conversion and its metabolic implication for d-ribose, l-fucose, and l-rhamnose. Here, we characterize the functions of three E. coli genes, rbsD, fucU, and yiiL as mutarotases involved in the metabolism of these monosaccharides. These findings may demonstrate an importance of anomeric change in sugar utilization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Protein Purification—The genes encoding RbsD, FucU, YiiL, and RbsK were cloned with their termination codons into a pET21a vector (Novagen, NdeI/XhoI) expressing intact forms of proteins without an attached tag. The N terminally His-tagged FucU was constructed with the pQE30 vector (Qiagen, BamH1/PstI). All proteins were expressed in an E. coli strain (BL21 DE3), and the His-tagged forms were purified with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). The intact forms were purified using the HiTrap-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) after ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by gel permeation chromatography using Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences).Determination of Molecular Weight—Gel permeation chromatography was carried out using Biosep Sec-S3000 HPLC column (Phenomenex, 300×7.8 mm). All experiments were performed at room temperature in the buffer solution (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, and 100 mm sodium chloride. The molecular weights were estimated from the retention times of the molecular size markers: aldolase, 11.58 min; dimer of bovine serum albumin, 11.41 min; bovine serum albumin, 14.61 min; cytochrome c, 14.70 min; ubiquitin, 14.81 min.Leaking Assay for d-Ribose—Cells were harvested after growth in M9 medium with 0.4% glycerol and then were washed and resuspended in the buffer (pH 7.0, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer). [14C]d-Ribose (DuPont, 51.1 mCi/mm, 2 mm) was added to a final concentration of 2.0 μm. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the sugar was diluted to 1:1000 with cold d-ribose. Aliquots were sampled through filtration and washing with the same buffer by using a 0.45-mm pore size nitrocellulose filter (Amicon) at different time intervals. The radioactivity was measured in a scintillation mixture after drying.Saturation Difference Experiment—All NMR spectra were recorded in 99% D2O buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm sodium chloride) with the Varian UNITY INOVA instrument (600 MHz), in which the ligand to protein ratio was fixed to 200. The first and second free induction decays were obtained by presaturating the selected peak (H1′ peak of the α- or β-anomer) and a 0.12 ppm neighborhood with a 180-degree shift of the receiver phase, respectively. As a result, only a saturated peak was observed in the absence of a chemical exchange among the anomers. However, the equivalent peaks of different anomers are also included for comparison in cases where the chemical exchanges are observed.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSCharacterization of RbsD as Pyranase—Previous demonstration of mutarotase activities was made through the change of optical rotation (3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), requiring a specific purified anomer. This allowed a measurement of only unidirectional conversion rate. Here, we exploited a one-dimensional saturation difference (SD 1The abbreviations used are: SD, saturation difference; STD, saturation transfer difference.) NMR technique for analyzing conversions between specific sugar isoforms as well as a one-dimensional saturation transfer difference (STD) technique (14Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) for monitoring sugar binding to the target protein (Fig. 1). The specific line-broadening (Fig. 2A, top) for the peaks of β-ribofuranose/β-ribopyranose as well as the STD spectrum by RbsD (Fig. 2A, middle, 0.5 versus 5 s) revealed that RbsD binds specifically to the β-furan and β-pyran forms of ribose. The peak of the STD spectrum obtained with a shorter saturation time indicates a direct association of the monosaccharide, for in such condition, the effects of T1-relaxation time and the secondary saturation transfer through the chemical exchange are minimized. The appearance of the α-furanose peak in the STD spectrum is because of a fast spontaneous exchange between the α- and β-ribofuranoses (see below). RbsK specifically binds to ribofuranose, perhaps with a preference for the α-furan form (Fig. 2A, bottom, 0.5 versus 5 s), which is consistent with the x-ray crystallography results (6Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Pyranase activity of RbsD. A, the one-dimensional NMR spectrum (top) shows the H1′ region of d-ribose. One-dimensional STD spectra with a 5-s saturation time were recorded in the presence of RbsD (middle) and RbsK (bottom). B, one-dimensional SD spectra of d-ribose in the absence of RbsD showed a fast conversion only between the α- and β-furan forms (blue). The asterisk indicates the saturated peak. RbsD accelerates the specific conversion between the β-furan and β-pyran forms of ribose (red). C, two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were obtained with 150-ms mixing time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RbsD considerably increases the exchange rate between β-ribofuranose and β-ribopyranose (Fig. 2B), which was also confirmed by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (Fig. 2C) and two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy experiments (data not shown). The same signed peaks shown by saturation in all spectra indicate that they originated from the chemical exchanges. RbsD catalytically and specifically reduces the activation energy barrier between these two forms of ribose, because the saturation transfer from one peak to another mainly depends on the chemical exchange between two exchangeable states that are at equilibrium. Because the substrate for RbsK is α-ribofuranose, we believe that the activity of RbsD on its β-ribopyranose substrate is crucial in cells that are actively utilizing ribose.Spontaneous Interconversion of Ribofuranoses and Its Evolutionary Implication—As indicated in the previous STD spectrum (Fig. 2A), the fast spontaneous conversion between α- and β-ribofuranoses was observed, which appears to play a role in enhancing the substrate availability of RbsK. This fast exchange between α- and β-ribofuranoses was also confirmed by SD (Fig. 2B, blue) and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (Fig. 2C-1) performed in the absence of the RbsD protein. The furanose is likely to have a lower energy barrier for ring opening than pyranose. We also observed the fast exchange between the α- and β-furans of ribose 5-phosphate and among the α-furan, β-furan, and linear forms of ketoses (d-xylulose and d-ribulose), the intermediates of sugar catabolism.It is tempting to speculate that the evolutionary choice of ribofuranose as a component of nucleic acids might have resulted from the advantage gained by its fast exchange rate between α- and β-anomers. It was shown that DNA with a pyranose moiety, 2′-deoxy-d-allose, forms a more stable DNA duplex (4′–6′ linkage) because of the fact that pyranose forms more rigid backbone than furanose. In contrast, RNA containing d-allose is unstable because of the steric hindrance from the bulk pyranose ring. Thus, it is conceivable that the furan backbone was energetically favored in the RNA world (15Eschenmoser A. Science. 1999; 284: 2118-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Kinetically, pyranoses have very slow anomeric exchange rates (1Livingstone G. Franks F. Aspinall L.J. J. Solution Chem. 1977; 6: 203-216Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) causing a difficulty in incorporating the α-configuration during the prebiotic sugar-base coupling. However, the anomers of furanose inherently have fast exchange rates and thus either the α-or β-anomer can be properly selected during the reaction.Effect of RbsD and RbsK on the Leakage of d-Ribose from the Cell—The effect of RbsD in vivo is achieved either by an enhancement of ribose uptake (data not shown) or an attenuation of sugar leakage (11Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The leakage of d-ribose from E. coli cells decreases with the presence of RbsD, irrespective of RbsK (Fig. 3). The positive effect of RbsK on attenuating ribose leakage was expected, because this protein catalyzes the phosphorylation of ribose to ribose 5-phosphate, which is impermeable to the lipid membrane. It was reported that imported galactose easily leaks out of the cell when its kinase is impaired (16Horecker B.L. Thomas J. Monod J. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1580-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It seems likely that the sugar concentration in the periplasm is maintained at a specific concentration by an active influx of the sugar from the medium into the cell and by a considerable amount of leakage of the sugar from the cytoplasm when RbsD and/or RbsK are absent. Thus, the absence of RbsD and RbsK leads to an initial burst of sugar leakage, which might be due mainly to the sugar leakage from the periplasm, because the outer membrane is more permeable to sugars than the inner membrane. We observed that the effect of RbsD on leakage is much smaller than the effect of RbsK presumably because the former is involved in a more reversible change than the latter (that is anomeric conversion versus phosphorylation).Fig. 3Leakage of d-ribose from E. coli cells. Leakage of 14C-labeled ribose from E. coli cells was measured in E. coli strains with the following genotypes: rbsK+rbsD+, rbsK+RbsD-, rbsK-RbsD+, and RbsK-RbsD-.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Residues Involved in the Pyranase Activity—The mechanism of mutarotation was investigated recently with the E. coli galactose mutarotase (3Thoden J.B.

The prime candidate for this activity is a histidine residue (pKa ∼6.0). E. coli RbsD contains two conserved histidine residues, His-20 and His-106, which were mutated to alanines (H20A and H106A). Although His-20 is highly conserved in RbsD/FucU family members, His-106 is variable in the FucU subgroup. The mutant proteins were able to form an oligomer as is the case for the wild type, which was confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (Table I). The STD analysis indicates that both mutants bind to ribose as much as the wild type does (Fig. 4A, top). The H20A change completely abolished the pyranase activity, whereas H106A retained one-third of the original activity (Fig. 4A, bottom), which is consistent with the results of ribose utilization on minimal plates (Fig. 4B). The results are expected from the structure of Bacillus subtilis RbsD (12Kim M.S. Shin J. Lee W. Lee H.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol.

It was suspected that l-fucose is a ligand for FucU, because the exchange rate between α- and β-fucopyranoses without FucU was too slow to be detected by our SD NMR technique (Fig. 5A). We discovered that FucU binds to both α- and β-fucopyranose and accelerates the conversion between them. The kcat/Km (m-1·sec-1) of FucU for the β- and α-forms was roughly estimated from our SD experiments as 65,100 ± 970 and 27,900 ± 420, respectively. 2K.-S. Ryu, C. Kim, I. Kim, S. Yoo, B.-S. Choi, and C. Park, manuscript submitted. With this technique, we were able to measure the enzymatic constants for both anomeric forms at the same time. Although RbsD did not show any activity for l-fucose as a substrate (data not shown), FucU exhibited a pyranase activity for d-ribose (Fig. 5B). The pyranase activity of FucU for ribose is roughly half that of RbsD, although the degree of sugar binding is similar (data not shown). The mutarotase and pyranase activity of FucU was also confirmed by two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (data not shown).Fig. 5Mutarotase activity of FucU and YiiL. A, the H1′ region of the l-fucose from a one-dimensional spectrum shows the β- and α-pyranose forms, respectively. One-dimensional STD and one-dimensional SD spectra of l-fucose indicate that FucU binds to both forms and specifically accelerates the conversion between the α- and β-forms. B, one-dimensional SD spectra of d-ribose in the presence of FucU also shows pyranase activity. C, one-dimensional spectrum of l-rhamnose exhibits two pyranose forms. One-dimensional STD and one-dimensional SD spectra present an evidence of YiiL as a mutarotase for l-rhamnose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Configuration of Sugar OH Group Determines the Specificity of Mutarotases—Because sugars are first metabolized by their isomerases and kinases, the mutarotases (aldose 1-epimerases) have to be coupled with these enzymes (2Timson D.J.

Biol. 2000; 300: 917-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in terms of their substrate specificities. From the analysis of specificities for monosaccharide substrates reported previously for a variety of isomerases, we realized that the ability of one isomerase for several monosaccharides is common and that both isomerase (data not shown) and mutarotase activities are categorized according to their substrate configurations (Table II). The structures of all monosaccharides are presented here in terms of their differences from the d-ribopyranose backbone. d-Allose, an analogue of ribopyranose, is also a substrate for the pyranase (supplemental Fig. 1). Here, α-allopyranose binds to RbsD, in which the conversion is between β-allofuranose and β-allopyranose. The metabolic pathways of allose and ribose are intertwined in E. coli by sharing a common regulator, alsR (or rpiR), for the expression of the rpiB gene (or alsI), which encodes ribose phosphate isomerase (or allose isomerase) (18Kim C. Song S. Park C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7631-7637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Poulsen T.S. Chang Y.Y. Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7126-7130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported also that l-galactose and d-arabinose could be metabolized through the l-fucose pathway (20Zhu Y. Lin E.C. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which belongs to the same category in Table II. This indicates that sugars with the same orientations of OH groups are likely to utilize the same metabolic pathway.Table IISubstrate specificities of enzymes altering monosacharide configurationView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Prediction of YiiL as Mutarotase—Our efforts to catalog the substrate specificities of all mutarotase activities revealed two groups of orphan sugars that differ at the C-3 or -4 position. Mutarotase reactions with the C-3 group, which comprises d-xylose, d-quinovose, and d-glucose, appear to be catalyzed by galactose mutarotase (3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In eubacteria, d-glucose is imported using the phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase system, which couples transport with phosphorylation without the need of mutarotase activity. The poor catalytic activity of Lactococcus lactis GalM (3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for sugars with different C-3 configurations may be because of the existence of the PTS system. Interestingly, human aldose 1-epimerase, a GalM counterpart, exhibits higher activity with d-glucose than with d-galactose (2Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the C-4 group, which comprises l-lyxose, l-rhamnose, and l-mannose, was not utilized by any of the known mutarotases. When we inspected genes in the rhamnose operon, we found an interesting candidate of the mutarotase gene, yiiL. Using the SD NMR technique (Fig. 5C), we observed that the protein indeed mediates the α–β conversion of rhamnose.Novel Family of Mutarotases from Bacteria to Higher Eukaryotes—In this study, we were able to determine the enzymatic functions of the RbsD, FucU, and YiiL proteins and bestow on them the names of pyranase, type-II mutarotase, and type-III mutarotase, respectively, with the galactose mutarotase being type-I enzyme. These three mutarotases are structurally distinct, because both the sizes (galactose mutarotase GalM, 346 amino acids; FucU, 140 amino acids; and YiiL, 104 amino acids) and oligomeric states differ (Table I). RbsD/FucU and YiiL seem to require multimeric or dimeric structures for their enzymatic activity, because the N terminally His-tagged FucU is an inactive monomer. In addition, the pyran-furan conversion is considered unique from other types of mutarotation (e.g. α–β conversion of pyranose), although their underlying chemistries are the same.There are a number of RbsD/FucU isoforms in the mouse and human that are generated by alternative splicing, which are more closely related to FucU than to RbsD (supplemental Fig. 2). l-Fucose is an indispensable sugar in higher eukaryotes and is involved in a variety of cellular processes including cell surface recognition, glycosylation, and signaling. The lack of fucosylation is caused by genetic disorders (21Becker D.J. Lowe J.B. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 41R-53RCrossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 22Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 129R-143RCrossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), whereas its increase is observed in cancer cells (23Noda K. Miyoshi E. Gu J. Gao C.X. Nakahara S. Kitada T. Honke K. Suzuki K. Yoshihara H. Yoshikawa K. Kawano K. Tonetti M. Kasahara A. Hori M. Hayashi N. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6282-6289PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of an RbsK homolog in human cells may suggest the presence of RbsD activity in human cells. It is known that human blood contains ∼100 μm ribose that can be used as an effective energy source without accumulating lactate. A therapeutic role of ribose in ischemia was also reported (24Foker J.E. U. S. Patent 4,605,644. 1986; (August 12)Google Scholar, 25Foker J.E. U. S. Patent 4,719,201. 1988; (January 12)Google Scholar), perhaps because the ribose metabolism achieves fast supply of ATP. Delineating the cellular functions of eukaryotic FucU homologs would be a future challenge. IntroductionThe α–β anomeric change of a monosaccharide involving a pyran configuration is considered very slow, e.g. the rate of glucose mutarotation is 0.015 min-1 in water (1Livingstone G. Franks F. Aspinall L.J. J. Solution Chem. 1977; 6: 203-216Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only known enzyme for such a process is galactose mutarotase (GalM of Escherichia coli), which accelerates the conversion between the α- and β-anomers of d-glucose and d-galactose (2Timson D.J. Reece R.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) presumably by enhancing the efficiency of glycolysis. The enzymes involving sugar metabolism including glycosylation tend to be selective for the α- or β-anomer, and thus a slow anomeric conversion may cause a problem in utilizing sugar. There has been no report on proteins involving an α–β conversion of sugars other than glucose, perhaps because of the lack of a method for detecting mutarotation at equilibrium. The conventional methods can only detect a change in optical rotation caused by an equilibrium shift from either the α- or β-anomer, which requires a purified α- or β-anomer as a substrate (3Thoden J.B. Kim J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45458-45465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Monosaccharides in general have α- and β-anomers of pyranose (six-membered ring, e.g. l-fucose and l-rhamnose) and often have additional α- and β-anomers of furanose (five-membered ring). d-Ribose, a key sugar moiety for the component of nucleic acids and ATP, exists in four different forms in solution, α-pyranose (22%), β-pyranose (58%), α-furanose (7%), and β-furanose (12%), with its open-chain form constituting less than 1% of the total ribose in solution. Ribose is transported as a β-d-pyranoribose, which is the major form in solution and binds to the ribose-binding protein (RbsB) in the bacterial periplasm (5Mowbray S.L. Cole L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the ribokinase (RbsK) involved in the next step of ribose metabolism recognizes α-d-ribofuranose as a substrate (6Sigrell J.A. Cameron A.D. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An apparent discrepancy in the substrate specificities for uptake and phosphorylation may require a novel component converting sugar anomers.RbsD is a component of the rbs operon of E. coli (rbsDACBKR) (7Willis R.C. Furlong C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6926-6929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iida A. Harayama S. Iino T. Hazelbauer G.L. J.

Ahn T. Park C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), yet its function has not been clearly elucidated. The only clue to the biological function of RbsD was obtained with a mutant glucose transporter (ptsG) that allowed the uptake of ribose at a lower rate (11Oh H. Park Y. Park C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14006-14011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Only when ribose is transported into E. coli by this inefficient transporter is the presence of RbsD critical. This is because the limited availability of ribose cannot support metabolism without RbsD. RbsD is weakly homologous to FucU, a component of the fucose operon, the function of which is also unknown. Both have been classified in the RbsD/FucU family of proteins. Members of this family are ubiquitous having been found in organisms from eubacteria to mammals (12Kim M.S. Shin J. Lee W. Lee H.S. Oh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). YiiL is an open reading frame of E. coli found in the rhamnose operon without any suspected function even with its homologs in other organisms including archaebacteria and eukaryote.The mutarotase seems to be critical in supporting fast energy generation by an organism when the substrate preference of metabolic enzymes for import or isomerization/phosphorylation is biased toward a specific anomer. Indeed, an uptake preference was reported for an α-anomer of N-fluoro-N-deoxy-d-glucose derivatives, which is incorporated 2.5-fold times more rapidly than its β-anomer (13O'Connell T.M. Gabel S.A. London R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10985-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although sugar utilization is crucial for the survival of the cell, nothing is known about the anomeric conversion and its metabolic implication for d-ribose, l-fucose, and l-rhamnose. Here, we characterize the functions of three E. coli genes, rbsD, fucU, and yiiL as mutarotases involved in the metabolism of these monosaccharides. These findings may demonstrate an importance of anomeric change in sugar utilization."

Introductionαβ T lymphocytes recognize peptide-major histocompatibility complex ligands by means of a multimeric protein complex termed the αβ T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; BN, blue native; FCS, fetal calf serum; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; NANAse, N-acetylneuraminidase; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte. CD3 complex (TCR·CD3). This structure is composed of a variable αβ TCR dimer that binds antigens and three invariant dimers (CD3γϵ, δϵ, and ζζ) that are in charge of TCR·CD3 complex transport, stabilization, and signal transduction (1Alarcon B. Gil D. Delgado P. Schamel W.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 38-46Google Scholar). The minimum stoichiometry, therefore, is believed to be αβγϵδϵζ2.Mature CD4+ and CD8+ αβ T cells differ sharply in their major histocompatibility complex ligands, but their TCR·CD3 complex is believed to be qualitatively identical. The reduced αβ TCR·CD3 staining levels observed in CD8+ T cells, relative to CD4+ T cells, were therefore reported as quantitative under this assumption (2Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, peripheral blood αβ TCR·CD3 expression was shown to be more impaired in CD8+ than in CD4+ cells when CD3γ (3Timón M. Arnaiz-Villena A.

These observations were followed by the description of conformational and biochemical differences in the TCR·CD3 complex between CD8+ and CD4+ CD3γ deficient (γ-) T lymphocytes (6Zapata D.A.

Biosynthetic studies showed that CD8+ but not CD4+ γ- T cells lacked normal TCRα. Instead, the CD4+ γ- T cells contained a small αβ heterodimer composed of abnormally glycosylated TCRβ and an abnormally small CD3-associated chain that was not recognized by TCRα-specific antibodies.In the present study, we have extended these biochemical studies to the cell surface and provide further evidence for the existence of qualitative differences in the αβ TCR·CD3 complex between CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, particularly when CD3γ is lacking, but also in normal T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Herpesvirus saimiri-transformed T cell lines were derived with informed consent from the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of a healthy congenital CD3γ-deficient (γ-) individual or the PBLs of normal donors (γ+) as described previously (7Torres P.S.

The T cell lines used in the experiments (DSF4, CD4+ γ-; CTRCD4, CD4+ γ+; DSF8, CD8+ γ-; and CTO, CD8+ γ+) had been cultured for 6–7 years when the experiments were performed. Cells had always been grown in parallel in 1:1 RPMI 1640 and 25 mm Hepes/Panserin medium (from Invitrogen and Pan Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany, respectively) supplemented with 40 IU/ml human rIL-2 (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD), 10% FCS (Flow Laboratories), and 1% glutamine (BioWhitaker, Berkshire, UK). The medium was replaced every 3–4 days. The pre-TCR-expressing cell line SupT1 was grown in RPMI 1640 and 25 mm Hepes supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% glutamine.Human PBLs were obtained with informed consent from normal donors. Purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were isolated immunomagnetically using standard procedures according to manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Purities >90% were the rule. Human postnatal thymocytes were isolated from thymus fragments removed during corrective cardiac surgery of patients aged 1 month to 4 years with informed parental consent.TCR Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Surface labeling (125I and biotin) and precipitation experiments were performed as described in Refs. 6Zapata D.A.

Samples were lysed in Nonidet P-40 (Sigma)-containing lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) or in digitonin (or Brij96)-containing lysis buffer (1% digitonin (or Brij96), 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8 mm iodoacetamide). Supernatants, hereafter referred to as lysates, were collected and transferred to new tubes. The lysates were precleared twice with Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% digitonin (or Brij96, depending on the detergent used for the lysis), followed by a 2-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The precleared supernatants were subsequently immunoprecipitated for 1 h and 30 min at 4 °C with 5–10 μlofanTCRα-orTCRβ-specific mAb (αF1 and βF1, respectively, from Endogen, Cambridge, MA) or 0.5 ml of the CD3-specific mAb OKT3 (CD3ϵγ/ϵδ-specific, generously donated by Dr. Bent Rubin, Centre Hospitaliare Universitaire de Purpan, Toulouse, France) coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For control immunoprecipitations, 5–10 μl of W6/32 mAb supernatant (a gift from Dr. E. Martínez-Naves, Inmunología, Universidad Complutense) coupled to protein-G-Sepharose beads were used. The beads were afterward washed 5 times in lysis buffer.Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) treatments were done as described (6Zapata D.A. Pacheco-Castro A.

Finally, samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before a short spin at 12,000 × g. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography.Confocal Microscopy—5 × 106 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline/1% bovine serum albumin and adjusted to a final concentration of 2.5 × 105/ml in the same solution. 2.5 × 104 cells were dropped on non-treated glass slides by cytocentrifugation at 400 rpm for 3–4 min in a Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were air-dried and then fixed in acetone at room temperature for 5 min. Slides were again air-dried and subsequently stained with the corresponding mAb. Briefly, 100 μl of either TCRα-orTCRβ-specific mAb (1:5 dilution) were dispensed onto the fixed cells, and the slides were incubated at room temperature in a wet box for 40 min. Samples were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, dried carefully, and stained with a mouse IgG-specific Cy5-conjugated secondary mAb (100 μl, 1:200 dilution) for another 40 min in a wet box. After two more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, samples were dried and stained (40 min, wet box) with either CD4- or CD8α-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAb from Pharmingen (100 μl, 1:2 dilution). After two final washes, a drop of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) mounting medium was added to the slides, and cells were analyzed under a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope.Flow Cytometry—TCR·CD3-associated epitopes were analyzed in thymocytes, PBLs, or H. saimiri-transformed T cells by three-color flow cytometry as described elsewhere (30 min, 4 °C; Ref. 8Pacheco-Castro A. Alvarez-Zapata D. Serrano-Torres P. Regueiro J.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3152-3160Google Scholar). PBLs were studied either before or 12 h after phytohemagglutinin stimulation (Sigma; 5 μg/ml; Ref. 9Lim L.C. Fiordalisi M.N. Mantell J.L. Schmitz J.L. Folds J.D. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 392-398Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were stained with CD3- or TCR-specific mAb, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline/1% FCS, and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated panTγδ mAb and a PC5-conjugated CD4- or CD8-specific mAb so that lineage-dependent comparisons could be established within γδ- CD4+- or γδ- CD8+-gated PBL subsets. Other PBL subsets were defined and gated using the appropriate mAb (CD45RA, CD45RO, or CD69). Intrathymic, mature, single positive subsets were gated as CD4+CD8-CD3+ or CD4+CD8-CD1a- and CD4-CD8+γδ- or CD4-CD8+CD1a-γδ-, respectively, or analyzed after magnetic sorting using CD1a-coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). For comparative stainings, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was used.The mAbs used in the study were UCHT1 (CD3ϵγ/ϵδ), CD4, CD8, and CD45RO from Immunotech (Marseille, France); X35 (CD3ϵ) from D. Bourel (Centre Régional de Transfusion Sanguine, Rennes, France); 2Ad2 (CD3ϵ) and RW2-8C8 (CD3ϵ) from E. L. Reinherz (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA); SPV.T3b (CD3ϵ) from J.

Vilella (Hospital Clínico, Barcelona, Spain); WT31 (CD3ϵ), Leu4 (CD3ϵγ/ϵδ), SP34 (CD3ϵ), CD8, CD69, CD45RA, and CD43 from BD Biosciences; BMA031 (TCRαβ) from Caltag or Beckman Coulter; CD4 and CD1a from Beckman Coulter; TS2/16 and Lia 3/2 (CD18) from C. Cabañas (Instituto de Farmacología y Toxicología, CSIC-UCM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain); TCRδ1 (TCRγδ) from T Cell Diagnostics (Boston, MA) or Caltag. For purified mAb, phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) or IgM (μ) secondary antibodies from Caltag, Southern Biotechnology Associates, or Immunotech were used.To selectively disrupt lipid rafts, cholesterol was removed using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD; Sigma) as described (10Drake III, D. Braciale T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7009-7013Google Scholar). MβCD was dissolved in water (0.5 m) and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm Hepes buffer. Briefly, 2 × 106 purified PBLs were washed in RPMI 1640 and 1% FCS, treated with 10 mm MβCD for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed extensively in ice-cold RPMI 1640 and 1% FCS. Cells were then stained for cell surface marker expression by flow cytometry. WT31 and OKT3 stainings were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (11Uhlin M. Masucci M. Levitsky V. Scand. J. Immunol. 2003; 57: 99-106Google Scholar).NANAse (Sigma) treatments were done as described (12van de Griend R.J. Borst J. Tax W.J. Bolhuis R.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1107-1110Google Scholar). NANAse effects were controlled externally by the increased WT31 binding of a γδ+ T cell line termed Peer (data not shown) and internally by the decreased binding of a CD43-specific antibody, as described (13Borche L. Lozano F. Vilella V. Vives J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1523-1526Google Scholar).Blue Native (BN)-PAGE and Western Blotting—Published methods were used for the two-step affinity purification of the TCR (14Schamel W.W.A. Reth M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 5-14Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated with pervanadate and lysed with 1% digitonin lysis buffer containing sodium orthovanadate. Phosphorylated proteins were purified with 1 μg of 4G10 and 3 μl of protein G-Sepharose, washed three times, and subsequently eluted in BN buffer (500 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 7) including 50 mm phenylphosphate, 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase, and 1% digitonin. Dephosphorylated TCRs were separated by BN-PAGE as described (15Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). Western blots were developed with the anti-ζ antiserum 448. Ferritin monomers (f1; 400 kDa), dimers (f2; 880 kDa), and trimers (f3; 1320 kDa) were included as molecular mass standards. Under these conditions, the normal dephosphorylated αβγϵδϵζ2 TCR·CD3 runs at ∼400 kDa (f1) despite the fact that the relative molecular masses of the isolated dimers add up to only 230 kDa (90 + 50 + 50 + 40). Therefore, shape as well as molecular mass is important in BN-PAGE gels. For antibody-based gel shift experiments, samples were pre-incubated with βF1 (TCRβ) mAb or Fab fragments of SP34 (CD3ϵ) before electrophoresis. A detailed description and analysis of the wild-type TCR by BN-PAGE has been submitted. 2W. W. A. Schamel and B. Alarcón, submitted for publication. RESULTSCD4+ and CD8+ CD3γ-deficient T Lymphocytes Express Biochemically Different Membrane αβ TCR·CD3 Complexes—Natural CD3γ-deficient (γ-) T cells were biotinylated or radioiodinated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with CD3-specific as well as with TCR-specific mAb and compared with normal controls (γ+). The results showed that, in contrast to biosynthetic experiments, the amount of surface CD3-associated TCR (and ζ) proteins was very low in γ- cells (Fig. 1A). This precluded a meaningful analysis of the TCR composition of the complex by this method. We have previously reported by immunoprecipitation that surface CD3δ from CD8+ γ- cells showed an impaired electrophoretic mobility in comparison with controls because of its abnormal glycosylation (Fig. 1A, right). This finding correlated with complete endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H resistance (6Zapata D.A. Pacheco-Castro A. Torres P.S. Ramiro A.R. San José E. Alarcón B. Alibaud L. Rubin B. Toribio M.L. Regueiro J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35119-35128Google Scholar). Therefore, we next analyzed the CD3δ from CD4+ γ- cells. The results demonstrated that, in contrast to CD8+ γ- cells, the CD3δ from CD4+ γ- cells was similar to that from controls, both in terms of relative mobility and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H sensitivity (Fig. 1B). The direct immunoprecipitation of TCR chains showed that CD4+ γ- cells were comparable with CD4+ γ+ cells in terms of TCR chain composition, whereas CD8+ γ- cells clearly lacked normal surface TCRα and TCRβ chains (Fig. 2). These differences were TCR-specific, because control immunoprecipitates of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules were equivalent in all cells.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of surface-iodinated TCR chains from CD3γ-deficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Equal numbers of γ+ and γ- cells, either CD4+ or CD8+, were surface-labeled with 125I, lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40-containing buffer, and precipitated with a TCR-specific mAb (W6/32) or, as a control, a major histocompatibility complex-specific mAb (MHC-1) before electrophoresis under reducing conditions in 10% polyacrylamide gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further characterize the surface TCR chains of the mutant cells, immunofluorescence confocal analyses were performed using the same mAb. Expression of the CD4 or CD8 coreceptors was used as a positive or negative control in each cell type. The results indicated that both TCRα and TCRβ chains showed normal (mostly surface) distribution and fluorescence intensities in CD4+γ- lymphocytes (Fig. 3). CD8+γ- cells also showed normal expression of TCRβ by this assay, but TCRα was hardly detectable and, when present (10–20% of cells), mostly intracellular. The discrepancy in TCRβ expression by CD4+γ- cells between these data and the immunoprecipitation results (above) may be due to technical differences, such as the use of acetone for confocal analysis.Fig. 3Confocal analysis of TCRα and TCRβ expression by CD3γ-deficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. 2.5 × 104 CD4+ or CD8+ cells, both γ+ and γ-, were cytocentrifuged, acetone-fixed, and stained with purified TCRα- and TCRβ-specific mAbs and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. CD4- and CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate stainings were included as a positive control. Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate emissions were acquired simultaneously. The images show a medial optical cut of representative cells. CD4 staining was intracellular in this particular preparation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In a last set of experiments, the native surface TCR·CD3 complexes from CD4+ and CD8+ mutant cells were compared (14Schamel W.W.A. Reth M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 5-14Google Scholar, 15Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). The results indicated that the TCR·CD3 complex from CD4+ γ- T lymphocytes was similar to normal complexes from γ+ T cells (CD4+, CD8+, or Jurkat), although with delayed electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4A). This observation was compatible with either a different stoichiometry or a different structure (such as glycosylation or conformation changes) of the mutant complex (see “Experimental Procedures”). To distinguish between these two possibilities, antigenic shift experiments were performed. One shift indicates that there is a single chain per complex, and two shifts denote two binding sites per complex. The results indicated that the mutant TCR·CD3 complex had a normal stoichiometry when compared with that of γ+ T cells (Jurkat, Fig. 4B, or PBL, not shown). It contained one TCRβ chain (hence a single αβ heterodimer) and two CD3ϵ chains (probably representing two CD3δϵ dimers, because γ was absent). In summary, these experiments support an αβ(δϵ)2ζ2 model for the mutant TCR·CD3 complex in CD4+ γ- cells, where the γϵ dimer is replaced by the analogous δϵ dimer. Therefore, other types of modifications, such as glycosylation or conformation, may explain the delayed migration of the mutant complex. In sharp contrast, CD8+ γ- cells expressed a very different TCR·CD3 complex as compared with their CD4+ γ- counterparts. Native TCR·CD3 complexes isolated from CD8+ γ- cells migrated along a broad smear, suggesting the existence of a heterogeneous population of complexes in these cells (Fig. 4A). The stoichiometry of these heterogeneous TCR·CD3 complexes could not be determined by antigenic shift due to the basal broad smear.Fig. 4Native surface TCR·CD3 complex analyses of CD3γ-deficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A, equal numbers of γ+ and γ- cells, either CD4+ or CD8+, were stimulated with pervanadate and lysed in 1% digitonin before the purification of phosphorylated proteins using anti-phosphotyrosine-immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were eluted, dephosphorylated, and separated by BN-PAGE. Western blots were developed with anti-ζ. Ferritin monomers (f1), dimers (f2), and trimers (f3) were included as molecular weight standards. B, antibody-based gel shift assay of CD4+ γ- or Jurkat T cells using the indicated mAbs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)From these studies we conclude that CD4+ γ- and CD8+ γ- cells shared a poor surface association of CD3 to TCR chains. We also conclude, by using several experimental approaches, that their surface αβ TCR·CD3 complexes differed biochemically in the CD3 and the TCR components, as well as in the complete native complex.CD4+ and CD8+ Primary T Lymphocytes Express Biochemically Different Membrane αβ TCR·CD3 Complexes—Normal primary CD4+ T cells show higher TCR·CD3 staining levels than do CD8+ cells (∼1.5-fold with OKT3; Ref. 2Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820Google Scholar). This difference was interpreted as quantitative under the assumption that the αβ TCR·CD3 complex is identical in both cell types. However, as shown above and in Ref. 6Zapata D.A. Pacheco-Castro A. Torres P.S. Ramiro A.R. San José E. Alarcón B. Alibaud L. Rubin B. Toribio M.L. Regueiro J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35119-35128Google Scholar, the analysis of γ- TCR·CD3 complexes suggested the existence of hitherto unrecognized structural differences between both cell lineages. These results prompted us to search for qualitative αβ TCR·CD3 complex differences in normal CD4+ and CD8+ primary T lymphocytes. To test this hypothesis, a broad epitopic scan of the TCR·CD3 complex was performed by three-color flow cytometry using several CD3- or TCR-specific mAbs within gated CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. To exclude CD8+ NK cells (mostly CD8αα+, which stain dull for CD8 mAb), only CD8bright cells (CD8αβ+ T cells) were analyzed. As a control, CD18-specific mAbs were used, which stained primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells similarly. The data are depicted in Fig. 5A as MFI ratios of each mAb in CD4+ relative to CD8+ T cells, with representative histograms in Fig. 5B. The results showed that, for most of the mAb assayed, CD4+ lymphocytes stained better (MFI ratio >1.5, Fig. 5A) than did CD8+ lymphocytes, as described (2Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820Google Scholar). However this was not the case with two mAbs that stained CD8+ T cells similarly (MFI ratio = 1.2, WT31; Ref. 16Spits H. Borst J. Tax W. Capel P.J. Terhorst C. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1992-1998Google Scholar) or even better (MFI ratio <1, RW2-8C8; Ref. 17Meuer S.C. Hodgdon J.C. Hussey R.E. Protentis J.P. Schlossman S.F. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 988-993Google Scholar) than did CD4+ T cells. These observations are not consistent with the quantitative interpretation but, rather, with the existence of conformational (i.e. qualitative) differences in the αβ TCR·CD3 complex between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.Fig. 5Comparative cell surface TCR·CD3 expression by normal CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes and dependence on lipid raft integrity. A, MFI ratios ± S.D. of CD4+ relative to CD8+ T cells with the indicated mAb in n independent donors. MFI ratios above or below 1 (indicated by the horizontal dotted line) reflect an increased or decreased mAb binding to CD4+ cells, respectively. As an invariant control, CD18/CD11b expression was evaluated in parallel with two different mAbs recognizing different epitopes of the same molecule. B, representative reactivity patterns of selected mAbs in CD4+ (open histograms) and CD8bright (filled histograms) PBLs. Profiles are shown as the logarithm of relative fluorescence versus the number of cells. The vertical line in each panel indicates the upper limit of background fluorescence using isotype-matched irrelevant mAb. C, MFI ratios as in panel A for the indicated mAb and T cell subsets from at least three independent donors (HVS, H. saimiri-transformed; Rest, resting; Act, activated). D, purified PBLs from n independent donors were treated with MβCD to disrupt rafts and analyzed for surface binding of the indicated mAbs within CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. The results are given relative to untreated cells. E, representative reactivity patterns of selected mAbs in CD4+ and CD8bright PBLs before (thin histograms) or after (thick histograms) MβCD treatment. The numbers denote the percentage of binding as in panel D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether these conformational differences were developmentally regulated or regulated by activation (as described for activated γδ T cells, 18), mature CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were analyzed and compared for CD3 (and CD18) expression in four consecutive differentiation stages as follows: 1) intrathymic single positive (CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+) early mature T cells (gated as described under “Experimental Procedures”); 2) peripheral blood naïve T cells (defined by CD45RA+ expression, which identifies recent thymic emigrants, Ref. 19Mackall C.L. Granger L. Sheard M.A. Cepeda R. Gress R.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 2585-2594Google Scholar); 3) peripheral blood memory T cells (CD45RO+); and 4) recently activated peripheral blood T cells (gated as CD69+ after phytohemagglutinin incubation) or constitutively activated H. saimiri (HVS)-transformed T cells (20Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Google Scholar). The results indicated that the increased RW2-8C8 binding of CD8+ as compared with that of CD4+ T cells was essentially independent of their activation or differentiation status, although it was more apparent in peripheral T cells (naïve, memory, or activated) than in intrathymic single positive T cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, increased UCHT1 binding of CD4+ T cells as compared with that of CD8+ T cells was clearly regulated by activation and differentiation, as it occurred only in intrathymic and naïve T cells but not in memory or activated T cells. These changes were specific for the TCR·CD3 complex, as CD18 was regulated in an opposite fashion. Interestingly, equivalent UCHT1 binding of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells was acquired through both a decreased binding of CD4+ T cells and an increased binding of CD8+ T cells relative to their naïve counterparts, whereas RW2-8C8 binding differences were unaltered by the naïve/memory transition (not shown). Therefore, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indeed regulated their αβ TCR·CD3 conformational differences but did so differently for each epitope, and the RW2-8C8 epitope was well conserved along mature T cell differentiation.It has been proposed that lipid raft integrity affects the topological arrangement of the TCR·CD3 complex on the cell surface (10Drake III, D. Braciale T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7009-7013Google Scholar). Also, it is believed that a fraction of TCR·CD3 is raft-associated because of its association with the cytoplasmic portion of the CD8 (or CD4) coreceptor (21Doucey M.A. Goffin L. Naeher D. Michielin O. Baumgartner P. Guillaume P. Palmer E. Luescher I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278:"

Immunological techniques confirmed several of the changes in protein expression, but microarray analysis indicated that many of these changes were not accompanied by altered mRNA expression. Proteome analysis revealed perturbations in mitochondrial function, free radical production, and neuritogenesis that were not observed in p53-deficient neurons. Changes in Tau, cofilin, and other proteins recapitulated abnormalities observed in neurodegenerative states in vivo. Additionally, DNA damage caused a p53-dependent decrease in expression of members of the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. PKA inhibition promoted death in the absence of DNA damage, revealing a novel mechanism by which endogenous down-regulation of PKA signaling may contribute to p53-dependent neuronal death.

Recent reports indicate that it is not always possible to reliably extrapolate from changes in mRNA expression levels to changes in protein expression (1Anderson L. Seilhamer J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Although cDNA microarray technology provides a comprehensive, high throughput tool for characterizing changes in mRNA expression, methods for the broad analysis of changes in protein expression on a scale similar to that obtained with mRNA analyses have not previously been available. Because variations in protein expression and function are the primary determinants of cellular behavior, however, the ability to quantitatively measure changes in the expression of a large number of proteins within a given cell or tissue is needed. Until recently, most proteome analyses have been performed using two-dimensional PAGE, followed by mass spectrometric identification of the visualized proteins. The utility of this approach, however, is limited by several factors, including the labor-intensive nature of the technique, its low sensitivity, and a significant bias against proteins with extreme molecular weights or isoelectric points (2Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Fortunately, recently developed methods such as stable isotope labeling and multidimensional fractionation coupled directly on-line with mass spectrometry (MS) obviate the need for two-dimensional PAGE. These methods promise to increase the speed, dynamic range, and sensitivity of protein identification and quantitation.

The p53 protein can act as either a site-specific transactivator or a repressor of transcription and can promote apoptosis by modulating the expression of select genes (5Morrison R.S. Kinoshita Y. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The absence of the p53 gene has been shown to protect neurons from damage caused by ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, excitotoxins, and hypoxia (5Morrison R.S. Kinoshita Y.

Thus, a more comprehensive approach to the investigation of p53-dependent neuronal death pathways is needed. We report here the use of mass spectrometry and differential isotope labeling to quantitate simultaneous changes in the expression of hundreds of neuronal proteins after DNA damage induced by exposure to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. The mass spectrometry results were validated using immunoblotting techniques and compared with cDNA array analysis of the same cell systems. The data reveal p53-dependent regulation of multiple processes that either promote or reduce neuronal viability after DNA damage. Preparation of Neuronal Cell Cultures and Transfection—Primary cortical neuronal cultures were established from wild-type (p53+/+) newborn pups (day 0) and from a p53 knock-out (p53-/-) strain (C57BL/6 × 129 SV background) as described previously (4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cortical brain tissue was excised, trypsinized, and dissociated by trituration to obtain single cells. Cells were then plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated cultureware (10-cm dishes for proteomics and 4-well multidish (Nunc) for all other experiments) and were maintained in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen). Under these conditions, cultures were shown to contain greater than 95% neurons, as assessed by neurofilament immunostaining (6Xiang H. Hochman D.W. Saya H. Fujiwara T. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6753-6765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained for 4 days prior to experimental manipulations. For transfection, wild-type postnatal mouse cortical neurons were co-transfected with a GFP expression vector (EGFP-N2, 0.1 μg/well; BD Biosciences Clontech) and either a vector expressing a dominant negative form of protein kinase A regulatory subunit type Iα (PKARIα) (12Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (0.4 μg/well, obtained from Dr. S. McKnight) or a corresponding empty vector (for control) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (0.75 μl/well; Invitrogen). Cultures were fixed 48 h later with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33258 (2.5 μg/ml). For transduction experiments, nonreplicative recombinant adenoviruses deleted in the E1 region and carrying either the human p53 gene or the AxCA lacZ β-galactosidase gene were prepared and used at a multiplicity of infection of 125 as described previously (4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. SH-SY5Y cells were plated at 1.25 × 106 cells/60-mm dish for Western blots and were routinely plated and maintained in culture for 2 days prior to use. Approximately 24-48 h after transduction, total cellular protein was collected and analyzed for Western blotting as described below. ICAT Labeling of Cortical Neuron Protein Extracts—Wild-type postnatal cortical neurons that were either maintained under control conditions or exposed to the DNA damaging agent, camptothecin, were used for the mass spectrometry ICAT analyses. Neurons were scraped from four 10-cm dishes per condition in ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in a minimal volume of lysis buffer containing 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.3, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA and sonicated in a Branson sonicator for 2 min in an ice water bath. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was removed and stored at -80 °C. Extracted proteins from control- and camptothecin-treated wild-type cortical neurons were labeled with the light (ICAT-D0) and the heavy (ICAT-D8) isotopic version of the ICAT reagent (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA), respectively, as described previously (13Shen Y. Zhao R. Belov M.E. Conrads T.P. Anderson G.A. Tang K. Pasa-Tolic L. Veenstra T.D. Lipton M.S. Udseth H.R. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1766-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the soluble proteins were desalted into 50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.4, and the protein concentration was measured using the Biuret assay. Guanidine HCl was added to a final concentration of 6 m. The samples were reduced by the addition of tributylphosphine (5 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. ICAT-D0 and ICAT-D8 were added to the control- and camptothecin-treated cortical neuron protein samples, respectively, in a 5-fold excess of the calculated approximate number of cysteine residues (assuming 1 mg of protein equals 30 nm and 6 Cys residues/protein). The reaction mixture was incubated at ambient temperature with stirring for 90 min in the dark. The two ICAT-labeled samples were combined and desalted using a 5000 molecular weight cut-off D-Salt gel filtration column (Pierce) equilibrated with 100 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.4, and digested with trypsin (1:50 enzyme/protein ratio) overnight at 37 °C. The digested samples were boiled for 5 min and cooled in an ice bath, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. A packed avidin column (1-ml bed volume) was prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) and equilibrated with 2× PBS (pH 7.2). ICAT-labeled samples were loaded onto the avidin column, which was sequentially washed with 10 column volumes each of 2× PBS, 1× PBS, and 20% methanol in 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.4). ICAT-labeled peptides were eluted with 30% acetonitrile, 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Peptides were lyophilized to dryness and stored at -20 °C. Analysis of ICAT-labeled Peptide Samples—ICAT-labeled peptide samples were analyzed by microcapillary LC (μLC) coupled on-line either with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ Classic; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) or with an “in-house” built 7-tesla FTICR mass spectrometer (14Li L. Masselon C.D. Anderson G.A. Pasa-Tolic L. Lee S.W. Shen Y. Zhao R. Lipton M.S. Conrads T.P. Tolic N. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3312-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using reversed-phase μLC separations (60 cm long × 150 μm inner diameter × 360 μm outer diameter; Polymicro Technologies, Pheonix, AZ) as previously described (13Shen Y. Zhao R. Belov M.E. Conrads T.P. Anderson G.A. Tang K. Pasa-Tolic L. Veenstra T.D. Lipton M.S. Udseth H.R. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1766-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The LC capillary was coupled to the mass spectrometers using in-house manufactured electrospray ionization interfaces with an applied electrospray ionization potential of ∼2 kV. To identify the eluting peptides, the ion trap mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent tandem MS mode, where the three most abundant ions detected in a precursor MS scan were dynamically selected for subsequent collisional induced dissociation (CID) in the following three tandem MS scans (IT CID energy set to 35%). Sustained off-resonance irradiation CID FTICR-MS experiments were conducted essentially as described previously (14Li L. Masselon C.D. Anderson G.A. Pasa-Tolic L. Lee S.W. Shen Y. Zhao R. Lipton M.S. Conrads T.P. Tolic N. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3312-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The CID IT spectra were analyzed using SEQUEST, and FTICR CID spectra were searched using ICR-2LS, a software algorithm developed in-house (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory), both utilizing a data base constructed from tryptic peptides from the mouse genomic data base (www.ncbi.nih.gov). Immunocytochemistry, Histochemistry, and Immunoblotting—Cultured neurons derived from either wild-type or p53-deficient mice were treated as described under “Results.” The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and either immunostained as described (8Johnson M.D. Wu X. Aithmitti N. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23000-23007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or stained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) to visualize F-actin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mitotracker Red was used to stain functional mitochondria as described (15Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Neurons derived from either wild-type or p53-deficient mice were incubated with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (20 ng/ml; Molecular Probes) for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 40 min prior to observation. Production of reactive oxygen species was visualized with the fluoroprobe 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA; 10 μm; Molecular Probes) as previously described (16Sah R. Schwartz-Bloom R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9209-9217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cultures were observed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100) designed for fluorescence imaging of living cells. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used were anti-protein kinase A regulatory subunit type IIα (PKARIIα) (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PKARIIβ (1:250; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-PKA catalytic subunit α (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MAP2 (clone AP-20, 1:400; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-SOD1 (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, 1:5000; Sigma), anti-HSP 60 (SPA-806; Stressgen), anti-cofilin (catalog no. 3312; Cell Signaling), anti-lamin B1 (ab8982; Abcam), anti-synaptophysin (catalog no. 902; Roche Applied Science), anti-VDAC (PA1-954; Affinity BioReagents), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (catalog no. 4300; Ambion), anti-β-tubulin (MMS-435P; Covance Research Products), anti-Tau (MAB361; Chemicon), anti-14-3-3 (MAB3053; Chemicon), anti-histone 3 (catalog no. 9715; Cell Signaling), anti-calreticulin (SPA-600; Stressgen), and species-specific Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Molecular Probes). cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultures of wild-type mouse cortical neurons using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the chloroform/isopropyl alcohol precipitation method. cDNA probes were prepared using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II) with oligo(dT) primer (8 μm) and random 9-mers (1 μg/μl) (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture contained RNasin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, dNTP mix at 50 μm d(AGT)TP and 10 μm dCTP, and either Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (10 μm each; Amersham Biosciences) and was incubated at 42 °C for 2.5 h. mRNA was subject to alkaline hydrolysis, and the probes were purified by ethanol precipitation. The labeled cDNA probes from each sample of control- and camptothecin-treated neurons were then combined and hybridized at 42 °C in a humidified chamber for 14-16 h to glass slides (Amersham Biosciences) that had been spotted with the 15K mouse unigene set (obtained from NIA, National Institutes of Health). Each expressed sequence tag was represented in duplicate on the slide set. Both Cy3-labeled and Cy5-labeled cDNA probes were prepared from each sample and used for hybridization in reversed combinations to control for artifactual biases in fluorescence intensity ratios resulting from differences inherent to the Cy3 and Cy5 dyes. Thus, essentially two separate hybridization experiments were performed, generating four data points per cDNA clone. The slides were then washed and scanned using a Molecular Dynamics GenIII scanning confocal scanner at 10-μm resolution. The fluorescence ratio of Cy3/Cy5 obtained from the four separate spots for each expressed sequence tag was used to determine the relative abundance of each mRNA in the two samples. Data analysis was performed using the Spot-On computer software program developed at the University of Washington. Expression ratios of 1.4 or greater were considered significantly different. ICAT mass spectrometry proteome analysis was performed using primary cortical neurons obtained from newborn (day 0) wild-type mice maintained in dissociated cell culture in a chemically defined medium for 4 days as described previously (3Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Schwartzkroin P.A. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Johnson M.D. Kinoshita Y. Xiang H. Ghatan S. Morrison R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA damage was induced by exposure to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (2.5 μM), for 18 h. This time point was chosen to maximize differences in protein expression between control and injured neurons. At 18 h, most of the neurons were committed to undergo apoptosis, and a majority of cells showed morphological changes characteristic of programmed cell death. Control cultures exposed only to Me2SO vehicle showed no evidence of increased cell death under these conditions. Crude protein extracts derived from control- or camptothecin-treated wild-type cortical neurons were prepared and separately labeled with one of two isotopically distinct versions of the ICAT reagent (ICAT-D0 and ICAT-D8). Both versions of the ICAT reagent contain a thiol-reactive group and a biotin functionality separated by a linker region, which, in the heavy version, is isotopically labeled with eight deuterium atoms in place of eight hydrogen atoms (17Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). After covalent labeling, the extracts were combined and digested with trypsin, and the ICAT-modified peptides were recovered using immobilized avidin. These peptides were then separated and analyzed via μLC coupled on-line with either an electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometer or a 7-tesla electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (electrospray ionization-FTICR-MS) (18Jensen P.K. Pasa-Tolic L. Anderson G.A. Horner J.A. Lipton M.S. Bruce J.E. Smith R.D. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2076-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ICAT-D0 and ICAT-D8 peptide pairs were reproducibly separated and identified using this μLC-MS approach (Fig. 1a). Relative protein expression levels were quantitatively determined by constructing extracted ion chromatograms for each of the ICAT-labeled peptides and integrating the area under each extracted ion chromatogram for each of the D0/D8 peptide pairs identified. Previous experiments in our laboratory using equivalent proteome samples or mixtures of standard proteins have suggested that ICAT measurements have an S.E. value for quantitation of 10-25%. Based on this finding, we considered proteins whose mean abundance ratios were equal to or greater than 1.7 (increased expression when treated with camptothecin) or, alternatively, equal to or smaller than 0.3 (decreased expression when treated with camptothecin) to constitute a significant change in protein expression. However, in cases where multiple measurements from the same protein were obtained, a mean ratio of 1.4-fold or greater (increased expression when treated with camptothecin) or, alternatively, a mean ratio of 0.6-fold or less (decreased expression when treated with camptothecin) was considered significant. Proteins were identified from nearly every intracellular compartment and organelle, and ranged in molecular mass from less than 10 kDa (cytochrome c oxidase) to greater than 210 kDa (myosin heavy chain). Both high abundance (e.g. actin and tubulin) and low abundance (e.g. cellular nucleic acid binding protein and granule cell differentiation protein) proteins were observed. As anticipated, many of the observed proteins were neuron-specific. The distribution of the identified proteins by functional class is shown in Fig. 1b. A total of 191 unique peptides corresponding to 150 proteins prepared from control- and camptothecin-treated wild-type postnatal mouse cortical neurons were identified and quantitated. The results indicated that 65% of proteins derived from camptothecin-treated neurons showed no significant change in their abundance levels. Of the remaining proteins, the abundance ratios ranged from 1.4 to cases in which the protein was only detected in either the control- or camptothecin-treated neuronal extracts. A complete list of proteins that showed a significant change in abundance is provided in Table I.Table IMass spectrometry analysis of neuronal proteins with significantly altered expression after DNA damageProteinPeptide sequenceD8/D0aMean abundance ratios (D8/D0) equal to or greater than 1.7 (increased expression) or, alternatively, equal to or smaller than 0.3 (decreased expression) represent a significant change in protein expression in the camptothecin treated wild-type neurons relative to Me2SO-treated wild-type control neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2018873324,"Scavenger receptor BI, SR-BI, is a physiologically relevant receptor for high density lipoprotein (HDL) that mediates the uptake of cholesteryl esters and delivers them to a metabolically active membrane pool where they are subsequently hydrolyzed. A previously characterized SR-BI mutant, A-VI, with an epitope tag inserted into the extracellular domain near the C-terminal transmembrane segment, revealed a separation-of-function between SR-BI-mediated HDL cholesteryl ester uptake and cholesterol efflux to HDL, on one hand, and cholesterol release to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicle acceptors and an increased cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool of membrane free cholesterol on the other. To further elucidate amino acid residues responsible for this separation-of-function phenotype, we engineered alanine substitutions and point mutations in and around the site of epitope tag insertion, and tested these for various cholesterol transport functions. We found that changing amino acid 420 from glycine to histidine had a profound effect on SR-BI function. Despite the ability to mediate selective HDL cholesteryl ester uptake, the G420H receptor had a greatly reduced ability to: 1) enlarge the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive pool of membrane free cholesterol, 2) mediate cholesterol efflux to HDL, even at low concentrations of HDL acceptor where binding-dependent cholesterol efflux predominates, and 3) accumulate cholesterol mass within the cell. Most importantly, the G420H mutant was unable to deliver the HDL cholesteryl ester to a metabolically active membrane compartment for efficient hydrolysis. These observations have important implications regarding SR-BI function as related to its structure near the C-terminal transmembrane domain.

https://openalex.org/W1989188758,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is generally considered to undergo a large and reversible conformational transition upon l-Phe binding, which is closely linked to the substrate-induced catalytic activation of this hysteretic enzyme. Recently, several crystallographically solvent-exposed hinge-bending regions including residues 31-34, 111-117, 218-226, and 425-429 have been defined/predicted to be involved in the intra-protomer propagation of the substrate-triggered molecular motions generated at the active site. On this basis, single-site mutagenesis of key residues in these regions of the human PAH tetramer was performed in the present study, and their functional impact was measured by steady-state kinetics and the global conformational transition as assessed by surface plasmon resonance and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. A strong correlation (r2 = 0.93-0.96) was observed between the l-Phe-induced global conformational transition and Vmax values for wild-type human PAH and the mutant forms K113P, N223D, N426D, and N32D, in contrast to the substitution T427P, which resulted in a tetrameric form with no kinetic cooperativity. Furthermore, the flexible intra-domain linker region (residues 31-34) seems to be involved in a more local conformational change, and the biochemical/biophysical properties of the G33A/G33V mutant forms support a key function of this residue in the positioning of the autoregulatory sequence (residues 1-30) and thus in the regulation of the solvent and substrate access to the active site. The mutant forms revealed a variably reduced global conformational stability compared with wild-type human PAH, as measured by thermal denaturation and limited proteolysis.

A strong correlation (r2 = 0.93-0.96) was observed between the l-Phe-induced global conformational transition and Vmax values for wild-type human PAH and the mutant forms K113P, N223D, N426D, and N32D, in contrast to the substitution T427P, which resulted in a tetrameric form with no kinetic cooperativity. Furthermore, the flexible intra-domain linker region (residues 31-34) seems to be involved in a more local conformational change, and the biochemical/biophysical properties of the G33A/G33V mutant forms support a key function of this residue in the positioning of the autoregulatory sequence (residues 1-30) and thus in the regulation of the solvent and substrate access to the active site. The mutant forms revealed a variably reduced global conformational stability compared with wild-type human PAH, as measured by thermal denaturation and limited proteolysis. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, 1The abbreviations used are: PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; BH4, (6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin; hPAH, human phenylalanine hydroxylase; PKU, phenylketonuria; rPAH, rat phenylalanine hydroxylase; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; wt, wild-type; RU, resonance units. phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1) is a non-heme iron monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-Phe to l-Tyr in the presence of the pterin cofactor (6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and dioxygen, the rate-limiting step in l-Phe catabolism. Mutations in human PAH (hPAH), leading to altered kinetic properties and/or reduced in vivo stability of the enzyme, are associated with the autosomal recessive metabolic disorder phenylketonuria/hyperphenylalaninemia, and so far 439 putative disease-causing alleles have been identified in the PAH gene coding for a 452-residue polypeptide (1Scriver C.R. Hurtubise M. Konecki D. Phommarinh M. Prevost L. Erlandsen H. Stevens R. Waters P.J. Ryan S. McDonald D. Sarkissian C. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (www.pahdb.mcgill.ca). Mammalian PAH is a homotetramer (in equilibrium with a dimeric form) with the protomer consisting of three functional domains, i.e. a regulatory, a catalytic (core), and an oligomerization domain (for review, see Ref. 2Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2137-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The tetramer is a dimer of two conformationally different dimers, denoted AC and BD, related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axis (3Fusetti F. Erlandsen H. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16962-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on a number of independent biochemical and biophysical criteria, it is generally accepted that the enzyme exists in at least two different activity and conformational states (4Shiman R.

J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and that it undergoes a large scale but relatively slow (seconds-to-minutes) global conformational transition (isomerization) upon binding of its substrate l-Phe, which is characteristic of a hysteretic enzyme (5Shiman R.

Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic activation of tetrameric hPAH by its substrate can be represented by the equilibria in Equation 1 (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem.

Thus, the binding of the substrate (7Andersen O.A. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as well as the pterin cofactor (9Erlandsen H.

Biol. 2001; 314: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), occurs by an induced-fit mechanism, with a perturbation of the structure of both the enzyme protomer and the ligand. Although the specific regions involved in the reversible conformational transition and catalytic activation of the tetramer, related to substrate binding at the active site, are only partly characterized (7Andersen O.A. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Andersen O.A. Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol.

Thus, hinge-bending regions in the catalytic domain have been identified to be involved in this isomerization on the basis of two conformational states (conformers) of the catalytic core structure (7Andersen O.A. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Andersen O.A. Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and three additional inter- and intra-domain hinge-bending regions, schematically shown in Fig. 1, have been predicted from the structure of complementary truncated forms of hPAH (3Fusetti F.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), for which only one x-ray conformer is yet available. There is, however, no crystal structure for any full-length tetrameric/dimeric PAH, which leaves unsolved the overall mechanism of the intramolecular propagation of the conformational changes initiated by the cooperative binding of l-Phe at the active site (11Andersen O.A. Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In order to gain further insight into the role of the crystallographically defined/predicted hinge-bending regions in the substrate-induced conformational transition and the related catalytic activation, single amino acid substitutions were made at key residues in full-length hPAH as follows: (i) in the flexible intra-domain linker region (residues 31-34) of the regulatory domain structure that follows the N-terminal autoregulatory sequence (13Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); (ii) in the regulatory-to-catalytic inter-domain loop structure (residues 111-117) (13Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J.

Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); and (iv) in the dimerization-to-tetramerization loop structure (residues 425-429) (3Fusetti F. Erlandsen H. Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16962-16967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) preceding the C-terminal amphipathic α-helix involved in tetramerization by three-dimensional domain swapping (Figs. 1 and 2). A key objective of the present paper was to study the effects of the structural perturbations of hinge flexibility, resulting from specific mutations, on the catalytic and global conformational properties of the tetrameric form of the enzyme. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were used to follow in real time the slow (hysteretic) global conformational transition (k2 in Equation 1) that is triggered by the reversible binding of l-Phe to hPAH (2Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2137-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal.

Materials—The primers for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. The Big Dye™ terminator ready reaction mix used to prepare DNA for sequencing was delivered by Applied Biosystems, and the DNA sequencing was carried out on an ABI Prism™ 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The restriction proteases factor Xa and enterokinase were obtained from Protein Engineering Technology ApS (Aarhus, Denmark) and Invitrogen, respectively. The reagents and the sensor chip CM5 used in the SPR analyses were purchased from BiaCore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). (6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrobiopterin was from the laboratory of Dr. B. Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). Trypsin and trypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. Site-specific Mutagenesis—The specific mutations addressed in the present study were selected based on predictive protein mutation stability changes (babylone.ulb.ac.be/popmusic/). The mutation K113P was introduced into the cDNA of the wt-hPAH by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. The pMAL-hPAH plasmid containing a cleavage site for factor Xa was used as the template, and the following primers were used for mutagenesis (mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface type): GCTTTCACGAGATCCGAAGAAAGACACAGTGCCCTGG (forward) and CCAGGGCACTGTGTCTTTCTTCGGATCTCGTGAAAGC (inverse). The N-terminal mutations (N32D and G33A/G33V) were introduced into the cDNA of the pMal vector containing the enterokinase cleavage site (D4K), and the remaining mutations (N223D, N426D, and T427P) were introduced into the pMal-hPAH expression system containing the factor Xa cleavage site (IEGR) (14Bjørgo E. de Carvalho R.M. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Carvalho R.N. Solstad T. Bjørgo E. Barroso J.F. Flatmark T. J. Biol.

DNA sequencing was used to verify the introduction of the desired mutations as described previously (16Eiken H.G. Knappskog P.M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Hum. Mutat. 1996; 7: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of hPAH—The wild-type and mutant fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli with maltose-binding protein as the fusion partner and harvested after 2 h of induction with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside, and the tetrameric fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity as described previously (17Martínez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were cleaved by the restriction protease factor Xa or enterokinase, followed by size-exclusion chromatography at 4 °C (17Martínez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using a HiLoad Superdex 200 HR column (1.6 × 60 cm), prepacked from Amersham Biosciences. The isolated hPAH tetramers were collected, and the concentration was measured spectrophotometrically by using the absorption coefficient A280 (1 mg·ml-1·cm-1) = 1 (17Martínez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Assay of Enzymatic Activity—The PAH activity was measured at 25 °C in a standard reaction mixture containing 0.4 μm subunit (unless otherwise stated) of tetrameric wild-type/mutant forms of hPAH, 1 mm l-Phe, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.04 mg/ml catalase, 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7. After preincubation (5 min) with l-Phe the reaction was started by adding 75 μm (unless otherwise stated) BH4 to the reaction mixture. The amount of l-Tyr formed after 1 min was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and fluorimetric detection, and the steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis where both the cooperativity and substrate inhibition were taken into consideration, using the Jandel Scientific SigmaPlot® technical graphing software (18Solstad T. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). SPR Analyses—Real time interaction analyses between immobilized enzyme (wt-hPAH or its different mutant forms) and l-Phe was measured by SPR analyses using the BiaCore X instrument (BiaCore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Full-length hPAH diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4, to a final concentration of 0.23 mg/ml was covalently immobilized to the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip (CM5) with the amine coupling procedure (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amount of immobilized protein was estimated from the increased ΔRU values by assuming that 1000 RU corresponds to ∼1 ng of immobilized protein/mm2 (19Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. Bio-Techniques. 1991; 11: 620-627Google Scholar). The wt-hPAH and its mutant forms were immobilized at high ΔRU values in the range of 26,000-32,000 RU, corresponding to 26-32 ng of bound protein/mm2. The double-truncated form ΔN102/ΔC24-hPAH (0.37 mg/ml in sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.4) was immobilized to the reference cell by the same procedure in order to correct for the changes in the bulk refractive index together with the minor ΔRU response associated with binding at the active site (without any measurable conformational change) of the low molecular mass substrate l-Phe (165 Da) (8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The system was equilibrated as described (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) of the surfactant P-20, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25 °C. Various concentrations of l-Phe in HBS buffer were injected over immobilized hPAH, and equilibrium SPR measurements were taken once the ΔRU reached a stable plateau value after ∼3 min (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The time-dependent positive SPR response, expressed as ΔRU/(ng protein/mm2), has been shown previously (6Flatmark T. Stokka A.J. Berge S.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to measure in real time the global conformational transition triggered by l-Phe binding. The l-Phe concentration at half-maximum response ([S]0.5) was calculated from the equilibrium binding isotherm using the Jandel Scientific SigmaPlot® technical graphing software for nonlinear regression analysis. Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements of the tetrameric forms of wt-hPAH and its different mutant forms were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C in a buffer consisting of 200 mm NaCl and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, and at a protein concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. Increasing concentrations of substrate (l-Phe or d-Phe) were added to the cuvette every 3rd min, and equilibrium fluorescence measurements were taken once the ΔF reached a stable plateau after ∼3 min. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and the l-Phe-specific increase in fluorescence at 358 nm (increased solvent exposure of Trp120 (20Knappskog P.M. Haavik J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11790-11799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) was obtained by subtracting the response to added d-Phe (which binds with very low affinity) from added l-Phe in order to correct for a minor nonspecific signal related to each addition and the base-line drift. The binding parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analyses as described above for the SPR measurements. Limited Proteolysis with Trypsin—The rate of proteolysis was measured at 25 °C in 20 mm Hepes and 200 mm NaCl, pH 7, and a hPAH to trypsin ratio of 200:1 (by mass) in the absence or presence of 1 mm l-Phe. The final protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml. At timed intervals, 10-μl aliquots were mixed with soybean trypsin inhibitor and subjected to SDS-PAGE analyses. Quantification of the protein bands was obtained by using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Circular Dichroism—CD analyses were performed at 25 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. 5-7 μm subunits of wild-type and mutant tetrameric hPAH were diluted in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm KF (pH 7) and a stoichiometric amount of ferrous ammonium sulfate. Wavelength scans were taken between 200 and 260 nm by using 0.1-cm path length quartz cells, and the spectra (run in duplicates or triplicates) were the average of four scans; buffer scans were subtracted from the protein spectra. The global conformational stability, as measured by thermal denaturation (range 25-70 °C), was monitored by following the changes in the ellipticity at 222 nm at a constant heating rate of 1 °C/min. The apparent melting temperature (Tm) values were determined from the first/second derivatives of the denaturation curves after noise reduction by using the standard analysis program provided with the instrument. The first derivative profile was further resolved (deconvoluted) into individual overlapping Tm transitions, using a Gaussian distribution function in the PeakFit software program (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Structural Studies—The crystallographically determined three-dimensional domain structure and hinge-loop regions of the truncated forms ΔN102-hPAH (lacking most of the N-terminal regulatory domain), ΔN102/ΔC24-hPAH, and ΔC24-rPAH (lacking the C-terminal tetramerization motif) were based on the Protein Data Bank files 2PAH (3Fusetti F.

The molecular motions of the catalytic domain of hPAH on substrate binding can be observed at (molmovdb.mbb.yale.edu/cgi-bin/morph.cgi?ID=571404-31794) (11Andersen O.A. Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rationale for Choosing Specific Residues for Mutagenesis—The schematic presentation of the domain structure of the wt-hPAH protomer shown in Fig. 1 also highlights the defined/predicted inter- and intra-domain solvent-exposed hinge-loop regions where single-site mutations were introduced. First, the hinge-bending residue Asn223, at the center of the crystallographically defined intra-domain hinge-loop region (residues 218-226) in the catalytic core domain structure (residues 118-410) (11Andersen O.A. Stokka A.J. Flatmark T. Hough E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was mutated to an aspartate. This substitution is predicted to result in a loss of a stabilizing H-bond to Gly218 (Fig. 2A) and thus a local destabilization. Second, the 111RDKKKDT117 loop structure, connecting the regulatory domain with the catalytic domain, in rPAH has been proposed to represent another center of hinge-bending motion as a result of substrate binding (13Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). On the basis of the prediction of protein mutation stability changes, residue 113 was selected for mutagenesis. Lys113 was substituted with a proline, as found in the structurally and functionally closely related enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (2Flatmark T. Stevens R.C. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2137-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which is predicted to result in a loss of the H-bonds to Asp27 (in the autoregulatory sequence) and Asp315 (in the catalytic core domain) of the same protomer (Fig. 2A) and thus made this linker region more flexible despite a more rigid backbone conformation. Moreover, in the three-dimensional structure of the tetrameric N-terminally truncated hPAH, a short loop (residues 425-429) was observed in the C-terminal oligomerization domain (residues 411-452) connecting the dimerization and the tetramerization motifs (3Fusetti F.

Mutation of residue 427 was predicted to result in a marked destabilization, and a T427P substitution (as in human tyrosine hydroxylase) had revealed previously that the backbone conformation of this loop was indeed involved in the control of the l-Phe-promoted conformational transition in addition to its effects on the tetramer ↔ dimer equilibrium and the cooperative binding of substrate (14Bjørgo E. de Carvalho R.M. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For comparison, the functional effects of substituting the neighbor residue Asn426 with an Asp (as in human tryptophan hydroxylase), predicted to be a harmless substitution, were also studied. Finally, the buried Gly33 (Fig. 2A), which represents the center of a proposed flexible intra-domain linker region (residues 31-34) (13Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E.

Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several mutations at Gly33 are expected to result in a destabilization of hPAH, and here we have selected the two mutations G33A/G33V predicted to have high ΔΔG values. For comparison, the functional effects of the N32D mutation were also studied. Expression and Isolation of Wild-type hPAH and Its Mutant Forms—Fusion proteins of wt-hPAH and its mutant forms N223D, K113P, N426D, T427P, N32D, and G33A/G33V were all expressed in high yields in the TB1 strain of E. coli. The cells were harvested after 2 h of induction with isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside at 28 °C, i.e. conditions that almost completely prevent the deamidation of three labile Asn residues (at positions 32, 133, and 376), which occurs on longer induction times and higher temperatures (15Carvalho R.N.

https://openalex.org/W2108337088,"Guy's 13 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the major cell-surface adhesion protein SA I/II of Streptococcus mutans, one of the major causative agents of dental caries. Passive immunization with Guy's 13 prevents bacterial colonization in humans. To help elucidate the mechanism of prevention of colonization conferred by this antibody, the SA I/II epitope recognized by Guy's 13 was investigated. It was previously established that the epitope is conformational, being assembled from two non-contiguous regions of SA I/II. In the current study, using recombinant fragments of SA I/II and, ultimately, synthetic peptides, the discontinuous epitope was localized to residues 170–218 and 956–969. This work describes the mapping of a novel discontinuous epitope that requires an interaction between each determinant in order for epitope assembly and recognition by antibody to take place. Guy's 13 binds to the assembled epitope but not to these individual epitope fragments. The assembled epitope results from the interaction between the individual antigenic determinants and can be formed by mixing together determinants present on separate polypeptide chains. The data are consistent with one of the epitope fragments adopting a polyproline II-like helical conformation.

The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans is one of the main causative agents of dental caries (1Loesche W.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 353-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion of the bacterium to the tooth surface is mediated by a major bacterial cell surface protein, termed streptococcal antigen I/II (SA I/II) 1The abbreviations used are: SA I/II, streptococcal antigen I/II; aa, amino acid residues; ASM, alanine scanning mutagenesis; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PP II, polyproline II.

This protein has been identified in a number of strains and serotypes of S. mutans and has also been called SR (3Ogier J.A. Wachsmann D. Schöller M. Lepoivre Y. Klein J.P. Arch.

Demuth D.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and on this basis the proteins have been divided into a number of distinct regions (Fig. 1). These include an alanine-rich repeat (A) region (residues 121–447 of SA I/II from S. mutans NG5) consisting of four tandem repeats of an 82 amino acid (aa) sequence, a variable (V) region, where most of the sequence variation between antigen I/II homologues occurs and a proline-rich repeat (P) region (aa 840–983) consisting of three tandem repeats of a 39-aa sequence, together with a fourth, more degenerate repeat. The mouse monoclonal antibody Guy's 13, which recognizes SA I/II of S. mutans and S. sobrinus (7Smith R. Lehner T. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 4: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), has been used successfully to prevent S. mutans colonization and the development of caries in non-human primates (8Lehner T. Caldwell J. Smith R. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 796-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prevents bacterial colonization in human clinical trials (9Ma J.K.C. Hunjan M. Smith R. Lehner T. Clin. Exp.

Guy's 13 has been expressed, as a secretory immunoglobulin molecule in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum plants (11Ma J.K.C. Hiatt A. Hein M. Vine N.D. Wang F. Stabila P. van Dolleweerd C. Mostov K.

Vine N.D. Chargelegue D. Yu L. Hein M.B. Lehner T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Previous work by our group has established that the epitope recognized by Guy's 13 monoclonal antibody is conformational, being assembled from two regions of SA I/II that are noncontiguous in sequence (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting, it was shown that Guy's 13 recognizes two non-overlapping recombinant polypeptides that show no sequence homology. One part of the discontinuous epitope was shown to reside in a recombinant polypeptide (fragment 114, see Fig. 1) spanning aa 45–457 of SA I/II. The partial epitope residing in this fragment, which includes the A-region of SA I/II, is designated the A-region binding site or A site. The other part of the epitope was localized to a fragment (Pro0-IV) spanning aa 816–983 of SA I/II. The partial epitope residing in this fragment (which spans the P-region of SA I/II) is called the P-region binding site or P site. In ELISA-based experiments, binding of Guy's 13 to these individual fragments could not be demonstrated unless a recombinant polypeptide containing the A site was incubated simultaneously with a recombinant fragment containing the P site. Additionally, we showed that the two binding sites are able to associate with each other, leading to a structure that can subsequently be recognized by Guy's 13. This suggested that the A and P sites, which are widely separated in the linear sequence, are situated in close proximity in the native SA I/II. The aim of the current work was to map both binding sites in greater detail and, in the process, identify critical residues responsible for forming the discontinuous Guy's 13 epitope. This in turn may give a better understanding of the structure of SA I/II, the nature of the antibody-antigen interaction, and provide an insight into how the antibody prevents S. mutans colonization of the oral cavity. Bacterial Strains and Antigen I/II—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS was from Novagen. SA I/II was prepared from S. mutans Guy's strain (serotype c) (7Smith R. Lehner T. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 4: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Russell M.W. Bergmeier L.A. Zanders E.D. Lehner T. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 486-493PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Guy's 13 monoclonal antibody and all other primary and secondary antibodies were used as described previously (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Recombinant spaP Gene Fragments— Genomic DNA of S. mutans was isolated according to the method of Bollet et al. (16Bollet C. Gevaudan M.J. de Lamballerie X. Zandotti C. de Micco P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Amplification, cloning, and expression, using the pEXssΔ3 vector, of recombinant spaP gene fragments (see Fig. 1) was performed as described previously (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The identity of the recombinant clones was confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant polypeptides are produced as a fusion with a C-terminal, 13-amino acid, E Tag peptide (17Schier R. Balint R.F. McCall A. Apell G. Larrick J.W. Marks J.D. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An anti-E Tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used to confirm expression of the recombinant polypeptides by immunoblotting (not shown). The residues of SA I/II encoded by the recombinant polypeptides are shown in Fig. 1. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides, corresponding to the SA I/II sequence from S. mutans NG5 strain, were synthesized as peptide amides by manual procedure on a solid phase scaffold using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (18Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) in a Biotech Instruments BT7400 peptide synthesis block (19Dörner B. Ostresh J.M. Houghten R.A. Frank R. Tiepold A. Fox J.E. Bray A.M. Ede N.J. James I.W. Wickham G. Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. University Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar), as described by Kelly et al. (20Kelly C.G. Younson J.S. Hikmat B.Y. Todryk S.M. Czisch M. Haris P.I. Flindall I.R. Newby C. Mallet A.I. Ma J.K.-C. Lehner T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Peptide compositions were determined by mass spectrometry. Immunoassays—For ELISAs, Maxisorp 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with SA I/II (2 μg/ml solution in PBS) or cell lysates from E. coli cultures expressing recombinant SA I/II fragments. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with H2O. Free protein binding sites were blocked with 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Fraction V) in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed three times with H2O containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, air-dried, and stored at -20 °C until required. Competition ELISA to measure the ability of lysates or peptides to inhibit the binding of Guy's 13 IgG to solid phase SA I/II has been described previously (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Essentially, 65 μl of a 1 μg/ml solution of Guy's 13 IgG in 5× DB (12.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) was added to 130 μl of inhibitor-1 (either neat lysate, 250 μm peptide in PBS, or PBS) and 130 μl of inhibitor-2 (neat lysate or PBS). Aliquots of 100 μl were added in triplicate to the wells of SA I/II-coated ELISA plates. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the wells were washed six times with H2O containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. Detection of bound Guy's 13 IgG was with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. HRP activity was quantitated by the addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma). Enzyme activity was stopped with 1 m H2SO4 and the A450 measured. Direct ELISA to measure the ability of peptides or lysates to promote the binding of Guy's 13 IgG to immobilized recombinant SA I/II fragments was described previously (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides were diluted to 100 μm in DB. Aliquots (240 μl) of peptide (100 μm), E. coli lysate, or DB were mixed with 10 μl of Guy's 13 IgG (5 μg/ml solution in DB). An isotype-matched mouse IgG1κ monoclonal antibody (MOPC 31C) was used as a negative control. Aliquots of 100 μl were added in triplicate to the wells of an ELISA plate coated in advance with recombinant E. coli lysates. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C non-bound fluid phase components were removed and bound Guy's 13 IgG detected as described above. Mapping of the A-region Binding Site Using Competition ELISA—We have previously demonstrated the simultaneous requirement for both the A and P sites in fluid phase assays (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In a competition ELISA, Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II was inhibited using a lysate from E. coli expressing a recombinant fragment of the P-region mixed with lysate from E. coli expressing an A-region fragment. A-region fragments 114, 115, 116, and 121 (Fig. 1) were mixed with recombinant P-region fragment Pro0-IV (Fig. 2A). When only one fragment was incubated with Guy's 13 (the “PBS” columns), antibody binding to solid phase SA I/II was unaffected compared with the control wells which received only Guy's 13 (the “no inhibitor” column). Mixing of 114 lysate with Pro0-IV lysate resulted in over 90% inhibition of Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II (OD450 < 0.1), consistent with our previous report (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When A-region fragments 115 or 121 (which both span the first alanine-rich repeat) were mixed with Pro0-IV lysate, >90% inhibition was also observed. In contrast, when A-region fragment 116 (representing the C-terminal half of 114) was mixed with Pro0-IV, inhibition of only 30% was observed. Recombinant polypeptide 110 (spanning aa 984–1539 of SA I/II), which was shown previously to have no Guy's 13-binding activity in immunoblotting or in ELISAs (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. The lack of inhibition observed following mixing of the 110 lysate with either Pro0-IV lysate or with each of the A-region lysates (Fig. 2A) confirmed the requirement for the simultaneous presence of both A- and P-region binding sites. These results show that all of the recombinant fragments of the A-region were able to inhibit Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II when mixed with Pro0-IV recombinant polypeptide, although the extent of inhibition varied depending on the recombinant polypeptide used. None of the recombinant fragments were able to inhibit Guy's 13 binding on their own. In view of the repeat nature of the A-region it is, perhaps, not surprising that all of the A-region recombinant polypeptides tested gave some levels of inhibition. The recombinant polypeptide 121 (aa 121–218 of SA I/II) inhibited Guy's 13 binding by >90% when mixed with Pro0-IV polypeptide. Two further non-overlapping clones of A-region fragment 121 were generated: fragment 128 (aa 121–169 of SA I/II) and fragment 129 (aa 170–218) (see Fig. 1). In combination with Pro0-IV fragment, A-region fragment 129 is an effective inhibitor of Guy's 13 binding to solid phase SA I/II (see Fig. 2B), giving levels of inhibition (80%) nearly equivalent to 121 (88.5%), while fragment 128 did not inhibit Guy's 13 IgG binding above controls. The A-region binding site therefore lies within aa 170–218 of SA I/II. An A-region binding site can therefore be localized to this fragment and the ELISA results indicate that homologous A-region binding sites may be present in at least one of the remaining A-region tandem repeats. Mapping of the Binding Sites Using Synthetic Peptides—The P-region binding site had previously been mapped to a recombinant polypeptide, representing aa 816–983 of SA I/II (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further characterize the binding of Guy's 13 to SA I/II, 19 overlapping 20-mer peptides spanning the P-region were synthesized (Table I). A further peptide, p1037, which lies C-terminal to the P-region, was included as a negative control. Each of the peptides was tested for their ability to inhibit Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II in combination with A-region fragment 121. Three independent experiments were performed, and the results were plotted as the mean percentage inhibition (±S.D.) relative to a no inhibitor control, which represents Guy's 13 binding to solid phase SA I/II in the absence of any inhibitor lysate or peptide (Fig. 3). As a positive control, a mixture of 121 and Pro0-IV lysates produced high levels of inhibition (89%). No inhibition (<5%) was observed with any fragment or peptide in combination with control recombinant polypeptide 110 (gray bars). Most of the 121 lysate + peptide combinations also did not give any inhibition (<5%), comparable with the no inhibitor control and with the samples utilizing the negative control 110 lysate + peptide combinations. The exceptions were peptides p886, p926, p955, and p965, which produced varying levels of inhibition at 27%, 52%, 87%, and 20%, respectively.Table INomenclature and sequence of peptides spanning amino acids 803-1004 of the P-region of SA I/II from S. mutans NG5 Peptide p1037 was included as a negative control.

Sequence homology between these two peptides is the likely reason for this. Indeed, all four inhibitory peptides (p886, p926, p955, and p965) share a common sequence motif, discussed later. Dose-dependent inhibition of Guy's 13 binding to immobilized SA I/II has been demonstrated before for both the A and P sites (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of saturating amounts of the 121 lysate, dose-dependent inhibition by peptide p955 was demonstrated. Maximal inhibition was achieved with 40 μm p955, with an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of 3.3 μm (data not shown). Six 20-mer peptides spanning aa 161–230 of SA I/II (each peptide overlapping by 10 residues) were synthesized to map more finely the A-region binding site. However, none of these peptides significantly inhibited the binding of Guy's 13 to solid phase SA I/II when mixed with lysate from E. coli expressing recombinant fragment Pro0-IV (results not shown). Homologues of Peptide p955—The peptide p955 sequence is located within tandem repeat IV of the proline-rich region of SA I/II. The repeat nature of the P-region suggested that p955-homologous peptides from the other P-region tandem repeats might also inhibit Guy's 13 binding. Table II shows the sequence of p955 aligned with the three other peptide homologues from P-region tandem repeats I, II, and III, which were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II by preincubation with the 121 fragment (or with the 110 fragment as a negative control).Table IISynthetic peptides from the P-region of SA I/II from S. mutans NG5 homologous to peptide p955 The location of the peptides within each of the P-region repeats is shown.

Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis of Peptide p955—ASM of peptide p955 was performed. Thirteen peptide analogues (A3 to A15) were synthesized, each containing a single alanine substitution at positions 3 to 15 of peptide p955. Each of the alanine-substituted peptides was tested with the 121 fragment (or with the 110 fragment as a negative control) for inhibition of Guy's 13 IgG binding to solid phase SA I/II (see Fig. 4B). As a positive control, Guy's 13 IgG preincubated with fragment 121 and either Pro0-IV or p955 resulted in high level (90%) inhibition. The results enabled the alanine substitutions to be classified into three groups: (i) those alanine substitutions that had no effect on the inhibition by p955 of Guy's 13 binding to SA I/II (positions 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14), (ii) those substitutions that completely abolished the inhibitory effects of p955 (positions 5 and 8), and (iii) those alanine substitutions that resulted in partial abolition of the inhibitory effects of p955 (positions 3, 6, 11, 12, and 15). N- and C-terminal Deletions of Peptide p955—Ten peptides were synthesized that exhibited progressive deletions of amino acid residues from the N terminus of peptide p955. A further 10 peptides were synthesized with progressive deletions of amino acid residues from the C terminus of peptide p955. The results of competition ELISAs using the N-terminal deleted peptides showed that deletion of the N-terminal residue (Asn) of p955 had no effect on the inhibition of Guy's 13 binding to solid phase SA I/II. Deletion of the first 2 residues (Asn-Lys), however, reduced by 38% the inhibition exhibited by p955, while deletion of the first 3 residues completely abolished the inhibitory effect of p955 (data not shown). The results of the competition ELISAs using the C-terminal deleted peptides showed that deletion of the last 5 residues of p955 (Thr-Asp-Pro-Val-Tyr) had very little effect on the ability of the peptide to inhibit Guy's 13 binding to solid phase SA I/II. Deletion of the last 6–8 residues resulted in progressively lower levels of inhibition, culminating in total loss of inhibition when the last 9 residues were removed (data not shown). Binding of Guy's 13 IgG to Solid Phase A-region or P-region Binding Site in the Presence of Peptides or Lysates—To confirm the results of the competition ELISAs, the ability of peptides or lysates to promote binding of Guy's 13 to solid phase-associated binding sites was investigated. The results show that when A-region fragment 121 was adsorbed to the solid phase of an ELISA plate, Pro0-IV lysate and peptide p955 both promoted the binding of Guy's 13 (Fig. 5A). No effect was seen with a control monoclonal antibody (MOPC 31C) (gray bars). The results using P-region tandem repeat homologues of p955 (see Table II) show that p892 and p931 also promote binding of Guy's 13 to 121 while p853 does not. Lysates 121, 129, and 110 did not promote binding of Guy's 13 to immobilized 121. These findings are consistent with the results of the competition ELISAs (see Figs. 2 and 4A) and confirm the simultaneous requirement for both the A- and P-region binding sites. The results using the alanine-substituted peptide analogues of p955 in this direct binding ELISA (see Fig. 5B) also mirrored the results obtained using these peptides in the competition ELISAs. Thus, peptides (such as A7, A10, and A13), which are strong promoters of Guy's 13 binding to solid phase 121 fragment, are also strong inhibitors (in combination with fragment 121) of Guy's 13 binding to immobilized SA I/II (see Fig. 4B). As a control, Pro0-IV lysate (encoding the P-region binding site) coated onto the solid phase did not bind Guy's 13 in the presence of fluid phase p955 but did bind Guy's 13 in the presence of fluid phase 121 and 129 lysates, which both encode A-region binding sites (data not shown). Negative control 110 fragment coated onto the solid phase did not bind Guy's 13 IgG in the presence of p955 or any of the A- or P-region lysates (data not shown). In an attempt to delineate the Guy's 13 conformational epitope, we made use of earlier findings that the Guy's 13 epitope was formed from non-contiguous sequences that, when added together, were able to reconstitute the Guy's 13 epitope. The epitope is unusual because it can be reassembled in vitro irrespective of whether the two regions lie in cis or in trans. This allowed each binding site to be studied in turn and enabled each to be more finely mapped by cloning and expression of successively smaller recombinant fragments and, ultimately, with synthetic peptides. The A site was mapped to a recombinant polypeptide (fragment 129) spanning aa 170–218 of the A-region of SA I/II. This sequence is identical to aa 170–218 of PAc from S. mutans serotype c strain MT8148 (21Okahashi N. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Hamada S. Koga T. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The data indicated that at least one further binding site was present in the A-region, consistent with the repeat nature of this region. Attempts to map the binding site in the 129 fragment using overlapping 20-mer peptides were unsuccessful. Collectively, alignment of the 20-mer synthetic peptides p886, p926, p955, and p965, the results of ASM, the use of N- and C-terminally truncated peptides, and a comparison of the peptide homologues allowed a consensus P-region binding site to be defined by a 14-amino acid sequence: XPX(E/D)PXYXXX-PXPP. This sequence can be found at aa 893–906, 932–945, and 956–969 of SA I/II and implies the presence of at least three P-region binding sites for Guy's 13. ASM of p955 showed that residues Pro957, Pro960, Tyr962, Pro966, Thr967, Pro968, and the acidic residue Glu959 were most important for peptide binding. Although the P site is shown to reside on a peptide, the data from the ASM show that this partial epitope is not defined simply by a linear sequence of residues (22Geysen H.M. Barteling S.J. Meloen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 23Geysen H.M. Rodda S.J. Mason T.J. Tribbick G. Schoofs P.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Thus many of the residues in this partial epitope are most likely not involved in making direct contact with the complementarity determining region residues of the antibody. Similarly, most of the residues of the A site are also unlikely to be involved in interaction with the paratope. This indicates that each binding site still retains some secondary structure, consisting of independent contact residues interspersed among non-contact residues. Non-contact residues may be required for either the formation of a stable secondary structure or for interactions between the A- and P-region binding sites, which then allows the assembled epitope to be recognized by Guy's 13. Other workers (24Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 4604-4610PubMed Google Scholar) have described the mapping of discontinuous epitopes using synthetic peptides. Those reports have all described antibodies that are able to bind independently to at least two, non-overlapping peptides, indicating that the epitopes are discontinuous and that there is little interaction between the epitope fragments (binding sites) in the assembled epitope. In contrast, Spendlove et al. (27Spendlove L. Li L. Potter V. Christiansen D. Loveland B.E. Durrant L.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) described an antibody that, while able to bind independently to three peptides, showed increased binding when the peptides were mixed together. This synergistic binding is indicative of cooperativity between each of the binding sites within the assembled epitope. The discontinuous Guy's 13 epitope represents an extreme form of cooperativity. Under the denaturing and reducing conditions of immunoblotting Guy's 13 was shown to interact with SA I/II through two binding sites in an independent fashion (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). While this is not likely to be representative of the conditions under which Guy's 13 would be expected to encounter cell-surface SA I/II, it nevertheless proved invaluable in establishing the discontinuous nature of the epitope. In fluid phase immunoassays, cooperativity between the binding sites was essential for Guy's 13 binding to take place. Taken together the results indicate that the two binding sites interact with each other to form the assembled epitope and that Guy's 13 interacts with both binding sites within the assembled epitope. Structural analysis of proline-rich regions in other proteins (28Blundell T.L. Pitts J.E. Tickle I.J. Wood S.P. Wu C.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). By analogy it is predicted that the P-region of SA I/II, which also contains frequently repeating (PXX)n motifs, may also adopt a PP II helix-like conformation (31Kelly C. Evans P. Ma J.K.C.

Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for the PP II helix of Src homology 3 ligands. This model, adapted for peptide p955 and depicted in Fig. 6 is consistent with the ASM results. The critical, as defined by ASM, acidic (Glu959) and tyrosine (Tyr962) residues lie in close proximity on one edge of the proposed PP II helix model. The residues that make a smaller entropic contribution lie in the lower plane, while residues that form the upper edge appear to make little contribution to peptide p955 function. The results of this study have demonstrated that A-region sequences of SA I/II are able to interact with P-region sequences. Thus, we hypothesize that the PP II-like helix of the proline-rich region interacts with the alanine-rich region, which itself is predicted to adopt an α-helical structure (5Kelly C. Evans P.

The interaction of PP II-like helices with α-helices has been described before for turkey pancreatic polypeptide, a 36-amino acid hormone (28Blundell T.L. Pitts J.E. Tickle I.J. Wood S.P. Wu C.-W.

Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), where residues 2 to 8 form a PP II-like helix that is closely packed against an α-helix formed from residues 14–32. Homologous polypeptides from the pancreas of a wide range of species have been isolated and sequenced, and despite sequence variation, secondary structure analyses (37Glover I.D. Barlow D.J. Pitts J.E. Wood S.P. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Tatemoto K. Kimmel J.R. Wollmer A. Strassburger W. Zhang Y.-S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and immunochemical studies (38Taylor T.C. Thompson D.O. Ebner K.E. Kimmel J.R. Rawitch A.B. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 961-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) indicate that the tertiary structure involves the interaction of the PP II- and α-helices. This idea is now proposed here as the structural basis for the recognition of SA I/II by Guy's 13. Thus, hydrophobic interactions between the proline side chains of the PP II-helical P-region and side chains from the α-helical A-region permit the assembly of the Guy's 13 epitope. Thus, although the Guy's 13 epitope is formed from two discontinuous binding sites within SA I/II, each site has a conformational requirement determined by its secondary structure. Recently, the crystal structure of a recombinant protein spanning the variable (V) region of antigen I/II (SR) from S. mutans serotype f strain OMZ 175 has been determined (39Troffer-Charlier N. Ogier J. Moras D. Cavarelli J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). While this recombinant protein does not encompass the A- and P-region binding sites defined in our studies, it does include some flanking alanine-rich and proline-rich sequences. The structure shows that the alanine-rich sequences form an α-helix that, indeed, lies in close proximity to the proline-rich sequences. The structure also suggests that the A- and P-regions are orientated in an antiparallel configuration. Juxtaposition of the A- and P-regions is also suggested by our present report as well as our earlier work (14van Dolleweerd C.J. Chargelegue D. Ma J.K.-C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 754-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this regard it is interesting to note that one of the A-region 82 aa repeats, with a predicted α-helical structure, has approximately the same length (123 Å)as one of the P-region 39 aa repeats, with a proposed PP II-helical structure (121 Å), suggesting that an interaction between the two regions might require the longitudinal association of a PP II helix with an α-helix. If this is true, it may explain why an A-region binding site could not be localized to a 20-mer peptide. The minimal P-region binding site was defined by the 14-residue sequence XPX(E/D)PXYXXXPXPP, which if it adopts a PP II helix conformation, would have a length of 43.4 Å. This distance can only be spanned by an α-helical peptide of ≥29 residues. The binding of antibodies, such as Guy's 13, to S. mutans cell surface SA I/II might block adhesion epitopes by exerting their effect locally (by steric hindrance) or at a distance (through induced conformational changes in the SA I/II molecule). Such antibodies, when used as a passive mucosal vaccine, could affect the adhesin function of the protein, leading to prevention of colonization of the oral cavity by the bacterium. These studies, which begin to map the interaction of Guy's 13 with SA I/II at a molecular level, represent an initial step in understanding these mechanisms.

We show that the domain 1 residues, Tyr15 and Phe79, of the hβc receptor are important for high affinity IL-3 binding and receptor activation as shown previously for the related cytokines, interleukin-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which also signal through this receptor subunit. From the x-ray structure of hβc, it is clear that the domain 1 residues cooperate with domain 4 residues to form a novel ligand-binding interface involving the two protein chains of the intertwined homodimer receptor. We demonstrate by ultracentrifugation that the βIL-3 receptor is also a homodimer. Its high sequence homology with hβc suggests that their structures are homologous, and we identified an analogous binding interface in βIL-3 for direct IL-3 binding to the high affinity binding site in hβc.

Whereas the α subunits bind their ligands with low affinity, βc does not measurably bind any of the ligands alone. Upon receptor activation, the cytoplasmic portion of the βc subunit, which lacks any intrinsic kinase activity (11Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), initiates a number of signaling pathways including the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (reviewed in Ref. 12de Groot R.P. Coffer P.J. Koenderman L. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mice also possess a βc subunit (mβc) but have an additional IL-3-specific β receptor (βIL-3). βIL-3 differs from the mβc subunit in its ability to bind murine IL-3 (mIL-3) directly (13Itoh N. Yonehara S. Schreurs J. Gorman D.M. Maruyama K. Ishii A. Yahara I. Arai K. Miyajima A. Science. 1990; 247: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), although the presence of the mIL-3 α subunit is absolutely required for signaling (14Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The properties of mIL-3-responsive precursor cells from gene knock-out mice lacking expression of the βIL-3 subunit indicate that this subunit plays an important role in the response to mIL-3 stimulation (15Nicola N.A. Robb L. Metcalf D. Cary D. Drinkwater C.C. Begley C.G. Blood. 1996; 87: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human βc (hβc), mβc, and βIL-3 receptors are closely homologous in sequence and belong to the hematopoietin (or class I cytokine) receptor superfamily. Members of this family have extracellular domains containing the cytokine-receptor homology module composed of two fibronectin III domains that have a number of conserved sequence elements (16Bazan J.F.

In addition, mutagenesis studies of these receptors have shown that within the structural epitopes only a relatively small number of residues, which compose the functional epitope, are critical determinants of ligand binding (21Bass S.H.

These residues are contributed by a combination of the A–B and E–F loops of the membrane-distal fibronectin III domain and the B′–C′ and F′–G′ loops of the membrane-proximal domain. To what extent the principles of ligand binding established for the two domain receptors apply to the hβc receptor and its close relatives has been unclear because the hβc receptor does not engage ligand in the absence of the α subunits and possesses an extracellular domain with two cytokine-receptor homology modules. Residues in the domain 4 B′–C′ and F′–G′ loops have been identified previously (28Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Plaetinck G. Bagley C.J. Qiyu S. Hercus T.R. Lopez A.F.

Prior to the structure of the hβc receptor being elucidated, it was expected that domain 3 would partner with domain 4 in forming the ligand-binding interface, but no binding residues in domain 3 of the hβc receptor were identified. The hβc receptor structure gave new insight into the ligand-binding interface thus predicting the involvement of domain 1. The crystal structure of the complete extracellular domain of the hβc subunit showed that hβc exists as a preformed homodimer (Fig. 1), in which the G-strands of domains 1 and 3 are swapped between the two monomers (26Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a result of the intertwining of two monomers, domains 1 and 4 of symmetry-related chains form an approximately orthogonal interface that resembles the ligand-binding interfaces of two-domain hematopoietin receptors. The participation of domain 1 in ligand binding has been supported by recent mutagenesis studies that have shown that residues in the A–B and E–F loops of domain 1 of hβc are required for the formation of the high affinity human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF) complex and for receptor activation by hGM-CSF and human IL-5 (hIL-5) (31Murphy J.M.

The involvement of domain 1 also provides further evidence for the biological relevance of the hβc receptor structure. The murine βIL-3 subunit has the interesting feature of binding mIL-3 directly with low affinity as well as forming a high affinity complex in the presence of the mIL-3α receptor (14Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the carboxyl-terminal cytokine-receptor homology module of βIL-3 makes a unique contribution to the direct binding of mIL-3 and that the domain 4 B′–C′ loop has a critical role (32Wang H. Ogorochi T. Arai K. Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 979-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal cytokine-receptor homology module is also essential, but the corresponding portion of mβc can effectively substitute for that of βIL-3 without compromising direct mIL-3 binding (32Wang H. Ogorochi T. Arai K. Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 979-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a detailed analysis of the residues involved in direct and high affinity IL-3 binding has not been carried out previously nor has the structure of the βIL-3 subunit extracellular domain been determined. In the present work, we show by using analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking that the expressed extracellular domains of the mβc and βIL-3 receptors, like hβc, are homodimers. This, together with the high sequence homology between the murine receptors and hβc, suggests that both mβc and βIL-3 are likely to have intertwined homodimer structures analogous to that determined for hβc (26Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, we demonstrate here that domains 1 and 4 cooperate to form the functional epitope for direct IL-3 binding to the murine βIL-3 receptor and similarly form the high affinity IL-3-binding site of the hβc receptor. Most surprising, however, we have shown that the residues in the “elbow” region of the murine βIL-3 receptor have little effect on the high affinity binding of mIL-3, indicating that this receptor forms a high affinity complex in a different way to the hβc receptor. Isolation of Murine βc, βIL-3, and IL-3α cDNAs—cDNAs encoding the extracellular domains of the mβc subunit, the extracellular domain, the full-length βIL-3 subunit, and the full-length mIL-3 α subunit were isolated from FDC-P1 total RNA by reverse transcription using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The sequences of these cDNAs were verified using Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Gladesville, Australia). Site-directed Mutagenesis of βIL-3 cDNA—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The complete sequences of mutant βIL-3 subunits were verified by Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Expression Constructs—For expression in COS7 cells, the cDNAs encoding mIL-3 α and wild-type or mutant βIL-3 subunits were subcloned into the vector, pcEX-V3-Xba (31Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Wiedemann U.M. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10572-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Wild-type, Y15A, and F79A hβc cDNAs were prepared and subcloned into pcEX-V3-Xba as described previously (31Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Wiedemann U.M. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10572-10577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding hIL-3α, in the expression vector pME18S, was kindly provided by A. Miyajima (Tokyo, Japan). For expression in CTLL-2 cells, cDNAs encoding hIL-3α or mIL-3α were subcloned into pEF-IRES-N, and the hβc or βIL-3 subunits were subcloned into pEF-IRES-P (33Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) (from S. Hobbs, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). Expression and Purification of hβc, mβc, and βIL-3 Extracellular Domains—cDNAs encoding the extracellular domain of the hβc, mβc, and βIL-3 subunits were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBacPAK8 for baculovirus expression. Recombinant baculovirus was produced, and protein was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, concentrated baculovirus supernatant, containing expressed protein, was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column, and fractions containing protein were concentrated before being chromatographed on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) at pH 6.5 using a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus and eluted using a 0–350 mm NaCl gradient. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), with bovine γ-globulin as the protein standard. The identities of these proteins were confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing, which was performed as described previously (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Chemical Cross-linking of β Subunit Extracellular Domains—Purified hβc, mβc, and βIL-3 extracellular domain proteins (1 μg), in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), were reacted with 2 mm BS3 (Pierce) at 25 °C for 1 h, before the reaction was quenched with glycine (50 mm). Nonreducing SDS-PAGE was carried out by using 8% Tris-glycine gels with silver staining, as described previously (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis of β Subunit Extracellular Domains—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 10,000 or 20,000 rpm by using 12-mm path length cells with carbon-filled double-sector centerpieces. The solution sector contained 100 μl of protein sample at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml dissolved in 20 mm bis-Tris propane, pH 6.5, with 110 μl of the solvent sector in the same buffer as reference. All experiments were performed at 25 °C for 20 h. Scans at sedimentation equilibrium of absorbance (A) versus radial distance (r) in centimeters from the axis of rotation were collected at 280 nm. Scans at 360 nm were collected and subtracted from the equilibrium scans to correct for anomalies arising from cell windows. The resulting A versus r data was analyzed by using software supplied with the instrument. Where the data indicated that the sample was homogeneous, the molecular weight was evaluated by employing the sedimentation equilibrium shown in Equation 1, M=2RT(1v¯ρ)ω2 dlnAd(r2) (Eq. 1) where R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; ω is the angular rotation (radians/s), v̄ is the partial specific volume of the protein (0.725 ml/g in this case), and ρ is the density of the buffer. The molecular weights of hβc and v̄ were determined by running one sample of the protein in H2O and one in D2O in the sample experiment and solving the resulting two simultaneous equations. The best fit molecular weight for each sample was obtained using the program XLAEQ, and the homogeneity of the molecular weight was checked by evaluating point average molecular weights using the program XLAMW. The percentages of dimer and monomer in the samples were calculated using the program MULTMX1B. Cytokines and Radiolabeling—mIL-2 and mIL-3 were produced by using the baculovirus expression system (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recombinant hIL-3 was purchased from Sigma. Purified mIL-3 or hIL-3 was radiolabeled with 125I using the method of Fraker and Speck (35Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μg of mIL-3 or hIL-3 in 30 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 10 μl(1 mCi) of Na125I in NaOH solution (Amersham Biosciences) were added to a microcentrifuge tube plated with 1 μg of IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce) and reacted on ice for 10 min. Radiolabeled cytokine was purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at 4 °C for up to 9 days. Cells and DNA Transfections—COS7 cells and CTLL-2 cells were maintained as described previously (31Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Wiedemann U.M. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol.

Equilibrium Binding Analysis for hIL-3 and mIL-3—Hot saturation binding experiments were performed on COS7 cells transfected with DNA constructs encoding the relevant receptors, as described previously (31Murphy J.M.

In order to assess the capacity of βIL-3 subunits to bind mIL-3 directly, cold competition assays were performed on COS7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant βIL-3 subunits in the absence of the mIL-3α cDNA. 1 nm125I-labeled mIL-3 was added to 106 cells in 200 μl of binding medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES) with a serial dilution from a 200-fold excess of unlabeled mIL-3. Nonspecific binding was determined by performing the assay in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled mIL-3. After incubation for 2.5–3 h at 4 °C with intermittent agitation, the assay was terminated by centrifugation through 2:1 v/v dibutyl phthalate/dinonyl phthalate at 12,000 × g for 4 min. The tips of tubes and visible cell pellets were counted using a Packard 5780 Auto-gamma counter. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined from specific binding data by using the programs EBDA (36McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) and LIGAND (37Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) as described (31Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Wiedemann U.M. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. J. Biol.

Flow Cytometry—COS7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type, K347A, I349A, Y21A/Y401A, or F85A/Y401A βIL-3 subunits were incubated with 10 μg/ml rat anti-Aic2 monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rat (μ) secondary antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 25 min at 4 °C and then washed before analysis of cell-surface expression was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Proliferation Assays—[3H]Thymidine incorporation into the DNA of CTLL-2 cells expressing wild-type or mutant hIL-3 or mIL-3 receptors was used to measure the capacity of these receptors to deliver a proliferative signal in response to hIL-3 or mIL-3, respectively, as described (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The βIL-3 and mβc Receptor Extracellular Domains Are Homodimers—Our studies of the hβc receptor extracellular domain expressed in the baculovirus system have demonstrated that it exists as a preformed homodimer both in solution and when crystallized (26Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The full-length receptor has also been verified to exist as a dimer in the cell membrane (26Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The novel intertwined dimer structure of the hβc receptor and the important ligand-binding loops of the elbow region formed by domains 1 and 4 of the two different protein chains are shown in Fig. 1. An alignment between the βIL-3 and mβc receptors and the hβc receptor is shown in Fig. 2. The figure demonstrates the high degree of sequence homology between the extracellular domains of the murine and human β receptors and the conservation of the cysteine residues known to form intramolecular disulfide bonds in hβc. It is therefore likely that they have homologous structures. To investigate this further, we carried out cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation studies of the purified extracellular domains of the βIL-3 and hβc subunits expressed in the baculovirus system. The mβc subunit was also included for comparison. The amino-terminal sequences of the mature forms of βIL-3 and mβc had not been determined previously and were shown to be HEVTEEEETV and HGVTEAEETV, respectively (as shown in Fig. 2). The amino-terminal sequence of hβc has been determined previously (34Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of all three β subunit extracellular domains using the water-soluble reagent, BS3, gave analogous cross-linked products (Fig. 3) supporting homologous structures. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies were also carried out (Table I). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at pH 7.4 on the purified extracellular domains of βIL-3, mβc, and hβc. The average molecular weights determined for both mβc and βIL-3 were 83,000, compared with the average molecular weight of 91,300 obtained for hβc from HL60 eosinophils and 87,500 for hβc from TF1 cells. Because the predicted molecular weights (excluding glycosylation) of the βIL-3, mβc, and hβc(HL60) extracellular domains are 48,181, 48,331, and 47,739, respectively, the ultracentrifugation data indicate that the proteins exist as dimers at pH 7.4. There was some evidence of lower molecular weight protein in the samples. Although there was no evidence that this material was the monomer form of the subunits, fitting the data by using the program MULTMX1B showed that the monomer, if present, would constitute less than 10% of the concentration of the dimer.Table IAnalysis of βIL-3 and murine and human βc extracellular domains by sedimentation equilibriumProteinpHAverage molecular weightPredicted molecular weightaPredicted for protein chain without glycosylationHuman βc (HL60 eosinophils)7.491,300bAverage of molecular weight determinations for three different protein batches47,739342,400cAveraged determination for two different protein concentrationsHuman βc (TF1)7.487,500dAverage of molecular weight determinations for two different protein batches47,099Murine βc7.483,00048,331Murine βIL-37.483,00048,181a Predicted for protein chain without glycosylationb Average of molecular wei"
https://openalex.org/W2114712822,"One important mechanism cytotoxic T lymphocytes use to kill target cells is exocytosis of lytic granules that contain cytotoxic agents such as perforin and granzyme. Ca2+ influx and activation of protein kinase C have been known for many years to be key signals for granule exocytosis. Recent work has suggested that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) family, may be a third required signal. We surmised that the involvement of ERK in lytic granule exocytosis could be mediated through cross-talk with Ca2+ influx, rather than constituting an independent signal. We tested this idea using TALL-104 human leukemic CTLs as a model system and discovered the following. 1) ERK inhibition caused a modest decrease in the amplitude of increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but this effect cannot account for the profound inhibition of granule exocytosis. 2) Ca2+ influx can activate ERK in TALL-104 cells, but this effect does not contribute to ERK activation stimulated by solid phase anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. We conclude that cross-talk between ERK signaling and Ca2+ does not mediate the role of ERK in CTL lytic granule exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2030104100,"Although responsible for a major health problem worldwide, hepatitis C virus is difficult to study because of the absence of fully permissive cell cultures or experimental animal models other than the chimpanzee. GB virus B (GBV-B), a closely related hepatotropic virus that infects small New World primates and replicates efficiently in primary hepatocyte cultures, is an attractive surrogate model system. However, little is known about processing of the GBV-B polyprotein. Because an understanding of these events is critical to further development of model GBV-B systems, we characterized signal peptidase processing of the polyprotein segment containing the putative structural proteins. We identified the exact N termini of the mature GBV-B envelope proteins, E1 and E2, and the first nonstructural protein, NS2, by direct amino acid sequencing. Interestingly, these studies document the existence of a previously unrecognized 13-kDa protein (p13) located between E2 and NS2 within the polyprotein. We compared the sequence of the p13 protein to that of hepatitis C virus p7, a small membrane-spanning protein with a similar location in the polyprotein and recently identified ion channel activity. The C-terminal half of p13 shows clear homology with p7, suggesting a common function, but the substantially larger size of p13, with 4 rather than 2 predicted transmembrane segments, indicates a different structural organization and/or additional functions. The identification of p13 in the GBV-B polyprotein provides strong support for the hypothesis that ion channel-forming proteins are essential for the life cycle of flaviviruses, possibly playing a role in virion morphogenesis and/or virus entry into cells."
