https://openalex.org/W1969570221,"The stoichiometry, cellular location, glycosylation, and hydrophobic properties of the components in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex were examined. The 156, 59, 50, 43, and 35 kd dystrophin-associated proteins each possess unique antigenic determinants, enrich quantitatively with dystrophin, and were localized to the skeletal muscle sarcolemma. The 156, 50, 43, and 35 kd dystrophin-associated proteins contained Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The 156 kd dystrophin-associated glycoprotein contained terminally sialylated Ser/Thr-linked oligosaccharides. Dystrophin, the 156 kd, and the 59 kd dystrophin-associated proteins were found to be peripheral membrane proteins, while the 50 kd, 43 kd, and 35 kd dystrophin-associated glycoproteins and the 25 kd dystrophin-associated protein were confirmed as integral membrane proteins. These results demonstrate that dystrophin and its 59 kd associated protein are cytoskeletal elements that are tightly linked to a 156 kd extracellular glycoprotein by way of a complex of transmembrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2093143038,"The maturation of T cells in the thymus is dependent on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. By disruption of the MHC class II Ab beta gene in embryonic stem cells, mice were generated that lack cell surface expression of class II molecules. These MHC class II-deficient mice were depleted of mature CD4+ T cells and were deficient in cell-mediated immune responses. These results provide genetic evidence that class II molecules are required for the maturation and function of mature CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021432006,"Genes placed near telomeres in S. cerevisiae succumb to position-effect variegation. SIR2, SIR3, SIR4, NAT1, ARD1, and HHF2 (histone H4) were identified as modifiers of the position effect at telomeres, since transcriptional repression near telomeres was no longer observed when any of the modifier genes were mutated. These genes, in addition to SIR1, have previously been shown to repress transcription at the silent mating loci, HML and HMR. However, there were differences between transcriptional silencing at telomeres and the HM loci, as demonstrated by suppressor analysis and the lack of involvement of SIR1 in telomeric silencing. These findings provide insights into telomeric structure and function that are likely to apply to many eukaryotes. In addition, the distinctions between telomeres and the HM loci suggest a hierarchy of chromosomal silencing in S. cerevisiae."

The Kallmann gene had been localized to Xp22.3. In this study 67 kb of genomic DNA, corresponding to a deletion interval containing at least part of the Kallmann gene, were sequenced. Two candidate exons, identified by multiparameter computer programs, were found in a cDNA encoding a protein of 679 amino acids. This candidate gene (ADMLX) is interrupted in its 3' coding region in the Kallmann patient, in which the proximal end of the KAL deletion interval was previously defined. A 5' end deletion was detected in another Kallmann patient. The predicted protein sequence shows homologies with the fibronectin type 111 repeat. ADMLX thus encodes a putative adhesion molecule, consistent with the defect of embryonic neuronal migration.

https://openalex.org/W1965805827,"Because influenza virus replicates in the nucleus and buds from the plasma membrane, its ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) must undergo bidirectional transport across the nuclear membrane. Export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was found to depend on the viral matrix protein (M1). M1 associated with newly assembled viral RNPs (vRNPs) in the nucleus and escorted them to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pores. In contrast, during entry of the virus into a new host cell, M1 protein dissociated from the RNPs, allowing them to enter the nucleus. Amantadine, an antiviral agent that induces an early block in influenza A infection, was found to block the dissociation event and thereby to prevent import of incoming RNPs into the nucleus. Together, these results showed that M1 modulates the directionality of vRNP transport into and out of the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2068681382,"Constructs of four different genetic loci were transfected into the avian leukosis virus-induced chicken B cell line DT40, which continues diversification of its rearranged light chain immunoglobulin gene by gene conversion. Analysis of stable transfectants revealed an unexpectedly high frequency of targeted integration into the homologous gene loci of DT40. Transcriptional activity of the target gene locus is not required, since a construct of the untranscribed ovalbumin gene also integrated predominantly by homologous recombination. A construct derived from the β-actin locus was transfected into other chicken cell lines to determine the cell type specificity of the phenomenon. Targeted integration still occurred at high frequency in two other B cell lines that do not have the gene conversion activity. However, the ratios of targeted to random integration were reduced by at least one order of magnitude in three non-B cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2041802268,"In synchronous cultures of S. cerevisiae undergoing meiosis, an early event in the meiotic recombination pathway, site-specific double strand breaks (DSBs), occurs early in prophase, in some instances well before tripartite synaptonemal complex (SC) begins to form. This observation, together with previous results, supports the view that events involving DSBs are required for SC formation. We discuss the possibility that the mitotic pathway for recombinational repair of DSBs served as the primordial mechanism for connecting homologous chromosomes during the evolution of meiosis. DSBs disappear during the period when tripartite SC structure is forming and elongating (zygotene); presumably, they are converted to another type of recombination intermediate. Neither DSBs nor mature recombinant molecules are present when SCs are full length (pachytene). Mature reciprocally recombinant molecules arise at the end of or just after pachytene. We suggest that the SC might coordinate recombinant maturation with other events of meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2002499520,"The capacity of cells to organize and contract collagen fibrils is fundamental to processes as diverse as embryogenesis and wound healing. We analyzed different β1 integrins on diploid fibroblasts for their role in modifying the tertiary structure of collagen matrices. Using monoclonal antibodies that block the interaction of integrins with their ligands, evidence was obtained that α2β1 integrin is required for the contraction of a type I collagen matrix. Further supporting the role of α2β1, cell lines expressing minimal levels of this integrin uniformly failed to contract collagen matrices. In addition, transfection of a full-length α2 cDNA into one such cell line led to enhanced cell surface expression of α2β1 and conferred the de novo capacity to contract collagen matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2027662766,"In Drosophila, the major rhodopsin Rh1 is synthesized in endoplasmic reticuIum (ER)-bound ribosomes of the R1-R6 photoreceptor cells and is then transported to the rhabdomeres where it functions in phototransduction. Mutations in the cyclophilin homolog ninaA lead to a 90% reduction in Rhl opsin. Cyclophilins have been shown to be peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases and have been implicated in catalyzing protein folding. We now show that mutations in the ninaA gene severely inhibit opsin transport from the ER, leading to dramatic accumulations of ER cisternae in the photoreceptor cells. These results demonstrate that ninaA functions in the ER. Interestingly, ninaA and Rh1 also colocalize to secretory vesicles, suggesting that Rh1 may require ninaA as it travels through the distal compartments of the secretory pathway. These results are discussed in relation to the possible role of cyclophilins in protein folding and intracellular protein traflicking."
https://openalex.org/W2092891127,"Processing of endogenously synthesized proteins generates short peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8 T lymphocytes. Here it is documented that not only the sequence of the presented peptide but also the residues by which it is flanked in the protein determine the efficiency of processing and presentation. This became evident when a viral sequence of proven antigenicity was inserted at different positions into an unrelated carrier protein. Not different peptides, but different amounts of the antigenic insert itself were retrieved by isolation of naturally processed peptides from cells expressing the different chimeric proteins. Low yield of antigenic peptide from an unfavorable integration site could be overcome by flanking the insert with oligo-alanine to space it from disruptive neighboring sequences. Notably, the degree of protection against lethal virus disease related directly to the amount of naturally processed antigenic peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1998149067,"The three-dimensional structure of adenovirus has been determined by image reconstruction from cryoelectron micrographs. Comparison with the high resolution X-ray crystal structure of hexon, the major capsid protein, enabled an unusually detailed interpretation of the density map and confirmed the validity of the reconstruction. The hexon packing in the capsid shows more extensive intermolecular interfaces between facets than previously proposed. The reconstruction provides the first three-dimensional visualization of the vertex proteins, including the penton base and its associated protruding fiber. Three minor capsid proteins that stabilize and modulate capsomer interactions are revealed. One of these components stabilizes the group-of-nine hexons in the center of each facet and the other two bridge hexons in adjacent facets. The strategic positions of these proteins highlight the importance of cementing proteins in stabilizing a complex assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2128156628,"We show that in Aspergillus nidulans, p34cdc2 tyrosine dephosphorylation accompanies activation of p34cdc2 as an H1 kinase at mitosis. However, the nimA5 mutation arrests cells in G2 with p34cdc2 tyrosine dephosphorylated and fully active as an H1 kinase. Activation of NIMA is therefore not required for p34cdc2 activation. Furthermore, mutation of nimT, which encodes a protein with 50% similarity to fission yeast cdc25, causes a G2 arrest and prevents tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34cdc2 but does not prevent full activation of the NIMA protein kinase. Mitotic activation of p340cdc2 by tyrosine dephosphorylation is therefore not required for activation of NIMA. These data suggest that activation of either the p34cdc2 protein kinase or the NIMA protein kinase alone is not sufficient to initiate mitosis. Parallel activation of both cell cycle-regulated protein kinases is required to trigger mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026455684,"The neurogenic genes of Drosophila have long been known to regulate cell fate decisions in the developing ectoderm. In this paper we show that these genes also control mesoderm development. Embryonic cells that express the muscle-specific gene nautilus are overproduced in each of seven neurogenic mutants (Notch, Delta, Enhancer of split, big brain, mastermind, neuralized, and almondex), at the apparent expense of neighboring, nonexpressing mesodermal cells. The mesodermal defect does not appear to be a simple consequence of associated neural hypertrophy, suggesting that the neurogenic genes may function similarly and independently in establishing cell fates in both ectoderm and mesoderm. Altered patterns of beta 3-tubulin and myosin heavy chain gene expression in the mutants indicate a role for the neurogenic genes in development of most visceral and somatic muscles. We propose that the signal produced by the neurogenic genes is a general one, effective in both ectoderm and mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1809000693,"A new, pharmacologically active metabolite of cocaine, ethylcocaine, has been reported in individuals after concurrent use of cocaine and ethanol. Formation of ethylcocaine may contribute to the common coabuse of these two drugs and the apparent danger of this practice. We have identified a nonspecific carboxylesterase that catalyzes the ethyl transesterification of cocaine to ethylcocaine in the presence of ethanol. In the absence of ethanol, this human liver esterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cocaine to benzoylecgonine, a metabolite that is inactive as a psychomotor stimulant. A second human liver esterase is also described. This enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of cocaine to ecgonine methyl ester, also inactive as a stimulant. These two liver esterases may play important roles in regulating the metabolic inactivation of cocaine.—Dean, R. A.; Christian, C. D.; Sample, R. H. B.; Bosron, W. F. Human liver cocaine enterases: ethanol-mediated formation of ethylcocaine. FASEB J. 5: 2735-2739; 1991."
https://openalex.org/W2079090605,"We describe the direct detection of radiolabeled antigen fragments bound to class II MHC molecules following immunoglobulin-mediated endocytosis and processing of native antigen in B lymphoblastoid cells. Tris-Tricine SDS gels revealed six distinct iodinated processing products that could be detected on class II MHC 1 hr after antigen endocytosis and persisted for at least 20 hr. These physiological processed antigen-class II complexes were remarkably stable, as judged by the fact that class II alpha beta dimers, which remain associated in SDS, became labeled with the same set of processed peptides. Using a lectin-binding assay, we show that these physiological processing products bind to the newly maturing population of MHC molecules rather than binding to the preexisting cell surface population; in contrast, an exogenous peptide binds predominantly to the latter population. A direct T cell-independent assay for processed peptide-MHC complex formation should facilitate additional studies on the exogenous antigen processing pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2146478396,"The Rev protein of HIV-1 regulates the synthesis of partially spliced forms of cytoplasmic viral mRNA by binding to a cis-acting RNA sequence, the Rev response element (RRE). We have investigated the regulation of splicing in vitro and have shown that Rev specifically inhibits splicing of pre-mRNAs containing an RRE by 3- to 4-fold. A synthetic peptide of 17 amino acids containing the RNA-binding domain of Rev is highly functional and specifically inhibits splicing by up to 30-fold. Other peptides that bind to the RRE with high affinity, but with low specificity, do not specifically inhibit splicing. Six repeated monomeric binding sites for the peptide can substitute for the RRE, indicating that regulation by Rev requires interactions with multiple sites. The peptide acts at a step in the assembly of splicing complexes, suggesting that one of the functions of the basic region of Rev is to prevent formation of a functional spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2068205674,"MinK is a small membrane protein of 130 amino acids with a single potential membrane-spanning alpha-helical domain. Its expression in Xenopus oocytes induces voltage-dependent, K(+)-selective channels. Using site-directed mutagenesis of a synthetic gene, we have identified residues in the hydrophobic region of minK that influence both ion selectivity and open-channel block. Single amino acid changes increase the channel's relative permeability for NH4+ and Cs+ without affecting its ability to exclude Na+ and Li+. Blockade by two common K+ channel pore blockers, tetraethylammonium and Cs+, was also modified. These results suggest that an ion selectivity region and binding sites for the pore blockers within the conduction pathway have been modified. We conclude that the gene encoding minK is a structural gene for a K+ channel protein."

Tendon development is initiated and the muscles are capable of performing directed, functional work. Kinetically engineered organs provide a new method for studying the growth and development of normal and diseased tissue.—Vandenburgh, H. H., Swasdison, S., Karlisch, P.

https://openalex.org/W1547923771,"The ability of the bovine brain A1-adenosine receptor to discriminate between different G protein subtypes was tested using G protein alpha-subunits synthesized in Escherichia coli (rG alpha-subunits). When combined with a 3-fold molar excess of beta gamma-subunit purified from bovine brain and used at high concentrations, all three subtypes of rGi alpha (rGi alpha-1, rGi alpha-2, and rGi alpha-3) and rGo alpha were capable of reconstituting guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity binding of the agonist radioligand (-)-N6-3-[125I] (iodo-4-hydroxyphenylisopropyl) adenosine ([125I]HPIA) to the purified A1-adenosine receptor (Kd approximately 1.2 nM). Titration of the A1-adenosine receptor with increasing amounts of rG alpha revealed a approximately 10-fold higher affinity for rGi alpha-3 compared with rGi alpha-1, rGi alpha-2, and rGo alpha. This selectivity was also observed in the absence of beta gamma. Other alpha-subunits (rGs alpha-s, rGs alpha-L, rGs alpha PT, and rGz alpha) did not promote [125I]HPIA binding to the purified receptor. In N-ethylmaleimide-treated bovine brain membranes, rGi alpha-3 was the only rG alpha-subunit capable of reconstituting high-affinity agonist binding. Similarly, rGi alpha-3 competed potently with rGo alpha for activation by the agonist-liganded A1-adenosine receptor, whereas a approximately 50-fold molar excess of rGo alpha was required to quench the receptor-mediated release of [alpha-32P]GDP from rGi alpha-3. Hence, in spite of the extensive homology between alpha-subunits belonging to the Gi/Go group, the A1-adenosine receptor appears to discriminate between the subtypes. This specificity is likely to govern transmembrane signaling pathways in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1619481003,"Abstract The glycosyltransferases controlling the biosynthesis of cell-surface complex carbohydrates transfer glycosyl residues from sugar nucleotides to specific hydroxyl groups of acceptor oligosaccharides. These enzymes represent prime targets for the design of glycosylation inhibitors with the potential to specifically alter the structures of cell-surface glycoconjugates. With the aim of producing such inhibitors, synthetic oligosaccharide substrates were prepared for eight different glycosyltransferases. The enzymes investigated were: A, alpha(1----2, porcine submaxillary gland); B, alpha(1----3/4, Lewis); C, alpha(1----4, mung bean); D, alpha(1----3, Lex)-fucosyltransferases; E, beta(1----4)-galactosyltransferase; F, beta(1----6)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V; G, beta(1----6)-mucin-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (core-2 transferase); and H, alpha(2----3)-sialyltransferase from rat liver. These enzymes all transfer sugar residues from their respective sugar nucleotides (GDP-Fuc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, and CMP-sialic acid) with inversion of configuration at their anomeric centers. The Km values for their synthetic oligosaccharide acceptors were in the range of 0.036-1.3 mM. For each of these eight enzymes, acceptor analogs were next prepared where the hydroxyl group undergoing glycosylation was chemically removed and replaced by hydrogen. The resulting deoxygenated acceptor analogs can no longer be substrates for the corresponding glycosyltransferases and, if still bound by the enzymes, should act as competitive inhibitors. In only four of the eight cases examined (enzymes A, C, F, and G) did the deoxygenated acceptor analogs inhibit their target enzymes, and their Ki values (all competitive) remained in the general range of the corresponding acceptor Km values. No inhibition was observed for the remaining four enzymes even at high concentrations of deoxygenated acceptor analog. For these latter enzymes it is suggested that the reactive acceptor hydroxyl groups are involved in a critical hydrogen bond donor interaction with a basic group on the enzyme which removes the developing proton during the glycosyl transfer reaction. Such groups are proposed to represent logical targets for irreversible covalent inactivation of this class of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1995204810,"The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and MalT, the maltose regulon activator, synergistically activate transcription from the E. coli malKp promoter. The malKp regulatory region comprises two series of MalT-binding sites separated by three CRP-binding sites. By combining genetic and biochemical studies, we demonstrate that the promoter-proximal region contains two overlapping sets of three MalT-binding sites. Occupation of the higher affinity set of sites, which occurs in the absence of CRP, does not lead to malKp activation. In contrast, in the presence of CRP, MalT binds to the lower affinity set of sites and triggers transcription initiation because, unlike the high affinity set, the low affinity set of sites is properly positioned with respect to the Pribnow box. The CRP effect requires the malKp-distal MalT-binding sites. The synergistic action of MalT and CRP therefore relies on MalT repositioning via the formation of a nucleoprotein structure involving the entire regulatory region."
https://openalex.org/W2064994017,"Mutations in the Drosophila maternal genes plutonium (plu) and pan gu (png) have the striking phenotype that DNA replication initiates in unfertilized eggs. Fertilized eggs from plu or png mutant mothers also have a mutant phenotype; DNA replication is uncoupled from nuclear division, resulting in giant, polyploid nuclei. Analysis of multiple alleles of these genes indicates that their wild-type function is required to maintain repression of DNA replication until fertilization. The phenotype of two png alleles suggests that this gene also may play a direct role in coupling S phase and mitosis during the early cleavage divisions. We describe genetic interactions among png, plu, and the previously identified gene gnu that demonstrate these three genes regulate the same process."
https://openalex.org/W1595127999,"The oncoprotein 18 (Op18) gene encodes a proliferation-related cytosolic phosphoprotein, which is induced in normal lymphocytes following mitogenic stimulation. Studies of the Op18 gene are of particular interest because of the proposed role of Op18 protein in signal transduction and because of its occurrence in markedly increased amounts in acute leukemia cells. We have recently reported the cloning and sequencing of two cDNA clones for Op18 (1 and 1.5 kilobases). Both clones code for the same 149-amino acid polypeptide; however, they differ in their 3'-region as a result of alternative polyadenylation. We report here the sequencing of the Op18 gene and describe its expression in leukemia. The Op18 gene, which is 6.3 kilobases in length, is comprised of five exons and four introns and exhibits features that are common to other genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation. The increase in Op18 polypeptide in leukemia is associated with increased RNA transcription without gene amplification or rearrangement. Treatment of K562 leukemia cell line with hemin that induces terminal differentiation resulted in decreased expression of Op18. Our findings suggest that the high amount of Op18 protein in acute leukemia results from increased expression of a structurally unaltered gene."
https://openalex.org/W2151054623,"The relationship between the kinetochore and the centromeric heterochromatin that surrounds it is unknown. Anti-centromere autoantibodies (ACAs) that recognize antigens found in the heterochromatin beneath the kinetochore disrupt mitotic events when microinjected into human cells. We show here that ACAs interfere with two different stages of centromere assembly during interphase, resulting in abnormal kinetochore structures during mitosis. Antibody injection prior to late G2 results in the subsequent failure to assemble a trilaminar kinetochore. Such chromosomes bind microtubules but are incapable of movement. Antibody disruption of events during G2 produces unstable kinetochores that prevent the normal transition into anaphase. These experiments present a novel way to examine events in the pathway of kinetochore assembly that occur during interphase, at a time when this structure cannot be visualized directly."
https://openalex.org/W2045787601,"We have translated the HLA-B27 heavy chain in vitro and studied its assembly with beta 2-microglobulin and peptide in microsomes from human cells. The assembly process requires ATP. However, the translocation of peptide across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane does not require ATP, and binding of biotinylated peptide to BiP, an ER luminal protein, occurs after ATP depletion. Proteinase K treatment of the microsomes does not block peptide translocation. Thus, ATP is required in the lumen of the ER for efficient assembly to occur. Microsomes prepared from Raji and T1 cells show similar levels of assembly, whereas assembly in T2 microsomes is 10-fold lower. This difference remains after peptide stimulation of assembly. The inefficient assembly in T2 microsomes is not due to impaired peptide translocation across the ER membrane, as no difference was found compared with microsomes from T1 cells. Instead, the defect seems to reside in the lumen of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1495944780,"The binding of 35S-labeled recombinant human Factor VIII to activated human platelets was studied in the presence and absence of exogenous plasma von Willebrand factor. In the absence of added von Willebrand Factor, platelets bound 210 molecules of Factor VIII/platelet when the unbound Factor VIII concentration was 2.0 nM (Kd = 2.9 nM). As the von Willebrand factor concentration was increased, the number of Factor VIII molecules bound/platelet decreased to 10 molecules of Factor VIII bound/platelet at 24 micrograms/ml of added vWF. Addition of an anti-vWF monoclonal antibody that inhibits the vWF-Factor VIII interaction attenuated the ability of vWF to inhibit binding of Factor VIII to platelets. In contrast, addition of a control anti-vWF antibody that does not block the vWF-Factor VIII interaction did not affect the ability of vWF to inhibit Factor VIII binding to platelets. From the vWF concentration dependence of inhibition of Factor VIII-platelet binding, a dissociation constant for the Factor VIII-vWF interaction was calculated (Kd = 0.44 nM). To further elucidate the role that vWF may play in preventing the interaction of Factor VIII with platelets, the platelet binding properties of a Factor VIII deletion mutant (90-73) which lacks the primary vWF-binding site was studied. The binding of this mutant was unaffected by added exogenous vWF. These observations demonstrate that Factor VIII can interact with platelets in a manner independent of vWF but that excess vWF in plasma can effectively compete with platelets for the binding of Factor VIII. In addition, since cleavage of Factor VIII by thrombin separates a vWF-binding domain from Factor VIIIa, we propose that activation of Factor VIII by thrombin may elicit release of activated Factor VIII from vWF and thereby make it fully available for platelet binding."
https://openalex.org/W1598764033,"The possibility that protein kinase C is involved in phototransduction by phosphorylating rhodopsin was explored in situ and in vitro. Pretreatment of intact retinas with phorbol myristate acetate markedly increased the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin, with the greatest effects observed at lower light levels. Phorbol myristate acetate treatment did not affect rhodopsin phosphorylation in retinas not exposed to light, suggesting that protein kinase C modulates the phosphorylation state of rhodopsin in a light-dependent manner. Limited proteolysis of rhodopsin phosphorylated in situ indicates that protein kinase C modifies rhodopsin on a domain distinct from that recognized by rhodopsin kinase. In vitro, protein kinase C purified from bovine retinas phosphorylated unbleached and bleached rhodopsin. Our results are consistent with protein kinase C phosphorylating unbleached rhodopsin in response to low light, suggesting that protein kinase C plays a role in light adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1505026545,"Insecticidal crystal proteins (delta-endotoxins), CryIA(a) and CryIA(c), from Bacillus thuringiensis are 82% homologous. Despite this homology, CryIA(c) was determined to have 10-fold more insecticidal activity toward Heliothis virescens and Trichoplusia ni than CryIA(a). Reciprocal recombinations between these two genes were performed by the homolog-scanning technique. The resultant mutants had different segments of their primary sequences exchanged. Bioassays with toxin proteins from these mutants revealed that amino acids 335-450 on CryIA(c) are associated with the activity against T. ni, whereas amino acids 335-615 on the same toxin are required to exchange full H. virescens specificity. One chimeric protein toxin, involving residues 450-612 from CryIA(c), demonstrated 30 times more activity against H. virescens than the native parental toxin, indicating that this region plays an important role in H. virescens specificity. The structural integrity of mutant toxin proteins was assessed by treatment with bovine trypsin. All actively toxic proteins formed a 65-kDA trypsin-resistant active toxic core, similar to the parental CryIA(c) toxin, indicating that toxin protein structure was not altered significantly. Contrarily, certain inactive mutant proteins were susceptible to complete protease hydrolysis, indicating that their lack of toxicity may have been due to structural alterations."
https://openalex.org/W1509316489,"Phorbol esters (TPA) and concanavalin A (ConA) are known to induce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production in murine thymoma EL-4 cells by mRNA stabilization. The role of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) in GM-CSF mRNA stabilization induced by TPA and ConA in EL-4 cells was examined by transfection studies using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructions. The GM-CSF 3'-UTR contains a 63-nucleotide region at its 3' end with repeating ATTTA motifs which is responsible for mRNA degradation in a variety of cell types (Shaw, G., and Kamen, R. (1986) Cell 46, 659-666). We produced constructs containing most of the GM-CSF 3'-UTR (303 nucleotides, pRSV-CATgm) or the 3'-terminal AT-rich region (116 nucleotides, pRSV-CATau) and measured CAT enzyme activity and CAT mRNA after transient transfection into EL-4 and NIH 3T3 cells. Low levels of CAT activity were seen in both cells with either plasmid compared with levels of CAT activity obtained with pRSV-CAT. TPA treatment caused an approximately 10-fold increase in CAT activity and mRNA in EL-4 cells transfected with pRSV-CATgm. No increases were seen in EL-4 cells transfected with pRSV-CATau or pRSV-CAT. No response to TPA was detected in transfected NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that the response to TPA is relatively cell-specific. There was no increase in CAT activity after ConA treatment in EL-4 or NIH 3T3 cells transfected with any of the constructs suggesting that the GM-CSF 3'-UTR lacks elements that can respond alone to ConA. Nuclear run-on and actinomycin D chase experiments in EL-4 cells showed that TPA induces CAT activity via mRNA stabilization. By linker-substitution mutagenesis we show that TPA inducibility depends on a 60-nucleotide region of the 3'-UTR whose 5' end is located 160 nucleotides upstream of the 5' end of the AU-rich region."
https://openalex.org/W1568802110,"The effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the regulation of the estrogen receptor (ER) was investigated in this study. After treatment with 100 nM TPA the concentration of receptor protein was measured using an enzyme immunoassay. By 24 h the receptor protein declined by about 80% from a level of approximately 236 fmol of ER/mg of protein in control cells to 50 fmol of ER/mg of protein in cells treated with TPA. Similar results were obtained with an estrogen receptor ligand binding assay. After removal of TPA, the level of ER returned to control values. 4-alpha-Phorbol, a compound related to TPA, had no effect on ER. The effects of TPA on ER expression appear to be mediated by activation of protein kinase C as H-7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocks these effects. In addition to the effect on ER protein, TPA treatment also resulted in a decrease in the steady-state level of ER mRNA as determined by a RNase protection assay. The metabolic inhibitor cycloheximide was unable to prevent the TPA-induced decrease in ER mRNA. Transcription run-off experiments demonstrated that TPA had no effect on ER gene transcription. A half-life study demonstrated that TPA decreased ER mRNA half-life by a factor of 6 from approximately 4 h in control cells to 40 min in TPA-treated cells. These data suggest that the decline in ER expression is mediated by post-transcriptional destabilization of ER mRNA."

Immunoblot and Northern analyses demonstrate that Gbe protein and mRNA is not present in Drosophila mutants that lack eyes. Immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analyses further demonstrate that Gbe is expressed in the eyes but not in the brain, whereas Gbb is abundantly expressed in the brain. The Gbe product is approximately 45% identical to previously identified G beta subunits and defines a new G beta class. Its localization suggests a possible role in phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W1559683256,"The effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on total and polarized protein secretion was examined in MDCK cells. Increasing concentrations of BFA have increasingly inhibitory effects on total protein secretion. The total protein secretion was essentially unaffected by BFA at 0.5 microgram/ml. When the BFA concentration was increased to 10 and 30 micrograms/ml, the total protein secretion was reduced to about 70 and 25%, respectively, of the control level. Consistent with this effect on total protein secretion, the Golgi structure as revealed by C6-NBD-ceramide (a fluorescent ceramide analog) staining was essentially unaltered by 0.5 microgram/ml BFA, while 10 and 30 micrograms/ml BFA significantly dispersed the Golgi apparatus. When the polarity of protein secretion was examined, it was found that the ratio of proteins secreted from the apical to those from the basolateral surface was reduced from 1.5-2.0 to 0.4-0.7 by all three BFA concentrations. Furthermore, several proteins which are preferentially released from the apical surface were found to be released without apparent surface polarity, while several other proteins which were preferentially released from the basolateral surface were unaffected. This study suggests that BFA, at 0.5 microgram/ml, can selectively inhibit protein secretion from the apical surface without affecting total protein secretion. The inhibition of apical secretion results in enhanced protein secretion from the basolateral surface."
https://openalex.org/W1484221662,"The substrate specificity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated using synthetic peptides corresponding to the local phosphorylation site sequence around Ser-230 in the yeast transcriptional activator ADR1. ADR1 is required for the expression of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase. Yeast cAPK (encoded by the TPK1 gene) phosphorylated Ser-230 in the synthetic peptide ADR1-217-234, VRKRYLKKLTRRASFSAQ-NH2, with a Km of 5.3 microM compared with 46 microM for LRRASLG (Kemptide). Porcine heart cAPK phosphorylated the ADR1 peptide and Kemptide with the considerable lower Km values of 0.23 and 1.6 microM, respectively. These results indicate that the ADR1 peptide is an excellent substrate for cAPK. Both the yeast and mammalian protein kinases qualitatively shared a number of substrate specificity determinants in common involving residues on the proximal NH2-terminal side and up to the +4 position of the COOH-terminal side of the phosphoacceptor. The mammalian enzyme, however, had a much higher affinity for its substrates than did the yeast enzyme. In addition, the yeast and mammalian enzymes displayed several quantitative differences in their preferences for particular peptide substrates. In particular, the mammalian enzyme strongly preferred substrates with NH2-terminal extensions beyond the -4 position relative to the phosphoacceptor. These results suggest that all eukaryotic cAPKs recognize similar but not identical substrate specificity determinants. They also suggest that the different affinities for substrates that inhere to the individual enzymes could influence their physiological roles."
https://openalex.org/W2021951330,"Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) do not express the typical neuronal intermediate filament proteins (IFPs), the neurofilament triplet proteins. Immunocytochemical evidence shows that ORNs coexpress vimentin and peripherin but distribute them differently. Specifically, ORNs contain vimentin in dendrites, cell bodies, and axons, but not in terminals in glomeruli; peripherin is present in axons, but excluded from dendrites, cell bodies, and terminal glomeruli. In adult rats, ORN axon fascicles are variably stained with antisera for peripherin; in juvenile rats, staining of fascicles is uniform. Staining with antibody to vimentin is uniform in both adult and juvenile ORN axon fascicles. The unusual pattern of IFP expression and intracellular sorting may have implications for the unique plastic and regenerative capacities of these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1524043385,"Sulfoglucuronyl glycolipids (SGGLs) are temporally and spatially regulated molecules present in the nervous system during its development. The characteristics of the rat brain enzyme glucuronyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of SGGLs have been described. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid (GlcA) from UDP-GlcA to terminal galactose of the neolacto (type 2) series of glycolipids to form beta 1-3-linked glucuronyl neolacto glycolipids. The enzyme was highly specific for the neolacto series of acceptor glycolipids, neolactotetraosylceramide (nLcOse4Cer), neolactohexaosylceramide (nLcOse6-Cer), and neolactooctaosylceramide (nLcOse8Cer) and was different from the drug-inducible phenol:GlcA transferase. Considerable activity of GlcA transferase was present in the adult rat cerebral cortex, even though SGGLs almost completely disappeared from the cortex by postnatal day 15. In the cerebellum, although levels of SGGLs increased with development, the specific activity of GlcA transferase declined. The results indicated that GlcA transferase was not a regulatory enzyme controlling the expression of SGGLs. Measurements of the levels of nLcOse4Cer and nLcOse6Cer in these neural tissues indicated that the availability of these precursors may regulate the differential expression of SGGLs seen previously. GlcA transferase was significantly reduced in the cerebellar Purkinje cell degenerating murine mutant (pcd/pcd), which is consistent with the loss of SGGLs in the cerebellum of this mutant and specific association of these glycolipids with Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524195561,"The interaction between G-actin and myosin subfragment-1 (S1) has been monitored by pyrenyl-actin fluorescence and light scattering. In low ionic strength buffer and in the absence of ATP the polymerization of G-actin induced by myosin subfragment-1 is preceded by the formation of binary GS and ternary G2S complexes in which S1 interacts tightly in rapid equilibrium (K greater than 10(7) M-1) with one and two G-actin molecules, respectively. Pyrenyl fluorescence of G-actin is enhanced 4-fold in GS and 3-fold in G2S. At concentrations of G-actin and S1 in the micromolar range and above, G2S is the predominant species at G-actin/S1 ratios equal to or greater than 1. The isomer of myosin subfragment-1 carrying the A1 light chain, S1(A1), forms a tighter ternary complex than the isomer S1(A2). Actin-bound ATP is not hydrolyzed upon formation of GS and G2S. In the presence of one molar equivalent or more of myosin subfragment-1/mol of G-actin, in low ionic strength buffer containing no nucleotides, G-actin polymerizes faster in the presence of S1(A1) than in the presence of S1(A2). The interaction of S1 with G-actin is inhibited by the binding of ATP or ADP to S1, ATP having a higher affinity for S1 than ADP. The possible structural similarity of the G2S complex to the F-acto-S1 complex in the rigor state and the potential significance of a ternary (actin)2-myosin interaction for actomyosin-based motility are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1544958839,"Two mutants of the spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) were constructed, expressed by using a heterologous expression system previously described (Aliverti, A., Jansen, T., Zanetti, G., Ronchi, S., Herrmann, R. G., and Curti, B. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 191, 551-555), and purified to homogeneity. The mutant enzymes FNR-Lys116Gln and FNR-Lys244Gln were similar to the wild-type enzyme in the physicochemical properties measured; however, both enzymes showed a lower activity. Steady-state kinetic analyses and NADP+ binding measurements of the mutant proteins have revealed that the Lys116Gln enzyme had a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KmNADPH) 500-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, and its interaction with NADP+ was greatly impaired. The Lys244Gln enzyme instead had almost the same kcat in the ferricyanide reductase reaction as the wild-type enzyme, while higher values of KmNADPH and Kd for NADP+ were observed. Thus, protein engineering has enabled us to define the role of Lys-116 and Lys-244 in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase; whereas Lys-244 contributes to the stabilization of the Michaelis complex, the Lys-116 side chain plays an important role also in the further steps of the catalytic cycle, because both Km and kcat are highly affected by the mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2140482361,"Posttranslational processing/modification is required for membrane localization and activation of ras proteins. In the case of yeast RAS2 protein, we have reported that the process starts with the removal of the initiator methionine followed by polyisoprenylation, removal of 3 amino acid residues from the C terminus, methyl esterification, and fatty acid acylation (Fujiyama, A., and Tamanoi, F. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3362-3368). In this study, we demonstrate that polyisoprenylation and methyl esterification of the cysteine residue in the C-terminal domain of the RAS2 protein are involved in the conversion process from precursor form to intermediate form. The polyisoprenoid moiety attached to the RAS2 protein was identified as a 15-carbon farnesyl group through two independent experiments: the release of S-farnesylcysteine with carboxypeptidase Y from the RAS2 protein, and the recovery of radioactive farnesol through methyliodide treatment of the RAS2 protein purified from yeast cells labeled with [3H]mevalonic acid. The farnesyl group attached to the RAS2 protein was detected predominantly in the C-terminal peptide, SGSGGCC, both in the intermediate and in the fatty acid acylated RAS2 protein. The C-terminal cysteine of the intermediate protein is also modified by methyl esterification in a nearly stoichiometric manner."
https://openalex.org/W1553377540,"The possibility of the existence of a covalent enzyme-phosphoryl intermediate, E-PO3, during catalysis of phosphate ester hydrolysis by the purple acid phosphatase (PAP) from bovine spleen has been examined. Transphosphorylation experiments show that up to 22% of the phosphoryl group from p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) can be transferred to primary alcohols. Burst experiments at high pH (9.1 or 8.1 for reduced or oxidized PAP, respectively), where hydrolysis of a phosphoenzyme intermediate is expected to be rate-limiting, show clear evidence for stoichiometric bursts of p-nitrophenolate from PNPP. The formation of base-stable, acid-sensitive adducts between PAP and the 32PO3 group of [gamma-32P]ATP has been demonstrated. The pH dependence of the kinetics parameters for reduced PAP has been determined over the range pH 3-8; a feature with a pKa of approximately 6.75 that is attributable to the enzyme-substrate complex is observed. Taken together, the present results are consistent with a two-stem pseudo Uni Bi mechanism that utilizes a covalent enzyme-phosphoryl intermediate, possibly a phosphohistidine."
https://openalex.org/W1637569250,"The presence of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins was investigated in subcellular fractions from skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle homogenate, transverse tubules, triads, sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes, and cytosol fractions were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The presence of GTP-binding proteins was explored by incubation of these blots with [alpha-32P] GTP. GTP labeled two polypeptides of Mr = 23,000 and 29,000 in all the fractions examined. Binding of [alpha-32P]GTP was specific and dependent on Mg2+. The 23-kDa polypeptide was labeled to a higher extent with [alpha-32P]GTP than the 29-kDa polypeptide, although both were enriched in transverse tubule fractions. A GTP-binding polypeptide of 40 kDa was also enriched in transverse tubule preparations and identified as Gi alpha by immunostaining with anti-Gi alpha. Using a blot overlay approach and [alpha-32P]GTP-labeled cytosolic components, several polypeptides were identified that interact with the 23- and 29-kDa GTP-binding proteins. Among these components were polypeptides of Mr = 60,000, 47,000, 44,000, 42,000, and 38,000, which were mainly of cytosolic origin but also associated with triads and transverse tubule membranes. The 47-, 44-, 42-, and 38-kDa polypeptides were found to be structurally related to the glycolytic enzymes enolase, 3-phosphoglyceric phosphokinase, aldolase, and glycoeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. The purified glycolytic enzymes specifically bound the 23- and 29-kDa GTP-binding proteins under both denaturing and nondenaturing conditions. The association of the GTP-binding proteins with these polypeptides was resistant to detergents such as 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), Triton X-100, and Tween. A 23-kDa GTP-binding protein purified from chromaffin cells bound to a 157-kDa polypeptide in triads and chromaffin cell membranes. The 157-kDa polypeptide was a minor component in these membranes and not related to the subunits of the dihydropyridine receptor. In view of the proposed function of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins in processes such as membrane communication and secretion coupling, the association of these proteins with transverse tubules and triads in skeletal muscle is discussed in terms of a role in signal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1587673083,"Biologically active colloid-gold complexes were used to compare ligand-induced microaggregation, redistribution, and internalization of insulin receptors on Rat 1 fibroblasts expressing wild type (HIRc) or tyrosine kinase-defective (HIR A/K1018) human insulin receptors. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) and alpha 2-macroglobulin receptors also were compared. On both cell types, all four unoccupied receptor types occurred predominantly as single receptors. Ligand binding caused receptor microaggregation. Microaggregation of wild type or kinase-defective insulin receptors or IGF I receptors was not different. alpha 2-Macroglobulin receptors formed larger microaggregates. Compared to wild type insulin or IGF I receptors, accumulation of kinase-defective insulin receptor microaggregates in endocytic structures was decreased, and the size of microaggregates in coated pits was significantly smaller. As a result, receptor-mediated internalization of gold-insulin by HIR A/K1018 cells was less than 6% of the cell-associated particles compared to approximately 60% of the particles in HIRc cells. On HIR A/K1018 cells, alpha 2-macroglobulin and IGF I were internalized via coated pits demonstrating that those structures were functional. These results suggest that: 1) ATP binding, receptor autophosphorylation, and activation of receptor kinase activity are not required for receptor microaggregation; 2) receptor microaggregation per se is not sufficient to cause ligand-induced receptor-mediated internalization or the biological effects of insulin; and 3) autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit or activation of the receptor kinase activity is required for the insulin-induced concentration of occupied receptors in coated pits."
https://openalex.org/W1655848190,"The in vivo membrane assembly of the mannitol permease, the mannitol Enzyme II (IImtl) of the Escherichia coli phosphotransferase system, has been studied employing molecular genetic approaches. Removal of the N-terminal amphiphilic leader of the permease and replacement with a short hydrophobic sequence resulted in an inactive protein unable to transport mannitol into the cell or catalyze either phosphoenol-pyruvate-dependent or mannitol 1-phosphate-dependent mannitol phosphorylation in vitro. The altered protein (68 kDa) was quantitatively cleaved by an endogenous protease to a membrane-associated 39-kDa fragment and a soluble 28-kDa fragment as revealed by Western blot analyses. Overproduction of the wild-type plasmid-encoded protein also led to cleavage, but repression of the synthesis of the plasmid-encoded enzyme by inclusion of glucose in the growth medium prevented cleavage. Several mtlA-phoA gene fusions encoding fused proteins with N-terminal regions derived from the mannitol permease and C-terminal regions derived from the mature portion of alkaline phosphatase were constructed. In the first fusion protein, F13, the N-terminal 13-aminoacyl residue amphiphilic leader sequence of the mannitol permease replaced the hydrophobic leader sequence of alkaline phosphatase. The resultant fusion protein was inefficiently translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane and became peripherally associated with both the inner and outer membranes, presumably via the noncleavable N-terminal amphiphilic sequence. The second fusion protein, F53, in which the N-terminal 53 residues of the mannitol permease were fused to alkaline phosphatase, was efficiently translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane and was largely found anchored to the inner membrane with the catalytic domain of alkaline phosphatase facing the periplasm. This 53-aminoacyl residue sequence included the amphiphilic leader sequence and a single hydrophobic, potentially transmembrane, segment. Analyses of other MtlA-PhoA fusion proteins led to the suggestion that internal amphiphilic segments may function to facilitate initiation of polypeptide trans-membrane translocation. The dependence of IImtl insertion on the N-terminal amphiphilic leader sequence was substantiated employing site-specific mutagenesis. The N-terminal sequence of the native permease is Met-Ser-Ser-Asp-Ile-Lys-Ile-Lys-Val-Gln-Ser-Phe-Gly.... The following point mutants were isolated, sequenced, and examined regarding the effects of the mutations on insertion of IImtl into the membrane: 1) S3P; 2) D4P; 3) D4L; 4) D4R; 5) D4H; 6) I5N; 7) K6P; and 8) K8P.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1565383688,"The role of mevalonate and its products in the regulation of cellular proliferation was examined using 6-fluoromevalonate (Fmev), a compound that blocks the conversion of mevalonate pyrophosphate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate. Fmev suppressed DNA synthesis by a variety of transformed and malignant T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell lines. In contrast to results previously reported with mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood T cell DNA synthesis, low concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) alone could not restore proliferation to these cell lines. The same concentrations of LDL were able to provide sufficient cholesterol and support the growth of all cell lines when mevalonate synthesis was blocked with a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lovastatin. Fmev-mediated inhibition was totally prevented in some but not all cell lines when the concentration of exogenous LDL was increased 5-10-fold above that required to permit proliferation of lovastatin-blocked cells. Residual HMG-CoA reductase activity of cells cultured with LDL inversely correlated with the restoration of growth to Fmev-blocked cultures. Confirmation of the critical role of HMG-CoA reductase activity and mevalonate synthesis in the inhibition of cellular proliferation by Fmev was obtained by demonstrating that the specific inhibitor of this enzyme, lovastatin, restored proliferation of Fmev-blocked cells. Furthermore, supplementation of cultures with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, markedly inhibited proliferation of Fmev-blocked cells. These findings indicate that mevalonate or one of the mevalonate phosphates, which accumulates in Fmev-blocked cells, is a critical negative regulator of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1579065888,"The conformations of two RNA dodecamers that differ markedly in affinity for the regA protein from bacteriophage T4 have been examined by NMR to see if the ability of that protein to discriminate between mRNAs is based on pre-existing differences in their three-dimensional structures. One of the RNAs examined has the same sequence as the site where regA protein binds when it inhibits the expression of gene 44's mRNA. The second RNA differs from the first in having a U instead of a G at position -9; it binds regA protein 100 times less tightly. The NMR data indicate that both RNAs have similar single-stranded conformations and that they each resemble an isolated strand of a double helix. They also show that most, if not all of the ribose rings in both molecules have appreciable 2'-endo puckering. It is unlikely that regA protein distinguishes between these two molecules on the basis of differences in their global conformations in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1585026366,"A survey of 124 protein and/or nucleic acid chemistry facilities has provided a basis for estimating the resources needed to establish a facility, the financial support needed to keep it operating, and the technical capabilities it might reasonably be expected to achieve. Based on these data, an average core facility occupied 870 ft2, was staffed by three full-time personnel, and was equipped with 4-5 major instrument systems. Because user fees generated an average of about $101,000/year in income compared with an average operating budget of about $197,000/year, even a facility that charged user fees would, on average, still require an annual subsidy of about $96,000. Although most government and industrial core facilities did not assess user fees, at least 83 of the 124 respondents did have a preestablished schedule of service charges that enabled a compilation to be made of the average cost of providing a number of typical facility analyses and syntheses. The greater than 100-fold range in charges assessed in core facilities for seemingly identical services was shown to result from the equally large range in the degree of subsidization of these laboratories. Although an average facility might be expected to offer four or five of the following six major services--amino acid sequencing, amino acid analysis, HPLC peptide isolation, peptide synthesis, fragmentation of proteins and DNA synthesis--less than 10% of the responding laboratories provided mass spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, or RNA synthesis. With the exception of peptide synthesis, which had an average turn-around time of about 24 days, all other major services had turn-around times that averaged in the range of 4-9 days. Additional data are summarized regarding average sample throughput in core laboratories and the amount of protein that is needed for hydrolysis/amino acid analysis and sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W1491458790,"The dimeric hemoglobin isolated from Scapharca inaequivalvis, HbI, is notable for its highly cooperative oxygen binding and for the unusual proximity of its heme groups. We now report that the oxidized protein, an equilibrium mixture of a dimeric high spin aquomet form and a monomeric low spin hemichrome, binds ferrocyanide tightly which allows for internal electron transfer with the heme iron. Surprisingly, when ferricyanide-oxidized HbI is exposed to CO, its spectrum shifts to that of the ferrous CO derivative. Gasometric removal of CO leads to the oxidized species rather than to ferrous deoxy-HbI. At equilibrium, CO binds with an apparent affinity (p50) of about 10-25 mm of Hg and no cooperativity (20 degrees C, 10-50 mM buffers at pH 6.1). The kinetics of CO binding under pseudo-first order conditions are biphasic (t1/2 of 15-50 s at pH 6.1). The rates depend on protein, but not on CO concentration. The nitrite-oxidized protein is not reduced readily in the presence of CO unless one equivalent of ferrocyanide, but not of ferricyanide, is added. We infer that ferrocyanide, produced in the oxidation reaction, is tightly bound to the protein forming a redox couple with the heme iron. CO shifts the redox equilibrium by acting as a trap for the reduced heme. The equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the process have been accounted for in a reaction scheme where the internal electron transfer reaction is the rate-limiting step."
https://openalex.org/W1498365901,"The T84 colonic cell line, a cultured Cl- secretory cell, elevates intracellular free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) in a concentration-dependent manner when exposed to carbachol or histamine. As determined with a fluorescence microscope imaging system, exposure of T84 cells to 100 microM carbachol or histamine resulted in an immediate [Ca2+]i rise of approximately 50-80 nM in all cells. Preincubation of monolayers for 1 h or longer with 0.4 microM phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) reduced the number of cells which responded to histamine or carbachol and reduced the magnitude of the increase in the responding cells. This effect reached its maximum after 2 h and persisted for at least 24 h of PDB incubation. Binding of quinuclidinyl benzilate, a cholinergic receptor antagonist, indicated that down-regulation of external receptors was not an explanation for this effect. Examination of phospholipase C activity in T84 cell membranes showed increased basal activity in PDB-treated compared with control cells. Measurement of inositol phosphates generated by intact cells using myo-[3H]inositol incorporation or receptor binding assays showed that 2 h of incubation with PDB elevated basal levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and prevented any further carbachol-induced generation of inositol trisphosphate. Probably as a consequence, both total cell calcium and Ca2+ ionophore-releasable calcium were decreased after 2 h of PDB incubation. Membrane-associated protein kinase C activity was elevated after a 2 h exposure to PDB but was below the level of detection after 24 h with PDB. Protein kinase C antagonists neither duplicated nor blocked the uncoupling of carbachol receptors induced by long term treatment with PDB. The results suggest that prolonged PDB incubation caused uncoupling and elevation of phospholipase C activity from cholinergic and histaminergic receptor regulation resulting in increased basal levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Protein kinase C apparently is not involved directly in the mechanism that leads to these effects."
https://openalex.org/W1558521385,"Conductive transport of chloride ion is important in controlling ion and fluid secretion by exocrine tissues. The current study was directed at identifying proteins in the intestinal brush-border membrane that may be involved with conductive chloride transport. Reaction of total brush-border membrane protein with phenyl-isothiocyanate inhibited conductive chloride transport into brush-border membrane vesicles. The conductive transport process was protected from this inhibition by including the ligands Cl- and alpha-phenylcinnamate in the reaction mixture. Brush-border membrane protein protected by this procedure and labeled with fluorescein had an apparent molecular mass in the region of 130 and 23 kDa on separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of brush-border membrane protein with [gamma-32P] ATP and endogenous protein kinase under conditions causing activation of chloride conductance in membrane vesicles caused the transfer of 32P to several proteins, including ones in the same molecular size range (130 and 23 kDa) as those identified by the fluorescein labeling procedure. Conductive chloride transport in porcine intestinal brush-border vesicles may occur via proteins identified by this differential labeling procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2127697290,"A cohort of phase I and phase II summary statements for the SBIR grant applications was evaluated to determine the strengths and weaknesses in approved and disapproved applications. An analysis of outcome variables (disapproval or unfunded status) was examined with respect to exposure variables (strengths or shortcomings). Logistic regression models were developed for comparisons to measure the predictive value of shortcomings and strengths to the outcomes. Disapproved phase I results were compared with an earlier 1985 study. Although the magnitude of the frequencies of shortcomings was greater in the present study, the relative rankings within shortcoming class were more alike than different. Also, the frequencies of shortcomings were, with one exception, not significantly different in the two studies. Differences in the summary statement review may have accounted for some differences observed between the 1985 data and results of the present study. Comparisons of Approved/Disapproved and Approved-Unfunded/Funded yielded the following observations. For phase I applicants, a lack of a clearly stated, testable hypothesis, a poorly qualified or described investigative team, and inadequate methodological approaches contributed significantly (in that order) to a rating of disapproval. A critical flaw for phase II proposals was failure to accomplish objectives of the phase I study. Methodological issues also dominate the distinctions in both comparison groups. A clear result of the data presented here and that published previously is that SBIR applicants need continuing assistance to improve the chances of their success. These results should serve as a guide to assist NIH staff as they provide information to prospective applicants focusing on key elements of the application. A continuing review of the SBIR program would be helpful to evaluate the quality of the submitted science.—Vener, K. J.; Calkins, B. M.
