https://openalex.org/W2050689355,"Pluripotent stem cells have been generated from mouse and human somatic cells by viral expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. A major limitation of this technology is the use of potentially harmful genome-integrating viruses. We generated mouse induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from fibroblasts and liver cells by using nonintegrating adenoviruses transiently expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. These adenoviral iPS (adeno-iPS) cells show DNA demethylation characteristic of reprogrammed cells, express endogenous pluripotency genes, form teratomas, and contribute to multiple tissues, including the germ line, in chimeric mice. Our results provide strong evidence that insertional mutagenesis is not required for in vitro reprogramming. Adenoviral reprogramming may provide an improved method for generating and studying patient-specific stem cells and for comparing embryonic stem cells and iPS cells."

Carbon-13 ( 13 C) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectra of GO for natural abundance 13 C have poor signal-to-noise ratios. Approximately 100% 13 C-labeled graphite was made and converted to 13 C-labeled GO, and 13 C SSNMR was used to reveal details of the chemical bonding network, including the chemical groups and their connections. Carbon-13–labeled graphite can be used to prepare chemically modified graphenes for 13 C SSNMR analysis with enhanced sensitivity and for fundamental studies of 13 C-labeled graphite and graphene."

https://openalex.org/W2087326716,"Almost two decades after CFTR was identified as the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), we still lack answers to many questions about the pathogenesis of the disease, and it remains incurable. Mice with a disrupted CFTR gene have greatly facilitated CF studies, but the mutant mice do not develop the characteristic manifestations of human CF, including abnormalities of the pancreas, lung, intestine, liver, and other organs. Because pigs share many anatomical and physiological features with humans, we generated pigs with a targeted disruption of both CFTR alleles. Newborn pigs lacking CFTR exhibited defective chloride transport and developed meconium ileus, exocrine pancreatic destruction, and focal biliary cirrhosis, replicating abnormalities seen in newborn humans with CF. The pig model may provide opportunities to address persistent questions about CF pathogenesis and accelerate discovery of strategies for prevention and treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2066350682,"The manufacture of smaller, faster, more efficient microelectronic components is a major scientific and technological challenge, driven in part by a constant need for smaller lithographically defined features and patterns. Traditional self-assembling approaches based on block copolymer lithography spontaneously yield nanometer-sized hexagonal structures, but these features are not consistent with the industry-standard rectilinear coordinate system. We present a modular and hierarchical self-assembly strategy, combining supramolecular assembly of hydrogen-bonding units with controlled phase separation of diblock copolymers, for the generation of nanoscale square patterns. These square arrays will enable simplified addressability and circuit interconnection in integrated circuit manufacturing and nanotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2086615189,"The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description, from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system realization, but can instead be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies through measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step in the investigation of the quantum-classical boundary. Although trapped-atom state reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar experiments with trapped photons because cavities that can store light for very long times are required. Here we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Atoms crossing the cavity one by one are used to extract information about the field. We obtain images of coherent states, Fock states with a definite photon number and 'Schrödinger cat' states (superpositions of coherent states with different phases). These states are equivalently represented by their density matrices or Wigner functions. Quasi-classical coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function, whereas the Wigner functions of Fock and Schrödinger cat states show oscillations and negativities revealing quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence that quickly washes out such oscillations. We observe this process and follow the evolution of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrödinger cat states at successive times. Our reconstruction procedure is a useful tool for further decoherence and quantum feedback studies of fields trapped in one or two cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2056406543,"In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time-lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization (typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2048233403,"An epistasis map (E-MAP) was constructed in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe , by systematically measuring the phenotypes associated with pairs of mutations. This high-density, quantitative genetic interaction map focused on various aspects of chromosome function, including transcription regulation and DNA repair/replication. The E-MAP uncovered a previously unidentified component of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery ( rsh1 ) and linked the RNAi pathway to several other biological processes. Comparison of the S. pombe E-MAP to an analogous genetic map from the budding yeast revealed that, whereas negative interactions were conserved between genes involved in similar biological processes, positive interactions and overall genetic profiles between pairs of genes coding for physically associated proteins were even more conserved. Hence, conservation occurs at the level of the functional module (protein complex), but the genetic cross talk between modules can differ substantially."

https://openalex.org/W2043009635,"Cultural boundaries have often been the basis for discrimination, nationalism, religious wars, and genocide. Little is known, however, about how cultural groups form or the evolutionary forces behind group affiliation and ingroup favoritism. Hence, we examine these forces experimentally and show that arbitrary symbolic markers, though initially meaningless, evolve to play a key role in cultural group formation and ingroup favoritism because they enable a population of heterogeneous individuals to solve important coordination problems. This process requires that individuals differ in some critical but unobservable way and that their markers be freely and flexibly chosen. If these conditions are met, markers become accurate predictors of behavior. The resulting social environment includes strong incentives to bias interactions toward others with the same marker, and subjects accordingly show strong ingroup favoritism. When markers do not acquire meaning as accurate predictors of behavior, players show a markedly reduced taste for ingroup favoritism. Our results support the prominent evolutionary hypothesis that cultural processes can reshape the selective pressures facing individuals and so favor the evolution of behavioral traits not previously advantaged."
https://openalex.org/W1985037192,"Having repeatedly retrieved an object from a location, human infants tend to search the same place even when they observe the object being hidden at another location. This perseverative error is usually explained by infants' inability to inhibit a previously rewarded search response or to recall the new location. We show that the tendency to commit this error is substantially reduced (from 81 to 41%) when the object is hidden in front of 10-month-old infants without the experimenter using the communicative cues that normally accompany object hiding in this task. We suggest that this improvement is due to an interpretive bias that normally helps infants learn from demonstrations but misleads them in the context of a hiding game. Our finding provides an alternative theoretical perspective on the nature of infants' perseverative search errors."
https://openalex.org/W2022530056,"We take advantage of our knowledge of the neural circuitry of reward to investigate a puzzling economic phenomenon: Why do people overbid in auctions? Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we observed that the social competition inherent in an auction results in a more pronounced blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response to loss in the striatum, with greater overbidding correlated with the magnitude of this response. Leveraging these neuroimaging results, we design a behavioral experiment that demonstrates that framing an experimental auction to emphasize loss increases overbidding. These results highlight a role for the contemplation of loss in understanding the tendency to bid “too high.” Current economic theories suggest overbidding may result from either “joy of winning” or risk aversion. By combining neuroeconomic and behavioral economic techniques, we find that another factor, namely loss contemplation in a social context, may mediate overbidding in auctions."
https://openalex.org/W2006112136,"Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) rather than antibodies play the primary role in recognition of antigens in the adaptive immune system of jawless vertebrates. Combinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) gene segments achieves the required repertoire for antigen recognition. We have determined a crystal structure for a VLR-antigen complex, VLR RBC36 in complex with the H-antigen trisaccharide from human blood type O erythrocytes, at 1.67 angstrom resolution. RBC36 binds the H-trisaccharide on the concave surface of the LRR modules of the solenoid structure where three key hydrophilic residues, multiple van der Waals interactions, and the highly variable insert of the carboxyl-terminal LRR module determine antigen recognition and specificity. The concave surface assembled from the most highly variable regions of the LRRs, along with diversity in the sequence and length of the highly variable insert, can account for the recognition of diverse antigens by VLRs."

We show that in membranes composed of zwitterionic lipids, i.e. phosphatidylcholine, melittin not only forms pores but also inhibits pore formation. We propose that these two modes of action are the result of two competing reactions: direct insertion into the membrane and binding parallel to the membrane surface. The direct insertion of melittin leads to pore formation, whereas the parallel conformation is inactive and prevents other melittin molecules from inserting, hence preventing pore formation.

Lytic or antimicrobial peptides are small proteins (12–50 amino acids) that affect cells by disrupting the barrier function of lipid membranes (1Brogden K.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (4406) Google Scholar). There is much interest in these peptides because of their potential pharmaceutical applications, e.g. as cancer drugs and antibiotics (2Finlay B.B. Hancock R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because of their small size and high stability, they can be obtained in large quantities. Of all lytic peptides, the 26-residue melittin is the best studied to date (for review see Ref. 3Raghuraman H. Chattopadhyay A. Biosci. Rep. 2007; 27: 189-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Melittin is the major constituent of the venom of the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Melittin has been reported to have anticancer effects and is already being used to treat pain and arthritis in Asia (4Son D.J. Lee J.W. Lee Y.H. Song H.S. Lee C.K. Hong J.T. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 115: 246-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Melittin can bind within milliseconds to lipid membranes and adopts an amphipatic α-helical conformation, oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. The perpendicular conformation is embedded in the membrane and is needed for pore formation, whereas the parallel conformation is inactive (5Lee M.T. Hung W.C. Chen F.Y. Huang H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These observations led to the proposal of a two-step model for pore formation, where melittin at low concentrations binds parallel to the membrane (Fig. 1A, step 1) and at higher concentrations shifts toward the perpendicular orientation (step 2), causing pore formation (10Yang L.

The transition from parallel to perpendicular is still poorly understood, especially because the cationic (5+ at neutral pH) melittin interacts strongly with the lipid headgroups (partitioning coefficient of 104–105 m–1 for phosphatidylcholine (PC) 2The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; CD, circular dichroism; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol.

Based on the high affinity of melittin for PC headgroups, it has been widely accepted that the concentration of melittin needed for pore formation is not dependent on the absolute melittin concentration but rather on the ratio of melittin to lipid molecules. However, this important implication has never been directly tested by varying the lipid concentration and determining the fractions of bound and free melittin. In this study we analyzed the lipid concentration dependence of melittin action and studied the reversibility of melittin binding, thereby resolving pore formation from binding events. Melittin was purchased from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ), and lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Albaster, AL). Liposomes (200 ± 50 nm in diameter) were prepared by rehydration of a dried lipid film, followed by flash freezing (liquid nitrogen) and thawing five times at 50 °C and subsequent extrusion through polycarbonate filters or sonication, as described (18van den Bogaart G.

Science. 2005; 309: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). For the calcein dequenching and the fluorescence-burst assays, the liposomes were separated from the free fluorophores by size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G-50, Sigma-Aldrich) (19Koçer A. Walko M. Meijberg W. Feringa B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and centrifugation (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys.

Feringa B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), with the liposomes loaded with 100 mm calcein in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The external medium was composed of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, plus 150 mm NaCl. The 100% level of leakage was determined using 0.03% (w/v) of the detergent Triton X-100. The dual-color fluorescence-burst assay was performed as described (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20van den Bogaart G. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 1233-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), with the only change that all experiments were performed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, supplemented with 150 mm NaCl to allow for direct comparison with the calcein dequenching experiments. The liposomes were labeled with the fluorescent lipid analog DiO (Invitrogen) and contained 5 μm glutathione labeled with Alexa fluor 633 (Invitrogen) as a leakage-marker (18van den Bogaart G.

The temperature was kept at 25 °C, and the sample compartment was continuously flushed with nitrogen gas. A correction was made for the background signal using a reference solution without the protein. We measured the melittin-induced pore formation as a function of the lipid concentration using the calcein dequenching assay (19Koçer A. Walko M. Meijberg W. Feringa B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 21Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), a fluorescence-burst assay (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20van den Bogaart G. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 1233-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and liposomes composed of pure DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine). The amount of melittin needed for calcein leakage was clearly dependent on the concentration of lipids (Fig. 2A). For each of the lipid concentrations, the concentration where half of the calcein leaked from the liposomes (C1/2) was obtained by fitting the melittin titration curves with a cumulative log normal distribution (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These C1/2 values were linearly related to the lipid concentration, and from a fit with a linear regression, a slope of 11 nm melittin/μm lipid and an offset of 21 nm melittin were obtained (Fig. 2B). We thus concluded that leakage is not only dependent on the melittin/lipid molecule ratio but also on the absolute concentration of melittin. The offset of the linear regression analysis indicates that melittin binding to the membrane is reversible (Fig. 1A, step 1). From the slope of the regression analysis, about 1 melittin per 90 lipid molecules (45 per monolayer) was needed for leakage of the 623 Da calcein (λex = 485 nm, λem = 520 nm). This value is in agreement with literature values but strongly depends on the precise experimental conditions, such as pH and ionic strength of the buffer, and the lipid composition (3Raghuraman H. Chattopadhyay A. Biosci. Rep. 2007; 27: 189-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 14Strómstedt A.A. Wessman P. Ringstad L. Edwards K. Malmsten M. J.

J. 1997; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 8 nm–44 μm melittin), the melittin in solution was predominantly present in an unstructured, most likely monomeric, form (Fig. 2C) (23Kubota S. Yang J.T. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 1493-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Brown L.R. Lauterwein J. Wúthrich K. Biochim. Biophys.

The results presented here can be interpreted in terms of the two-step model, where pore formation (Fig. 1A, step 2) leads to a decrease in the concentration of free melittin until below the critical threshold concentration needed for leakage. We performed experiments to establish whether melittin indeed interacted with the liposomes until no further leakage occurred. A two-step calcein dequenching experiment was devised where first melittin was added to liposomes and the calcein leakage was measured (Fig. 3A). A second batch of intact liposomes was then added to the solution, and the calcein leakage of this second batch was measured. If the melittin free in solution was depleted by the pore formation of the first batch of liposomes, one would expect no leakage from the second batch of liposomes. However, this was not the case, and the level of leakage of the second batch was significant, even at conditions where only partial (<100%) leakage of the first batch of liposomes was observed (Fig. 3B). This implies that melittin is capable of pore formation in freshly added liposomes, but not in liposomes already present in the solution. A dual-color fluorescence-burst experiment (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20van den Bogaart G. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 1233-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicated that this finding was independent of the lipid concentration, as similar results were obtained for 250-fold higher concentrations of lipids (Fig. 3C). Next, the fraction of melittin bound to the membrane and the reversibility of the binding were assessed. Melittin was added to liposome suspensions, and the liposomes were washed and pelleted by centrifugation (270,000 × g, 20 min). Tryptophan fluorescence was used to determine the fraction of melittin bound to the liposomes (Fig. 3D). About 1 melittin bound per 100 lipid molecules. Most important, melittin was readily removed from the liposomes by washing, indicating that binding of melittin to the membrane is reversible. In addition to the zwitterionic DOPC, we also performed two-step calcein dequenching experiments with liposomes composed of the anionic phospholipid DOPG (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol). For liposomes composed of DOPG, melittin elicited calcein leakage from the first but not from the second batch of liposomes (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, for DOPG, melittin did not cause leakage in freshly added liposomes, presumably because of the extremely high binding coefficient (e.g. ∼10-fold higher than for PC (14Strómstedt A.A. Wessman P. Ringstad L. Edwards K. Malmsten M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2007; 311: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Dufourcq J. Faucon J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 467: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)), which dropped the free concentration of melittin to below that needed for leakage. Indeed, binding experiments indicated that melittin bound much more strongly to DOPG than to DOPC liposomes because virtually all melittin was absorbed to the membrane for melittin/lipid molecule ratios up to 0.1. In addition, melittin could not be removed from the liposomes by washing, implying that binding of melittin to DOPG membranes is essentially irreversible (Fig. 4C). Our data clearly show that melittin is able to induce leakage in freshly added liposomes composed of DOPC (not of DOPG), but not in liposomes already present in solution and saturated with melittin. Melittin is thus able both to cause and to prevent pore formation. This cannot be understood in terms of the two-step model presented in the Introduction (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we propose an alternative mechanism for pore formation (Fig. 1B) in which the parallel binding to the membrane by melittin actually competes with the peptide insertion and thus pore formation. Here, and similar to the two-step model (11Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8347-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), α-helical melittin associates with the membrane either in an inactive conformation, oriented parallel to the membrane, or in a pore-forming conformation, inserted perpendicular in the membrane. However, contrary to the two-step model, the reorientation from parallel to perpendicular does not take place, but instead both the parallel binding and direct insertion are competing events. In addition, the membrane has only a limited capacity to absorb melittin, and hence melittin bound to the surface prevents other molecules from forming pores. This explains why melittin is both capable of pore formation and able to prevent leakage. The inhibition of pore formation by surface-bound melittin can be explained by the elasticity theory, where a repulsive force extending to a distance of about 2.5 nm was calculated for surface-adsorbed peptides (26Huang H.W. J. Phys. II France. 1995; 5: 1427-1431Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, where it was shown that magainin 2, a cationic α-helical pore-forming peptide similar to melittin, was not randomly localized on PC membranes. Rather, a minimum distance of about 2 nm was observed between the molecules (27Schúmann M. Dathe M. Wieprecht T. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4345-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Contrary to DOPC, essentially all melittin bound to liposomes composed of DOPG and did not cause pore formation in freshly added liposomes. This indicates that the disruption of membranes composed of anionic lipids probably proceeds via a mechanism different from that for DOPC. This is also apparent from our recent findings, that for DOPC the pore size is dependent on the melittin concentration (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as was also observed by others (28Ladokhin A.S. Selsted M.E. White S.H. Biophys.

J. 1997; 73: 831-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whereas for DOPG leakage is completely a-specific for compounds with diameters up to at least 5 nm, and leakage was accompanied by membrane fusion (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The interaction of melittin with PG headgroups is much stronger than for PC, and it has been proposed that melittin does not insert into the membrane but only accumulates at the surface. This asymmetric accumulation would lead to membrane thinning and nonselective membrane damage (14Strómstedt A.A. Wessman P. Ringstad L. Edwards K. Malmsten M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2007; 311: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Matsuzaki K. Yoneyama S. Miyajima K. Biophys.

At very high concentrations of melittin, the peptide might disrupt PC membranes in a similar fashion as PG membranes (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Popplewell J.F. Swann M.J. Freeman N.J. McDonnell C. Ford R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, these concentrations are much higher than needed for pore formation (e.g. melittin/lipid molecule ratios of 0.5 (18van den Bogaart G. Mika J.T. Krasnikov V. Poolman B. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Pore formation in membranes composed of PC headgroups might be physiologically more relevant than for anionic headgroups, because the erythrocyte membrane, the natural target of melittin, is mainly zwitterionic (35Verkleij A.J. Zwaal R.F. Roelofsen B. Comfurius P. Kastelijn D. Van Deenen L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 178-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Moreover, anionic lipids are preferentially located in the inner leaflet of the membrane. In conclusion, we show that melittin exerts two effects on liposomes composed of zwitterionic DOPC lipids. First, the peptide forms pores leading to content leakage from the vesicles. Second, melittin binds to the membrane surface in an inactive conformation, thereby preventing other melittin molecules from inserting into the bilayer and hence protecting the membrane from leakage. This level of understanding of the mechanism of action of lytic peptides is essential for their development as pharmaceutical agents, e.g. as antibiotics or hemolytic therapeutics. We thank A. Koçer, G. K. Schuurman-Wolters, and V. Krasnikov (University of Groningen, The Netherlands) for helpful advice."
https://openalex.org/W2003394211,"The Fc receptor of neonates (FcRn) mediates the apical-to-basolateral transcytosis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) across epithelial cells so that newborns are able to receive maternal antibodies. In this study Her et al. use electron tomography to visualize the transport of IgG during this process with a resolution of 4–6 nm. Individual FcRn ligands were identified inside intracellular organelles using a new gold enlargement technique compatible with high pressure frozen samples. The transcytosis pathways revealed show labelled-Fc moving through networks of vesicles as it migrates from the apical to basolateral surface. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) transports maternal IgG across epithelial barriers1,2, thereby providing the fetus or newborn with humoral immunity before its immune system is fully functional. In newborn rats, FcRn transfers IgG from milk to blood by apical-to-basolateral transcytosis across intestinal epithelial cells. The pH difference between the apical (pH 6.0–6.5) and basolateral (pH 7.4) sides of intestinal epithelial cells facilitates the efficient unidirectional transport of IgG, because FcRn binds IgG at pH 6.0–6.5 but not at pH 7 or more1,2. As milk passes through the neonatal intestine, maternal IgG is removed by FcRn-expressing cells in the proximal small intestine (duodenum and jejunum); remaining proteins are absorbed and degraded by FcRn-negative cells in the distal small intestine (ileum)3,4,5,6. Here we use electron tomography to make jejunal transcytosis visible directly in space and time, developing new labelling and detection methods to map individual nanogold-labelled Fc within transport vesicles7 and simultaneously to characterize these vesicles by immunolabelling. Combining electron tomography with a non-perturbing endocytic label allowed us to conclusively identify receptor-bound ligands, resolve interconnecting vesicles, determine whether a vesicle was microtubule-associated, and accurately trace FcRn-mediated transport of IgG. Our results present a complex picture in which Fc moves through networks of entangled tubular and irregular vesicles, only some of which are microtubule-associated, as it migrates to the basolateral surface. New features of transcytosis are elucidated, including transport involving multivesicular body inner vesicles/tubules and exocytosis through clathrin-coated pits. Markers for early, late and recycling endosomes each labelled vesicles in different and overlapping morphological classes, revealing spatial complexity in endo-lysosomal trafficking."

Their three-dimensional (3D) structure and transient dynamics are uncertain. Using 3D numerical simulations, we demonstrated that convection cells self-organize into pipelike upflow zones surrounded by narrow zones of focused and relatively warm downflow. This configuration ensures optimal heat transfer and efficient metal leaching for ore-deposit formation. Simulated fluid-residence times are as short as 3 years. The concentric flow geometry results from nonlinearities in fluid properties, and this may influence the behavior of other fluid-flow systems in Earth's crust."
https://openalex.org/W1992509039,"The class-3 semaphorins (sema3s) include seven family members. Six of them bind to neuropilin-1 (np1) or neuropilin-2 (np2) receptors or to both, while the seventh, sema3E, binds to the plexin-D1 receptor. Sema3B and sema3F were previously characterized as tumor suppressors and as inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis. To determine if additional class-3 semaphorins such as sema3A, sema3D, sema3E and sema3G possess anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic properties, we expressed the recombinant full length semaphorins in four different tumorigenic cell lines expressing different combinations of class-3 semaphorin receptors. We show for the first time that sema3A, sema3D, sema3E and sema3G can function as potent anti-tumorigenic agents. All the semaphorins we examined were also able to reduce the concentration of tumor associated blood vessels although the potencies of the anti-angiogenic effects varied depending on the tumor cell type. Surprisingly, there was little correlation between the ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and their anti-tumorigenic activity. None of the semaphorins inhibited the adhesion of the tumor cells to plastic or fibronectin nor did they modulate the proliferation of tumor cells cultured in cell culture dishes. However, various semaphorins were able to inhibit the formation of soft agar colonies from tumor cells expressing appropriate semaphorin receptors, although in this case too the inhibitory effect was not always correlated with the anti-tumorigenic effect. In contrast, the anti-tumorigenic effect of each of the semaphorins correlated very well with tumor cell expression of specific signal transducing receptors for particular semaphorins. This correlation was not broken even in cases in which the tumor cells expressed significant concentrations of endogenous semaphorins. Our results suggest that combinations of different class-3 semaphorins may be more effective than single semaphorins in cases in which tumor cells express more than one type of semaphorin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2020432242,"The ability to remove unwanted proteins is an important cellular feature. Classically, this involves the enzymatic addition of ubiquitin moieties followed by degradation in the proteasome. Nedd4 proteins are ubiquitin ligases important not only for protein degradation, but also for protein trafficking. Nedd4 proteins can bind to target proteins either by themselves or through adaptor protein Ndfip1 (Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1). An alternative mechanism for protein removal and trafficking is provided by exosomes, which are small vesicles (50–90-nm diameter) originating from late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Exosomes provide a rapid means of shedding obsolete proteins and also for cell to cell communication. In the present work, we show that Ndfip1 is detectable in exosomes secreted from transfected cells and also from primary neurons. Compared with control, Ndfip1 increases exosome secretion from transfected cells. Furthermore, while Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch are normally absent from exosomes, expression of Ndfip1 results in recruitment of all three Nedd4 proteins into exosomes. Together, these results suggest that Ndfip1 is important for protein trafficking via exosomes, and provides a mechanism for cargoing passenger proteins such as Nedd4 family proteins.

The ability to dispose of unwanted proteins is an important function during cellular homeostasis in health or disease. The best studied pathway for disposing of unwanted proteins involves the addition of ubiquitin chains to target proteins followed by degradation of the complex in the proteasome. A major class of enzymes involved in target recognition in this pathway is the E3 ligases with HECT (homology to the E6-associated protein C terminus domain) domains (1Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are archetypal members of this family, with ability to bind and ubiquitinate proteins containing PPXY motifs (2Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D.

Chao M.V. Neuron. 2006; 50: 549-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, Nedd4 family proteins (e.g. Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch) can also ubiquitinate target proteins that are bound to Nedd4 adaptors. One such adaptor is Ndfip1 (Nedd4 family-interacting protein 1) originally identified in a screen for Nedd4-binding partners (8Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ndfip1 contains three transmembrane domains and is localized in the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles. Through their transmembrane domains, Ndfip1 can bind membrane proteins and in doing so, either recruit or inhibit the interaction of membrane proteins with cytosolic Nedd4. In the brain, both Ndfip1 and Nedd4 are co-expressed in the same neuron, and their interaction has been shown to be crucial for increasing the survival of cortical neurons during injury (10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Besides proteasomal degradation of targeted proteins, Nedd4 proteins also participate in a number of cellular trafficking activities including viral budding, protein sorting, and cell signaling (for reviews, see Refs. 11Ingham R.J.

Bioessays. 2006; 28: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The execution of these functions requires the participation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) 2The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. 2The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular bodies; HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. and their intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). These organelles control the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins for recycling to the plasma membrane, or alternatively, for destruction in the lysosome (13Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The ILVs are formed by inward budding and scission of vesicles from the limiting membrane of MVBs into their lumen. Interestingly, MVBs can also fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of their ILVs (50–90-nm diameter) into the extracellular space. The released vesicles are known as exosomes (see reviews in Refs. 14Denzer K. Kleijmeer M.J. Heijnen H.F. Stoorvogel W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15van Niel G. Porto-Carreiro I. Simoes S. Raposo G. J. Biochem. 2006; 140: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and are recoverable by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. It is now clear that exosomal release provides a cellular means of shedding unwanted proteins as in maturing reticulocytes (16Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but accumulating evidence also indicates that released exosomes can also mediate cell-to-cell communication, antigen presentation, and oncogenic protein propagation (17Johnstone R.M. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2006; 36: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 18Al-Nedawi K. Meehan B. Micallef J. Lhotak V. May L. Guha A. Rak J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Although hundreds of proteins are carried within exosomes and their composition is allied to the cell of origin (19Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13368-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar), there is little information on the mechanisms leading to exosomal transport of the hundreds of proteins. Recent evidence point to the involvement of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) proteins in sorting ubiquitinated proteins to specific endosome compartments prior to exosome budding and scission (20Urbe S. Sachse M. Row P.E. Preisinger C. Barr F.A. Strous G. Klumperman J. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination appears to be a necessary step for recruitment of viral proteins (Gag, LMP2A) to the late endosome before ESCRT-mediated vesicular budding within MVBs (21Blot V. Perugi F. Gay B. Prevost M.C. Briant L. Tangy F. Abriel H. Staub O. Dokhelar M.C. Pique C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2357-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Segura-Morales C. Pescia C.

Virology. 2007; 360: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). So while Nedd4 can regulate exosome biogenesis via ubiquitination of proteins in the early steps of the pathway, there is no evidence that Nedd4 proteins are themselves recruited into exosomes. In the present study, we provide evidence to show that Nedd4 family proteins and their adaptor protein Ndfip1 are released in exosomes. While Ndfip1 is constitutively secreted in exosomes, its presence in exosomes is necessary for the exosomal secretion of Nedd4 family proteins. Antibodies—Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-Ndfip1, mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-GM130, and anti-flotillin (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), mouse anti-KDEL (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI), mouse anti-Alix (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), mouse anti-β actin (Sigma), mouse anti-HA (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), goat anti-mouse-HRP, and goat anti-rabbit-HRP (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T cells) were grown to 90% confluence in 10-cm culture dishes or 6-well plates with 15 ml or 2 ml of medium (10% fetal calf serum, 50 units of penicillin, 50 μg streptomycin, 4 mm l-glutamate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively, and transfected with indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Construction of FLAG-tagged pcDNA3-based constructs harboring Ndfip1, Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch have been previously described (9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol.

Bohmann (University of Rochester). In addition, the following construct was also used: pEF-N-FLAG-CrmA (cytokine response modifier A). BFA (10 μg/ml) and Exo1 (100 μm) (Sigma) were added as indicated 24 h after transfection for another 24 h. Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells were harvested at indicated time points, washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 30 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). 10 μl of the cell lysates were subject to SDS-PAGE. Supernatants were harvested at indicated time points, and debris was removed by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of supernatant volumes (20 μl) from equal amounts of parent cells (2 × 106) were subjects to SDS-PAGE. Western blots were incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG, anti-GM130, anti-actin, anti-flotillin, polyclonal anti-Ndfip1 antiserum, and anti-HA antibody. Primary antibodies were detected by a goat anti-mouse-HRP or a goat anti-rabbit-HRP secondary. The silver staining procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (SilverSnap Kit, Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—One 10-cm plate with 2 × 106 HEK293T cells was plated for each immunoprecipitation. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and supernatants using anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma). The recovered proteins were washed three times with PBS plus Protein Inhibitor Mixture (Roche), resuspended in Laemmli buffer and used for SDS-PAGE. Primary Cortical Cultures—Primary cortical cultures were performed as previously described (25Putz U. Harwell C. Nedivi E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After 7 days in culture, BFA (10 μg/ml) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, Sigma) were added for 6 h. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and antibody staining was performed as previously described (25Putz U. Harwell C. Nedivi E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Isolation of Exosomes—Exosomes were isolated from the supernatant of primary cortical neurons and HEK293T cells after 7 and 2 days in culture, respectively. Supernatants were cleared of debris by centrifugation for 10 min at 200 × g and again for 20 min at 20,000 × g. Exosomes were recovered from the cleared supernatant by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The exosome pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS plus Protein Inhibitor Mixture (PIC, Roche) and centrifuged again for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in PBS plus PIC. The amount of protein in the exosome preparation was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). To generate green fluorescent labeled exosomes, HEK 293T cells were labeled with PKH67 (Sigma), plated and exosomes were harvested 48 h later. Fluorescence of labeled exosomes was measured with a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA) at 485/535-nm wavelength. Electron Microscopy—Transmission electron microscopy was performed using standard protocols. In brief, exosomes were fixed in 100 μl of 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in PBS. 5 μl of exosome preparation was applied to a 200-mesh copper grid supported with formvar/carbon (ProSciTech, Kirwan, Australia), and the grid was air-dried. Grids were washed, negatively stained with 3% saturated aqueous uranyl acetate, and viewed with a transmission electron microscope (Siemens Elmiskop 102, Siemens, Munich, Germany). Ndfip1 Is Secreted into the Supernatant of Cultured Cells—To determine if Ndfip1 is released from cultured cells, we transiently overexpressed FLAG-tagged Ndfip1 in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 followed by collection of culture media (12, 24, and 48 h after transfection) for Western blotting against the FLAG tag. Secreted Ndfip1-Flag was detected in the culture medium by Western blotting 24 h after transfection, with the greatest signal intensity detected after 48 h (Fig. 1A). The predicted molecular weight of Ndfip1-FLAG is 27 kDa, and a similar band of equivalent molecular mass was seen in cell lysates harvested at 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1A) and the supernatant suggesting that Ndfip1-FLAG is released into the media as full-length protein. To demonstrate that the release of Ndfip1 was not an artifact of cell transfection and protein overexpression in HEK293T cells, a variety of control proteins were transfected and examined for their secretion into culture supernatant. Control Nedd4 family proteins were selected for their known capacity to bind Ndfip1 (e.g. Nedd 4, Nedd 4-2, and Itch) (Fig. 1B) (9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also chose proteins whose molecular masses are similar to Ndfip1 (e.g. CrmA and Bcl-2) (Fig. 1C). In these experiments, Ndfip1 is clearly detected in Western blots of the supernatant (Fig. 1A) and can also be visualized following immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 1B). Despite almost similar transfection efficiencies (indicated by equivalent protein levels in cell lysate), none of the control proteins were secreted into the supernatant (Fig. 1, B and C). These results indicate that Ndfip1 secretion into the culture supernatant is an intrinsic characteristic of Ndfip1. Ndfip1 Secretion Is Mediated by the Classical ER-Golgi Pathway—To determine whether Ndfip1 secretion is mediated by the classical ER-Golgi pathway, secretion of Ndfip1 by cultured cells was monitored in the presence or absence of Brefeldin A (BFA) or Exo1. Brefeldin A and Exo1 are inhibitors of protein transport from the ER to the Golgi, by virtue of their ability to induce the rapid release of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 1 from the Golgi membranes (26Feng Y. Yu S. Lasell T.K. Jadhav A.P. Macia E. Chardin P. Melancon P. Roth M. Mitchison T. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6469-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Treatment of transfected HEK293T cells with either BFA or Exo1 drastically reduced Ndfip1 secretion into the supernatant (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Ndfip1 secretion involves the classical ER-Golgi pathway. Support for this is seen in the increased intensity of Ndfip1 staining in the cell following treatment with BFA for 6 h (Fig. 2, B and C). After BFA treatment, Ndfip1 shows co-localization with KDEL, a marker for the ER (27Vaux D. Tooze J. Fuller S. Nature. 1990; 345: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ndfip1 is not transported from the ER to the Golgi and is accumulated in the ER (Fig. 2C). Ndfip1 is known to be up-regulated after stress induced by starvation and trauma (10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, increased Ndfip1 staining may be due to increased protein synthesis, rather than BFA blockade of Ndfip1 transport. To test this, new protein synthesis of Ndfip1 was prevented by cycloheximide during treatment with BFA (Fig. 2D). Immunostaining of these cells showed persistent Ndfip1 increase, suggesting that the increase is due to Ndfip1 accumulation from BFA treatment, rather than from increased protein synthesis. Ndfip1 Is Localized in Exosomes—Ndfip1 has three transmembrane domains and previous results indicate that it localizes to the Golgi apparatus (9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these experiments also report Ndfip1 immunostaining outside the Golgi membranes, suggesting transient associations with other cellular organelles (10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Ndfip1 is transported to the extracellular milieu as membrane-bound protein within exosomes, a number of experiments were carried out using HEK293T cells transfected with Ndfip1, and primary untransfected cortical neurons expressing endogenous Ndfip1. Using standard protocols to isolate exosomes from cells and neurons (28Faure J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 29Trajkovic K. Hsu C. Chiantia S. Rajendran L. Wenzel D. Wieland F. Schwille P. Brugger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), supernatant was harvested from HEK293T cells 48 h after transfection or from primary cortical neurons (from embryonic day 15 mouse embryos) 7 days after platting. Following clearing of cell debris by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min), exosomes were pelleted (100,000 × g for 1 h) and analyzed by Western blotting for Ndfip1-FLAG in transfected cells. The results clearly demonstrate the presence of Ndfip1 in these exosome preparations, while the vector-alone samples did not contain Ndfip1 (Fig. 3A). Exosome content in both vector-alone and transfected preparations was confirmed by the presence of flotillin, a lipid raft protein known to be localized in exosomes (30de Gassart A. Geminard C. Fevrier B. Raposo G. Vidal M. Blood. 2003; 102: 4336-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). A similar result was also obtained from Western blots of exosomes prepared from the supernatant of untransfected primary neurons (Fig. 3B), suggesting that Ndfip1 presence in exosomes is not the result of Ndfip1 overexpression or a consequence of transfection. To confirm that Ndfip1 is present in exosomes and not in general membrane debris, Western blotting was also carried out using antibodies to GM130, a known Golgi membrane protein. The negative results for GM130 suggest that the exosomal preparations are not contaminated with membrane debris. Further evidence that the loaded samples contain only exosomes was directly provided by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following uranyl acetate staining of exosome preparation from primary neurons. The TEM analysis indicates the sample consists of microvesicles with shapes and diameters (50–100 nm) consistent with exosomes (Fig. 3, C1–C4). The localization of exosomes in primary cortical neurons was examined using antibodies to Alix, a component of the ESCRT complex in MVBs and a marker for ILVs and exosomes (31de Gassart A. Geminard C. Hoekstra D. Vidal M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that immunostaining for Alix was co-extensive with Ndfip1 in primary cortical neurons (Fig. 3, D1–D3), further suggesting that Ndfip1 in these neurons localizes to ILVs. Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch Recruited into Exosomes by Ndfip1 Expression—Ndfip1 release into the supernatant in exosomes is likely to be physiological as it occurs in cultured primary cortical neurons. We therefore asked whether any of the known Ndfip1-binding proteins are co-released with Ndfip1. Using HEK293T cells, we overexpressed either Ndfip1 or control protein Bcl-2 together with certain proteins (Nedd4, Nedd4-2, Itch) that have been shown to bind to Ndfip1 (9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The control transfections with Bcl-2 showed that neither Nedd4, Nedd4-2, nor Itch are present in exosomes (Fig. 4A, exosome lanes 1, 3, and 5) despite their presence in cell lysates (Fig. 4A, cell lysate lanes 1, 3, and 5). In contrast, parallel transfections of Ndfip1 with either Nedd4, Nedd4-2, or Itch showed the presence of Nedd4, or Nedd4-2 or Itch in both lysates (Fig. 4A, cell lysate lanes 2, 4, and 6) and also in exosomes (Fig. 4A, exosome lanes 2, 4, and 6). Together, these experiments indicate that Ndfip1 is sufficient for the exosomal secretion of Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch. Overexpression of Ndfip1 Increases Exosomal Protein Levels—Our results suggest that increasing Ndfip1 levels may provide a novel mechanism for up-regulating certain binding proteins such as Nedd4, Nedd4-2, and Itch in exosomes. However, it is unclear whether or not Ndfip1 can up-regulate the overall level of exosomal proteins. To approach this question in a semiquantitative fashion, we examined protein levels in exosomes following Ndfip1 transfection, compared with control transfection with CrmA. Following transfection in HEK293T cells, cell lysates and exosomes were prepared and equal volumes loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels followed by silver staining. The results indicate higher staining intensities for exosomal proteins in the Ndfip1 lanes (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4), compared with the CrmA lanes (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). As a control, the respective cell lysate lanes indicate comparatively similar intensities between all four lanes, highlighting that the exosomal results are semiquantitative. This was further confirmed by comparing protein levels (by BCA assay) present in exosomes harvested from Ndfip1-expressing cells versus controls (Bcl-2 expressing cells) (Fig. 4C). Thus, increasing Ndfip1 expression in HEK293T cells results in higher protein levels in exosome preparations. Alternatively, these results may also suggest higher production of exosomes in response to Ndfip1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a green fluorescent dye (PKH67) that has previously been utilized to label exosomes (32Morelli A.E. Larregina A.T. Shufesky W.J. Sullivan M.L. Stolz D.B. Papworth G.D. Zahorchak A.F. Logar A.J. Wang Z. Watkins S.C. Falo Jr., L.D. Thomson A.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Following labeling, equivalent exosomal fractions from HEK293T cells were measured for fluorescence intensity using a Fluoro-spectrometer, comparing exosomes from cells expressing either Ndfip1 or Bcl-2 control. The results showed that exosomes from Ndfip1-expressing cells show twice as much fluorescence as the control cells (Fig. 4D). This can be interpreted that Ndfip1 promotes the secretion of more exosomes rather than more protein carried in the same quantity of exosomes. Overexpression of Ndfip1 Increases the Level of Ubiquitinated Proteins in Exosomes—One of the proposed functions for Ndfip1 is ubiquitination of substrate proteins in association with Nedd4 ligases (12Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. Bioessays. 2006; 28: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This notion is strongly supported by parallel studies conducted in yeast where Bsd2p (Ndfip1 homologue) is known to recruit Rsp5p (Nedd4 homologue) for ubiquitination of transmembrane proteins (33Hettema E.H. Valdez-Taubas J. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Given that Ndfip1 in the current study has been shown to be present in exosomes, and that Ndfip1 is capable of increasing protein levels in exosomes, it is of interest to examine whether or not Ndfip1 up-regulation in exosomes is associated with increased protein ubiquitination. To address this question, HEK293T cells were transfected with Ubiquitin-HA alone or together with Ndfip to study levels of ubiquitination. Western blotting was performed with an anti-HA antibody to visualize protein ubiquitination. The results demonstrate that Ndfip1 overexpression slightly increased protein ubiquitination in cell lysates (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). However, while control cells (without Ndfip1) have only low levels of ubiquitinated proteins in exosomes (Fig. 5A, lane 3), Ndfip1 drastically increases the level of ubiquitinated proteins in exosomes (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). One possible interpretation for the above results is due to increased Ndfip1 ubiquitination in exosomes. To examine this question, the ubiquitination of Ndfip1 in cell lysate was compared with that in exosomes. Following co-transfection of Ubiquitin-HA with either Ndfip1-FLAG or CrmA-FLAG, a control protein, immunoprecipitation with FLAG beads was carried out followed by blotting with anti-HA antibodies (for ubiquitination) or with anti-FLAG antibodies (to visualize CrmA-FLAG or Ndfip1-FLAG). In cell lysates, Ndfip1-FLAG was clearly ubiquitinated (Fig. 5B, lane 2), while CrmA-FLAG was ubiquitinated to a lesser extent (Fig. 5B, lane 1). In exosomes, there is clearly no ubiquitination of Ndfip1-FLAG (Fig. 5B, lane 4), despite evidence that Ndfip1 has been successfully immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5B, lane 4). Together, these results raise the conclusion that increased expression of Ndfip1 leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in exosomes. Degradation of proteins that are no longer required is part and parcel of protein cycling in cellular metabolism. A number of protein degradation pathways have been identified, including lysosomal and non-lysosomal pathways. Traditionally, the latter requires target protein ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in the 26S proteasome. Major players in this process are Nedd4 proteins, E3 ligases important for identifying and ubiquitinating specific target substrates in health and in disease (4Fotia A.B. Ekberg J. Adams D.J.

Cook D.I. Kumar S. Faseb. J. 2003; 17: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Through its adaptor Ndfip1, the range of potential targets for Nedd4 binding and ubiquitination is dramatically expanded to embrace proteins lacking the recognition PPXY motifs (9Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Proof of principle studies using yeast homologues suggest that Ndfip1 and Nedd4 are key players for removing damaged and misfolded proteins during cellular stress (33Hettema E.H. Valdez-Taubas J. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Indeed, we recently demonstrated that Ndfip1 and Nedd4 proteins are up-regulated in stressed neurons during brain injury, suggesting that in higher organisms, a parallel mechanism is operative for removing toxic proteins in times of stress (10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, an additional cellular mechanism for removing unwanted proteins by exosomal transport of proteins to the extracellular environment has been identified (15van Niel G. Porto-Carreiro I. Simoes S. Raposo G. J. Biochem. 2006; 140: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In reticulocytes, exosomal release provides a mechanism for getting rid of obsolete cell surface membranes during red blood cell maturation (16Johnstone R.M. Adam M. Hammond J.R. Orr L. Turbide C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9412-9420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this in mind, we set out to explore cellular trafficking of Ndfip1, and whether or not it might be involved in the exosomal transport of proteins, suggesting a novel mechanism for Ndfip1-mediated transport of unwanted proteins. Our results suggest this to be the case, and confirm that that Ndfip1 is secreted into the supernatant of cells overexpressing this protein. In addition, Ndfip1 is secreted from cultured primary cortical neurons, suggesting that Ndfip1 secretion is not an artifact of protein overexpression, but may be germane to cells that normally express this protein. Our experiments also indicate that the secretion of Ndfip1 utilizes the classical ER to Golgi pathway. What might be the possible incentives for a Golgi-embedded protein to be transported to MVBs and ultimately secreted in exosomes? The concept of a Golgi protein being secreted in exosomes is nothing new (19Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13368-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar), however in the current study, its effects on exosomal content generally and specifically is somewhat surprising. In general terms, overexpression of Ndfip1 was found to increase exosome release from cells, contributing to more protein secretion, compared with the control. In addition, the general level of protein ubiquitination in exosomes was also increased. Together, these two attributes would suggest that Ndfip1 may play a major role in mediating exosomal transfer of other ubiquitinated proteins. The presence of ubiquitinated proteins in MVBs and exosomes has previously been reported (19Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13368-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 34Buschow S.I. Liefhebber J.M. Wubbolts R. Stoorvogel W. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2005; 35: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but its physiological significance remains unclear. Possible explanations include the requirement for proteins to be polyubiquitinated prior to exosomal sorting in MVBs or alternatively, ubiquitination is necessary for directing exosomal cargo to lysosomes for degradation. A third explanation is that ubiquitination of cargo proteins is an important step for exosomal release by intraluminal budding. Support for this argument is provided by the demonstration that the Gag polyprotein of HTLV-1 virus can utilize Nedd4 for their ubiquitination prior to their binding to Tsg101, and consequently leading to their assembly and budding in the MVBs (21Blot V. Perugi F. Gay B. Prevost M.C. Briant L. Tangy F. Abriel H. Staub O. Dokhelar M.C. Pique C. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2357-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether or not Nedd4 family proteins are involved in ubiquitinating exosomal proteins but their presence in exosomes (as a consequence of Ndfip1) suggests guilt by association. If that is the case, then increased ubiquitination in exosomes is mechanistically dependent on the presence of Ndfip1. Together, they would participate in regulating protein trafficking. On the other hand, it is possible that ubiquitination of proteins by Nedd4 family proteins occurs in MVBs (not exosomes), followed by protein sorting to lysosomes or exosomes. We have previously shown that Nedd4 protein is localized to MVBs (35Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Brown D.L. Wylie F.G. Stow J.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3679-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this light, the current data would suggest that termination or reversal of Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination in MVBs may require Nedd4 to be removed into exosomes, and this is regulated by Ndfip1. During neuronal injury, a large number of potentially harmful substances accumulate inside and outside neurons with the capacity to induce cell death (36Vink R. Nimmo A.J. Cernak I. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These include metal cations and excitotoxic neurotransmitters capable of triggering ionic imbalances and metabolic overload. We have previously observed that increasing neuronal concentrations of Ndfip1 is associated with cell survival (10Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and that this process may involve Ndfip1/Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination and removal of proteins that facilitate entry of metal cations and neurotransmitters, including metal transporters and glutamate receptors. Ion transporters and membrane channels are abundant in exosomes (19Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13368-13373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar), and glutamate receptors have been identified in exosomes from primary neurons (28Faure J. Lachenal G. Court M. Hirrlinger J. Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Grange J. Schoehn G. Goldberg Y. Boyer V. Kirchhoff F. Raposo G. Garin J. Sadoul R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2006; 31: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In this context, it is reasonable to hypothesize that exosomal transport of Ndfip1 and its associated cargo proteins would provide an additional and rapid route for removal of unwanted proteins to enhance neuronal survival.

Unexplained characteristics of the field include its strength, concentration in the southern hemisphere, and lack of correlation with any surface features except for the hemispheric crustal dichotomy. We used numerical dynamo modeling to demonstrate that the mechanisms proposed to explain crustal dichotomy formation can result in a single-hemisphere dynamo. This dynamo produces strong magnetic fields in only the southern hemisphere. This magnetic field morphology can explain why Mars' crustal magnetic field intensities are substantially stronger in the southern hemisphere without relying on any postdynamo mechanisms."

The citric acid cycle has a dual role in central carbon metabolism. On the one hand, it is the terminal respiratory pathway and is used for the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA to CO2. On the other hand, the citric acid cycle is the source of carbon precursors for the synthesis of cell constituents. However, net synthesis of carbon precursors via the citric acid cycle is not possible. Intermediates that are drained from the cycle must be replenished using anaplerotic reaction sequences (1Kornberg H.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1965; 4: 558-565Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, growth on substrates that enter the central carbon metabolism on the level of acetyl-CoA, such as fatty acids, alcohols, and esters but also waxes, alkenes, or C1 compounds, requires an additional pathway for the assimilation of acetyl-CoA. The glyoxylate cycle that is used for the net conversion of two acetyl-CoA molecules to malate provides a solution for this problem and has been the only known route for 50 years (2Kornberg H.L. Krebs H.A. Nature. 1957; 17: 988-991Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar).Recently we proposed the so-called ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetyl-CoA assimilation by Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which lacks isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle (3Alber B.E. Spanheimer R. Ebenau-Jehle C. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Erb T.J. Berg I.A. Brecht V. Müller M. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10631-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The new pathway converts three molecules of acetyl-CoA, one molecule of CO2, and one molecule of bicarbonate to the citric acid cycle intermediates malate and succinyl-CoA (see Fig. 1). Initially two molecules of acetyl-CoA are converted into crotonyl-CoA involving steps that are common to polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis. Crotonyl-CoA is further transformed in a unique reaction sequence to β-methylmalyl-CoA that is cleaved in the latter part of the pathway to glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA. Glyoxylate condenses with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form l-malyl-CoA that is in turn hydrolyzed by a so far unknown thioesterase to malate. Propionyl-CoA is assimilated by carboxylation followed by a carbon skeleton rearrangement step catalyzed by coenzyme B12-dependent (2R)-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase yielding succinyl-CoA. This novel assimilation pathway is not only limited to R. sphaeroides but seems to operate in a number of other bacteria that have been reported to lack a functional glyoxylate cycle, like Methylobacterium extorquens and Streptomyces coelicolor (3Alber B.E.

NaH14CO3 was obtained from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany).Bacterial Strains and Growth ConditionsR. sphaeroides strain 2.4.1 (DSMZ 158) was grown at pH 6.7 and 30 °C aerobically in the dark or in 2-liter bottles anaerobically in the light (3,000 lux) on defined media supplemented with a 10 mm concentration of the appropriate carbon source as described previously (3Alber B.E. Spanheimer R. Ebenau-Jehle C. Fuchs G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Growth was followed by determining the absorbance at 578 nm (A578), and cells were harvested in midexponential phase at an optical density of 0.5–1.0. For growth studies, R. sphaeroides mutant ecm::kan and wild type were pregrown anaerobically in 100 ml of minimal medium containing 10 mm sodium succinate, and 0.1 ml was transferred to stoppered screw-capped (Hungate) tubes with 10 ml of minimal medium and the appropriate carbon source. The mutant was grown in the presence of 20 μg ml–1 kanamycin. Escherichia coli strains DH5α, BL21(DE3), Rosetta 2(DE3), and S17-1/λpir were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. For conjugation experiments R. sphaeroides was also grown aerobically on LB medium in the dark.SynthesesCrotonyl-CoA was synthesized from its anhydride (8Simon E.J. Shemin D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Acrylyl-CoA was synthesized from the free acid by the method of Stadtman (9Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 931Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). CoA-esters were quantified by determining the absorption at 260 nm (ϵ = 22,000 m–1 cm–1) (10Decker K. Die aktivierte Essigsäure. Das Coenzym A und seine Acylderivate im Stoffwechsel der Zelle, (Activated acetic acid. Coenzyme A and its acyl-derivatives in the metabolism of the cell). Ferdinand Enke, Stuttgart, Germany1959: 84-89Google Scholar), and the purity was analyzed by a previously described HPLC method (4Erb T.J. Berg I.A. Brecht V. Müller M. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10631-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Mutant Construction and Strain IsolationChromosomal DNA from R. sphaeroides was isolated using standard techniques. A fragment containing 500–600 nucleotides flanking regions on either site of the PstI sites within the ecm gene was amplified using the forward primer, 5′-ATG GTA AGC TTC CTC TAG AA TCT GTC TGC TGC AAC-3′, to introduce HindIII and XbaI sites (underlined) and the reverse primer, 5′-TCC GGT AC CAG TCT AGA TAT GGG CCA GCT CTT C-3′, to introduce KpnI and XbaI sites (underlined). PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Genaxxon Bioscience GmbH) for 25 cycles, including denaturation for 1 min, annealing at 62 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was isolated and cloned into pUC19 to obtain plasmid pAS10. A kanamycin resistance cassette (kan) was amplified using forward primer 5′-AAC TGC AGT TAG AAA AAC TCA TCG AGC-3′, reverse primer 5′-TTC TGC AGA AAG CCA CGT TGT GTC TCA AAA TC-3′, and pUC4KSAC (Promega) as a template. The 159-nucleotide PstI fragment within the ecm gene was replaced by the kanamycin resistance cassette, resulting in plasmid pASK101. The plasmid was digested with XbaI, and the fragment containing the interrupted ecm gene was ligated into pJQ200mp18 (11Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), resulting in plasmid pJS8meaAKJ. This plasmid was transferred into R. sphaeroides by conjugation with E. coli S17-1/λpir carrying pJS8meaAKJ. Donor and recipient strains were grown on LB medium to midexponential phase (A578 nm = 0.4–0.5) with 20 μg ml–1 kanamycin and 15 μg ml–1 gentamycin in the case of the donor strain. Cells (from a 15-ml culture) were collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, washed with LB medium, mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of LB medium and placed as a single drop on an LB agar plate for mating. After incubation at 30 °C in the dark for 24 h, the cells were suspended in 200 μl of LB medium, diluted from 10–1 to 10–6, and plated on LB agar with 15 μg ml–1 kanamycin (positive selection for crossover event) and 10% sucrose (negative selection for single crossover and donor). Conjugants were picked after 4–6 days of incubation (30 °C anaerobically in the light). The deletion/insertion mutation of the ecm gene was verified by PCR analyses.Cell Extracts and Qualitative Enzymatic MeasurementsCell extracts of R. sphaeroides were prepared by suspending 0.3–0.5 g of cells in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) containing 50 μg ml–1 DNase I. Glass beads (1.1 g, 0.1–0.25-mm diameter) were added, and the suspension was treated for 9 min at 30 Hz and 4 °C in a mixer mill (Retsch, Haare, Germany). After centrifugation (10 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant (cell extract, 5–10 mg ml–1 protein) was tested for ethylmalonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA transforming activity. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (213510) Google Scholar).Ethylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Assay—Radioactive labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA was synthesized in situ from crotonyl-CoA, H14CO–3, NADPH, and recombinant Ccr and subsequently used as substrate: the “substrate mixture” (3.07 ml) contained 76 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 4.9 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm crotonyl-CoA, 17.7 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 MBq ml–1 NaH14CO3, and 120 μg of recombinant Ccr. After 10–30 min of incubation at 30 °C, 90 μl of the substrate mixture were added to 20 μl of cell extract protein that had been preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.025 μmol of coenzyme B12. An aliquot of 30-μl samples was taken at different time points and stopped with 5 μl of 4 m KOH to follow the fate of ethylmalonyl-CoA. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 80 °C to hydrolyze the CoA-esters and then acidified with 10 μl of H2SO4. Separation of the free acids was performed with thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck) with CHCl3:acetic acid (5:1, v/v) as solvent and subsequent detection of radioactivity by phosphorimaging. The dependence on coenzyme B12 was examined using the supernatant of a 35% ammonium sulfate precipitation of cell extract protein that had been dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris·HCl and preincubated for 10 min in the presence (0.025 μmol) or absence of coenzyme B12.Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Assay—Conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA was measured analogously to ethylmalonyl-CoA transforming activity, replacing crotonyl-CoA by acrylyl-CoA. Non-radioactive labeled ethylmalonate, methylmalonate, methylsuccinate, and succinate were used as standards for thin layer chromatography and were visualized by bromcresol green solution (0.05% (w/v) in 1:4 ethanol:water).Product Isolation and Identification by NMRCell extract of R. sphaeroides was prepared by suspending 3 g of cells in 6 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mg μl–1 DNase I. The suspension was passed twice through a French pressure cell at 137 megapascals and 4 °C, and the cell lysate was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h). Coenzyme B12 (0.635 μmol) was added to 1.6 ml of the supernatant (cell extract protein, approximately 60 mg ml–1) and incubated at 30 °C. 3-Carboxy-13/14C-labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA was produced in a substrate mixture (15.7 ml) that contained 79 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 5.1 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm crotonyl-CoA, 31.8 mm NaH13CO3, 29 kBq ml–1 NaH14CO3, and 6 mg of recombinant Ccr. After 12 min of incubation at 30 °C, the substrate mixture was combined with the B12-incubated cell extract. After incubation for 90 min at 30 °C, 1.6 ml of 4 m KOH were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 80 °C to hydrolyze the CoA ester into free acids. Protein was removed by adding 25% HCl to pH = 0 followed by a centrifugation step (38,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). The free acids were extracted from the supernatant by solvent extraction with ethyl acetate (four times, 1:1, v/v), and the organic phase was concentrated to a volume of 1.5 ml by evaporation. The acids were separated by preparative thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck) with CHCl3:acetic acid (5:1, v/v) as solvent and subsequent detection of radioactivity. The radioactive labeled compound co-eluting with methylsuccinate was scratched from the plate. The material was extracted five times with 10 ml of methanol. The organic solvent was concentrated by evaporation and lyophilized overnight, and the remainder was dissolved in MeOH-d4 for NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance DRX-400 spectrometer at 27 °C. Chemical shifts were recorded and reported in ppm relative to MeOH-d4 (1H: δ = 3.31, 13C: δ = 49.15) as internal standard.Cloning and Heterologous Expression of ecm and epi from R. sphaeroides in E. coliThe gene encoding ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase (ecm) was amplified from R. sphaeroides chromosomal DNA by using the forward primer 5′-CCT TCA TAT GAC CCA GAA GGA TAG CCC CTG-3′ introducing an NdeI site (underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CGG GAA GCT TGG GAT CCT ATT CCG CC-3′ introducing a HindIII site (underlined). PCR was performed with PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) for 33 cycles, including denaturation for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2.5 min. The PCR product was isolated and cloned into pET16b (Invitrogen) to obtain pTE33 for expression of ecm and production of an N-terminal deca-His tag fusion protein. The gene encoding ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (epi) was amplified with forward primer 5′-GGA GAG CAT ATG ATC GGA CGC CTG AAC CAT GTG G-3′ introducing a NdeI site (underlined) and reverse primer 5′-GCC GGT GAA GCT TAT ACC TGC TCG AGC TCC ACG-3′ introducing a HindIII site (underlined) and a PCR program of 34 cycles with denaturation for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 80 s. The PCR product was cloned into pET16b resulting in pTE45 to express an N-terminal deca-His-tagged version of Epi. Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) or Rosetta 2 (DE3) were transformed with the appropriate plasmid and grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin. Expression was induced at A578 = 0.6–0.9 with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside, and the temperature was lowered to 30 °C. For expression of ecm, 1 ml of Pfennig vitamin solution VL-7 (13Pfennig N. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1978; 28: 283-288Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar) was added per liter of LB medium. Cells were harvested after additional growth for 3 h and stored at −80 °C until use. Heterologous production of Ccr in a 200-liter scale and purification of the recombinant protein have been described previously (4Erb T.J. Berg I.A. Brecht V. Müller M. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10631-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Purification of Recombinant His-tagged Ecm and EpiAll purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Frozen cells were suspended in a double volume of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mg μl–1 DNase I. The suspension was passed twice through a chilled French pressure cell at 137 megapascals, and the cell lysate was centrifuged (100,000 × g) at 4 °C for 1 h. An aliquot of the supernatant (2–5 ml, 70–100 mg of protein) was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 onto a 1-ml nickel-Sepharose Fast Flow column (HisTrap FF; Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl and 200 mm KCl (pH 7.8)). After application of cell extract, the column was washed with buffer A and buffer A containing 75 mm imidazole at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 to elute unwanted protein. Recombinant Ecm or Epi was eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm imidazole. The enzymes were desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon XM 50 (Ecm) or an Amicon YM 10 (Epi) membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The protein (8–10 mg) was stored at −20 °C in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) with 50% glycerol. Recombinant Ccr was purified from cell extracts as described before (4Erb T.J. Berg I.A. Brecht V. Müller M. Fuchs G. Alber B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10631-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Determination of Molecular MassSodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (12.5%) gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). The native molecular mass of Ecm was estimated by gel filtration at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min–1 on a 120-ml Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.9) and 125 mm KCl. Ecm eluted with a retention volume of 16.9 ml. Ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and RNase A (13 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards for calibration.Quantitative Enzymatic Measurements of Recombinant EnzymesEcm and Epi were measured quantitatively by an HPLC-based assay.Ethylmalonyl-CoA Mutase—Radioactive labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA was synthesized from crotonyl-CoA, H14CO–3, and recombinant Ccr and subsequently used as substrate. The substrate mixture (1.07 ml) contained 80 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 3.7 mm NADPH, 1.9 mm crotonyl-CoA, 7.9 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 MBq ml–1 NaH14CO3, and 230 μg of recombinant Ccr. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, crotonyl-CoA was completely transformed to ethylmalonyl-CoA as shown by HPLC, and the reaction was stopped by boiling the reaction mixture for 5 min. To start the ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase assay, 212 μl of the substrate mixture were added to 20μl of a “protein solution” containing 0.12μmol of coenzyme B12, an excess of partially purified methylmalonyl-CoA racemase fraction from Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii (15Abend, A. (1995) Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of the methylmalnyl-CoA mutase reaction using alternative substrates and inhibitors. Ph.D. thesis, University of KarlsruheGoogle Scholar), and 3–6 μg of recombinant Ecm. The reaction was stopped at different time points by removing 50-μl samples and adding 5 μl of 20% formic acid; acidification also avoids hydrolysis of the unstable methylsuccinyl-CoA. The samples were diluted with 50 μl of water and centrifuged (15 min, 20,000 × g) to remove denatured protein. The supernatant was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column (LiChrospher 100, end-capped, 5 μm, 125 × 4 mm; Merck). The column was developed for 7 min under isocratic conditions with 100 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 4.0) in 7.5% methanol (v/v) followed by a linear 10-min gradient from 0 to 60% 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.2) in 90% methanol (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Reaction products and standard compounds were detected by UV absorbance with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Radioactivity of eluting compounds was also monitored by a Ramona 2000 radioactive monitor (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) connected in series. Retention times were 11.7 min for methylmalonyl-CoA, 12.3 min for succinyl-CoA, 12.5 min for ethylmalonyl-CoA, and 13.1 min for methylsuccinyl-CoA (radioactive monitoring). The amount of product formed was calculated from the relative peak area. The apparent Km value of ethylmalonyl-CoA was determined by varying the end concentration of ethylmalonyl-CoA from 0.12 to 1.8 mm while keeping coenzyme B12 at a saturating concentration (506 μm). The apparent Kd of coenzyme B12 was determined by varying the end concentration of coenzyme B12 from 0.25 to 506 μm at a saturating ethylmalonyl-CoA concentration (1.8 mm). The pH optimum was determined using 16 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.8) instead of 80 mm in the substrate mixture. The pH was subsequently adjusted by addition of 92 μl of the substrate mixture to 55 μl of a protein solution containing 0.13 μmol of coenzyme B12, excess amounts of methylmalonyl-CoA racemase from P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii, 3 μg of recombinant Ecm, and an Ellis and Morrison (16Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) buffer of constant ionic strength composed of 363 mm N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 189 mm Tris, and 189 mm ethanolamine. The pH value of the buffer was varied from pH 6.0 to 10.0 with HCl or NaOH (0.5 pH units per step).Ethylmalonyl-CoA Epimerase—To measure ethylmalonyl-CoA epimerase activity, recombinant Ecm was used in excess, and the amount of Epi was kept rate-limiting. Also the substrate mixture for the synthesis of ethylmalonyl-CoA (from crotonyl-CoA) was not stopped by boiling to avoid spontaneous epimerization of ethylmalonyl-CoA. Instead 212 μl of the substrate mixture were added directly to 38 μl of a protein solution containing 0.13 μmol of coenzyme B12, 0.20 μmol of CoCl2, 0.08–0.24 μg of recombinant Epi, and 32–64 μg of recombinant Ecm. The apparent Km value of ethylmalonyl-CoA was examined by varying the end concentration of ethylmalonyl-CoA (0.06–0.88 mm) in the assay at a saturating coenzyme B12 concentration (506 μm). Additionally NaH14CO3 was increased to 3.2 MBq ml–1 for the synthesis of ethylmalonyl-CoA by Ccr. To test the influence of divalent cations, EDTA was added to a 1.3 mg ml–1 Epi solution to a final concentration of 2 mm and incubated overnight. An aliquot of this solution containing 0.03–0.3 μg of Epi was diluted into protein solution (final volume, 38 μl) containing 0.2 μmol of CoCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2, or NiCl2 or no divalent cation before the reaction was started by adding 212 μl of substrate mixture.Methylmalonyl-CoA Epimerase—Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerizing activity of recombinant Epi was measured analogously to ethylmalonyl-CoA epimerizing activity. Crotonyl-CoA was replaced by acrylyl-CoA for substrate synthesis resulting in the formation of radioactively labeled methylmalonyl-CoA. Recombinant methylmalonyl-CoA mutase 3T. J. Erb, B. E. Alber, and G. Fuchs, unpublished results. was used in excess, and the amount of Epi (10–40 ng) was kept rate-limiting. The apparent Km value of methylmalonyl-CoA was examined by varying the concentration of methylmalonyl-CoA from 0.06 to 0.88 mm while keeping coenzyme B12 at saturating concentrations (506 μm).Phylogenetic AnalysisThe genomic BLAST interface (February 13, 2008) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was used to search 592 fully sequenced genomes with the amino acid sequences of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (large subunit) from P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii (NCBI accession number P11653.3), isobutyryl-CoA mutase (large subunit) from S. cinnamonensis (NCBI accession number AAC08713.1), and ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase from R. sphaeroides (NCBI accession number YP_354045). All hits with an expectation value >e–20 were controlled for the presence of a substrate binding and a coenzyme B12 binding domain. In absence of either domain, the genomic context was analyzed for the presence of an open reading frame encoding the missing subunit. When both subunits were present, their sequences were linked to a concatamer. All hits where the substrate binding domain was fused to an argK-like domain were excluded because these proteins are not characterized yet and their function as bona fide mutases remains to be shown. The amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW as implemented in the BioEdit 7.0.9.0. software package, and the sequences obtained were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining algorithms as implemented in the Tree-ConW 1.3b software package or maximum parsimony and distance matrix algorithms as implemented in the PHYLIP 3.67 software package.Computational ModelingEthylmalonyl-CoA mutase was modeled using the SWISS-MODEL Automated Comparative Protein Modeling Server (November 6, 2007) with the structure of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase substrate complex from P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii (Protein Data Bank code 4REQ) as template. The software packages of DeepView 3.7 and University of California San Francisco Chimera 1 were used to visualize and overlay the structure models.RESULTSCoenzyme B12-dependent Conversion of Ethylmalonyl-CoA to Methylsuccinyl-CoA in Cell Extracts of R. sphaeroides—To follow the fate of ethylmalonyl-CoA in cell extracts of R. sphaeroides, 3-carboxy-14C-labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA was produced enzymatically from crotonyl-CoA, H14CO–3, and NADPH by Ccr from R. sphaeroides and used in subsequent experiments. Cell extracts of acetate-grown R. sphaeroides were able to convert this [3-carboxy-14C]ethylmalonyl-CoA into a radioactive labeled product, and the conversion was dependent on the presence of coenzyme B12. After hydrolysis of CoA-thioesters, the product of the conversion co-eluted with methylsuccinate on thin layer chromatography plates (Fig. 2) and was isolated from preparative scale using 3-carboxy-13C-labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA. One-dimensional (1H, 13C) and two-dimensional (correlation spectroscopy, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) NMR experiments confirmed the product as [4-carboxy-13C]methylsuccinate, suggesting that a rearrangement of the carbon skeleton had taken place (supplemental Fig. S1). We conclude that a coenzyme B12-dependent ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzed this reaction in cell extracts of R. sphaeroides.FIGURE 2Coenzyme B12-dependent conversion of ethylmalonyl-CoA by cell extract of acetate grown R. sphaeroides. Radioactive labeled ethylmalonyl-CoA was formed in vitro by recombinant Ccr from crotonyl-CoA, NADPH, and H14CO–3 (t(0)). The reaction was started by cell extract protein of acetate-grown R. sphaeroides (supernatant of a 35% ammonium sulfate fraction dialyzed overnight) in the presence (+coenzyme B12) or absence (–coenzyme B12) of coenzyme B12. Samples were taken after 90 min and stopped with KOH to hydrolyze the corresponding coenzyme A-thioesters. Free acids were separated by thin layer chromatogr"
https://openalex.org/W2086307866,"Chicken Ovalbumin Upstream Promoter-Transcription Factor II (COUP-TFII; also known as NR2F2), is an orphan nuclear receptor of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. COUP-TFII-null mice die during the early embryonic development due to angiogenesis and cardiovascular defects. To circumvent the early embryonic lethality and investigate the physiological function of COUP-TFII, we knocked out COUP-TFII gene in a time-specific manner by using a tamoxifen inducible Cre recombinase. The ablation of COUP-TFII during pre-pubertal stages of male development results in infertility, hypogonadism and spermatogenetic arrest. Homozygous adult male mutants are defective in testosterone synthesis, and administration of testosterone could largely rescue the mutant defects. Notably, the rescued results also provide the evidence that the major function of adult Leydig cell is to synthesize testosterone. Further phenotypic analysis reveals that Leydig cell differentiation is arrested at the progenitor cell stage in the testes of null mice. The failure of testosterone to resumption of Leydig cell maturation in the null mice indicates that COUP-TFII itself is essential for this process. In addition, we identify that COUP-TFII plays roles in progenitor Leydig cell formation and early testis organogenesis, as demonstrated by the ablation of COUP-TFII at E18.5. On the other hand, when COUP-TFII is deleted in the adult stage after Leydig cells are well differentiated, there are no obvious defects in reproduction and Leydig cell function. Taken together, these results indicate that COUP-TFII plays a major role in differentiation, but not the maintenance of Leydig cells."
https://openalex.org/W2133535400,"The non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1B and T-cell phosphatase (TCPTP) have been implicated as negative regulators of multiple signaling pathways including receptor-tyrosine kinases. We have identified PTP1B and TCPTP as negative regulators of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, the Met receptor-tyrosine kinase. In vivo, loss of PTP1B or TCPTP enhances hepatocyte growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of Met. Using substrate trapping mutants of PTP1B or TCPTP, we have demonstrated that both phosphatases interact with Met and that these interactions require phosphorylation of twin tyrosines (Tyr-1234/1235) in the activation loop of the Met kinase domain. Using confocal microscopy, we show that trapping mutants of both PTP1B and the endoplasmic reticulum-targeted TCPTP isoform, TC48, colocalize with Met and that activation of Met enables the nuclear-localized isoform of TCPTP, TC45, to exit the nucleus. Using small interfering RNA against PTP1B and TCPTP, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tyr-1234/1235 in the activation loop of the Met receptor is elevated in the absence of either PTP1B or TCPTP and further elevated upon loss of both phosphatases. This enhanced phosphorylation of Met corresponds to enhanced biological activity and cellular invasion.

These, through a series of protein-protein interactions, transduce the extracellular signal to the interior of the cell. Although numerous studies have addressed mechanisms resulting in elevation of Met RTK activity (5Peschard P. Park M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanisms involved in down-regulation of the Met receptor. Biological consequences resulting from RTK activation are determined by the duration, intensity, and specificity of the signals activated downstream of the receptor. Regulation of signals occurs on multiple levels, including the RTK itself. Ligand activation of the Met receptor promotes internalization of the receptor into the endocytic pathway with subsequent degradation in the lysosome (6Hammond D.E. Urbe S. Vande Woude G.F. Clague M.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2761-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Termination of RTK signaling has been correlated with receptor dephosphorylation, degradation, or sequestration from the cytoplasm (5Peschard P. Park M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition to receptor internalization, trafficking, and degradation in the lysosome as mechanisms of down-regulation, the Met receptor has been identified as a substrate for several PTPs. The receptor PTP LAR (leukocyte antigen-related) targets the Met receptor in confluent cells. This interaction is initiated after cell-cell contact and suppresses the mitogenic response of primary rat hepatocytes, resulting in contact inhibition (7Machide M. Hashigasako A. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8765-8772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another receptor PTP, DEP-1, has been proposed to negatively regulate Met RTK signaling via dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues in Met that are involved in substrate binding (8Palka H.L. Park M. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although DEP-1 suppresses Met signaling, it does not dephosphorylate the tyrosine residues in the activation loop (Tyr-1234/1235) that are required for Met catalytic activity. Because Met continues to signal after internalization (9Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbe S. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9632-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), other PTPs are likely to be involved in the suppression and/or down-regulation of Met receptor catalytic activity. We have recently established that phosphorylation of Met is elevated in PTP1B-null mice after treatment with Fas ligand, suggesting that the Met receptor may be a target for this phosphatase (10Sangwan V. Paliouras G.N. Cheng A. Dube N. Tremblay M.L. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTP1B is a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to either genetically or biochemically interact with multiple RTKs, including the insulin, insulin-like growth factor, EGF, and PDGF; receptors (11Stuible M. Doody K.M. Tremblay M.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). PTP1B possesses a phosphatase catalytic domain and a proline-rich domain. It interacts with and dephosphorylates multiple proteins including p130Cas, p62Dok, Jak2, and Tyk2 (12Cheng A. Uetani N. Simoncic P.D. Chaubey V.P. Lee-Loy A. McGlade C.J. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L.

At its carboxyl terminus, it contains an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting signal that anchors PTP1B to the cytoplasmic face of the ER (18Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 19Cheng A. Dube N. Gu F. Tremblay M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The role of PTP1B in the down-regulation of the insulin receptor (IR) has been extensively studied. Liver and muscle from PTP1B knock-out (KO) mice show hyperphosphorylation of the IR upon stimulation with insulin. These mice are resistant to weight gain caused by a high fat diet, demonstrating that loss of PTP1B has physiological consequences in vivo (20Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Recent studies show that internalization of the EGF and PDGF receptors is required for their colocalization with PTP1B (22Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), supporting a role for PTP1B in the dephosphorylation and down-modulation of internalized RTKs. The mechanism by which PTP1B interacts with its substrates has been elucidated. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the affinity of PTP1B for a substrate containing twin tyrosines is 70-fold higher than for a substrate in which one tyrosine is substituted with phenylalanine (23Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Moreover, using peptides corresponding to the activation loop of the kinase domain of the IR, the catalytic domain of PTP1B has been shown to associate with the phosphorylated twin tyrosines present in this sequence (23Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1401-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent studies have shown that PTP1B docks on the kinase domain of the IR in a region opposite to the activation loop that contains these tyrosine residues (24Li S. Depetris R.S. Barford D. Chernoff J. Hubbard S.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 1643-1651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A given RTK can be the substrate of several phosphatases, emphasizing the importance of this mechanism. For example, the EGF receptor is thought to be negatively down-regulated by PTP:, LAR, SHP-1, PTP1B, and TCPTP (25Suarez Pestana E. Tenev T. Gross S. Stoyanov B. Ogata M. Bohmer F.D.

Sci. 2005; 22: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), among others. PTP1B is most closely related to the non-receptor TCPTP, which is expressed in all tissues and at all stages of development (33Ibarra-Sanchez M.J. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). TCPTP is alternatively spliced, yielding two isoforms that differ in their non-catalytic carboxyl termini: the ER-localized 48 kDa form (TC48) and the nuclear-localized 45-kDa form (TC45) (34Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both TC48 and TC45 are present in humans (35Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A.

Moreover, siRNA against TCPTP or PTP1B in vivo has demonstrated that PTP1B and TCPTP do not act additively on the IR in mouse liver (45Xu J. Li L. Hong J. Huang W. Cell Biol. Int. 2007; 31: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The interaction of a wild-type (WT) phosphatase with its substrate is transient. Substrate trapping mutants of PTPs have been engineered in which a single aspartic acid residue in the catalytic domain is replaced with alanine (D/A mutants) (27Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). These proteins are capable of binding to PTP substrates but are slow to catalyze the dephosphorylation reaction and, thus, form a stable intermediate with the substrate (46Xie L. Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4032-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hence, such mutants compete when co-expressed with WT PTPs. In this study we demonstrate a role for PTP1B and TCPTP in the dephosphorylation of the Met RTK and show that substrate trapping mutants of either PTP1B or TCPTP (TC48) are recruited to an internalized Met receptor. Moreover, Met activation promotes nuclear exit of TCPTP (TC45) and recruitment to the membrane, indicating a role for each phosphatase in the dephosphorylation and modulation of the signal from the Met receptor. DNA Constructs and siRNA—GFP-TC48 or GFP-TC45 WT and D/A constructs were created by cloning TC45 or TC48 WT or D/A into the BglII and HindIII sites of the pEGFPC2 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). PTP1B WT and D/A was inserted into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the pEGFPC2 vector. TC48 was a kind gift from N. Tonks. Tpr-Met and its various mutants, Met and Met-Y1003F, have been described previously (9Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbe S. Park M. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). siRNA duplexes against the PTP1B target sequence CACGTGGGTATTTAATAAGAA and TCPTP target sequence CACAAAGAAGTTACATCTTAA were obtained from Qiagen (Mississauga, ON, Canada) and transfected into HeLa cells for 48 h using Hiperfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and DNA Transfections—All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For expression of cDNAs, 1 × 106 HEK 293 cells were seeded 24 h before transient transfection using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Media was replaced 3 h post-transfection, and cells were lysed 24 h posttransfection in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) lacking sodium vanadate unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. 10 ;g/ml aprotinin, 10 ;g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added to the lysis buffer before use. Antibodies and Reagents—A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide from the carboxyl terminus of human (48Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell.

Anti-Met B2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p-Tyr-20 was from Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc./Bio-Can (Mississauga, ON, Canada), and anti-Myc 9E10, anti-EEA1, and anti-GFP were from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). An antibody against the extracellular region of Met (anti-Met AF276) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—500 ;g of HEK 293 cell lysates were used for each immunoprecipitation. The antibody was allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C, after which 10 ;l of protein A or protein G-Sepharose beads were added to collect immune complexes. Beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, then resuspended in 20 ;l of Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfe, Québec, Canada), which were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and probed with the appropriate antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) indicating the positions of target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Odyssey blocking buffer, IRDye800 anti-rabbit, and Cy5.5 anti-mouse secondary antibodies for use with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Analyses using the Odyssey infrared imaging system were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Animal Experiments—WT and PTP1B-null mice are a hybrid of 129S/v and BALB/c backgrounds (20Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J.

Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). 4-6-week-old mice were injected with 15 nm HGF via the hepatic portal vein, and livers were excised at the times indicated. All experiments were carried out in accordance with approved animal use protocols (McGill University). Whole livers were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 ;g/ml aprotinin, 10 ;g/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The Met receptor was immunoprecipitated from 3 mg of protein lysate using the mouse-specific anti-Met antibody (49Yang X.M. Park M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with antibodies as indicated in figure legends and quantified using the NIH ImageJ software. Each experiment was carried out a minimum of three times. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—2 × 104 HeLa cells or 1 × 105 T47D cells were seeded on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass Inc. Vineland, NJ) in 24-well plates (Nalgene NUNC, Rochester, NY) and transfected with the indicated DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions 16 h post-plating. 16 h later, cells were serum-starved for 2 h either with or without cycloheximide (0.1 mg/ml) before HGF treatment (1.5 nm) as indicated. Coverslips were washed once with PBS and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Fisher) in PBS for 20 min. Coverslips were then washed 4 times in PBS, and residual PFA was removed by three 5-min washes with 100 mm glycine/PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS). Coverslips were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h and 40 min, respectively, at room temperature. Coverslips were washed four times in IF buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS) between primary and secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted with Immumount (Thermo-Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd, Toronto, ON, Canada) with a 100× objective. Image analysis was carried out using the LSM 5 image browser (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Invasion Assays—3 × 104 HeLa cells were seeded directly onto 6.5-mm Corning Costar transwells coated with 100 ;g/cm2 Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Complete media was added to both the top and bottom wells, and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. For HGF stimulations, 0.15 nm HGF was added to the bottom wells. After the overnight incubation, cells on both sides of the transwells were fixed using formalin phosphate for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. Cells on the top layer were scraped, and membranes were left to dry overnight. Images were captured using a Retiga 1300 digital camera (QIMAGING, Burnaby, BC, Canada) and a Zeiss AxioVert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd.). Imaging of these assays was carried out with a 10× objective, and images were analyzed using the ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA). Each experiment was carried out a minimum of three times. Loss of PTP1B Results in Increased Levels of Met Phosphorylation—To test if Met is a physiological substrate for PTP1B, PTP1B-null mice were injected via the hepatic portal vein with 15 nm HGF, the ligand for the Met receptor. Livers were harvested at the times indicated, and proteins from lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific to murine Met protein. Increase in phosphorylation of Met was normalized to the levels of Met receptor as evaluated by densitometry (Fig. 1). Notably, we observe no significant difference in basal tyrosine phosphorylation of the Met receptor in livers from WT or PTP1B-null mice (Fig. 1A). However, in response to HGF, tyrosine phosphorylation of the Met receptor was enhanced significantly in PTP1B-null animals when compared with livers from WT animals (Fig. 1, A and B). Using general anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (p-Tyr-100), we observe that the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in PTP1B-null animals is 4-fold higher than Met phosphorylation in WT animals when stimulated with HGF for similar time periods (Fig. 1, A and B). To provide insight into the specificity of enhanced Met phosphorylation in PTP1B-null animals, we utilized Met tyrosine-phosphorylation specific antibodies. Upon binding HGF, Met is autophosphorylated on tyrosine 1234 and 1235 in the activation loop of the Met catalytic domain (47Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2019-2027PubMed Google Scholar). In response to HGF, phosphorylation of these tyrosines is required for activation of Met kinase and subsequent phosphorylation of other sites in the Met receptor, including Tyr-1003 in the juxtamembrane domain and Tyr-1003 and -1356 in the Met carboxyl terminus (47Rodrigues G.A.

Utilizing phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies to compare phosphorylation of Tyr-1234/1235, Tyr-1003 or Tyr-1365 of Met in response to HGF in livers from WT and PTP1B-null mice, we observed an overall increase in phosphorylation of these tyrosines of 4-6-fold when compared with lysates of livers from WT mice (Fig. 1, A and B). In response to HGF, phosphorylation of tyrosines 1234/35 is elevated in PTP1B-null mice when compared with WT mice, demonstrating for the first time in vivo that the phosphorylation state of Tyr-1234/1235, required for the catalytic activity of the Met receptor, is regulated by PTP1B (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, enhanced phosphorylation of Tyr-1234/1235 coincides with enhanced phosphorylation of non-catalytic tyrosines, Tyr-1003 in the juxtamembrane domain and Tyr-1365 in the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine whether loss of PTP1B also impacts on downstream signaling pathways, the engagement of the JNK and ERK pathways were studied using phosphospecific antibodies. Consistent with enhanced phosphorylation of Met, increased phosphorylation of the Met-activated pathway components ERK1/2 in HGF-injected livers from KO versus WT mice was observed (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we saw no induction of p46 Jnk1, whereas p54 Jnk2 was elevated in PTP1B KO livers after HGF portal vein injection when compared with WT (Fig. 1, C and D), consistent with an increase in Jnk2/3 activation post-HGF stimulation in rat hepatoma cells (53Yang H.

The ERAD quality control system identifies aberrant proteins and targets them for destruction. This disposal mechanism involves misfolded proteins being “dislocated” across the ER membrane to the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated before being delivered to the proteasome for degradation (1Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Three distinct ERAD pathways can be distinguished according to the topology of the misfolded lesion. ER lumenal proteins are degraded via the ERAD-L pathway, as are integral membrane proteins with lesions in a lumenal domain. Membrane proteins with cytosolic lesions are degraded by the ERAD-C pathway (2Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), whereas those with misfolded transmembrane domains are degraded by the ERAD-M pathway (3Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 4Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). All three pathways require the cytosolic Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex, which delivers ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome. ERAD-L involves recognition of aberrant domains by a lumenal surveillance complex, comprising Yos9p and Kar2p, which maintains the substrate in an ERAD-competent conformation. The substrate is then delivered to the membrane-associated Hrd1 complex comprising the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p and its co-factors Hrd3p, Usa1p, and Der1p (3Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 4Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Cell. 2006; 126: 349-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). At this stage the substrate must be dislocated across the ER membrane where it is ubiquitinated by the Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase in combination with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p and its membrane anchor, Cue1p. The ubiquitinated substrate is then passed to the Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex, which is itself anchored to the membrane by the Ubx2p receptor (1Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). The identity of the protein dislocation channel has been the subject of considerable debate. Derlin-1, a recently identified human homologue of yeast Der1p has been suggested to form a pore in the ER membrane through which unfolded ERAD substrates are exported for degradation (5Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 6Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Yeast Der1p is an integral membrane protein required for the degradation of ERAD-L substrates including CPY*, KHN, and KWW (2Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 7Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), but the molecular function of Der1p/Derlin-1 is not yet known. In yeast, Der1p is not essential for viability, but its widespread conservation does suggest an important role in eukaryotes. Another candidate for the dislocation channel is Sec61p, which is a core component of the translocation channel through which proteins are imported into the ER (8Robson A. Collinson I. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A number of observations support a role for Sec61p in ERAD including its association with a variety of ERAD substrates (9de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) plus the intriguing observation that proteasomes interact with the Sec61 complex both in vivo and in vitro (12Kalies K.U. Allan S. Sergeyenko T. Kroger H. Romisch K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2284-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast have shown that the degradation of an unfolded mutant form of alpha factor is reduced in a cell free assay using microsomes from various sec61 mutant strains (13Pilon M. Romisch K. Quach D. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3455-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas the degradation of CPY* is delayed in sec61-2 mutant cells (14Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of these data is complicated by the fact that the sec61 mutant alleles examined were also defective in the initial translocation of both alpha factor and CPY*. In this paper we employ the sec61-3 mutant, which has a cold-sensitive defect in the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent co-translational translocation pathway. We therefore engineered two novel SRP-dependent derivatives of CPY*, one integral membrane form and one soluble, and examined their translocation and ERAD properties. We demonstrate that Sec61p is required for ERAD of these novel substrates in a manner that is independent of any effect on translocation. Yeast Strains—The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast strains were grown in either YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) or minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, appropriate supplements) at temperatures required for individual experiments (17, 24, 30, or 37 °C). Analysis of plasmid-borne forms of CPY*, DPY*, and OPY* were performed in strains lacking any endogenous CPY (prc1::KANMX). To make strains of the required genotypes, we re-engineered the sec61-3 allele in target strains in the following way. The sec61-3 mutation was introduced into pBW11 (15Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis with Primers 1 and 2 generating plasmid pCW11 Table 2. A 2.4-kb KpnI-PstI fragment containing the mutagenized sec61-3 allele was cloned into KpnI-PstI of YIp352, generating an integrative vector pCW14, which was subsequently linearized with Xba1 and transformed into yeast. Loss of the integrative vector part was selected for on media containing 5-fluo-orotic acid, and the resulting single copy genomic copy of sec61-3 was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceMWY61Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 der1::KanMXThis studyMWY63Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 his3 ura3 ade2 pep4-3 sec61-3This studyMWY64Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 ura3 ade2 pep4-3This studyMWY71Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ade2 sec65-1This studyMWY77Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 his3 ura3 doa10::KanMXThis studyMWY82Mata prc1::KanMX leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ade2 sec62-1This studyW303-cd3Mata leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ade2 der3 prc1-1This study Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequenceprc1-1_FCCGAGCTCGCGATGTTGGTCATCCAGTACACTTCGGTAGCprc1-1_RGGAATCAGCACATAGTTCTTGAACCAGCTCAGCPY_Nde1_FCTACTCAACTTAAAGTATACATACCATATGAAAGCATTCACCAGTTTACTATGCPY_Nde1_RCATAGTAAACTGGTGAATGCTTTCATATGGTATGTATACTTTAAGTTGAGTAGDPAPB_F2GAGGACATATGAGAGTCGGTATTATCTTCGTTTTGTTGATTTGGGGTACTGTTTDPAPB_R2GTGCCGTAGGCCTTCTATACTCTTCAACAACAAAACAGTACCCAAAATCAACAAOST2FTTCTTTGAGCTCCGAGGCAGCAGTCTCTGTGGAGGGGGTACCOST2RCCGGATATCGGCTCGTATTGGGCAGCAGAAGACACGTTGAAAAAACATAGGPrimer 1CTCAAATGGCCTTGAGCGAGTTGGCCTACTACATCCAACCPrimer 2GGTTGGATGTAGTAGGCCAACTCGCTCAAGGCCATTTGAG Open table in a new tab Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids encoding CPY* (pMW319), DPY* (pMW339), and OPY* (pMW342) were generated as follows. The CPY* encoding allele of PRC1 (prc1-1) was amplified from genomic DNA with primers prc1-1_F and prc1-1_R. A 2379-bp HindIII-SacI DNA fragment was cloned into pRS315 and pRS316 to generate pMW319 and pMW320, respectively. A 645-bp BamHI-SacI fragment from pMW320 was cloned into pBLUESCRIPT KS+ to generate pMW321. A NdeI restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with primers CPY_NdeI_F and CPY_NdeI_R to generate pMW325. Signal sequence coding sequence of DPAP B was amplified with primers DPAPB_F2 and DPAPB_R2 and following digestion with NdeI and StuI cloned into pMW325 to generate pMW330. Finally, a 748-bp SacI-BamHI fragment from was cloned from pMW330 into pMW319 to generate pMW339. An OST1 sequence was PCR-amplified with primers OST2F and OST2R, digested with SacI and EcoRV, and cloned into SacI-StuI of pMW319 to generate pMW342. To be able to make strains of the required genotypes, we decided to regenerate the sec61-3 allele in target strains in the following way: The sec61-3 mutation was introduced into pBW11(22) by site-directed mutagenesis with Primers 1 and 2 generating plasmid pCW11. A 2.4-kb KpnI-PstI fragment was cloned into YIp352, generating pCW14. Membrane Association Experiments—The microsomes were prepared as previously described (16Willer M. Jermy A.J. Young B.P. Stirling C.J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The microsomes were treated with 100 mm Na2CO3 at 0 °C for 30 min and spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Equal proportions of pellets and supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. Antibodies against CPY, Kar2p, and Sec61p have previously been described (17Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Wilkinson B.M. Tyson J.R. Reid P.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol.

Pulse-Chase Analysis—Temperature shifts were done for 2 h prior to radiolabeling. The cells were grown in minimal medium to A600 = 0.2 and labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 min (5 min for experiments looking at translocation). Chase was performed by the addition of cold methionine and cysteine to final concentrations of 2 mm each. 5 A600 units of cells were taken for each time point, and the cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described (17Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a Fujifilm FLA3000 phosphorimaging device, and quantitation was performed on signals within the linear range of detection using the Aida Image Analyzer v.3.44 software. Properties of New ERAD Substrates—A single mutation (G255R) in the yeast vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) results in a misfolded protein (CPY*), which is a substrate for the ERAD-L pathway (21Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PreproCPY* is translated in the cytosol and translocated post-translationally into the ER. We were interested in addressing the role of Sec61p in ERAD using CPY* as a substrate, but all known mutant alleles of sec61 are deficient in post-translational translocation. The sec61-3 mutant allele is no exception but differs in that it also exhibits a cold-sensitive defect in co-translational translocation. This mutant translocates SRP-dependent precursors efficiently at 30 °C but is defective in post-translational translocation at this temperature and is completely deficient in all translocation at 17 °C (Fig. 1A). We therefore reasoned that an SRP-dependent ERAD substrate might translocate normally in sec61-3 cells at 30 °C and might therefore allow us to test specifically for any effect on ERAD following the loss of Sec61p function at 17 °C. The signal sequence of a precursor determines whether it will follow either the Sec62- or SRP-dependent pathway, with more hydrophobic sequences tending to require the latter (22Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to create SRP-dependent derivatives of CPY* by replacing its targeting sequence with that of either DPAP-B (DPY*) or Ost1p (OPY*) (Fig. 1B). DPAP-B is a type II integral membrane protein with an amino-terminal signal anchor domain whose targeting is SRP-dependent (23Stirling C.J. Hewitt E.W. Nature. 1992; 356: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ost1p is a type I integral membrane protein with a cleavable signal sequence (24Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) whose hydrophobicity led us to predict a likely dependence upon SRP. ER Translocation of DPY* and OPY*—When expressed in wild type cells, both DPY* and OPY* were efficiently translocated and glycosylated, indicating that their respective ER targeting signals are functional. Our hypothesis predicted that DPY* and OPY* would translocate efficiently in sec61-3 cells at 30 °C, and this proved to be the case (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, these proteins also translocate well at 17 °C, suggesting that the SRP-dependent targeting of a polypeptide that is competent for post-translational import can overcome the sec61-3 translocation defect. This finding suggested that the translocation defect in sec61-3 cells might be kinetic in nature, and this has been confirmed by pulse-chase analysis (see supplemental Fig. 1). To confirm that DPY* and OPY* were being targeted via the SRP-dependent pathway, we also examined their translocation in sec65-1 cells, which express a temperature-sensitive form of SRP (23Stirling C.J. Hewitt E.W. Nature. 1992; 356: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As expected, preproCPY* translocation is unaffected in sec65-1 cells with only the ER glycosylated form of proCPY* being evident at either 24 or 37 °C. In contrast, DPY* and OPY* translocate efficiently at 24 °C but accumulate as precursor forms at 37 °C (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that DPY* and OPY* require functional SRP for their ER targeting. A further characteristic of a genuinely SRP-dependent precursor is that it does not depend on Sec62p for translocation. sec62-1 cells have defects in post-translational translocation at their permissive temperature (24 °C) and are temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C (25Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We therefore examined translocation of DPY* and OPY* in sec62-1 cells. A profound defect in translocation of CPY* was observed at both 24 and 37 °C, but DPY* and OPY* translocation were unaffected (Fig. 1D). We therefore conclude that unlike CPY*, both DPY* and OPY* translocate via the co-translational SRP-dependent pathway. Most importantly, the sec61-3 mutation has no detectable effect on translocation of these new precursors. Membrane Association of DPY* and OPY*—The signal peptide of preproCPY* is cleaved during translocation by signal peptidase. OPY* was predicted to be similarly cleaved, whereas DPY* was predicted to insert into the bilayer as an integral membrane protein. To test these predictions we used carbonate extraction of microsomes to examine the membrane association of the various proteins. We found that DPY* behaved as an integral membrane protein, whereas both CPY* and OPY* were readily extracted by carbonate (Fig. 2). We therefore conclude that OPY* is soluble, whereas DPY* is membrane associated. DPY* and OPY* thus behave entirely differently from CPY* with regards to their mode of translocation and differently from one another with regards to their solubility/membrane association properties. DPY* and OPY* Are Subject to Der1p-dependent ERAD-L—Next we examined whether the translocated forms of DPY* and OPY* were subject to ERAD. Wild type cells expressing CPY*, DPY*, or OPY* were subjected to pulse-chase studies demonstrating that all three substrates degraded with similar kinetics (Fig. 3). Signal cleaved OPY* behaved as a lumenal protein in our carbonate extraction studies, and so one might expect that it would be a substrate for the Der1p-dependent ERAD-L pathway (7Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by pulse-chase studies in Δder1 cells in which the rate of OPY* degradation was indistinguishable from that of CPY* (Fig. 4). DPY* shares the same lumenal lesion as CPY*/OPY* but in a membrane-tethered form. Recent studies suggest that ERAD-M can supersede the ERAD-L pathway for substrates that have lesions in both a membrane anchor and a lumenal domain (26Taxis C. Hitt R. Park S.H. Deak P.M. Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35903-35913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 27Meusser B. Sommer T. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); thus any lesion in the DPY* membrane anchor might have led to degradation via the Der1p-independent ERAD-M pathway. However, our data demonstrate that DPY* degradation requires Der1p (Fig. 4) and so conclude that this degradation occurs as a result of the lumenal lesion in this protein. Finally we found that the rates of degradation of DPY* and OPY* were unaffected in Δdoa10 cells (data not shown), confirming that neither was dependent on the ERAD-C pathway (28Ravid T. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that DPY* and OPY* are efficiently degraded via the ERAD-L pathway.FIGURE 4ERAD of DPY* and OPY* is Der1p-dependent.

B, quantification of data shown in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ERAD of DPY* and OPY* Requires Functional Sec61p—Next we sought to examine any requirement for Sec61p. We have earlier shown that DPY* and OPY* can be efficiently translocated into the ER in sec61-3 mutant cells at 30 °C. We therefore tested whether these translocated substrates were competent for ERAD under these same conditions. Wild type or sec61-3 mutant cells expressing either DPY* or OPY* were labeled at 30 °C, and samples taken at various time points during a chase performed at the same temperature. We found the half-life of both DPY* and OPY* in sec61-3 cells to be indistinguishable from that in wild type cells under these conditions (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that DPY* and OPY* are available for ERAD after translocation at 30 °C in sec61-3 cells and that their degradation occurs with essentially wild type kinetics. Next we tested for any effect on ERAD following inactivation of the Sec61p-dependent translocase at 17 °C. The ER was preloaded with ERAD-competent substrate by pulse labeling at 30 °C in either wild type or sec61-3 mutant cells. The cells were then shifted to 17 °C and chased in the presence of unlabeled methionine for the times indicated (Fig. 6, A and B). We observed a dramatic increase in the stability of both substrates in sec61-3 cells when compared with wild type controls. Thus functional Sec61p is required for the ER-associated degradation of both DPY* and OPY*. It remains formally possible that the severe translocation phenotype associated with sec61-3 at 17 °C might lead to an indirect effect on ERAD, perhaps by blocking the import of some essential factor. To rule this out we first examined ERAD in sec62-1 mutant cells in which post-translational translocation is specifically blocked but found no significant difference in the rate of degradation of either substrate when compared with wild type controls (Fig. 6C). Thus ERAD of these novel substrates does not require ongoing post-translational translocation. Of course sec61-3 cells are also deficient in co-translational translocation at 17 °C. We therefore tested the effects on our ERAD substrates of a complete block in all protein translocation by treating wild type cells with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. The cells were pulse-labeled at 30 °C and then chased at either 30 or 17 °C in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 6D). We found no delay in the degradation of DPY* in the presence of drug. Because protein synthesis is not required for ERAD, it naturally follows that ongoing co-translational import of factors into the ER cannot be required. This is consistent with numerous studies in which ERAD has been observed in cells treated with cycloheximide (29Hitt R. Wolf D.H. FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 4: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A variety of studies implicate Der1p in ERAD, but its precise function remains unknown. It is clearly required for the degradation of a range of misfolded luminal proteins including CPY* (7Knop M. Finger A. Braun T. Hellmuth K. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of membrane proteins tested appear to be degraded independently of Der1p (2Vashist S. Ng D.T. J.

One notable exception is the type I integral membrane protein, KWW, whose degradation is defective in der1 mutant cells (2Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The misfolded lesion in KWW is located within its luminal domain leading to the suggestion that Der1p is required for the degradation of substrates with misfolded lumenal domains via a pathway now known as ERAD-L (2Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). A number of studies have similarly implicated Sec61p in ERAD, but the role of Sec61p in the initial translocation of such substrates into the ER complicates the analysis of degradation kinetics. We have sought to temporally separate the known role of Sec61p in translocation from any subsequent role in ERAD by exploiting the properties of the sec61-3 mutant. We have created two new ERAD substrates, both of which are imported into the ER in an SRP-dependent manner. The first, DPY*, inserts into the ER membrane as a type II integral membrane protein, whereas the second, OPY*, is subject to signal peptide cleavage and is released into the ER lumen. Both DPY* and OPY* are substrates for Der1p-dependent ERAD and so, like CPY*, must be substrates for the ERAD-L pathway. As expected, both DPY* and OPY* were efficiently translocated in sec61-3 cells at the permissive temperature of 30 °C. These translocated forms of DPY* and OPY* were evidently available to the ERAD machinery because both were degraded with kinetics that were indistinguishable from those observed in wild type cells. This allowed us to load the ER in sec61-3 cells with ERAD-competent substrate and to then inactivate Sec61p by shifting cells to 17 °C. Our data demonstrate that the inactivation of sec61-3p at 17 °C results in a rapid and substantial block in the ERAD of both DPY* and OPY*. This cannot be explained by some indirect effect of a block in sec61-3-dependent protein import because neither sec62-1 nor cycloheximide treatment had any similar effect on ERAD. Our results demonstrate that functional Sec61p is essential for degradation of ERAD-L substrates. This finding supports a model in which Sec61p forms a bi-directional protein-conducting channel for the transport of polypeptide chains both into and out of the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. It will be interesting to determine whether or not different accessory factors might engage with Sec61p to determine the directionality of transport. We thank Drs. Martin Pool and Barrie Wilkinson for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript and Professors Steve Oliver and Mark Hochstrasser for yeast strains.

https://openalex.org/W1977394099,"Iron plays an essential role in cell proliferation and is a required cofactor for a number of critical cellular enzymes. In this report we investigate changes in proteins of iron metabolism during p53-mediated replicative arrest. Following the induction of p53 in H1299 lung cancer cells containing a doxycycline-inducible p53, an increase in both H and L subunits of ferritin protein was observed. To determine the mechanism of this effect, we investigated the ability of p53 to regulate ferritin. Real time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated no difference in levels of ferritin H mRNA in the presence and absence of p53. Because these results suggested that transcriptional mechanisms were not responsible for the p53-dependent increase in ferritin, we tested whether a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved. RNA bandshift assays revealed that induction of p53 decreased iron regulatory protein binding. Consistent with this observation, Western blot analysis revealed a decline in transferrin receptor 1 protein levels following induction of p53. Collectively, these results suggest that p53 may induce cell cycle arrest not only by well described mechanisms involving the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors but also by the recruitment of pathways that reduce the availability of intracellular iron.

Collectively, these results suggest that p53 may induce cell cycle arrest not only by well described mechanisms involving the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors but also by the recruitment of pathways that reduce the availability of intracellular iron. The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a critical mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that is activated by cellular stress, including DNA damage, hypoxia, ribosomal stress, and loss of adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 1Horn H.F. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Following its induction, p53 transcriptionally induces a set of genes that can promote growth arrest, cell death, or senescence, including p21waf1, bax, fas, and KILLER/DR5 (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 can also function as a transcriptional repressor (3Brown L. Boswell S. Raj L. Lee S.W. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2007; 17: 73-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether a cell undergoes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to p53 depends on several factors, including the presence of extracellular survival factors, the presence of other oncogenic alterations, and the availability of additional transcription factors or cofactors, as well as the character and magnitude of p53 induction (4Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 5Vousden K.H. Woude G.F. Nat.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a transcription factor, p53 exhibits transcription-independent functions in the cytosol that augment its pro-apoptotic activity (1Horn H.F. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although an increase in reactive oxygen species may contribute to p53-mediated apoptosis (7Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), p53 can also play a role as an antioxidant (8Sablina A.A. Budanov A.V. Ilyinskaya G.V. Agapova L.S. Kravchenko J.E. Chumakov P.M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) by inducing genes that reduce reactive oxygen species, such as TIGAR (9Bensaad K. Tsuruta A.

Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and ALDH4 (11Yoon K.A. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 49: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Iron is critically important for cell growth and proliferation. Iron is required for the activity of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo DNA synthesis (12Eriksson S. Graslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also an important cofactor of the G1 phase cyclins E/cdk2, D/cdk5 (13Kulp K.S. Green S.L. Vulliet P.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), D1 (14Chang H.C. Lee T.H. Chuang L.Y. Yen M.H. Hung W.C. Cancer Lett. 1999; 145: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the S phase cyclin A/cdk2 (15Pahl P.M. Yan X.D. Hodges Y.K. Rosenthal E.A. Horwitz M.A. Horwitz L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17821-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as numerous proteins involved in respiration and energy metabolism. Accordingly, iron deprivation inhibits proliferation. For example, small molecule iron chelators that sequester iron can inhibit cell proliferation and/or induce apoptosis (16Greene B.T. Thorburn J. Willingham M.C. Thorburn A. Planalp R.P. Brechbiel M.W. Jennings-Gee J. Wilkinson J.t. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 4: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ferritin is a 480-kDa ubiquitous and highly conserved protein that can store up to 4500 atoms of iron (19Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). It is composed of 24 subunits of two types, termed H (heavy or heart) and L (light or liver). By sequestering iron and preventing the participation of iron in reactions that generate oxygen free radicals, ferritin plays a key role in the protection against oxidant stress (20Orino K. Lehman L. Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 21Wilkinson J.T. Pietsch E.C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Regulation of iron levels by ferritin has also been shown to affect cell growth (22Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S.

J. 1998; 335: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, the E1A adenoviral oncogene represses ferritin at a transcriptional level (25Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the c-myc proto-oncogene both represses ferritin H and stimulates IRP2 (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These events decrease iron storage and increase the availability of intracellular iron for cell proliferation (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, an increase in the labile iron pool caused by ferritin repression enhances growth induced by H-ras and reverts growth arrest induced by dominant negative H-ras (28Kakhlon O. Gruenbaum Y. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In keeping with these findings, overexpression of ferritin H can inhibit cell proliferation (22Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The iron regulatory proteins are central regulators of ferritin and other proteins of iron metabolism. Translation of both H and L subunits of ferritin are coordinately regulated through the interaction of RNA-binding proteins (iron regulatory proteins (IRPs)) 5The abbreviations used are: IRP, iron regulatory protein; IRE, iron-responsive element; TfR1, transferrin receptor 1; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. with the iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5′-untranslated region of ferritin H and L mRNAs (29Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The IRPs also regulate the stability of transferrin receptor 1 mRNA (19Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). IRE binding of the IRPs is in turn modulated by iron, as well as by oxidative stress (30Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), nitrogen radicals (31Kim S. Ponka P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12214-12219Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation (32Wallander M.L. Leibold E.A. Eisenstein R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 668-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 33Theil E.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 2074-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Under conditions of iron deprivation, the IRP proteins are activated to repress ferritin translation and stabilize transferrin receptor 1 mRNA, leading to decreased iron storage in ferritin and increased iron uptake by transferrin receptor 1; conversely, when iron is abundant, ferritin translation is induced and transferrin receptor 1 mRNA is degraded, leading to enhanced iron storage and reduced iron uptake (19Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). This elegant mechanism is a critical component of the maintenance of intracellular iron homeostasis. In this manuscript, we tested whether p53 impinges on this iron regulatory network. Specifically, we hypothesized that p53 might induce ferritin and thus limit iron availability during growth arrest. We report here that ferritin protein is indeed up-regulated by p53. However, this effect is not mediated by transcriptional activation of ferritin but rather by a p53-dependent reduction in IRP binding. Consistent with these findings, TfR1 protein was decreased by p53. These p53-mediated changes in ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 may contribute to growth arrest and support a growing set of observations that iron availability is critical to proliferative regulation during malignant change (18Buss J.L.

Cell Culture—p53.ind and p53–cells were generated by stable transfection of wild type p53 or empty vector into the H1299 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line containing a Tet-on transactivator, and were a generous gift of Dr. C. Koumenis (Wake Forest University Health Sciences), p53.ind and empty vector (p53–) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% Tet system approved fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml G418, 100 unit/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Empty vector transfected p53–cells were treated with doxycycline to control for effects of doxycycline itself, because doxycycline has weak chelating activity (14Chang H.C. Lee T.H. Chuang L.Y. Yen M.H. Hung W.C. Cancer Lett. 1999; 145: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and thus might influence iron metabolism. However, at the concentrations used in these experiments, there were no effects of doxycycline itself on any parameter measured (data not shown). HCT 116 human colon carcinoma TP53 wild type (TP53+/+) and TP53 knock-out (TP53–/–) cell lines were generous gifts from Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). These cell lines were maintained in McCoys 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Western Immunoblot—To assess p53, p21, ferritin H, ferritin L, TfR1, ferroportin, and β-actin protein levels, cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously described (35Pietsch E.C. Chan J.Y. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2361-2369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein (except in the case of TfR1 detection, where 10 μg of protein was used) was fractionated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris base, pH 7.6, NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 buffer, washed, and incubated with 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-ferritin H or anti-ferritin L peptide antibody, or 1:400 dilution of monoclonal mouse anti-p53 or anti-p21 antibody, or 1:500 rabbit anti-mouse ferroportin antibody, or 1:5,000 dilution of mouse anti-human TfR1 antibody following by a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or 1:4000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase according to primary antibodies. The blots were developed using ECL. To assure equivalent protein loading, the blots were washed and reblotted using 1:10,000 dilution of anti-β-actin antibody followed by a 1:5,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Transfection—siPort™ NeoFX™ (Ambion) was used for transient transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides into cells following the manufacturer's protocol. 10–30 nm siRNA was transfected. The siRNA target sequences were as follows: for IRP1, 5′-GGGCAAGAACGATACACTA-3′, and for IRP2, 5′-GGAAGAACATGTTATACTA-3′. Scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control. Real Time RT-PCR—Real time RT-PCR was performed as described previously (36Wang W. Di X. D'Agostino Jr., R.B. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24650-24659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: for hepcidin, forward, 5′-CTGCAACCCCAGGACAGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGAATAAATAAGGAAGGGAGGGG-3′ (37Wrighting D.M. Andrews N.C. Blood. 2006; 108: 3204-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar); and for ferritin H, forward, 5′-CTTTGACCGCGATGATGTGGCTTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTGTCAGTGGCCAGTTTGTGCAG-3′. The results were normalized using GAPDH as a control, as previously described (38Blish K.R. Wang W. Willingham M.C. Du W. Birse C.E. Krishnan S.R. Brown J.C. Hawkins G.A. Garvin A.J. D'Agostino Jr., R.B. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IRE Binding Assays—RNA band shift assays were performed as previously described (36Wang W. Di X. D'Agostino Jr., R.B. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24650-24659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (2 × 105) were lysed in 50 μl of extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Samples of cytoplasmic extract were diluted to 2 μg/μl in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg of protein from each sample was analyzed for IRP binding by incubating with 32P-labeled IRE probe. The ferritin H IRE probe was prepared from in vivo transcription of BamHI-linearized pST18 plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. P. Ponka, McGill University, Montreal, Canada). To form RNA-protein complexes, cytoplasmic extracts were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 3 × 105 cpm probe. Heparin (5 mg/ml) and RNase T1 were added for another 10 min, and RNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. Unpaired Student's t tests were used for experiments in which two groups were being compared. For all studies involving more than two groups, differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Ferritin Protein Is Increased by p53—To assess the effect of p53 on intracellular iron homeostasis, we used H1299 p53 null human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible p53 (these cells are termed p53.ind cells throughout this manuscript). Preliminary experiments indicated that optimal induction of p53 protein in these cells was attained using 1 μg/ml doxycycline (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 1A, p53 protein was induced following doxycycline treatment in these cells. To assess changes in proteins of iron metabolism following induction of p53, we first assessed whether ferritin protein levels changed after p53 induction. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of p53.ind cells with doxycycline led to an increase in both ferritin H and ferritin L protein. Control p53-H1299 cells transfected with empty vector exhibited no change in levels of ferritin in response to doxycycline, indicating that doxycycline itself did not contribute to the change in ferritin (Fig. 1B). To confirm the ability of p53 to induce ferritin protein, we compared ferritin levels in HCT 116 human colon carcinoma TP53 wild type (TP53+/+) and TP53 knock-out (TP53–/–) cells. As shown in Fig. 2, p53 expression was also associated with higher levels of ferritin H in these cells. p53-dependent Induction of Ferritin Is Not Transcriptionally Mediated—To test whether the increase in ferritin was mediated at a transcriptional level, we examined the effect of p53 on ferritin reporter genes. Chimeric genes that fused 1.2 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the human ferritin H gene to the firefly luciferase reporter gene were constructed. This region of the ferritin H promoter contains numerous important regulatory sequences, including G-fer (–0.291 kb), A box (–0.132 kb), and B box (–0.062 kb) transcription regulation regions (19Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). We observed that wild type p53 did not induce, and in fact repressed, the hFerritin H promoter (data not shown). Similar results were obtained following transfection of a mouse ferritin H promoter containing 4.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequence into mouse fibroblasts containing either endogenous or transfected p53; in all cases, p53 failed to induce the ferritin H promoter (data not shown). To confirm these results, we examined the levels of endogenous ferritin mRNA in the presence and absence of p53. p53.ind cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h to induce p53, and the levels of ferritin H mRNA were compared with untreated cells by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of ferritin H mRNA were not increased in response to p53. IRE Binding of IRPs Is Decreased by p53—Because these results suggested that transcriptional mechanisms were not responsible for the p53-dependent increase in ferritin, we tested whether a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved. Because the IRPs are central regulators of the translation of ferritin, we examined effects of p53 on IRE binding of IRPs. p53.ind H1299 cells were treated with doxycycline to induce p53 for 24 h, and IRE binding was assessed by bandshift assays. As depicted in Fig. 4, left panels, induction of p53 decreased IRE binding compared with controls. Because p53 can function as a transcriptional repressor, we tested whether p53 inhibited IRP through direct transcriptional repression. IRP mRNA levels were assessed by real time RT-PCR in cells treated with or without doxycycline for 24 h. mRNA levels of GAPDH were used as a control. There was no change in mRNA levels for either IRP1 or IRP2 under these conditions (Table 1).TABLE 1Induction of p53 in H1299 cells does not affect levels of IRP mRNA-p53+p53IRP1/GAPDH1.01.0 ± 0.1IRP2/GAPDH1.00.9 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To confirm the ability of p53 to reduce IRE binding of IRPs, we compared IRE binding in HCT116 p53–/– and HCT116 p53+/+ cells. In accord with results obtained using doxycycline-inducible p53, IRP binding was also decreased in HCT116 p53 +/+ cells compared with HCT116 p53–/– cells (Fig. 4, right panels). IRP1 Plays an Important Role in p53-mediated Induction of Ferritin—To determine whether p53-mediated induction of ferritin is attributable to IRP1, IRP2, or both, we assessed the effect of knockdown of IRPs on p53-dependent ferritin H induction. siRNA was used to knock down IRP1, IRP2, or both in H1299 cells. Scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control. As assessed by real time RT-PCR, in IRP1 knockdown cells, IRP1 was knocked down to 58 ± 8% of control (means ± S.D.). In IRP2 knockdown cells, IRP2 was knockdown to 51 ± 12%. In cells in which IRP1 and IRP2 were simultaneously knocked down, IRP1 was knocked down to 53 ± 5%, and IRP2 was knocked down to 47 ± 7%. The cells were then treated with doxycycline to induce p53, and ferritin H protein measured by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, p53-mediated ferritin induction was preserved in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (compare lane 2 with lane 1). In contrast, knockdown of IRP1 or the combination of IRP1 and IRP2 abolished ferritin induction by p53 (compare lane 4 with lane 3 and lane 8 with lane 7). Induction of ferritin was preserved following knockdown of IRP2, although the magnitude of the effect was diminished (compare lane 5 with lane 6). There was no apparent effect of IRP1 knockdown on basal levels of ferritin, perhaps because of the relatively modest levels of knockdown attained in these cells. These results demonstrate that p53 exerts its effects on ferritin through IRPs, with IRP1 playing a prominent role. Effects of p53 on Ferritin Are Not Mediated through a Regulatory Loop Involving Hepcidin and Ferroportin—p53 has recently been shown to induce hepcidin transcription (39Weizer-Stern O. Adamsky K. Margalit O. Ashur-Fabian O. Givol D. Amariglio N. Rechavi G. Br. J. Haematol. 2007; 138: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that binds directly to ferroportin, an iron efflux pump, and triggers its degradation (40Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2004; 306: 2090-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Thus an increase in hepcidin would be expected to decrease iron efflux, potentially leading to an increase in cellular iron, an increase in ferritin, and a decrease in IRP binding. To test whether p53 mediates its effects on iron homeostasis via a pathway involving hepcidin and ferroportin, we induced p53 in H1299 cells and assessed its effects on hepcidin mRNA and ferroportin protein. Consistent with previous results, we observed that hepcidin mRNA was modestly induced by p53 (Fig. 6A), although the basal level of hepcidin mRNA was low in this cell line. However, the increase in hepcidin was insufficient to alter the levels of ferroportin protein, as measured by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). TfR1 Protein Expression Decreases Following the Decline in IRP Binding—TfR1 plays a prominent role in cellular iron uptake and is another important contributor to overall cellular iron status that is regulated by IRPs. To determine whether the effects of p53 on proteins of iron metabolism were more broadly based, we measured TfR1 protein levels by Western blot analysis following induction of p53. As depicted in Fig. 7, TfR1 levels declined following induction of p53. This result is consistent with the decrease in IRP binding seen in Fig. 4, because a reduction in IRP destabilizes TfR1 mRNA (29Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Changes in Ferritin and TfR1 Occur Following Induction of p53 and Are Associated with Cell Cycle Arrest—To determine whether these changes in proteins of iron metabolism are associated with cell cycle arrest, we assessed expression of p21 following induction of p53. As shown in Fig. 8A, p53 was induced at 4 h following doxycycline addition, reached a peak at 24 h, and remained at maximal levels until ∼48 h. After 48 h, the levels of p53 began to decline as expected, because of the known ability of p53 to transcriptionally induce mdm2, an ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation (41Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). As anticipated from the ability of p53 to transcriptionally activate p21 (7Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), p21 levels increased following p53 induction (Fig. 8A). To determine the effect of p53 on cell proliferation, growth rate and viability were measured. As shown in Fig. 8B, cell replication was arrested in cells induced to express p53. Growth of control cells was not affected by doxycycline. There was no evidence of increased cell death following p53 induction as measured by trypan blue exclusion, suggesting that under these conditions p53 induced cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. Thus these cells exhibit p53-dependent growth arrest. Time course analysis revealed that the decrease in TfR1 protein was coordinate with the induction of ferritin H and ferritin L and occurred following the increase in p53 and p21 (Fig. 9). These p53-dependent changes in the proteins of iron metabolism are incorporated into a model of p53-dependent growth arrest in Fig. 10.FIGURE 9Time course of induction of p53, p21, ferritin H, ferritin L, and TfR1 following induction of p53 by doxycycline. Ferritin and TfR1 levels were measured in four to five independent experiments; all other measurements were performed at least three times. Relative protein amount in extracts from p53–cells with Dox was defined as 1. Standard errors are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 10A role for iron in p53-mediated growth arrest. p53 induces cell cycle arrest at both the G1 and G2 cell cycle checkpoints through the induction of multiple genes. These include the cdk kinase inhibitor p21, as well as genes such as 14-3-3σ, Reprimo, GADD45, and others not illustrated here. p53 affects iron metabolism by reducing IRP activity, reducing transferrin receptor 1, and increasing ferritin. The ensuing reduction in iron may mimic effects of iron depletion induced by iron chelators, triggering events that further contribute to inhibition of cell cycle progression, including inhibition of cyclins D and E and cdk2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The intracellular availability of iron has been linked to cell proliferation. Oncogenes, including E1A (25Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), c-myc (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and H-ras (28Kakhlon O. Gruenbaum Y. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), repress ferritin and increase the pool of iron available for proliferation (the labile iron pool). Conversely, forced overexpression of ferritin increases the sequestration of iron, reduces the labile iron pool, and reduces growth rate (22Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The negative effect of ferritin H on cell growth is dependent on the ferroxidase activity of ferritin and is secondary to the iron deficiency induced by it (22Cozzi A. Corsi B. Levi S. Santambrogio P. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25122-25129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that p53-induced growth arrest triggers multiple changes in iron homeostasis. Following the addition of doxycycline to cells expressing doxycycline-inducible p53, we observed an early increase in p53 protein levels (Figs. 8 and 9). This was followed by an increase in p21 and growth arrest by 24 h (Fig. 8). At the 24-time point, IRP proteins exhibited a decrease in binding (Fig. 4). Because IRP proteins bind to ferritin mRNA and inhibit its translation and also bind to TfR1 mRNA to stabilize the TfR1 message, a reduction in IRP binding would be expected to both increase ferritin protein and decrease levels of the transferrin receptor. These changes were observed after induction of p53 (Figs. 1, 7, and 9). These responses are expected to decrease the size of the labile iron pool (24Kakhlon O. Gruenbaum Y. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 311-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to test whether changes in IRP binding were accompanied by changes in the labile iron pool. However, although we were readily able to detect changes in the labile iron pool in HeLa cells, the small size of the iron pool in both p53.ind and p53-H1299 cells prevented us from accurately assessing p53-mediated changes in the labile iron pool. 6F. Zhang and J. Buss, unpublished observations. Overall, however, our results support a model in which p53 induces changes in proteins of iron metabolism that operate to restrict the amount of iron available for proliferation. We speculate that iron limitation may collaborate with other p53-dependent mechanisms, such as the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, to facilitate growth arrest (Fig. 10). Our results demonstrate that IRP binding is repressed in cells induced to express p53 (Fig. 4). Because induction of p53 by doxycycline did not affect levels of either IRP1 or IRP2 mRNA, this is not due to direct transcriptional repression of IRP mRNA in H1299 cells (Table 1). We speculate that p53 may regulate IRP binding at a post-transcriptional level, perhaps through the activity of one or more of the downstream targets of p53. For example, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and protein kinases are known modulators of IRP binding (32Wallander M.L. Leibold E.A. Eisenstein R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 668-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); all of these are directly or indirectly affected by p53 and its target genes (1Horn H.F. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 41Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our results suggest that IRP1 may be a more important target of p53 than IRP2, because knockdown of IRP1 completely abrogated p53-mediated ferritin H induction, whereas knockdown of IRP2 had only a modest effect (Fig. 5). Following induction of p53, both ferritin H and L subunits were increased, consistent with the involvement of IRPs, which translationally regulate both ferritin subunits (19Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Blood. 2002; 99: 3505-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Transcriptional mechanisms that target both ferritin H and L are also known (for example, oxidative stress and chemopreventive agents induce both ferritin subunits (21Wilkinson J.T. Pietsch E.C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Epsztejn S. Glickstein H. Picard V. Slotki I.N. Breuer W. Beaumont C. Cabantchik Z.I.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 42Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); however, induction of p53 did not induce ferritin transcription. In fact, reporter assays indicated that ferritin H promoter activity was slightly repressed by p53 (data not shown), consistent with results reported by others (43Faniello M.C. Di Sanzo M. Quaresima B. Baudi F. Di Caro V. Cuda G. Morrone G. Del Sal G. Spinelli G. Venuta S. Costanzo F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 40: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This may reflect interaction of p53 with sequences present in the luciferase plasmid used for creation of ferritin reporter constructs or an artifactual effect on the relatively short (∼1 kb) ferritin H promoter sequence used in these studies, because we found no effect of p53 on the endogenous ferritin H gene as assessed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 3) or Northern blot analyses (data not shown). Overall, our results suggest a model in which restriction of available iron contributes to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest (Fig. 10). Extensive work from other laboratories has shown that p53 transcriptionally activates genes such as p21, 14-3-3σ, Reprimo, GADD45, and others to inhibit cell cycle progression (1Horn H.F. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1306-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that by inducing ferritin and repressing TfR1, p53 simultaneously recruits pathways that restrict the availability of intracellular iron as an additional mechanism to limit cell cycle progression. This is consistent with studies of small molecule iron chelators, which have shown that iron depletion facilitates growth arrest by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, an iron-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis (12Eriksson S. Graslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as by inhibiting cyclins D, A, and B and cdk2 (34Gao J. Richardson D.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 44Nurtjahja-Tjendraputra E. Fu D. Phang J.M. Richardson D.R. Blood. 2007; 109: 4045-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to triggering growth arrest, p53 can also induce apoptosis, particularly in response to chemotherapeutic drugs (45Vousden K.H. Lane D.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Depletion of the labile iron pool by p53-dependent inactivation of IRPs and induction of ferritin H may also contribute to resistance to such agents, particularly those that bind iron, such as the anthracyclines (46Minotti G. Recalcati S. Mordente A. Liberi G. Calafiore A.M. Mancuso C. Preziosi P. Cairo G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the adenoviral oncogene E1A represses ferritin (30Tsuji Y. Ayaki H. Whitman S.P. Morrow C.S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5818-5827Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The oncogene c-myc also represses ferritin and activates IRP2, expanding the labile iron pool and facilitating proliferation (26Wu K.J. Polack A. Dalla-Favera R. Science. 1999; 283: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Similarly, growth stimulated by activated H-ras is facilitated by ferritin repression and retarded by ferritin overexpression (24Kakhlon O. Gruenbaum Y. Cabantchik Z.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 311-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that oncogenes may expand the labile iron pool as part of their pro-proliferative activity. In this report we examine events that ensue following p53-mediated cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the tumor suppressor p53 triggers events opposite to those induced by oncogenes, including inactivation of IRP, induction of ferritin, and reduction of TfR1. Our data suggest that restricting iron availability is a possible additional pathway that contributes to p53-mediated growth arrest."

Here we show that the endogenous polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate B (CSB) promotes the formation of fibrillar structures of the 42-residue fragment, Aβ1–42. Atomic force microscopy visualization, thioflavin T fluorescence, CD measurements, and cell viability assays indicate that CSB-induced fibrils are highly stable entities with abundant β-sheet structure that have little toxicity for neuroblastoma cells. We propose a wedged cylinder model for Aβ1–42 fibrils that is consistent with the majority of available data, it is an energetically favorable assembly that minimizes the exposure of hydrophobic areas, and it explains why fibrils do not grow in thickness. Fluorescence measurements of the effect of different Aβ1–42 species on Ca2+ homeostasis show that weakly structured nodular fibrils, but not CSB-induced smooth fibrils, trigger a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ that depends on the presence of both extracellular and intracellular stocks. In vitro assays indicate that such transient, local Ca2+ increases can have a direct effect in promoting the formation of Tau filaments similar to those isolated from Alzheimer disease brains.

It is generally accepted that the aggregative state of Aβ is a paramount issue in determining its degree of neurotoxicity.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 13Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J.

Baudry J. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Stine W.B. Emmerling M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Among the different forms of Aβ, the 42-residue fragment (Aβ1–42) readily self-associates and forms nucleation centers from where fibrils can quickly grow. In a previous work, we characterized the different species that appear during Aβ1–42 fibrillogenesis in vitro, from oligomers through protofibrillar forms to mature fibrils (15Arimon M. Díez-Pérez I. Kogan M.J. Durany N. Giralt E. Sanz F. Fernàndez-Busquets X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although active debate is centered on the issue of which is the pathogenic species of the peptide that ultimately causes the synaptic loss and dementia associated with AD (16Mandavilli A. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), comparatively less effort is being devoted to the study of endogenous factors that can promote or inhibit the formation of the candidate neurotoxic forms. There are evidences indicating that the appearance of insoluble fibrillar structures enriched in β-sheets is facilitated by diverse environmental factors (17Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The amounts of Aβ in vivo are generally much smaller than the concentrations required to induce fibril formation in vitro. It is therefore likely that other molecules exist that play an important role in the formation and deposition of amyloid fibrils and plaques. Carbohydrates are ubiquitous components of plasma, like glucose, that is found in brain tissue in millimolar amounts (18Gruetter R. Novotny E.J. Boulware S.D. Rothman D.L. Mason G.F. Shulman G.I. Shulman R.G. Tamborlane W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and are also present in long-lasting structures of the extracellular matrix (ECM) such as proteoglycans. Proteoglycans are highly glycosylated proteins often carrying multiple negatively charged polysaccharides termed glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are among the most abundant components in the ECM of many tissues, including the brain (19Meyer-Puttlitz B.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). From a chemical point of view, GAGs are unbranched polymers of repeated disaccharide units, usually containing an amino sugar and a uronic acid. Except in the case of hyaluronan, GAGs have varying degrees of sulfation. Proteoglycans and GAGs are found associated with all types of amyloid deposits (21Ancsin J.B.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that GAGs may have a scaffolding role, promoting fibrillogenesisprone conformations of the amyloid precursor proteins (21Ancsin J.B. Amyloid. 2003; 10: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Aβ1–42 and other aggregating peptides like prion protein peptide 106–126 and Tau peptide 317–335 share cationic motifs that may be involved in binding to the negative charges of sulfated GAGs (33Díaz-Nido J. Wandosell F. Avila J. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34McLaurin J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6353-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other linear anionic polymers such as nucleic acids have also been described to bind prions with high affinity (35Caughey B. Baron G.S. Nature. 2006; 443: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Silva J.L. Lima L.M. Foguel D. Cordeiro Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 132-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that polymeric molecules with repeating anionic and hydrophobic surfaces might be efficient inducers of amyloid structure. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans have been found to be associated with the lesions of AD (37DeWitt D.A. Silver J. Canning D.R. Perry G. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and heparan and chondroitin sulfate GAGs attenuate the neurotoxic effect of Aβ in primary neuronal cultures (38Woods A.G. Cribbs D.H. Whittemore E.R. Cotman C.W. Brain Res. 1995; 697: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in neuron-like cell lines (39Pollack S.J. Sadler I.I. Hawtin S.R. Tailor V.J. Shearman M.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 184: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because GAGs can bind Aβ, it is conceivable that GAG-mediated neuroprotection is due to the sequestering of Aβ, in agreement with the hypothesis that the generation of senile plaques in AD would be a partially protective response aimed at reducing Aβ neurotoxicity. Supportive of this view is the finding that low susceptibility of neurons and cortical areas to neurofibrillar deposition corresponds with high proportions of aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the neuronal microenvironment (40Bruckner G. Hausen D. Hartig W. Drlicek M. Arendt T. Brauer K. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite this clearly established relationship between GAGs, Aβ, and AD onset and progression described above, little is known about the type of Aβ-containing structures induced by carbohydrates in general and by GAGs in particular. Much attention has focused on Aβ as causative agent for AD, but accumulating evidence points to disruptions in neuronal Ca2+ signaling as a consistent progenitor for the disease, occurring prior to the development of the histopathological markers and cognitive decline (41Stutzmann G.E. Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ hypothesis of AD proposes that sustained and accumulated alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis are a proximal cause in neurodegenerative diseases (42Khachaturian Z.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 747: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Thus, alterations in the permeability to Ca2+ of the cell membrane could be one of the events linking Aβ and Tau aggregation, the two processes central to the amyloid cascade theory. It is likely that if Aβ has a role in permeabilizing the cell membrane to Ca2+, this effect will depend on its aggregated state, i.e. globular oligomers and fibrils might elicit different responses. In turn, because Aβ aggregation is influenced by ECM components such as GAGs, these might be able to modulate a putative Aβ-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+. To tackle these issues, we have exposed Aβ1–42 to carbohydrates, studying the structures formed, their cytotoxicity, their ability to alter the permeability to Ca2+ of culture cells, and the effect of Aβ-induced Ca2+ dyshomeostasis on Tau aggregation. Preparation of Aβ1–42 and Tau—Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, except where otherwise indicated. Aβ1–42 synthesized by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Japan) was purchased lyophilized in glass vials and stored at −80 °C immediately upon arrival. As a rule, lyophilized Aβ1–42 was dissolved to 10 μm in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB). When complete disaggregation of Aβ1–42 was required, we followed a variant of Zagorski's protocol (43Zagorski M.G. Yang J. Shao H. Ma K. Zeng H. Hong A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) as described (15Arimon M. Díez-Pérez I. Kogan M.J. Durany N. Giralt E. Sanz F. Fernàndez-Busquets X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated in the dark for the times indicated in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at 37 °C with gentle rocking. For the production of control oligomeric or fibrillar preparations of Aβ1–42 we followed established protocols (9Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligomers were prepared by diluting 5 mm Aβ1–42 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to 200 μm in phenol red-free Ham's F12 cell culture medium, immediately vortexing for 30 s, and incubating at 4 °C for 24 h. Fibrils were prepared by diluting 5 mm Aβ1–42 in DMSO to 200 μm in 10 mm HCl, immediately vortexing for 30 s, and incubating at 37 °C for 24 h. When carbohydrates had to be present they were included in the solutions prior to adding them to the peptide. A stock solution of recombinant Tau protein was prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein to 0.5 mg/ml in 30 mm TBS, pH 7.4, and stored at −20 °C. For assays, Tau aliquots were diluted to the required concentrations in PB and incubated in the dark at 37 °C. Electrophoresis and Immunoblots—Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (15Arimon M. Díez-Pérez I. Kogan M.J. Durany N. Giralt E. Sanz F. Fernàndez-Busquets X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), in Tricine gels containing 0.1% SDS. Immunoblots were transferred to (and dot blots spotted on) a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) with a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad), blocked in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween 20, 1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated in the presence of rabbit anti-Aβ1–40, mouse anti-chondroitin-4-sulfate (Acris Antibodies), or mouse anti-Tau (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences Corp.) was used to visualize the decorated bands or dots. Atomic Force Microscopy—Images were obtained with a commercial MultiMode atomic force microscope controlled by a Nanoscope IV electronics (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) equipped with either a 12-μm scanner (E-scanner) or a 120-μm scanner (J-scanner), or with a commercial MFP-3D (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA). Oxide-sharpened pyramidal Si3N4 tips mounted on triangular 100-μm long cantilevers (k = 0.08 N/m) were purchased from Olympus (Tokyo, Japan). Except where otherwise indicated, images were taken in liquid using a tapping mode cell without the O-ring seal, following established protocols (15Arimon M. Díez-Pérez I. Kogan M.J. Durany N. Giralt E. Sanz F. Fernàndez-Busquets X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After the indicated incubation times and immediately before imaging, 10 μl of the sample were allowed to adsorb for about 5–10 min at room temperature on freshly cleaved muscovite mica (Asheville-Schoonmaker Mica Co.) or highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (Nt-MDT Co., Zelenograd, Moscow, Russia), and finally overlaid with ∼100 μl of the corresponding incubation buffer. Mica-supported dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers were prepared as described (44Garcia-Manyes S. Oncins G. Sanz F. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1812-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For images taken in air, the surface was carefully rinsed with deionized water and gently dried under a N2 stream. Except where otherwise indicated, z scale for amplitude images was 0.2 V. Cell Cultures and Ca2+ Imaging—Cell culture media and other reagents were obtained from Biological Industries, unless specified otherwise. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (CRL-2266, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2, and the medium was replaced every 2 days. Cells were plated at a density of ∼5000 cells/dish in 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp.) for at least 24 h before transfection. One μg of plasmid encoding cameleon YC3.60 (45Nagai T. Yamada S. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10554-10559Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama, Japan) was mixed with 3 μl FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Basel, Switzerland) in 1.5 ml Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen), and added to the cells. After 6 h, the medium was removed and cells were incubated in Ham's F-12 containing 15% fetal calf serum for 4–6 days. One day before the measurements, the culture medium was changed to Ham's F12 containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. In the experiments where extracellular Ca2+ was depleted, cells were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+/Mg2+, and medium was changed to Hanks' balanced salt solution without Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 2 mm EGTA before application of the amyloids. Thapsigargin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a specific blocker of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase Ca2+ pumps, was added at a final concentration of 2 μm in Ham's F-12 containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Amyloids were applied by pipetting a fixed aliquot (100 μl) of the preincubated solution into the temperature controlled recording chamber containing the cells in 900 μl of medium (for a 1-ml final volume). Controls included the incubation of cells in HCl-containing medium, which in the absence of Aβ1–42 did not induce any Ca2+ response. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (Calbiochem) was used as a control at the end of each experiment to saturate YC3.60. Cells were visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope Leica TCS SP2 (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope with a CO2- and temperature-controlled atmosphere (Life Imaging Services, Reinsch, Switzerland). Cameleon YC3.60 was excited with a 458 nm line of an argon ion laser. Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) signals were collected by using a 458/514 double dichroic mirror and 510/590 (YFP) and 465/530 (CFP) emission ranges. Images (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired every5sata 400-Hz scan rate with a 40× Leitz Pla-Apochromat objective (numerical aperture 1.25, oil). To quantitatively analyze the changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer, raw CFP and YFP fluorescence intensity were quantified in Leica LCS software and the data obtained were exported to Microsoft Excel for further analysis. Fluorescence intensity was calculated as the average within the regions drawn around individual cells, and a suitable threshold was set to avoid background signal. Signals are expressed as normalized fluorescence ratio (R/Ro), where R is the fluorescence ratio at any time calculated as FYFP/FCFP and Ro is the basal fluorescence ratio, which is obtained by averaging 20 scans before amyloid stimulation. Immunocytochemistry—SH-SY5Y cells were cultured on coverslips in Petri dishes as described above. After incubation for the specified times in the absence or presence of Aβ1–42 HCl fibrils, cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 15 min with a solution of 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 60 mm saccharose. Fixed cells were washed with PBS containing 20 mm glycine and permeabilized for 10 min with a solution of 0.05% Triton X-100 and 20 mm glycine in PBS. To block nonspecific antibody binding, coverslips were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a blocking PBS solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm glycine. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber for 1 h with monoclonal antibody anti-Tau or anti-α-tubulin diluted in blocking solution at 20 μg/ml. After a washing step, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were obtained with an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope and a 60× Plan Apochromatic objective (numerical aperture 1.4, oil). Alexa Fluor 546 was excited at 543 nm with a He-Ne laser, and image size was 1024 × 1024 pixels. Three-dimensional maximum projection images were obtained from 12 serial optical sections (z-step = 500 nm) at the confocal microscope normal rate. Fluorescence Spectroscopy and CD Assays—A stock solution of 10 mm thioflavin T (ThT) prepared in PB was filtered and diluted in PB to a final concentration of 20 μm. Except where otherwise indicated, samples containing 20 μm Aβ1–42 and/or 2 mg/ml carbohydrate were mixed with an equal volume of 20 μm ThT. Fluorescence was measured in 348-well plates (Nunc) using a BioTek FL600 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 and 485 nm, respectively. The reported values have been corrected by subtracting the buffer fluorescence in the absence of amyloid and/or carbohydrate. Samples were prepared in triplicate for each experiment. CD measurements were performed with a UV-visible Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control system using a 1-mm path length silica quartz cuvette (Hellma). Samples were measured at wavelengths between 190 and 250 nm with a 1 nm step resolution and an integration time of 2 s. Spectra recorded at 25 °C were an average of 20 scans baseline-corrected from where the buffer spectrum was subtracted. The contribution of CSB to the CD signal in the Aβ/CSB mixture was removed by subtracting the corresponding spectrum. Cell Viability Assays—SH-SY5Y were plated at 20,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in 100 μl of Ham's F-12 medium with 15% fetal calf serum. After 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere the medium was substituted by 100 μl of peptide-containing solution prepared by dissolving 10 μl of concentrated Aβ1–42 in 90 μl of Ham's F-12 with 0.5% fetal calf serum, to reach the desired final Aβ concentration. Incubation was resumed for the times indicated. 10 μl of 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate labeling reagent (WST-1, Roche Diagnostics GmbH) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated in the same conditions for 4 h. After thoroughly mixing for 1 min on a shaker, the absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm. WST-1 in the absence of cells was used as blank. Samples were prepared in triplicate for each experiment. Transmission Electron Microscopy—Aβ fibrils were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PB and kept in the fixative for 3 h at 4 °C. Fixed fibrils were washed and postfixed at 4 °C with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer containing 0.8% potassium ferricyanide. Then, the sample was dehydrated in acetone, with addition of 5% uranyl acetate in the 70% acetone step, infiltrated with Lowicryl HM20 resin during 2 days, embedded in the same resin, and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were obtained with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome and mounted on Formvar-coated copper grids. Sections were finally stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water and 0.8% lead citrate. For Tau samples, a 5- to 10-μl aliquot was placed on a Formvar-coated copper grid, allowed to stand for 1 min, washed with distilled water, and finally stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min. All samples were observed in a JEM-1010 electron microscope (Jeol, Japan) operated at 80 kV. Protofibrillar and Oligomeric Aβ1–42 Can Form Different Types of Associations—Atomic force microscope (AFM) visualization on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) provides a good resolution of molecular species that have affinity for hydrophobic surfaces. During the first stages of aggregation, Aβ1–42 can adopt either a globular or a fibrillar structure depending on the method used to prepare the sample (Fig. 1). Aβ1–42 directly dissolved in phosphate buffer or PBS quickly forms protofibrils up to 100 nm long (Fig. 1, A–D). Protofibrils have a characteristic ribbon-like shape ∼1.5 nm high and ∼5.5 nm wide (15Arimon M. Díez-Pérez I. Kogan M.J. Durany N. Giralt E. Sanz F. Fernàndez-Busquets X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and can associate in elongated fibril-like clusters (Fig. 1, A and B). AFM images taken minutes apart have revealed rearrangements of individual protofibrils (Fig. 1, C and D) that include shuffling and growth. Pretreatment of Aβ1–42 with trifluoroacetic acid reduces the formation of protofibril nucleating centers, and globular structures with a mean height of ∼5 nm deposit on a hydrophilic mica substrate as the major initial species (15Arimon M.

In this study, we examined the expression and function of three CS sulfotransferases in the developing neocortex: uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST), N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (4,6-ST) and dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4-ST), which are responsible for the synthesis of oversulfated structures. The CS chains of the neocortex of mouse embryos contained significant amounts of D and E units that are generated by UST and 4,6-ST, respectively. UST and 4,6-ST mRNAs were expressed in the ventricular and subventricular zones, and their expression increased during late embryonic development. In utero electroporation experiments indicated that knockdown of UST and 4,6-ST resulted in the disturbed migration of cortical neurons. The neurons electroporated with the short hairpin RNA constructs of UST and 4,6-ST accumulated in the lower intermediate zone and in the subventricular zone, showing a multipolar morphology. The cDNA constructs of UST and 4,6-ST rescued the defects caused by the RNA interference, and the neurons were able to migrate radially. On the other hand, knockdown of D4-ST, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the iB unit, caused no migratory defects.

The CS portions are considered to be the major determinants of function, because digestion with chondroitinase ABC (CHase ABC) diminishes many of the activities of CS proteoglycans (1Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies have shown that CS proteoglycans bind with various growth factors, chemokines, and extracellular matrix molecules via CS chains in a CS structure-dependent manner (14Probstmeier R.

However, little is known about the significance of structural variation of CS chains in the nervous system. CS chains are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by sequential modifications after the polymerization of repeating disaccharide units of GlcA and GalNAc (O unit) (20Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In the process of biosynthesis, some of the GlcA residues are converted to IdoA by chondroitin-glucuronate C5-epimerase, producing the iO unit (IdoAα1–3GalNAc), and then the CS precursors are heavily sulfated by various sulfotransferases (Fig. 1A). Although most of the disaccharide units are monosulfated ones that are called the A unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)) and C unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), a minor but significant portion is disulfated (2Ida M. Shuo T. Hirano K. Tokita Y. Nakanishi, K, Matsui F. Aono S. Fujita H. Fujiwara Y. Kaji T. Oohira A. J. Biol.

Recent studies revealed that the disulfated disaccharide units, which are classified into iB (IdoA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)), D (GlcA(2-O-sulfate)β1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)), and E (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate)) units (Fig. 1A), constitute the binding sites for various heparin-binding growth factors, regulating their physiological activities (15Deepa S.S.

Several in vitro studies suggested that oversulfated structures in CS chains are involved in neuritogenesis and neuronal migration (5Maeda N. Noda M. J.

Notably, by using a Boyden chamber cell migration assay, we previously demonstrated that D unit- and E unit-rich CS preparations strongly inhibited the pleiotrophin/midkine-induced migration of cortical neurons (5Maeda N.

However, no in vivo evidence has been presented for the functions of oversulfated structures in the CNS. Three sulfotransferases, uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST) (26Kobayashi M. Sugumaran G. Liu J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36344-36353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), play critical roles in the biosynthesis of oversulfated structures (Fig. 1A). D units are generated by UST from C units, and E units are synthesized through sulfation of A units by 4,6-ST. iB units are synthesized by UST from iA units (IdoAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)) that are generated by sulfation of iO units by D4-ST. In this study, we analyzed the expression of these sulfotransferases and tried to reveal the in vivo functions of CS-disulfated disaccharide structures in the developing cortex using in utero RNAi. By knockdown or overexpression of UST and 4,6-ST, we could down- or up-regulate the expression of disulfated disaccharide units in the CS chains. Knockdown of UST and 4,6-ST resulted in severe defects in the radial migration of cortical neurons, and the cDNA constructs of these sulfotransferases rescued this defect. These observations suggest that the expression of CS-oversulfated structures changes the behavior of neurons, possibly by modifying their modes of interaction with extracellular environments. Animals—Pregnant ICR mice were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). All of the animal experiments were performed with the approval by the Animal Use and Care Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience. Disaccharide Composition Analysis of CS Chains—After ether anesthesia, cerebra of embryonic day 16 (E16), E18, postnatal day 1 (P1), P7, P10, P14, and P20 mice were dissected out, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were cut into 16-μm-thick sagittal sections, which were collected onto glass slides. The hippocampal and striatal regions were scraped off with a microsurgical blade under a stereomicroscope. The CS disaccharide composition was analyzed using trimmed sections 40–60 mm2 in total area. The sections on the glass slides were fixed with 1 ml of methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 5 min. After the solution was discarded, the slides were further treated with 1 ml of the same solution for 5 min twice. The sections were air-dried and then washed twice with distilled water. They were again air-dried and treated with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in distilled water for 15 min. After three washes with distilled water, the sections were equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium acetate for 2 min. They were then treated with 100 μl of 0.3 units/ml CHase ABC (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) in 100 mm ammonium acetate for 2 h at 37°C. The solutions were collected into microcentrifuge tubes, and the sections were extracted with 500 μl of distilled water. The combined solutions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were dried by SpeedVac lyophilization. The dried materials were treated with 5 μl of 0.35 m 2-aminobenzamide, 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride in 30% acetic acid, 70% dimethyl sulfoxide for 2 h at 65 °C. After the removal of excess 2-aminobenzamide by paper chromatography, the fluorescently labeled unsaturated disaccharides were identified and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a YMC pack PA-03 column (YMC, Kyoto, Japan) according to the method described by Mitsunaga et al. (21Mitsunaga C. Mikami T. Mizumoto S. Fukuda J. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18942-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The COS-7 cells cultured under a serum-free condition on 6-cm diameter dishes were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and then fixed with 1 ml of methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were scraped off using a cell scraper, and the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellets were washed with 500 μl of methanol twice and then air-dried. The cells were treated with 100 μl of 0.3 units/ml CHase ABC in 100 mm ammonium acetate for 2 h at 37 °C. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the resultant supernatants were mixed with three volumes of ethanol. After incubation at −20 °C for 30 min, the solutions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were dried by SpeedVac lyophilization. The dried materials were treated with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed with anion exchange HPLC as described above. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—After ether anesthesia, the cerebral cortices were dissected out from ICR mice, and the total RNA was purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For the synthesis of first strand cDNA, 2 μg of the total RNA was treated with ReverTra Ace and an oligo(dT)20 RT primer (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Primer sequences of CS sulfotransferases are as follows: for UST, 5′-AGACATGTCCACTTCCTCAACTTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAAGCGACGGAAGAAATAGTTAGA-3′ (reverse); for 4,6-ST, 5′-ATATGTTTTCTGTAATCCCCAGCAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTAGAGCACGTAGGAATTGGTCAG-3′ (reverse); for D4-ST, 5′-GCCTGCTCTAACTGGAAACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGCCAGAAACACCAAGTCA-3′ (reverse). Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit; Qiagen) and an ABI PRISM 7500 (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of the genes were normalized to that of glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using the following primers: 5′-AGTCTACTGGTGTCTTCACCACCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTTGTCATATTTCTCGTGGTTCAC-3′ (reverse). In Situ Hybridization—Fragments of CS sulfotransferase genes were amplified by PCR from a mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using the following primer sets: for UST (685 bp), 5′-GCTACCCTGGTGGTCTTCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGAGCAGGAAGTTTTCGTTC-3′ (reverse); for 4,6-ST (681 bp), 5′-CTGCCAGGATTGAGTTCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTTGGCTTCTGGTTGAAAG-3′ (reverse); for D4-ST (393 bp), 5′-TTTCCCCGCCCTCTGACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCACCGGCAAGTCCCA-3′ (reverse). The amplified CS sulfotransferase gene fragments were inserted into the pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the antisense or sense probes were produced using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of fluorescein RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science). After ether anesthesia, brains of E14, E16, and E18 embryos were dissected out and immersion-fixed in Bouin's solution and then embedded in paraffin after dehydration through a graded alcohol series. The paraffin-embedded brains were cut into 5-μm-thick sagittal sections, which were deparaffinized and then pretreated with 0.2 n HCl and 20 μg/ml proteinase K. After prehybridizing in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, they were hybridized with the riboprobes in the hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml heparin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA) at 70 °C for 18 h. The washing step was performed sequentially as follows: 1) 4× SSC, 2) 2× SSC at 65 °C for 30 min (twice), 3) 0.1× SSC at 70 °C for 1 h (twice), and 4) 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for 5 min (twice). After washing, the sections were incubated in the blocking reagent and then with mouse anti-fluorescein antibody (Roche Applied Science) (1:200) at 4 °C overnight. Next, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:200). The samples were observed under an FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Digital images were processed for publication using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) with minimal adjustments of brightness and contrast applied to the whole images. Construction of Plasmids for RNAi and Evaluation of Their Knockdown Effects—The targeted regions, which only matched with UST, 4,6-ST, and D4-ST cDNA sequences, respectively, were selected and inserted into U6 promoter-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector, pRNAT-U6.1 (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ), which expresses a GFP marker along with shRNA under the control of the CMV promoter. We used two or three regions that had sufficient knockdown effect on the targeted genes. The targeted 19-nucleotide sequences are as follows: for UST, 5′-GGACTACGGTTTCTGCATG-3′ (UST-sh-1) and 5′-GAATATAAGTACCGCCGAA-3′ (UST-sh-2); for 4,6-ST, 5′-AGACAAGAGTTGCATATGT-3′ (4,6-ST-sh-1), 5′-GGACTATCCGAGCATTAAA-3′ (4,6-ST-sh-2), and 5′-GAGGTTGTACTCAGACTAT-3′ (4,6-ST-sh-3); for D4-ST, 5′-GGACAGATCCTAAGCCTAG-3′ (D4-ST-sh-1) and 5′-GATGTTCGCTGTAATCGTG-3′ (D4-ST-sh-2). The data obtained by using the shRNA plasmids constructed with UST-sh-1, 4,6-ST-sh-1, and D4-ST-sh-1 were presented, unless otherwise stated. As controls, scrambled sequences for UST-sh-1, 4,6-ST-sh-1, and D4-ST-sh-1 were inserted into the pRNAT vector: for UST, 5′-GGACTTCTGCATACGGTTG-3′ (UST-scr); for 4,6-ST, 5′-AGACAGTTGCATATGTAAG-3′ (4,6-ST-scr); for D4-ST, 5′-GGGATCCTACAAAGCCTAG-3′ (D4-ST-scr). The underlined sequences represent the rearranged segments. To evaluate the efficiency of shRNA constructs, full-length mouse UST, 4,6-ST, and D4-ST cDNAs were inserted into the pIRES2-DsRed-Express vector (Clontech) (UST-pIRES, 4,6-ST-pIRES, and D4-ST-pIRES, respectively). COS-7 cells in 6-cm dishes were co-transfected with each sulfotransferase cDNA construct and the corresponding shRNA construct (1:4) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured under serum-free conditions for 48 h, and the RNA level of each sulfotransferase was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR using the primers described above. For the CS disaccharide composition analysis, COS-7 cells in 6-cm dishes were co-transfected with each sulfotransferase cDNA construct and the corresponding shRNA construct (1:4 for 4,6-ST and D4-ST and 1:8 for UST) and cultured for 72 h under serum-free conditions. The CS disaccharide composition was determined as described above. For the rescue experiments, we prepared the following sulfotransferase cDNA constructs, in which six mutations were inserted into the target sequences for the shRNAs with no amino acid sequence alteration. For UST, the target region of UST-sh-1 in UST-pIRES was mutated to 5′-TGATTATGGGTTTTGTATG-3′. For 4,6-ST, the target region of 4,6-ST-sh-2 in 4,6-ST-pIRES was mutated to 5′-GGATTACCCAAGTATCAAG-3′. The underlined nucleotides represent the mutations introduced. In Utero Electroporation—In utero electroporation was performed according to the methods described by Tabata and Nakajima (29Tabata H. Nakajima K. Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Briefly, timed pregnant ICR mice (E14) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital at 40 mg/kg of body weight, and the uterine horns were exposed. A plasmid DNA solution (4 μg/μl) containing 0.01% Fast Green was injected (∼2 μl) into the left side of the lateral ventricle with heat-pulled glass micropipettes. The heads of embryos in the uterus were placed between the forceps-type electrode (5 mm in diameter, CUY650P5, Nepa Gene, Chiba, Japan), and four electrical pulses (35 V, 50 ms in duration at intervals of 950 ms) were delivered using an electroporator (CUY21; Nepa Gene). All of the electroporations were done targeting the dorsolateral region of the neocortex adjacent to the lateral ventricle. The uterine horns were returned into the abdominal cavity, and the embryos were allowed to develop for appropriate periods. For the rescue experiments, the embryos were co-electroporated with the mixture (∼2 μl) of shRNA construct (4 μg/μl) and rescue construct (8 μg/μl). For the histological analyses, the mice were anesthetized with ether, and the embryos were dissected out. The brains were removed from the embryos and immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 6–8 h. After being washed with PBS, they were incubated in 30% sucrose/PBS for cryoprotection at 4 °C overnight. They were embedded in OCT compound and cut into 20–30-μm-thick coronal sections. The sections were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) and observed under an FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. For the analyses of neuronal migration, the images of the coronal sections were divided evenly into 10 compartments from the outermost region of cortical plate to the ventricular zone, and the number of GFP-positive cells in the each compartment was counted. To determine the distribution of electroporated cells, the positions of 200∼500 GFP-positive cells were analyzed for the each brain. For each condition, at least four independently electroporated brains were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry—After ether anesthesia, the heads of embryos were dissected, immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 6–8 h and embedded in paraffin. The samples were cut into 5-μm-thick sagittal sections, which were then deparaffinized and treated with 2.5% hydrogen peroxide/PBS for 15 min. After blocking with 4% normal goat serum, 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min, the sections were incubated with MO-225 monoclonal antibody (Seikagaku) (1:200) in 1% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 90 min. The sections were treated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (GE Healthcare) (1:200) at room temperature for 60 min and then processed using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After being washed with PBS, they were treated with 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 0.02% hydrogen peroxide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sections were observed under a Zeiss Axioskop, and the images were captured using an AxioCAM HRc CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and processed as described above. The electroporated brain samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 6–8 h, embedded in OCT compound, and then cut into 15-μm-thick coronal sections. After blocking with 4% normal goat serum, 1% BSA/PBS, the sections were incubated with MO-225 (1:200) at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with PBS, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgM (Molecular Probes) (1:200) and Hoechst 33258 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) (2 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. For double fluorescent labeling, the sections were treated with 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a mixture of monoclonal anti-GFAP (Clone G-A-5; Sigma) (1:400) and rabbit anti-GFP (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (1:400), or a mixture of monoclonal anti-β-III tubulin (TUJ1) (Covance, Emeryville, CA) (1:500) and anti-GFP (1:400) in 1% BSA/PBS at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with PBS, the sections were treated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) in 1% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After another wash with PBS, they were observed under an FV1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Analysis of the CS Chains in the Developing Neocortex—In order to analyze the structural changes of CS in the developing cerebral cortex, frozen cortical sections on glass slides were treated with CHase ABC, and the resulting unsaturated disaccharides were fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide and separated by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 1, B and C, and Table 1). At E16, the major components of CS were ΔA (Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)) (53.2 ± 1.8%), ΔO(Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc) (30.3 ± 1.3%), and ΔC (Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)) (12.2 ± 0.5%) units. Thereafter, the amount of ΔA unit gradually increased, and that of the ΔO unit decreased. The amount of ΔC unit peaked at P7 and then gradually decreased. At P20, CS chains were composed of 83.4 ± 1.2% ΔA unit, 7.8 ± 1.3% ΔO unit, and 5.9 ± 0.2% ΔC unit. On the other hand, the levels of disulfated disaccharides were relatively low, but significant amounts were detected for ΔD (Δ4,5HexA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)) and ΔE units (Δ4,5HexAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate)) (Fig. 1C). CS chains contained 3.4% ΔE unit from E16 to E18, which gradually decreased after birth (1.6 ± 0.1% at P20), and the level of ΔD unit showed a slight increasing trend after E18 (0.32 ± 0.02% at E18 and 0.89 ± 0.05% at P20). The amounts of ΔB(Δ4,5HexA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc"
https://openalex.org/W2090099105,"Background After decades during which endosymbionts were considered as silent in their hosts, in particular concerning the immune system, recent studies have revealed the contrary. In the present paper, we addressed the effect of Wolbachia, the most prevalent endosymbiont in arthropods, on host immunocompetence. To this end, we chose the A. vulgare-Wolbachia symbiosis as a model system because it leads to compare consequences of two Wolbachia strains (wVulC and wVulM) on hosts from the same population. Moreover, A. vulgare is the only host-species in which Wolbachia have been directly observed within haemocytes which are responsible for both humoral and cellular immune responses. Methodology/Principal Findings We sampled gravid females from the same population that were either asymbiotic, infected with wVulC, or infected with wVulM. The offspring from these females were tested and it was revealed that individuals harbouring wVulC exhibited: (i) lower haemocyte densities, (ii) more intense septicaemia in their haemolymph and (iii) a reduced lifespan as compared to individuals habouring wVulM or asymbiotic ones. Therefore, individuals in this population of A. vulgare appeared to suffer more from wVulC than from wVulM. Symbiotic titer and location in the haemocytes did not differ for the two Wolbachia strains showing that these two parameters were not responsible for differences observed in their extended phenotypes in A. vulgare. Conclusion/Significance The two Wolbachia strains infecting A. vulgare in the same population induced variation in immunocompetence and survival of their hosts. Such variation should highly influence the dynamics of this host-symbiont system. We propose in accordance with previous population genetic works, that wVulM is a local strain that has attenuated its virulence through a long term adaptation process towards local A. vulgare genotypes whereas wVulC, which is a widespread and invasive strain, is not locally adapted."
https://openalex.org/W2067591042,"Spontaneous preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation—PTB) occurs in ∼12% of pregnancies in the United States, and is the largest contributor to neonatal morbidity and mortality. PTB is a complex disease, potentially induced by several etiologic factors from multiple pathophysiologic pathways. To dissect the genetic risk factors of PTB a large-scale high-throughput candidate gene association study was performed examining 1536 SNP in 130 candidate genes from hypothesized PTB pathways. Maternal and fetal DNA from 370 US Caucasian birth-events (172 cases and 198 controls) was examined. Single locus, haplotype, and multi-locus association analyses were performed separately on maternal and fetal data. For maternal data the strongest associations were found in genes in the complement-coagulation pathway related to decidual hemorrhage in PTB. In this pathway 3 of 6 genes examined had SNPs significantly associated with PTB. These include factor V (FV) that was previously associated with PTB, factor VII (FVII), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The single strongest effect was observed in tPA marker rs879293 with a significant allelic (p = 2.30×10−3) and genotypic association (p = 2.0×10−6) with PTB. The odds ratio (OR) for this SNP was 2.80 [CI 1.77–4.44] for a recessive model. Given that 6 of 8 markers in tPA were statistically significant, sliding window haplotype analyses were performed and revealed an associating 4 marker haplotype in tPA (p = 6.00×10−3). The single strongest effect in fetal DNA was observed in the inflammatory pathway at rs17121510 in the interleukin-10 receptor antagonist (IL-10RA) gene for allele (p = 0.01) and genotype (p = 3.34×10−4). The OR for the IL-10RA genotypic additive model was 1.92 [CI 1.15–3.19] (p = 2.00×10−3). Finally, exploratory multi-locus analyses in the complement and coagulation pathway were performed and revealed a potentially significant interaction between a marker in FV (rs2187952) and FVII (rs3211719) (p<0.001). These results support a role for genes in both the coagulation and inflammation pathways, and potentially different maternal and fetal genetic risks for PTB."
https://openalex.org/W1994485628,"The production of a functional mRNA is regulated at every step of transcription. An area not well-understood is the transition of RNA polymerase II from elongation to termination. The S. cerevisiae SR-like protein Npl3 functions to negatively regulate transcription termination by antagonizing the binding of polyA/termination proteins to the mRNA. In this study, Npl3 is shown to interact with the CTD and have a direct stimulatory effect on the elongation activity of the polymerase. The interaction is inhibited by phosphorylation of Npl3. In addition, Casein Kinase 2 was found to be required for the phosphorylation of Npl3 and affect its ability to compete against Rna15 (Cleavage Factor I) for binding to polyA signals. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Npl3 promotes its dissociation from the mRNA/RNAP II, and contributes to the association of the polyA/termination factor Rna15. This work defines a novel role for Npl3 in elongation and its regulation by phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2066715359,"The linear response (LR) approximation, which predicts identical relaxation rates from all nonequilibrium initial conditions that relax to the same equilibrium state, underlies dominant models of how solvation influences chemical reactivity. We experimentally tested the validity of LR for the solvation that accompanies partial electron transfer to and from a monatomic solute in solution. We photochemically prepared the species with stoichiometry Na 0 in liquid tetrahydrofuran by both adding an electron to Na + and removing an electron from Na – . Because atoms lack nuclear degrees of freedom, ultrafast changes in the Na 0 absorption spectrum reflected the solvation that began from our two initial nonequilibrium conditions. We found that the solvation of Na 0 occurs more rapidly from Na + than Na – , constituting a breakdown of LR. This indicates that Marcus theory would fail to describe electron-transfer processes for this and related chemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2128970032,"Human immunodeficiency virus Rev-binding protein (HRB), also called human Rev-interacting protein (hRIP) or Rev/Rex activation domain binding (RAB) is a partner of the tyrosine kinase substrate EPS15, and it has been recovered in the AP-2 interactome. EPS15 and AP-2 are involved in endocytosis, but the function of HRB in this process is still unknown. Here we identified HRB as a partner of the vesicular SNARE tetanus neurotoxin-insensitive vesicle-associated membrane protein (TI-VAMP, also called VAMP7) in yeast two-hybrid screens and using biochemical assays. In HeLa cells, HRB localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, HRB colocalized with clathrin-, AP-2-, EPS15-, and transferrin receptor-containing vesicles. We did not see significant colocalization between HRB and TI-VAMP in HeLa cells, and we saw partial colocalization with green fluorescent protein-TI-VAMP in stably expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Nevertheless using a pHLuorin-tagged TI-VAMP construct, we found that HRB and TI-VAMP colocalize close to the plasma membrane after 5 min of anti-green fluorescent protein antibody uptake. These results suggest that TI-VAMP and HRB may interact only during the early stages of endocytosis. Furthermore uptake experiments followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that the endocytosis of fluorescent transferrin and pHLuorin-TI-VAMP is strongly reduced in HRB knockdown cells.

Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Target SNARE can be composed of two to three proteins related to syntaxin 1 or synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). Following membrane fusion, the vesicular SNARE protein localizes to its formerly target membrane in association with its target SNARE proteins. The ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor dissociates SNARE complexes in association with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins. Following this step, v-SNAREs are thought to be recycled, but the molecular mechanisms involved are only poorly understood (1Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

STKE. 2004; 2004: re19PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express only nine v-SNAREs (YKT6, SEC22, and VAMPs 1-5, 7, and 8), in fact even fewer in most cells because some VAMPs show a high cell/tissue-specific expression (4Bock J.B.

Traffic. 2005; 6: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this family of protein, TI-VAMP is a particularly intriguing member because of its original amino-terminal extension called the Longin domain (6Rossi V. Banfield D.K. Vacca M. Dietrich L.E.

Other v-SNAREs belong to the brevin subfamily or may correspond to intermediates in the case of VAMPs 4 and 8.

To identify the regulators of TI-VAMP, we carried out yeast two-hybrid screens using the Longin domain alone or the full cytoplasmic domain of TI-VAMP. Here we identify human immunodeficiency virus Rev-binding protein (HRB; also called Rev-interacting protein (RIP) or Rev/Rex activation domain binding (RAB)) as a partner of TI-VAMP in yeast two-hybrid screens and biochemical assays in vitro. HRB has been shown to be a cofactor of the retroviral protein Rev (15Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Madore S. Cullen B.R.

HRB is also implicated in the fusion of preacrosomal vesicle during the formation of the acrosome in spermatogenesis (20Kang-Decker N. Mantchev G.T. Juneja S.C. McNiven M.A. van Deursen J.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1531-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and more recently, HRB has been found as an interactor of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (21Schmid E.M. Ford M.G. Burtey A.

Here we show that HRB localized both to the nuclei and to AP-2+, EPS15+, clathrin+, and transferrin receptor (TfR)+ vesicles. Silencing the expression of HRB by RNA interference and shRNA led to the inhibition of transferrin (Tf) and TI-VAMP endocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. Thus our results suggest that HRB regulates clathrin-dependent endocytosis and may recruit TI-VAMP in this process. Antibodies—The goat polyclonal antibody directed against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of human HRB (sc-1424) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor (CD71), clathrin (X22), and AP-2 (clone AP6) were from Sigma, BD Transduction Laboratories, and Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), respectively. Monoclonal antibody against EPS15 was kindly provided by A. Benmerah (Institut Cochin, Paris, France). The mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 158.2) and rabbit serum (TG18) directed against TI-VAMP/VAMP7 have been described previously (22Paumet F. Le Mao J. Martin S. Galli T. David B. Blank U. Roa M. J.

Affinity-purified Cy3- and Cy5-coupled anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -goat immunoglobulins were from Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Alexa 488-coupled anti-goat immunoglobulins and Alexa 488-transferrin were from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA). Bovine serum albumin and gelatin from cold water fish were from Sigma. Constructs—The full-length cDNA sequence of human HRB was cleaved from the pMT-Rab cl 14 construct from Dr. P. P. Di Fiore (Fondazione Istituto FIRC di Oncologia Molecolare, Milan, Italy) by restriction digest using XbaI and SalI. The cleaved fragment was blunted using Klenow polymerase enzyme and was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) plasmid by using the EcoRV site. The new construct pcDNA-Hrb was checked by sequencing. We previously described a pHLuorin-TI-VAMP construct (10Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Here we improved the construction by adding a linker sequence between TI-VAMP and pHLuorin. Rat brain TI-VAMP cDNA bearing an AgeI site and a linker sequence (three Ser-Gly-Gly repeats) (24Miesenbock G. Yuste R. Lanni F. Konnerth A. Imaging Neurons: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 59.1-59.12Google Scholar) in its 3′-end was obtained by PCR and cloned in the pcDNA3 vector. The superecliptic variant of pHLuorin was then cloned in the AgeI sites. The mutations (F64L and S65T) required to obtain the superecliptic variant (25Sankaranarayanan S. DeAngelis D. Rothman J.E. Ryan T.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2199-2208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Yeast Two-hybrid Cloning and Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid screens performed on human placenta cDNA library were described previously (8Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G. Camonis J. Proux-Gillardeaux V. Daviet L. Formstecher E. Hamburger A. Filippini F. D'Esposito M. Galli T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For the screen performed on human fetal brain library, the same approach was used using only the TI-VAMP cytosolic domain (amino acids 1-188) as bait. The screens were carried out by Hybrigenics (Paris, France) using its standard procedures. Relevance of each identified interaction was noted on an A to E predicted biological score scale as follow. “A,” “B,” and “C” show “very high,” “high,” and “good” confidence, respectively, in the interaction. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ;g/ml streptomycin. Cells were regularly passaged by trypsin-EDTA to maintain exponential growth. All culture media were from Invitrogen. Tet-Off MDCK cells overexpressing GFP and GFP-Longin were described previously (12Proux-Gillardeaux V. Raposo G. Irinopoulou T. Galli T. Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly Tet-Off MDCK cells were cultured in DMEM with 7% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 400 ;g/ml hygromycin, 200 ;g/ml G418, and 0.5 ;g/ml doxycycline. Experiments were carried out for at least 5 days after the removal of doxycycline. RNA Interference and Stable Cell Lines with shRNA—siRNA duplex corresponded to nucleotides 1593-1613 of the human HRB mRNA. Human HRB duplex sequences used are 5′-CAGCCCAAUGGUGCAGGUUTT-3′ and 5′-AACCUGCACCAUUGGGCUGTT-3′ (26Sanchez-Velar N. Udofia E.B. Yu Z. Zapp M.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for the delivery of siRNAs into HeLa cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Control cells were transfected with luciferase siRNA (mock condition). Cells were incubated for 24 h with siRNA. Four Sure Silencing™ shRNA plasmids targeting human HRB and one negative control shRNA targeting no known human gene and containing the neomycin resistance gene were purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, MD). HeLa cells were transfected by the different shRNAs against human HRB and by the negative control shRNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were selected for neomycin resistance (400 ;g/ml G418). Western Blot—Cells were washed three times in cold PBS and lysed under continuous shaking with TSE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Cells were scraped, and the supernatant resulting from centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min was used for Western blot analysis. Brains from embryonic day 16, P4, P14, P30, and adult rats were homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer (10 strokes at 900 rpm) in homogenizing buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). After a 10-min centrifugation at 800 rpm at 4 °C, 1% Triton X-100 final concentration was added to the supernatant for 30 min, and finally the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Generally 25 ;g of protein were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in SDS buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed using a 4-12% bis-Tris NuPAGE (Invitrogen) gradient gel and the manufacturer's buffers and then processed for Western blot. Primary antibodies were revealed with fluorescent secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 680 or Alexa 800 and analyzed by Odyssey. Blots were quantified by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Production of Recombinant Proteins—GST and GST-TI-VAMP constructs and production of recombinant proteins were described previously (8Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G. Camonis J.

In Vitro Interaction Assay and GST Pulldown—pcDNA3-Hrb construct was used for in vitro T7-driven transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). For binding experiments, 10 ;l of the reaction or 500 ;g of total brain extracts for GST pulldown were incubated overnight with GST, GST-TI-VAMP, or GST-Longin immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 1 ;m final concentration in 200 or 500 ;l of binding buffer (4 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 as indicated). The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed eight times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 as indicated), and the final bead fraction was eluted with NuPAGE gel sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation from rat brains was performed using a Triton X-100-soluble fraction prepared as described previously for Western blot. Immunoprecipitation experiments were done as described previously (28Alberts P. Rudge R. Hinners I. Muzerelle A. MartinezArca S. Irinopoulou T. Marthiens V. Tooze S. Rathjen F. Gaspar P. Galli T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4207-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly P4 rat brain lysate was incubated with immunobeads overnight, and the beads were washed five times in homogenization buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound material was eluted with gel sample buffer, and the eluates were boiled for 5 min and run on 4-12% gradient NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min; blocked 20 min in PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl; and permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.125% gelatin in PBS for 4 min at room temperature. After treatment with 0.25% cold water fish skin gelatin in PBS for 30 min, cells were incubated overnight with the first antibodies in 0.125% gelatin in PBS at 4 °C. After several washings with PBS, cells were then incubated in the secondary antibodies in 0.125% gelatin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, then washed several times in PBS, and mounted in Prolong medium (Invitrogen). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed using an SP2 confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The images were assembled without modifications using Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). For standard epifluorescence microscopy, images were acquired on a Leica DMRD microscope (objective 63×/1.32) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-, Cy3-, Cy5-, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-specific sets of filters and a high resolution camera (Coolsnap HQ) driven by the Metamorph Image Analysis System. Image files were merged for colocalization using Adobe Photoshop CS3. TI-VAMP Endocytosis Assay—Cells were transfected with pHLuorin-TI-VAMP construct using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). After 24 h, cells were starved for 1 h in DMEM without serum and incubated in the same medium containing a monoclonal antibody against GFP (5 ;g/ml) at 37 °C for 5, 15, or 30 min. Cells were then washed extensively in PBS, 1% BSA at 4 °C; fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min; and processed for immunofluorescence as described below. Transferrin Uptake Assay—Cells were starved for 1 h in DMEM without serum. Cells were collected in PBS-EDTA and incubated in DMEM, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm glucose, 1% BSA with fluorescent human transferrin for the indicated times at 37 °C; washed extensively with PBS, 1% BSA at 4 °C; and either incubated in acid buffer (50 mm glycine, 100 mm NaCl (i.e. 5.84 g/liter), pH 3.0) for 3 min at 4 °C to remove surface labeling before fixation or fixed immediately. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence or for flow cytometry analysis. pHLuorin-TI-VAMP Uptake Assay—Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). 24 h later, cells were starved, collected in PBS-EDTA, and incubated in DMEM, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm glucose, 1% BSA with a monoclonal antibody against GFP at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then extensively washed with PBS, 1% BSA at 4 °C and then placed at 37 °C to allow endocytosis for 20 min prior to fixation. Cells were then incubated with an anti-mouse antibody coupled to Cy5. Cells were then processed for flow cytometry analysis. Flow Cytometry—Analyses were performed with a CyAn ADP flow cytometer (DakoCytomation) equipped with two solid state lasers: 488 nm for Alexa 488 and phycoerythrin and 635 nm for Cy5. Alexa 488 was collected through a 530/40 nm band pass. Forward angle light scatter and right angle scatter were used to select cells; resultant fluorescence histograms were taken on 20,000 cells. Data analysis was performed with Summit v4.3.01. Median fluorescence intensity and mean fluorescence intensity values were determined for both positive and negative populations of cells. For statistical analysis, all experiments were repeated at least three times. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons of median values between mock and shRNA cells were performed using an unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Significant differences with the corresponding internal control values are indicated by asterisks (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 in Student's t test). To identify the partners of TI-VAMP we carried out yeast two-hybrid screens using either the Longin domain of TI-VAMP alone or the full cytoplasmic domain of the human isoform as baits in human placenta (screen with both baits (8Martinez-Arca S.

These screens were validated by the identification of the cognate t-SNARE partners of TI-VAMP, syntaxin 3 and SNAP-23 in the human placenta library (8Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M. Raposo G.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), both of which are relevant to TI-VAMP exocytic function in epithelial and neuronal cells, respectively. Furthermore all screens identified the ; subunit of the molecular coat AP-3 that was previously functionally validated both in non-neuronal and neuronal cells (8Martinez-Arca S. Rudge R. Vacca M.

The phenotype of HRB-/- mice further reinforces the mysterious function of HRB because defects were seen only in sperm cells that lack an acrosome because of the inability of proacrosomal vesicles to fuse (20Kang-Decker N. Mantchev G.T. Juneja S.C. McNiven M.A. van Deursen J.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1531-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Juneja S.C. van Deursen J.M. Hum. Reprod. (Oxf.). 2005; 20: 881-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate the possible regulation of TI-VAMP function by HRB because of the evidence listed above suggesting a role of HRB in membrane trafficking. The intersection coverage of all prey clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid screens (Fig. 1A) spanned the region 147-267 in the screen with the Longin domain alone, the region 147-217 in the screen with the full cytoplasmic domain in the placenta library, and the region 128-259 in the screen with the same bait in the fetal brain library. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the minimal interaction domain with TI-VAMP is contained within the 147-217 region of HRB. This region of HRB is located downstream of an in silico predicted ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein zinc finger domain motif and upstream of FG and NPF repeats that are thought to mediate other important interactions including that with EPS15 (18Doria M.

Thus, we sought to create a facile experimental strategy for unbiased discovery of pathway specificity conferred by N-terminal signals. Using a limited collection of Escherichia coli strains that allow protein oxidation in the cytoplasm or, conversely, disable protein oxidation in the periplasm, we were able to discriminate the specific mode of export for PhoA (alkaline phosphatase) fusions to signal peptides for all of the major modes of transport across the inner membrane (Sec, SRP, or Tat). Based on these findings, we developed a mini-Tn5 phoA approach to isolate pathway-specific export signals from libraries of random fusions between exported proteins and the phoA gene. Interestingly, we observed that reduced PhoA was exported in a Tat-independent manner when targeted for Tat export in the absence of the essential translocon component TatC. This suggests that initial docking to TatC serves as a key specificity determinant for Tat-specific routing of PhoA, and in its absence, substrates can be rerouted to the Sec pathway, provided they remain compatible with the Sec export mechanism. Finally, the utility of our approach was demonstrated by experimental verification that four secreted proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis carrying putative Tat signals are bona fide Tat substrates and thus represent potential Tat-dependent virulence factors in this important human pathogen.

Despite recent advances in bioinformatic analysis of N-terminal protein export signals (1.Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4933) Google Scholar) prediction of export pathway specificity based on sequence information alone is complicated by the similar overall architecture of N-terminal export signals (Fig. 1a). Since bioinformatic tools for predicting pathway specificity typically rely on experimentally confirmed signal peptides, these approaches can be biased toward export signal whose primary structure does not differ greatly from those of the learning set. The TnphoA transposon probe developed by Manoil and Beckwith (7.Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) has been an extraordinarily useful experimental tool for verifying and discovering signal peptides in numerous bacterial species on a genome-wide scale (8.Bailey J. Manoil C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9.Gutierrez C. Barondess J. Manoil C. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TnphoA is a derivative of the Tn5 transposon that enables the generation of protein fusions to Escherichia coli PhoA (alkaline phosphatase; EC3.1.3.1) devoid of its native amino-terminal export signal. The resulting fusions only confer phosphate hydrolase activity to cells if they are capable of export out of the cytoplasm. Consequently, TnphoA can be used to detect proteins localized to the periplasm, inner and outer membranes, or extracellularly. Living cells can be assayed for PhoA activity using the chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) 3The abbreviations used are: BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; SRP, signal recognition particle; HMM, hidden Markov model; MBP, maltose-binding protein. or by selective growth on medium containing a sole carbon or phosphate source that requires PhoA activity to be metabolized (10.Sarthy A. Michaelis S. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 288-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The general utility of this genetic construct is exemplified by the large number of applications reporting its use, including, for example, identification of cell surface and secreted virulence factors (11.Finlay B.B.

In general, the TnphoA strategy is very efficient at uncovering proteins that carry Sec signals peptides. This is because (i) PhoA itself is a native Sec-dependent substrate, and (ii) the majority of proteins that are exported out of the cytoplasm of bacteria are substrates of the Sec pathway (22.Driessen A.J. Nouwen N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Sec pathway consists of the SecYEG translocase formed by the SecYEG integral membrane proteins and a molecular motor, SecA, which drives translocation of unfolded substrates in an ATP-dependent manner (22.Driessen A.J. Nouwen N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Driessen A.J. Manting E.H. van der Does C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The bulk of proteins targeted to SecYEG are routed in a post-translational manner with assistance from the dedicated molecular chaperone SecB (25.Collier D.N. Bankaitis V.A. Weiss J.B. Bassford Jr., P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26.Weiss J.B. Ray P.H. Bassford Jr., P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8978-8982Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), although for some substrates, including PhoA, post-translational export can proceed without assistance from SecB (27.Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, a subset of exported proteins are routed co-translationally by the signal recognition particle (SRP) (28.Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29.Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that directs substrates to the FtsY receptor (30.Luirink J. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. van der Weijden C.C. Oudega B. High S. Dobberstein B. Kusters R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and ultimately the SecYEG translocase. This mechanism is responsible for the export of both soluble periplasmic proteins (31.Huber D. Boyd D. Xia Y. Olma M.H. Gerstein M. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2983-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32.Schierle C.F. Berkmen M. Huber D. Kumamoto C. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5706-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and, with assistance from YidC, integral membrane proteins (29.Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33.Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Park S.K. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the use of TnphoA in bacteria is capable of detecting proteins exported via the Sec and SRP pathways, it does not provide sufficient resolution to distinguish between these different modes of SecYEG targeting. To address this limitation, previous studies used TnphoA in combination with Escherichia coli lpp-5508 mutants that have a leaky outer membrane. Free periplasmic PhoA diffused away from these cells and hydrolyzed BCIP in the surrounding medium to yield a “blue halo” around the colony, whereas membrane-bound PhoA could only hydrolyze intracellular BCIP, and the resulting blue color was localized within the colony (34.Giladi M. Champion C.I. Haake D.A. Blanco D.R. Miller J.F. Miller J.N. Lovett M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This approach enabled discrimination between cells expressing PhoA fusions with cleavable signal peptides (mostly Sec substrates) from those that spanned the inner membrane (mostly SRP substrates) but did not shed light on the specific targeting route. A further shortcoming of the TnphoA system is its limited ability to detect export via the Tat (twin-arginine translocation) pathway, whose substrates contain unique Arg-Arg signal peptides and are known to fold in the cytoplasm prior to transiting the inner membrane (36.Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 37.Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). For instance, in a recent genome-wide screen for N-terminal signal peptides in Psuedomonas aeruginosa, 310 PhoA fusions were identified, of which only one (RnfG, PA3493) was predicted to be a Tat substrate (39.Lewenza S. Gardy J.L. Brinkman F.S. Hancock R.E. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) despite the fact that as many as 57 Tat-dependent substrates have been predicted for this organism (4.Dilks K. Rose R.W. Hartmann E. Pohlschroder M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The reason for this is that the bacterial Tat transporter accepts only those proteins that have attained a native or nearly native structure in the cytoplasm (40.Bruser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 41.DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since PhoA folding is dependent upon disulfide bonds that can only form in the periplasm (43.Sone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), PhoA fusions misfold in the cytoplasm of wild type bacteria and thus are incapable of transiting the Tat pathway (41.DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, PhoA can be exported by the Tat pathway under specific conditions, such as when the cytoplasm is rendered more oxidizing by deletion of the trxB gor genes that encode the two major cytoplasmic reductases in E. coli (41.DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to expand the utility of TnphoA screening for (i) resolving the targeting specificity (e.g. SecB-independent versus SecB-dependent versus SRP-dependent) of exported proteins and (ii) detecting export via the Tat pathway. Using mini-Tn5 phoA-generated libraries in combination with a limited collection of isogenic E. coli strains derived from strain DR473 that allow toggling of PhoA folding, we have isolated PhoA fusions for all major modes of inner membrane transport in E. coli. Additionally, we have employed this strategy to experimentally verify that four secreted proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis carrying putative Tat signal peptides are bona fide Tat substrates and thus represent potential Tat-dependent virulence factors in this important human pathogen. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli strains were routinely grown in LB medium (Difco) broth at 30 or 37 °C with antibiotics added at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 10 μg/ml gentamycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μg/ml spectinomycin. Mycobacterium smegmatis strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80; l-lysine was added at a concentration of 80 μg/ml for the strains MB692, PM759, and JM578, and all cells were grown at 37 °C with antibiotics added at the same concentrations as listed above. M. smegmatis cells were also grown on solid Middlebrook 7H10 medium (Difco) supplemented as indicated above but with 40 μg/ml l-lysine when necessary.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant genotype/phenotypeReference or sourceE. coli strainsMC4100F ΔlacU169 araD139 rpsL150 relA1 ptsF rbs flbB5301Laboratory stockSM10 λ-pirthi thr leu tonA lacY supE recA::RP4-2-Tc::Mu Kmr pirRef. 77.Miller V.L.

Briefly, donor cells containing the gene of interest with a selectable marker were grown in LB broth at 37 °C overnight and subcultured into fresh medium containing 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% glucose at a 100-fold dilution and allowed to grow for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Lytic phage was then added, and the culture was grown until “clearing” occurred, after which the phage was harvested through centrifugation and stored at 4 °C with chloroform. Recipient DHB4 or DR473 cells were grown in appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C overnight and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 3 min. Cells were then resuspended in fresh medium containing 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% glucose, and lytic phage carrying the marked gene of interest was added at a 10-fold dilution. Cells and phage were grown at 37 °C for 30 min, subsequently supplemented with 100 mm sodium citrate, grown for an additional 1 h, and plated on LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotics and 100 mm sodium citrate overnight. Cells containing the genetic disruption were recovered, and the resistance marker was removed using the pCP20 helper plasmid, as previously described (44.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11197) Google Scholar). Construction of the plasmid pBR322-Gm was carried out by replacement of the Tcr cassette in pBR322 with the gentamycin resistance gene. pBR322-Gm was then converted into a destination vector with an insertion of the Gateway RfC.1 cassette (Invitrogen) into the SspI/ScaI sites, creating the vector pBRGC.1. Plasmid pVV16 (45.Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper S.B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar) was converted into a destination vector named pVV-GC.1-FH by insertion of a modified version of the Gateway RfC.1 cassette containing a FLAG affinity epitope at the 3′-end into the NdeI/HindIII sites. All derivatives of pVV-GC.1-FH and pBRGC.1 were created using Gateway cloning technology according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). The plasmids pCueO-AP and pSufI-AP were constructed by first inserting the 1,412-bp E. coli phoA gene with a modified 5′-end to include a mini multicloning site (NheI, PsiI, and XhoI sites) into the HindIII/SalI sites of pBR322, yielding vector pMCS-ΔssPhoA. Then DNA encoding E. coli cueO or E. coli sufI was PCR-amplified and inserted in the NheI/PsiI sites pMCS-ΔssPhoA. Plasmid pssMBP-PhoA was constructed by PCR amplification of the first 143 bp of malE from pMalE and insertion of the resulting product into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pMCS-ΔssPhoA. Plasmid pMCS-ΔssBlaC was constructed by inserting an 864-bp PCR product corresponding to M. tuberculosis blaC lacking the first 93 bp but with a 33-bp FLAG epitope tag added to the 3′-end into the SpeI/EcoRI sites of pSALect. To construct plasmid pVV-ssAg85A-BlaC-FH, a 120-bp PCR product encoding the M. tuberculosis Ag85A signal peptide was first cloned into the SalI/SpeI sites of pMCS-ΔssBlaC. Then a 14-bp ribosome binding site was appended to the 5′-end of the DNA encoding Ag85A-BlaC via PCR, and the entire 1010-bp construct was cloned into the NdeI/HindIII sites of pVV16. This same procedure was repeated to create pVV-ssAg85C-BlaC-FH, pVV-ssModD-BlaC-FH, and pVV-ssPepA-BlaC-FH by inserting DNA encoding the signal peptides (72, 117, and 96 bp, respectively) inserted at the 5′-end of ΔssBlaC. Plasmid pBR-BamHI-Gm was constructed by inserting the BamHI restriction site into the SspI/PstI sites of pBR322-Gm. Subcellular Fractionation—Cytoplasmic and periplasmic fractions were prepared from cells that had been induced for protein expression at 30 °C for 8 h in the presence of either arabinose or glucose, as indicated. Following protein induction, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then subjected to the ice-cold osmotic shock procedure as previously described (46.Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The quality of all fractionations was determined by immunodetection of the cytoplasmic GroEL protein (41.DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (47.Chen G. Hayhurst A. Thomas J.G. Harvey B.R. Iverson B.L. Georgiou G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, all lanes of SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) were loaded with samples prepared from an equivalent number of cells harvested for each experiment. The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-PhoA (Sigma) diluted 1:20,000; monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG (Stratagene) diluted 1:3,000, and polyclonal anti-GroEL (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000. Secondary antibodies were either goat anti-mouse (Promega) or goat anti-rabbit (Promega) diluted 1:2,500. Following development of blots using the Immun-Star horseradish peroxidase substrate kit (Bio-Rad) and visualized using x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.), membranes were stripped in a solution consisting of 2.0% SDS, 7.0% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.03% NaCl, and 0.0025% Tris, reblocked, and probed with anti-GroEL antibody. Monitoring of PhoA Activity in Intact Cells—E. coli cells were grown in LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C overnight and streaked onto LB agar supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma), and 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose and grown at 30 °C for 2 days. Streaks that attained a blue phenotype were classified as export competent, whereas cells that appeared white/colorless were classified as incapable of PhoA export from the cytoplasm. Isolation of Mini-Tn5 phoA Insertions—SM10 λ-pir cells carrying pUTphoA and MC4100 cells carrying the expression vector of interest were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Cells were then pelleted, washed three times with fresh LB, mixed, and spotted in 40-μl aliquots onto a nitrocellulose membrane on LB agar and grown at 30 °C for 16 h. The membrane was then resuspended in 10 ml of fresh LB and used to inoculate 200 ml of LB supplemented with 300 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 μg/ml gentamycin, followed by growth at 37 °C for 16 h. Upon conjugation, ∼104 recipient cells containing both the marked transposon and the expression vector of interest were selected and pooled together. Plasmid DNA was then extracted from these cells and used to transform competent DR473 cells that were grown on LB agar supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, 50 μg/ml BCIP, and either 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose at 30 °C for 2 days. For each library, 12 colonies that exhibited a strong blue phenotype were restreaked onto the same medium and grown at 30 °C for 2 days to confirm the phenotype. Plasmid DNA was then prepared from all positive clones and sequenced using a primer specific for the antisense strand of the 5′-end of the phoA gene. Construction and Screening of Genomic Library—Genomic DNA was isolated from MC4100 cells and partially digested using Sau3AI, as previously described (39.Lewenza S. Gardy J.L. Brinkman F.S. Hancock R.E. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fragments between 0.75 and 3.0 kb were excised from a 1% agarose-Tris borate-EDTA gel and gel-purified (Qiagen) and then ligated into the BamHI site of pBR-BamHI-Gm. This library of genomic DNA was then electroporated into competent MC4100 cells and conjugated with SM10 λ-pir cells carrying pUTphoA as described above. The resulting library, composed of transposon insertions into genomic DNA, was isolated and electroporated into competent DR473 cells. Screening of the library was performed on BCIP indicator plates supplemented with either glucose or arabinose as described above. Cells displaying a bright blue phenotype were reconfirmed, after which their plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced using a primer specific for the antisense strand of the 5′-end of the phoA gene. Bioinformatic Prediction of Tat Substrates—Analysis was carried out as previously described (3.Bronstein P.A. Marrichi M. Cartinhour S. Schneider D.J. DeLisa M.P. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 8450-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was developed using a training set constructed from experimentally confirmed Tat substrates present in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The previously developed HMM for Tat motifs using hmmbuild (available on the World Wide Web) was calibrated with hmmcalibrate and used to search the annotated proteins from the chromosome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (GenBank™ accession number NC_000962.2) with hmmsearch.

Although etiological mechanisms remain unclear, DMP1 is the only one of these three genes currently known to have mutations resulting in human disease, and yet it remains the least studied. All three contain the highly conserved integrin-binding tripeptide, RGD, and experiments comparing the cell attachment and haptotactic migration-enhancing properties of DMP1 to BSP and OPN were performed using human skeletal (MG63 and primary dental pulp cells) and salivary gland (HSG) cells. Mutation of any SIBLING's RGD destroyed all attachment and migration activity. Using itsαVβ5 integrin, HSG cells attached to BSP but not to DMP1 or OPN. However, HSG cells could not migrate onto BSP in a modified Boyden chamber assay. Expression of αVβ3 integrin enhanced HSG attachment to DMP1 and OPN and promoted haptotactic migration onto all three proteins. Interchanging the first four coding exons or the conserved amino acids adjacent to the RGD of DMP1 with corresponding sequences of BSP did not enhance the ability of DMP1 to bindαVβ5. For αVβ3-expressing cells, intact DMP1, its BMP1-cleaved C-terminal fragment, and exon six lacking all post-translational modifications worked equally well but the proteoglycan isoform of DMP1 had greatly reduced ability for cell attachment and migration. The sequence specificity of the proposed BMP1-cleavage site of DMP1 was verified by mutation analysis. Direct comparison of the three proteins showed that cells discriminate among these SIBLINGs and among DMP1 isoforms.

SIBLINGs share many common features, such as their tandem gene location on human chromosome 4q21, similar intron/exon organization, multiple phosphorylation sites, disulfide-free flexible hydrophilic structures, and the presence of the integrin-binding tripeptide, arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) (1Fisher L.W.

Fedarko N.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These proteins have long been thought to play key biological roles during the synthesis of mineralized dentin and bone matrices (3Qin C. Baba O. Butler W.T. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 4Huq N.L. Cross K.J. Ung M. Reynolds E.C. Arch. Oral Biol. 2005; 50: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DMP1 was first found in odontoblasts (5George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, recent studies revealed that, like all other SIBLINGs, it is also expressed in specific soft tissues, including many tumors (2Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Ogbureke K.U. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) as well as in normal, metabolically active ductal epithelial cells such as salivary gland, sweat gland, and kidney (6Ogbureke K.U.

Cavaliere A. Brachelente G. Costa G. Chaplet M. Castronovo V. Bellahcene A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2007; 105: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), its function in tumors as well as normal ductal cells remains elusive. The importance of DMP1 in the processes of mineralization is supported by observations that the DMP1-knockout mouse has defective dentin development, hypomineralization, and rickets (10Ling Y. Rios H.F. Myers E.R. Lu Y. Feng J.Q. Boskey A.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Feng J.Q. Ward L.M. Liu S. Lu Y. Xie Y. Yuan B. Yu X. Rauch F.

Genet. 2006; 38: 1310-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and was associated with severe hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia, and increased levels of the phosphate-regulating hormone, FGF23 (11Feng J.Q. Ward L.M. Liu S. Lu Y. Xie Y. Yuan B. Yu X. Rauch F. Davis S.I. Zhang S. Rios H. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Bonewald L.F. White K.E. Nat.

Human genetic studies have connected mutations in DMP1 with the autosomal-recessive forms of hypophosphatemic rickets in which blood levels of FGF23 are elevated (11Feng J.Q. Ward L.M. Liu S. Lu Y. Xie Y. Yuan B. Yu X. Rauch F. Davis S.I. Zhang S. Rios H. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Bonewald L.F. White K.E. Nat.

Thus, DMP1 may be involved directly or indirectly in controlling the production of the bone-derived hormone, FGF23. However, the underlying mechanisms of DMP1 action remain to be explained. DMP1 has several interesting structural and functional domains, including several acidic domains rich in phosphoserine, Glu, and Asp, that are reported to serve as putative sites for calcium deposition and hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation (3Qin C. Baba O. Butler W.T. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 4Huq N.L. Cross K.J. Ung M. Reynolds E.C. Arch.

DMP1, like most if not all SIBLINGs (2Bellahcene A. Castronovo V. Ogbureke K.U. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage resulting in the generation of specific N- and C-terminal fragments (13Qin C. Brunn J.C.

In analogy to another SIBLING, DSPP, it has been suggested that the BMP1-cleavage fragments represent the active form(s) of DMP1, whereas the full-length form may be a non-functional precursor (13Qin C.

The bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1)/Tolloid-like metalloproteinases were proposed to be the enzyme group responsible for cleaving between the conserved Ser212 and Asp213 residues in mouse DMP1 (14Steiglitz B.M. Ayala M. Narayanan K. George A. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 980-986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). DMP1 exists also as a proteoglycan form with the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain being attached at a highly conserved Ser-Gly motif in the N-terminal domain (15Qin C. Huang B. Wygant J.N. McIntyre B.W.

(2007) Genome Biology http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/5/215Google Scholar). It has been shown that, depending on cell and tissue type, DMP1 is capable of supporting cell attachment via the RGD motif (19Kulkarni G.V. Chen B. Malone J.P. Narayanan A.S. George A. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the specific integrin(s) involved in this cellular interaction with DMP1 have not been identified. Therefore, we investigated the integrins involved in binding to specific DMP1 isoforms compared with two other more highly studied SIBLING proteins, BSP and OPN, by performing attachment and haptotactic migration assays. Cell Culture—Human salivary intercalated duct cell line (HSG), established from an irradiated human salivary gland (20Shirasuna K. Sato M. Miyazaki T. Cancer. 1981; 48: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), was propagated in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Primary human dental pulp cells (DPC) were obtained from human third molars collected from adults at the Dental Clinic of the NIDCR, National Institutes of Health (NIH) under approved guidelines set by the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research as described previously (21Gronthos S. Mankani M. Brahim J. Robey P.G. Shi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. of U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13625-13630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3415) Google Scholar) and were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS (v/v) and ascorbic acid (100 μm). The DPC were a generous gift from Drs. Sayuri Yoshizawa and Pamela Gehron Robey, Craniofacial and Skeletal Diseases Branch/NIDCR/NIH. Human osteosarcoma cells (MG63, ATCC number CRL-1427) and human embryonic kidney 293A (HEK293A) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and Invitrogen, respectively, and were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (v/v). All media were supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air. Antibodies and Peptides—Monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human α5 integrin subunit (clone 238307) and polyclonal goat anti-human BMP1 antibody (Cat. # AF1927) were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), mAbs against human integrin subunits αV (clone 272–17E6), β1 (clone 4B7), and β6 (clone 442.5C4) were from EMD Biosciences Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), mAbs against human αVβ3 (clone LM609), αVβ5 (clone P1F6), and subunit β1 (clone P4C10) were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA), Alexa Flour 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GRGDS and GRDGS peptides were synthesized and purified at the FDA/NIH Center for Biological Evaluation and Research, Facility for Biotechnology Resources (Bethesda, MD). Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant human BSP, BSP-KAE, OPN, and OPN-KAE, as well as bovine DMP1 and DMP1-KAE were purified from conditioned medium of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) (gift of Drs. Pamela Gehron Robey and Serger Kuznetsov) infected with the corresponding adenoviruses as described previously (22Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16666-16672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Jain A. Karadag A. Fohr B. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13700-13708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Full-length human DMP1 was made by reverse transcription-PCR of human kidney poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech/BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) with oligonucleotides, including Asp718 (5′ to the natural start codon) and BamHI (3′ to the stop codon) restriction sites for eventual ligation into the prepared adenovirus expression plasmid. An adenoviral expression plasmid containing the DMP1MQΔIH cDNA (Ad-DMP1MQΔIH) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the Met215-Gln216 residues into IIe-His of the human DMP1 cDNA. An adenoviral expression plasmid containing the DMP1-BSP-likeRGD sequence (Ad-DMP1-BSP-likeRGD) was similarly produced by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser364 and Pro369 residues into Pro and Tyr, respectively, to match BSP's EPRGDNY conserved sequence. The mutated cDNA forms were generated by using oligonucleotide pairs containing the new sequences and the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An adenoviral expression plasmid containing the hBSP/bDMP1 hybrid cDNA was generated by first making the human BSP exons 2–5 from the B6-5g cDNA clone (24Fisher L.W. McBride O.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2347-2351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using an oligonucleotide pair for introducing the necessary restriction sites. The BSP portion of the PCR construct begins with the Asp718 restriction site (5′ to the natural start codon) and ends with the 3′-end being an in-frame BsrBI blunt end restriction site that, upon digestion, makes the last codon of exon 5 the end of the construct. The bDMP1 exon 6 was made with a blunt end restriction site of FspI added to the 5′-end (which after digestion leaves the first codon of the last exon as the first bases) and a BamHI after the stop codon on the 3′-end by PCR of the bovine DMP1 cDNA (a gift from Dr. M. J. Dixon, University of Manchester, UK). The two amplicons were gel-purified, digested with Asp718 plus BsrBI (BSP) or BamHI site plus FspI (DMP1), purified, and ligated together. A second PCR was performed on the ligation product using the 5′-BSP oligonucleotide and the 3′-DMP1 oligonucleotide to amplify the ligated, full-length product. The Asp718 and BamHI-treated amplicon was ligated into the prepared adenoviral expression plasmid. All adenovirus expression plasmids were sequenced to confirm the entire sequence. Each adenovirus expression plasmid was recombined with the replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) plasmid in appropriate HEK293A cells, selected, amplified, and purified for use. In each case, the mRNA transcription was under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (except for the normal BSP construct, which was under the control of the EF-1 promoter). The recombinant proteins were produced by infecting midpassage, subconfluent normal human BMSCs. Proteins (usually representing ∼50% of the total protein in the serum-free media) were purified from the conditioned serum-free media to >95% purity by means of anion exchange chromatography, as described previously (22Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16666-16672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Jain A. Karadag A. Fohr B. Fisher L.W.

The bacterial recombinant human DMP1/exon 6 was generated by PCR of human genomic DNA with oligonucleotides containing in-frame NdeI (5′) and BamHI (3′) for ligation into pET-15B (Novagen/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA). Competent BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the plasmid and grown to mid log phase, and the fusion protein was stimulated with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Novagen) for 1 h. DMP1exon6 protein was purified on His-Bind (Novagen) resin using standard denaturing (urea) conditions followed by dialysis against water and freeze drying. The purity of all proteins was analyzed by electrophoresing in SDS on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels, followed by staining with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen) and StainsAll (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Adenoviral Constructs for Integrin and BMP1 Expression—The coding domain of human β3 integrin was PCR-amplified from a pGEM-1/β3 construct containing human β3 integrin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Kenneth Yamada, NIDCR, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The coding sequence of human αV integrin was PCR-amplified from human αV plasmid (IOH38619, Invitrogen). Each cDNA was subcloned into the pVQ-CMV-K-NpA Ad5 vector (ViraQuest, North Liberty, IA) under control of the CMV promoter, and the resulting plasmids were converted into the adenovirus form, amplified, and purified by ViraQuest according to their protocols. Adenoviruses bearing full-length cDNA for human integrin β1 (IOH21479) and β5 (IOH57077) were made using the ViraPower™ Adenoviral Expression System (all from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the coding domain of integrin β1 and β5 flanked by attL sites in a Gateway entry vector (Invitrogen) were recombined into the ViraPower™ pAd/CMV/V5-Dest™ vector using Gateway LR Clonase. The adenoviruses were produced and amplified in HEK293A cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. An adenovirus expressing human BMP1 (Ad-BMP1) was generated using the splice variant 5 of the human BMP1 cDNA in a Gateway Entry vector (IOH36655, Invitrogen) as described above. The expression of the recombinant BMP1 protein was analyzed in conditioned media from BMSCs infected with the Ad-BMP1 by means of both Western blot using the goat anti-human BMP1 antibody and by noting the processing of fibroblast procollagen on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Adenoviral Expression of Integrins and FACS Analysis—3 × 105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in DMEM/F-12 medium and grown until subconfluent. Viruses were than added in 1.5 ml of DMEM/F-12 medium containing 2% FBS. After 24 h, medium was changed to complete medium. 48 h post infection, cells were harvested by means of Enzyme-Free Cell Dissociation Buffer (Invitrogen), and the expression of integrins was analyzed by flow cytometry. Control, “Empty” Aden5 viruses were purchased from ViraQuest (VQ-013). Harvested cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in cold PBS containing 1% FBS. Cells were then incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies for 30 min on ice followed by a cold wash and incubation with Alexa Flour 488-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min on ice. Fluorescence was measured using FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and analyzed using CellQuest software. Attachment Assay—Wells of 96-well non-tissue culture polystyrene microtiter plates (Cat. #655061, Greiner Bio-One Inc., Longwood, FL) were coated with 100 μl of 100 nm solutions of SIBLINGs or their mutant constructs in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Wells were rinsed with PBS and blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Control wells were coated with only BSA. For in situ chondroitinase ABC digestion, 4 milliunits of the enzyme (Seikagaku America Inc., Ijamsville, MD) in 100 μl of reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml BSA) were added to wells previously coated with DMP1MQΔIH-PG, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and then washed. Control wells were coated with DMP1MQΔIH-PG and incubated with the enzyme reaction buffer only. Cells were harvested using Enzyme-Free Dissociation Buffer and added to the coated wells at 5 × 104 cells per 50 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml BSA in the presence or absence of 0.250–1 mm MnCl2 as noted. For blocking experiments, cells were preincubated with 1 mm GRGDS, 1 mm GRDGS peptide for 15 min at room temperature, or with blocking antibodies as indicated for 30 min at 4 °C. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with PBS. The attached cells were fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained for 10 min with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol, rinsed with water, solubilized in 100 μl of 2% SDS, and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm in a microtiter plate reader. Migration Assay—Haptotactic migration assays were performed in 24-well Transwell plates with 8-μm pore size (Cat. #353097, Falcon System Inc., Columbia, MD). The lower surface of the polyethylene terephthalate membranes were pre-coated with 50 μl of 1 μm SIBLING solutions overnight at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, both sides of the membrane were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. 5 × 104 cells in 250 μl of serum-free culture medium were added to the upper chambers while 750 μl of the same medium was added to the bottom chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 19 h (HSG cells) or 5 h (MG63 cells). For blocking experiments, cells were preincubated with 1 mm GRGDS, 1 mm GRDGS, or function-blocking antibodies as described above prior to adding to the Transwells. Cells remaining in the top chamber (non-migrated) were removed from the upper membranes surfaces with cotton swabs, whereas cells that had migrated through the pores were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with 100 nm blue-fluorescent 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes) and quantified by performing cell counts on the underside of the filter on 10 randomly selected fields at 400× magnification. In Vitro BMP1 Enzyme Digestion—10 μg of recombinant human DMP1 and DMP1MQΔIH mutant protein were separately incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant BMP1 (R&D Systems) in a 50-μl total volume of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.01% Brij, pH 7.5) or reaction buffer alone for 19 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (SB, Invitrogen) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and heated for 10 min at 70 °C. Samples were electrophoresed in SDS on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels, and proteins were visualized with StainsAll as previously described (25Green M.R. Pastewka J.V. Peacock A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). BMP1-mediated DMP1 Processing in Vivo—HSG cells (4 × 104) were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates (Falcon System Inc.), and the next day infected with a single fixed dose of viruses expressing DMP1 or DMP1MQΔIH mutant protein, some in combination with increasing doses of the BMP1 adenovirus described above. After 3 days of incubation, samples of serum-free conditioned media (DMEM/F-12) were electrophoresed in SDS on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and stained with StainsAll. Verification of BMP1 Cleavage Site by Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—100 μg of purified recombinant DMP1 was incubated with or without 5 μg of recombinant BMP1 at 37 °C for 19 h in a 100-μl total volume of reaction buffer. Enzyme was removed by applying the samples to ∼0.2 ml minicolumns of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with PBS. DMP1 and fragments were eluted with 0.4 m NaCl in PBS. Products were resolved on a SDS NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tis gel and stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain until faint bands were just detected. Intact and C-terminal DMP1 protein bands were excised from the gels, transferred to a D-Tube Dialyzer (Novagen/EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ), and electroeluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the NIH Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FDA) using the Procise ABI Model 494A Protein Sequencing System. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad software (San Diego, CA). Multiple comparisons were performed with a one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test, which compares all pairs of columns. Pairwise comparisons were carried out by using the non-parametric two-sided t test for unpaired observations. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were considered statistically different at p < 0.05. Differential Attachment of DPC, HSG, and MG63 Cells to DMP1, BSP, and OPN—The ability to attach to DMP1-coated plastic has been shown to be cell-type-specific and RGD-dependent (19Kulkarni G.V. Chen B. Malone J.P. Narayanan A.S. George A. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the one or more integrin receptors involved are not known. A panel of cells (bone, tooth, and salivary gland-related cells) was used to test their ability to attach to DMP1 compared with two more frequently studied SIBLINGs, BSP and OPN. DPC, HSG, and MG63 cells were plated on wells coated with purified recombinant DMP1, BSP, OPN, or their respective RGD-inactivated control proteins, DMP1-KAE, BSP-KAE, or OPN-KAE. The SIBLINGs used in these experiments were recombinant proteins purified from human BMSC-conditioned media after infection with the appropriate adenoviral constructs (22Fedarko N.S. Fohr B.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13700-13708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These cells have the ability to add each of the types of post-translational modification reported to be found on the various SIBLING members, although the exact combination of such modifications on the BMSC-synthesized recombinant proteins have not been verified to match any one natural tissue source completely (supplemental Fig. S1 shows evidence for the presence of CS/DS glycosaminoglycan chains, N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide chains, as well as sialic acid, phosphate, and tyrosine sulfate on various SIBLING members). The purified recombinant DMP1 protein used in this experiment was a mixture of the full-length protein as well as some of its cleavage products of ∼52 kDa and ∼33 kDa, as determined by gel electrophoresis. The sizes of these cleavage products were similar to the previously described 57- and 37-kDa fragments found in rat dentin (13Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Malone J.P. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34700-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and corresponded to the C- and N-terminal fragments of DMP1, respectively. All three cell types showed a similar robust attachment to BSP with the majority of the plated cells attaching to the substratum within 1 h of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 1). Fewer DPC and MG63 cells attached to DMP1- or OPN-coated wells, whereas HSG cells failed to attach to either DMP1 or OPN (Fig. 1). Attachment by all cells was found to be RGD-dependent, because both a soluble GRGDS peptide as well as each SIBLING's respective RGD-inactivated mutants (KAE) totally abolished cell attachment. Representative results are shown for the DPC cells in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Cell attachment to BSP, DMP1, and OPN is RGD-dependent. DPCs were plated on wells coated with BSP (A), DMP1 (B), and OPN (C) or t"

We investigated the effects of human IL-18 on the engraftment and function of human T cell subsets in xenograft mouse models. IL-18 enhanced the engraftment of human CD8(+) effector T cells and promoted the development of xenogeneic graft versus host disease (GVHD). In marked contrast, IL-18 had reciprocal effects on the engraftment of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the xenografted mice. Adoptive transfer experiments indicated that IL-18 prevented the suppressive effects of Tregs on the development of xenogeneic GVHD. The IL-18 results were robust as they were observed in two different mouse strains. In addition, the effects of IL-18 were systemic as IL-18 promoted engraftment and persistence of human effector T cells and decreased Tregs in peripheral blood, peritoneal cavity, spleen and liver. In vitro experiments indicated that the expression of the IL-18Ralpha was induced on both CD4 and CD8 effector T cells and Tregs, and that the duration of expression was less sustained on Tregs. These preclinical data suggest that human IL-18 may have use as an adjuvant for immune reconstitution after cytotoxic therapies, and to augment adoptive immunotherapy, donor leukocyte infusions, and vaccine strategies."

Using synaptic vesicle aggregation in cultured neurons as a marker of presynaptic differentiation, we purified candidate presynaptic organizers from mouse brain. A major bioactive species was the extracellular domain of signal regulatory protein α (SIRP-α), a transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily member concentrated at synapses. The extracellular domain of SIRP-α is cleaved and shed in a developmentally regulated manner. The presynaptic organizing activity of SIRP-α is mediated in part by CD47. SIRP-α homologues, SIRP-β and -γ also have synaptic vesicle clustering activity. The effects of SIRP-α are distinct from those of another presynaptic organizer, FGF22: the two proteins induced vesicle clusters of different sizes, differed in their ability to promote neurite branching, and acted through different receptors and signaling pathways.

Information transfer involves release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals, binding of neurotransmitter by receptors at the precisely apposed postsynaptic membrane, and generation of an electrical or chemical signal in the postsynaptic cell. Alterations in synapse number and strength underlie neural plasticity, and defects in synaptic circuitry and function underlie some neurological disorders. Thus, proper assembly of appropriate synapses is essential for optimal functioning of the nervous system (1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 2Waites C.L. Craig A.M. Garner C.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 251-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Pre- and postsynaptic specializations form in precise apposition to each other at sites where axons contact specific target cells. This precision is one indication that signals are exchanged between presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic target cells to organize synaptic differentiation and maturation (3Fox M.A. Umemori H. J.

The brain contains dozens if not hundreds of different synaptic types, however, and additional organizers likely remain to be identified. To identify novel synaptic organizers, we devised an assay for presynaptic differentiation in isolated, cultured neurons, and used it to guide biochemical purification of active molecules from brain extracts. In initial studies, we showed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; SIRP, signal regulatory protein; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; PTX, pertussis toxin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI-MS, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; SIRP, signal regulatory protein; NMJ, neuromuscular junction; PTX, pertussis toxin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MALDI-MS, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcription. 22 and its close relatives, FGFs 7 and 10, promote differentiation of neuromuscular and cerebellar synapses (7Umemori H.

Some neuronal populations were unresponsive to these FGFs, however, and FGFs accounted for less than half of the active material in brain extracts. We therefore sought additional active species. Here, we show that SIRP-α is a presynaptic organizer.

Its intracellular domain has tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, can interact with phosphatases to send negative signals downstream. SIRP-α is involved in hematopoietic cell functions such as regulation of host cell phagocytosis and clearance, inflammatory mediator production, and control of cell migration (11Kharitonenkov A.

Little is known about roles of SIRP-α in the nervous system, but it is expressed by hippocampal neurons, promotes neurite outgrowth in culture, and enhances the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (23Wang X.X.

Most of these studies, however, focused on intracellular signals transduced by SIRP-α when it is engaged by its ligand, CD47/integrin-associated protein (16Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Here, in contrast, we show that the extracellular domain of SIRP-α is cleaved and acts as a secreted presynaptic organizer. We also show that two little-studied close relatives of SIRP-α, SIRP-β and SIRP-γ, also have presynaptic organizing activity. Finally, we show that SIRPs act in part through CD47 and in part through other receptors, and that effects of SIRPs on axons are distinct from those of FGF22. Cell Culture—Motoneurons were prepared and cultured as described (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Fox M.A. Sanes J.R. Borza D.B. Eswarakumar V.P. Fassler R. Hudson B.G. John S.W. Ninomiya Y.

Briefly, cells were dissociated from E5 chick spinal cord with trypsin. Motoneurons were purified by Metrizamide density gradient centrifugation and plated at 2,000 cells/well in 8-well Lab-Tek Permanox chamber slides coated with poly-d,l-ornithine and laminin (Invitrogen). Motoneurons were cultured in L-15 medium with insulin, putrescine, conalbumin, progesterone, sodium selenite, and 2% horse serum for 48 h, then analyzed as described below. Proteins, blocking antibodies, and inhibitors were added at the time of plating except where indicated. In some experiments, motoneurons were co-cultured with COS cells, obtained from ATCC. The COS cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and plated on 8-well Lab-Tek Permanox chamber slides. Two days later, motoneurons were prepared as described above and added to the COS cells at 2,000 cells per well. They were co-cultured for 2 days in motoneuron culture media, and the cells were processed for immunohistochemistry. C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum. Differentiation into myotubes was induced by changing the culture media to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum. Histology—Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, then incubated successively in 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were mounted with p-phenylenediamine. Images were captured with a CCD camera (Optronics) on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope and analyzed with Metamorph imaging software (Universal Imaging). The number of neurites analyzed was 50 to 100 per condition from three to four experiments. Anti-synapsin antibody was a kind gift from Paul Greengard and Angus Nairn (Rockefeller University), anti-SV2 was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, monoclonal anti-SIRP-α (clone p84), anti-CD47 (clones B6H12 and mIAP301), and anti-CD3 antibodies were from BD Biosciences, polyclonal anti-SIRP-α antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-FLAG and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma, and anti-neurofilament was from Sternberger. For styryl FM dye imaging (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), cultures were incubated for 90 s with 10 μm FM1–43 in a modified Tyrode solution containing 107 mm NaCl, 47 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mm CaCl2. After washing for 10 min, cultures were treated with 90 mm KCl, Tyrode (KCl plus NaCl held constant). Images were captured with a CCD camera (Photometrics) on an inverted microscope. Purification and Identification of Synaptic Organizing Molecules—Extracts were prepared from the forebrains of ∼100 P7 mouse pups (C57/BL6 strain) as described (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) by homogenizing in a Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 400 mm NaCl. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column, and eluted with a 0–500 mm linear NaCl gradient. Fractions were added to motoneuron cultures and their vesicle-aggregating activity assayed as described above. Active fractions were applied to a 20-ml HiTrap Q column, and eluted with a 100–200 mm linear NaCl gradient. Active fractions from this column were concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex-200 HR10/30 gel filtration column, and separated with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) plus 150 mm NaCl. Active fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column, and eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl linear gradient. Active fractions were dialyzed against 25 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 8.3), applied to a Mono P HR 5/5 column, and eluted with Poly-buffer 96 (GE Healthcare; diluted 1:10, pH 6.0). Columns were run using an AKTAprime FPLC System (GE Healthcare). The final active fractions were separated by a 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and stained with Colloidal Blue (Novex). Bands were excised, trypsin digested, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University. Sequences were analyzed using the data base searching program ProFound. Plasmid Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—cDNAs encoding mouse SIRP-α (IMAGE: 5368250), human SIRP-α (IMAGE: 3916836), SIRP-β1 (IMAGE: 5215629), and SIRP-γ (IMAGE: 5588038) were obtained from ATCC. Sequences encoding the entire protein or just the extracellular domain were cloned into the APtag5 expression vector (GenHunter), replacing the alkaline phosphatase coding sequence. A FLAG epitope tag was placed between the signal peptide and the SIRP sequence. Soluble SIRP proteins were produced by transiently transfecting extracellular domain plasmids into COS cells, and purifying secreted SIRP proteins from culture media by affinity chromatography on anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma). Recombinant FGF22 was prepared as described previously (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Cells and tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5) with a freshly added Protein inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche). Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (27Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein for each group, as ensured by protein assays (BCA, Pierce), were applied to the gel. Equal loading was confirmed by testing the level ofα-tubulin by Western blotting. Concentrations of antibodies used for blotting were: anti-SIRP-α extracellular domain, 2.5 μg/ml; anti-SIRP-α intracellular domain, 4 μg/ml; anti-FLAG, 10 μg/ml; anti-α-tubulin, 0.4 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitation—C2C12 culture media (from myoblasts and myotubes) were collected, precleared with 100 μl of Immobilized Protein-L (Pierce), and incubated with 2.5 μg of anti-SIRP-α extracellular domain antibody at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of Immobilized Protein-L, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to Western blotting to test the amount of secreted SIRP-α. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RT-PCR was performed using Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Primers used were: 5′-ATA CGC AGA CCT GAA TGT GCC CAA-3′ and 5′-TGG CCA CTC CAT GTA GGA CAA GAA-3′ for SIRP-α, and 5′-AGA GCT GAA GGT GAT CCA ACC TGT-3′ and 3′-ACC CGA ATC AGC AGG AGT GAC ATT-3′ for SIRP-β1. Assay and Purification of Presynaptic Organizing Molecules— A critical step in presynaptic differentiation is the clustering of synaptic vesicles near neurotransmitter release sites in nerve terminals (28Murthy V.N. De Camilli P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 701-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We therefore used synaptic vesicle clustering as an assay to monitor purification of presynaptic organizing molecules from brain. Embryonic motoneurons were purified, cultured, and treated with brain extract for 2 days, then vesicle distribution was assessed by immunostaining for the vesicle-associated protein, synapsin (28Murthy V.N. De Camilli P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 701-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We used chick motoneuron cultures for the assay because they can be prepared in the large numbers needed to monitor purification, are very pure (>90% purity), and can be cultured at low density to facilitate scoring (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Fox M.A. Sanes J.R. Borza D.B. Eswarakumar V.P. Fassler R. Hudson B.G. John S.W. Ninomiya Y. Pedchenko V. Pfaff S.L. Rheault M.N. Sado Y. Segal Y. Werle M.J. Umemori H. Cell. 2007; 129: 179-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To purify active factors from the brain, extracts were prepared from the forebrains of 7-day-old mice, because synapse formation is at its peak at this stage (29Vaughn J.E. Synapse. 1989; 3: 255-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Untreated motoneurons extended neurofilament-positive neurites within which synapsin was diffusely distributed (Fig. 1A, top). When crude brain extracts were added to the cultures, synapsin distribution became punctate and varicose. The crude extract also promoted elongation and branching of neurites (Fig. 1A, middle; see below for quantification). The brain extract was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (DEAE), and aliquots of individual fractions were added to motoneuron cultures to monitor vesicle-clustering activity. This assay revealed two peaks of activity that induced synapsin aggregation. One peak contains FGF22, which we characterized previously (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The other peak, on which we focus here, was fractionated further on anion exchange (HiTrap-Q), gel filtration (Superdex 200), cation exchange (Mono S), and chromatofocusing (Mono P) columns (Table 1). The most active fractions from the Mono P column retained synapsin aggregation activity but did not detectably affect neurite branching or elongation (Fig. 1A, bottom; number of aggregates were 2.3 ± 0.8/mm for control, 4.98 ± 1.3/mm for crude extract, and 8.0 ± 1.0/mm for purified fraction; neurite lengths were 416.9 ± 12 μm for control, 833.3 ± 15 μm for crude extract, and 424.9 ± 11 μm for purified fraction; branch points per neurite were 1.69 ± 1.1 for control, 4.08 ± 1.5 for crude extract, and 1.50 ± 1.2 for purified fraction; mean ± S.E. for 30 neurites). Vesicle aggregation activity in this fraction was enriched >3,000-fold compared with the original supernatant (Table 1), but because the crude extract contained multiple active components, we estimate that purification of this species was >10,000-fold.TABLE 1Purification of presynaptic organizing molecules from brain extracts Presynaptic organizing activity was monitored by the vesicle clustering assay shown in Fig. 1A. Active fractions from each step were pooled and subjected to sequential chromatography. Presynaptic organizing activity was purified 3,313-fold; because multiple active species were present in the starting material (7Umemori H. Linhoff M.W. Ornitz D.M. Sanes J.R. Cell. 2004; 118: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), purification of SIRP-α was ∼10,000-fold.StepProteinTotal activityPurificationμgAgg/mm-foldForebrain (P7, ∼100)∼20 gS-201,080,000.01,800,0001.0DEAE22,800.0300,0007.9Hi-Trap Q6,900.0270,00023.5Superdex 200380.0117,000184.9Mono S61.068,000669.4Mono P8.748,0003,313.0 Open table in a new tab The most active fractions from the Mono P column contained a major protein of 70 kDa (Fig. 1B) along with a minor protein of 40 kDa. The 70-kDa band was subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. The peptides were processed for MALDI-MS and MS/MS. Data base search with the detected masses identified a protein corresponding to SIRP-α. The 40-kDa band was identified as an N-terminal fragment of rabaptin-5, a 95-kDa intracellular signaling protein (30Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar); it was not studied further. Presynaptic Organizing Activity of SIRP-α—SIRP-α is a transmembrane adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily (11Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 12Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 13van Beek E.M.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 7788-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As discussed below, the presence of this protein in a soluble extract was unexpected. As a first step in testing whether SIRP-α is capable of promoting synapsin aggregation, we constructed an expression plasmid encoding the full-length protein, and transfected it into COS cells. The motoneurons were co-cultured with COS cells and stained for synapsin. As shown in Fig. 2A, synapsin was diffusely distributed in most neurites contacting COS cells transfected with GFP alone. In contrast, when motoneurons were co-cultured with COS cells expressing SIRP-α in addition to GFP, synapsin was aggregated in ∼80% of neurites contacting the transfected COS cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained in cultures stained for another synaptic vesicle protein, SV2 (Fig. 2C). These results confirm that SIRP-α has presynaptic organizing activity. Regulated Cleavage of the SIRP-α Extracellular Domain—Although SIRP-α has transmembrane and intracellular domains, all of the peptides obtained by MALDI and MS/MS from the SIRP-α we purified were located in its extracellular domain (Fig. 3A). This result suggested that the presence of this transmembrane protein in a soluble extract resulted from cleavage and release of the extracellular domain. Consistent with this idea, the protein we purified was ∼70 kDa, approximately the expected mass of the glycosylated extracellular domain, rather than the ∼85 kDa expected for the full-length glycosylated protein (15Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The presence of an extracellular fragment in the extract might result from an endogenous, regulated process, or artifactual proteolysis during preparation of the extract. To investigate SIRP-α cleavage, we generated a SIRP-α construct with a FLAG tag at the N terminus and introduced it into COS cells. Media and cells were rapidly separated and treated with a mixture of protease inhibitors. We then probed media and cell lysates with antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain and to the FLAG epitope. As shown in Fig. 3B, a protein of ∼85 kDa was detected in lysates but not media by both antibodies; this species presumably corresponds to full-length, glycosylated SIRP-α. In addition, a ∼70-kDa band was detected in media but not lysates by the anti-FLAG antibody (arrowhead) but not by antibody to the SIRP-α intracellular domain. These results verify that cells cleave and release the extracellular domain of SIRP-α, which is consistent with a previous study with Chinese hamster ovary cells (31Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Okazawa H. Ohe Y. Tomizawa K. Sato R. Matozaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27878-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We next examined whether tissues express both full-length and truncated forms of SIRP-α. As shown in Fig. 3C, an antibody to the extracellular domain of SIRP-α (15Chuang W. Lagenaur C.F. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) detected two bands (∼85 and ∼70 kDa) on Western blots of E16-striated muscle extracts, suggesting that indeed the cleavage of SIRP-α occurs in vivo. The level of SIRP-α was much higher at E16, the time when synapses are being formed, than adult. We also asked whether the level of SIRP-α in the muscle increases after denervation in adult. We surgically cut the sciatic nerve and compared the expression of SIRP-α between innervated and denervated leg muscles. SIRP-α was significantly induced by denervation (Fig. 3D) (32Mitsuhashi H. Yoshikawa A. Sasagawa N. Hayashi Y. Ishiura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), suggesting its role in regeneration and synaptogenesis. To ask whether SIRP-α cleavage and release are regulated, we turned to C2C12 muscle cells. Myotubes are the synaptic targets of motoneurons, and are known to express SIRP-α (32Mitsuhashi H. Yoshikawa A. Sasagawa N. Hayashi Y. Ishiura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Kontaridis M.I. Liu X. Zhang L. Bennett A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); C2C12 cells can be grown as myoblasts then induced to fuse into myotubes (10Fox M.A. Sanes J.R. Borza D.B. Eswarakumar V.P. Fassler R. Hudson B.G. John S.W. Ninomiya Y. Pedchenko V. Pfaff S.L. Rheault M.N. Sado Y. Segal Y. Werle M.J. Umemori H.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes expressed full-length (∼85 kDa) SIRP-α with higher expression in myotubes (Fig. 3E). Significantly higher levels of ∼70-kDa SIRP-α fragment were present in culture media from myotubes (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that the extracellular domain of SIRP-α is cleaved and released, and that these processes are regulated by cellular differentiation. Presynaptic Organizing Activity of the SIRP-α Extracellular Domain—To characterize the synaptic organizing activity of the soluble SIRP-α extracellular domain (sSIRP-α), we purified the cleaved fragment from the culture media of FLAG-SIRP-α-expressing COS cells using anti-FLAG-agarose. Like SIRP-α from brain (Fig. 1) and full-length SIRP-α (Fig. 2), sSIRP-α induced aggregation of synaptic vesicles in neurites of c"
https://openalex.org/W2007767964,"Natural killer (NK) cell activation receptors accumulate by an actin-dependent process at cytotoxic immune synapses where they provide synergistic signals that trigger NK cell effector functions. In contrast, NK cell inhibitory receptors, including members of the MHC class I-specific killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) family, accumulate at inhibitory immune synapses, block actin dynamics, and prevent actin-dependent phosphorylation of activation receptors. Therefore, one would predict inhibition of actin-dependent accumulation of activation receptors when inhibitory receptors are engaged. By confocal imaging of primary human NK cells in contact with target cells expressing physiological ligands of NK cell receptors, we show here that this prediction is incorrect. Target cells included a human cell line and transfected Drosophila insect cells that expressed ligands of NK cell activation receptors in combination with an MHC class I ligand of inhibitory KIR. The two NK cell activation receptors CD2 and 2B4 accumulated and co-localized with KIR at inhibitory immune synapses. In fact, KIR promoted CD2 and 2B4 clustering, as CD2 and 2B4 accumulated more efficiently at inhibitory synapses. In contrast, accumulation of KIR and of activation receptors at inhibitory synapses correlated with reduced density of the integrin LFA-1. These results imply that inhibitory KIR does not prevent CD2 and 2B4 signaling by blocking their accumulation at NK cell immune synapses, but by blocking their ability to signal within inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2005097680,"Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are a rare type of gamma-ray transient sources that are ocasionally detected as bursts in the high-energy sky. They are thought to be produced by magnetars, young neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields of the order of 10^(14-15) G. Only three such objects are known in our Galaxy, and a fourth one is associated with the supernova remnant N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. In none of these cases has an optical counterpart to either the gamma-ray flares or the quiescent source been identified. Here we present multi-wavelength observations of a puzzling source, SWIFT J195509+261406, for which we detected more than 40 flaring episodes in the optical band over a time span of 3 days, plus a faint infrared flare 11 days later, after which it returned to quiescence. We propose that SWIFT J195509+261406 is a member of a subgroup of SGRs for which the long-term X-ray emission is transient in nature. Furthermore, it is the first SGR for which bursts have been detected in the optical and near-infrared bands and maybe the link between the ""persistent"" SGRs and the dim isolated neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W2125454951,"Two groups report the observation of optical flares from SWIFT J195509.6+261406, an intriguing X-ray source located in our Galaxy and initially discovered as a γ-ray burst by the orbiting Swift observatory. Stefanescu et al. detected extremely bright and rapid optical flaring, producing optical light-curves similar to the high energy light-curves of soft γ-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars, which are thought to be neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (magnetars). In a multiwavelength study Castro-Tirado et al. detected more than 40 flaring episodes at optical wavelengths over a time span of three days. They suggest that SWIFT J195509+261406 could be an isolated magnetar whose bursting activity has been detected at optical wavelengths. Highly luminous rapid flares are characteristic of processes around compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. In the high-energy regime of X-rays and γ-rays, outbursts with variabilities on timescales of seconds or less are routinely observed, for example in γ-ray bursts1 or soft γ-ray repeaters2. At optical wavelengths, flaring activity on such timescales has not been observed, other than from the prompt phase of one exceptional γ-ray burst3. This is mostly due to the fact that outbursts with strong, fast flaring are usually discovered in the high-energy regime; most optical follow-up observations of such transients use instruments with integration times exceeding tens of seconds, which are therefore unable to resolve fast variability. Here we show the observation of extremely bright and rapid optical flaring in the Galactic transient4,5,6,7 SWIFT J195509.6+261406. Our optical light curves are phenomenologically similar to high-energy light curves of soft γ-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars8, which are thought to be neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields (magnetars). This suggests that similar processes are in operation, but with strong emission in the optical, unlike in the case of other known magnetars."
https://openalex.org/W2056380838,"We present evidence that the source of Earth's axial dipole field is largely independent from the sources responsible for the rest of the geomagnetic field, the so-called nonaxial dipole (NAD) field. Support for this claim comes from correlations between the structure of the historic field and the behavior of the paleomagnetic field recorded in precisely dated lavas at those times when the axial dipole was especially weak or nearly absent. It is argued that a ""stratification"" of magnetic sources exists in the fluid core such that the axial dipole is the only observed field component that is nearly immune from the influence exerted by the lowermost mantle. It follows that subsequent work on spherical harmonic-based field descriptions may now incorporate an understanding of a dichotomy of spatial-temporal dynamo processes."
https://openalex.org/W2113898420,"Analysis of microarray and other high throughput data often involves identification of genes consistently up or down-regulated across samples as the first step in extraction of biological meaning. This gene-level paradigm can be limited as a result of valid sample fluctuations and biological complexities. In this report, we describe a novel method, SLEPR, which eliminates this limitation by relying on pathway-level consistencies. Our method first selects the sample-level differentiated genes from each individual sample, capturing genes missed by other analysis methods, ascertains the enrichment levels of associated pathways from each of those lists, and then ranks annotated pathways based on the consistency of enrichment levels of individual samples from both sample classes. As a proof of concept, we have used this method to analyze three public microarray datasets with a direct comparison with the GSEA method, one of the most popular pathway-level analysis methods in the field. We found that our method was able to reproduce the earlier observations with significant improvements in depth of coverage for validated or expected biological themes, but also produced additional insights that make biological sense. This new method extends existing analyses approaches and facilitates integration of different types of HTP data."
https://openalex.org/W2051537008,"The JIL-1 histone H3S10 kinase in Drosophila localizes specifically to euchromatic interband regions of polytene chromosomes and is enriched 2-fold on the male X chromosome. JIL-1 can be divided into four main domains including an NH2-terminal domain, two separate kinase domains, and a COOH-terminal domain. Our results demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain of JIL-1 is necessary and sufficient for correct chromosome targeting to autosomes but that both COOH- and NH2-terminal sequences are necessary for enrichment on the male X chromosome. We furthermore show that a small 53-amino acid region within the COOH-terminal domain can interact with the tail region of histone H3, suggesting that this interaction is necessary for the correct chromatin targeting of the JIL-1 kinase. Interestingly, our data indicate that the COOH-terminal domain alone is sufficient to rescue JIL-1 null mutant polytene chromosome defects including those of the male X chromosome. Nonetheless, we also found that a truncated JIL-1 protein which was without the COOH-terminal domain but retained histone H3S10 kinase activity was able to rescue autosome as well as partially rescue male X polytene chromosome morphology. Taken together these findings indicate that JIL-1 may participate in regulating chromatin structure by multiple and partially redundant mechanisms. The JIL-1 histone H3S10 kinase in Drosophila localizes specifically to euchromatic interband regions of polytene chromosomes and is enriched 2-fold on the male X chromosome. JIL-1 can be divided into four main domains including an NH2-terminal domain, two separate kinase domains, and a COOH-terminal domain.

Taken together these findings indicate that JIL-1 may participate in regulating chromatin structure by multiple and partially redundant mechanisms. The JIL-1 tandem kinase is a multidomain protein that localizes specifically to euchromatic chromosome regions, phosphorylates histone H3S10 at interphase, and is enriched almost 2-fold on the transcriptionally hyperactive male X chromosome (1Jin Y.

Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the JIL-1 kinase has been functionally implicated in counteracting heterochromatization and gene silencing and is required for maintaining proper chromosome morphology (4Ebert A.

Development. 2008; 135: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In polytene autosomes loss of JIL-1 leads to misalignment of interband chromatin fibrils and to increased ectopic contacts between nonhomologous regions (7Deng H. Zhang W. Bao X. Martin J.N. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Chromosoma. 2005; 114: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is an abnormal coiling of the chromosomes with an intermixing of euchromatic regions and the compacted chromatin characteristic of banded regions. Especially affected by loss of JIL-1 is the male X chromosome where chromatin is dispersed into a diffuse network without any discernable banded regions that leads to a characteristic “puffed” appearance (7Deng H. Zhang W. Bao X. Martin J.N. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Chromosoma. 2005; 114: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). JIL-1 can be divided into four main domains including an NH2-terminal domain (NTD), 2The abbreviations used are: NTD, NH2-terminal domain; CTD, COOH-terminal domain; KDI, kinase domain I; KDII, kinase domain II; Su(var), suppressor-of-variegation; MSL, male-specific lethal; FL, full length; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. the first kinase domain (KDI), the second kinase domain (KDII), and a COOH-terminal domain (CTD) (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations resulting in truncations of the COOH-terminal domain of JIL-1 lead to chromatin mislocalization of the protein (5Zhang W. Deng H. Bao X. Lerach S. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Development. 2006; 133: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and give rise to some of strongest suppressor-of-variegation (Su(var)) phenotypes yet described of the wm4 allele (4Ebert A. Schotta G. Lein S. Kubicek S. Krauss V. Jenuwein T. Reuter G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine which sequences function to localize JIL-1 to chromatin and to enrich it on the male X chromosome, we have undertaken a domain analysis of the JIL-1 protein by expressing deletion constructs of JIL-1 transgenically in JIL-1 null mutant flies. Our results demonstrate that the CTD of JIL-1 is necessary and sufficient for correct chromosome targeting to autosomes but that both COOH- and NH2-terminal sequences are necessary for enrichment on the male X chromosome. In addition, the CTD has an unusual organization, being highly acidic in its first half (pI < 4) and highly basic in its second half (pI > 11), the latter of which contains a predicted globular tertiary structure (9Bao X. Zhang W. Krencik R. Deng H. Wang Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We show by in vitro deletion construct analysis that a small 53-amino acid region of the putative CTD globular domain specifically binds to the tail region of histone H3. Thus, our findings indicate that this sequence within the COOH-terminal region of JIL-1 represents a novel histone H3 binding domain that is required for the correct localization of the JIL-1 kinase to chromatin. JIL-1 GFP/CFP- and V5-tagged Fusion Constructs—A full-length JIL-1 (1–1207) construct (JIL-1-FL), a NH2-terminal domain construct of JIL-1 from residue 1–260 (NTD), a KDI/KDII construct containing the two kinase domains (255–888), and a NTD/CTD construct containing most of the NH2-terminal domain (1–190) and the COOH-terminal domain (927–1207) in tandem were cloned into the pUAST vector with in-frame V5 tags (V5-pMT vector, Invitrogen) at the COOH termini using standard methods (10Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.1-18.136Google Scholar). Similarly, a ΔCTD construct from residue 1–926 with an in-frame GFP tag at the NH2 terminus as well as a CTD construct containing sequences from amino acids 927–1207 with an in-frame CFP tag were cloned into the pUAST vector. For those constructs not containing the endogenous JIL-1 nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that is situated in the NH2-terminal domain (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the NLS from NLS-pECFP vector (Clontech) was added to the NH2 terminus. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing at the Iowa State University Sequencing facility. Drosophila melanogaster Stocks—Fly stocks were maintained at 23 °C according to standard protocols (11Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 1-389Google Scholar). Canton-S was used for wild type preparations. The JIL-1z2 null allele is described in Wang et al. (3Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) as well as in Zhang et al. (12Zhang W. Jin Y. Ji Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1341-1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GFP-JIL-1 line (P[hsp83-GFP-JIL-1, w+]) has been previously characterized in Jin et al. (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and in Wang et al. (3Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). JIL-1 construct pUAST lines were generated by standard P-element transformation (BestGene, Inc.), and expression of the transgenes were driven using the hsp70-GAL4 (P{w[+mC] = GAL4-hsp70.PB}) driver (obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center) introduced by standard genetic crosses. The hsp83 and hsp70 promoters are leaky (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 13Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and were used without heat shock treatment. Expression levels of each of the JIL-1 constructs were monitored by immunoblot analysis as described below. Balancer chromosomes and markers are described in Lindsley and Zimm (14Lindsley D.L. Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, Inc., New York1992: 1071-1076Crossref Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Standard polytene chromosome squash preparations were performed as in Kelley et al. (15Kelley R.L. Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Roman G. Davis R.L. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1999; 98: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) using the 5-min fixation protocol, and acid-free squash preparations were done following the procedure of DiMario et al. (16DiMario P. Rosby R. Cui Z. Drosophila Information Service. 2006; 89: 115-118Google Scholar). Antibody labeling of these preparations was performed as described in Jin et al. (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and in Wang et al. (3Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In most preparations the male X chromosome was identified by double labeling with MSL antibody as previously described (2Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used in this study include rabbit anti-H3S10ph (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-histone H3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen), chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs), anti-Chromator mAb 6H11 (17Rath U.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DNA was visualized by staining with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) in PBS. The appropriate species- and isotype-specific Texas Red-, TRITC-, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel/ICN, Southern Biotech) were used (1:200 dilution) to visualize primary antibody labeling. The final preparations were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.5% n-propyl gallate. The preparations were examined using epifluorescence optics on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were captured and digitized using a high resolution Spot CCD camera. Images were imported into Photoshop where they were pseudocolored, image-processed, and merged. In some images nonlinear adjustments were made to the channel with Hoechst labeling for optimal visualization of chromosomes. For quantification of the relative levels of antibody staining of X chromosomes and autosomes, images of polytene chromosome squashes were analyzed using the NIH Image software as previously described (1Jin Y. Wang Y. Walker D.L. Dong H. Conley C. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 129-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In short, the staining intensity of the autosomes from male preparations was averaged and normalized to a value of one and compared with the average pixel intensity for that of the X chromosome. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared from whole third instar larvae or in some experiments from dissected salivary glands homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to standard procedures (10Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.1-18.136Google Scholar). Electroblot transfer was performed as in Towbin et al. (18Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 9: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) with transfer buffer containing 20% methanol and in most cases including 0.04% SDS. For these experiments we used the Bio-Rad Mini PROTEAN II system, electroblotting to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose, and using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (1:3000) for visualization of primary antibody. Antibody labeling was visualized using chemiluminescent detection methods (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). The immunoblots were digitized using a flatbed scanner (Epson Expression 1680). Pulldown Assays—In pulldown assays GST fusion proteins containing JIL-1 sequences were used to pull down endogenous nuclear proteins from S2 cell lysates as previously described (9Bao X. Zhang W. Krencik R. Deng H. Wang Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, pulldown experiments were performed with histone H3 GST fusion proteins of lysates from an S2 cell line stably transfected with a Myc-tagged CTD domain of JIL-1 (927–1207). This construct was subcloned into the pMT/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) with an NH2-terminal insertion of a 6-Myc tag from the 6-CMYC clone CD3-128 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center) as well as of a nuclear localization sequence. Initially the JIL-1 GST fusion proteins CTD-A (886–1033), CTD-B (1033–1207), and CTD-G (1065–1196), which have been previously described (9Bao X. Zhang W. Krencik R. Deng H. Wang Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and a full-length histone H3 (1–135) construct that was reverse transcription-PCR-amplified from mRNA extractions from S2 cells and cloned into the pGEX4T vector (Amersham Biosciences) were expressed in Escherichia coli using standard techniques (10Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1.1-18.136Google Scholar). For subsequent experiments, GST fusion protein constructs with various truncations of histone H3 and the COOH-terminal domain of JIL-1 were generated by PCR amplification and insertion into the pGEX4T vector. The additional histone H3 GST fusion proteins were GST-H3-T (1–74) and GST-H3-C (56–135), and the additional JIL-1 GST fusion proteins were CTD-G1 (1105–1196), CTD-G2 (1105–1144), and CTD-G3 (1144–1196). All GST fusion protein constructs were verified by sequencing. The GST tag of all constructs was added to the NH2 terminus. For the in vitro protein-protein interaction assays, ∼2 μg of the appropriate GST fusion protein was coupled with glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with 300 μl of S2 cell lysate (from 107 cells/ml) at 4 °C overnight on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed 4 times for 10 min each in 1 ml of PBS with 0.5% Tween 20, and proteins retained on the glutathione-agarose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as previously described (9Bao X. Zhang W. Krencik R. Deng H. Wang Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Overlay Experiments—The truncated GST-JIL-1 fusion proteins GST-NTD (1–211) and GST-CTD (927–1207) have been previously described (2Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Bao X. Zhang W. Krencik R. Deng H. Wang Y. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5079-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The JIL-1 GST fusion protein CTD-G3 (1144–1196) is described above. The respective GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells and purified over a glutathione agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the pGEX manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For the overlay interaction assays, either bovine histones (Worthington), individually purified bovine histones (Roche Applied Science), or Drosophila histone extractions from S2 cells performed as described below were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were subsequently incubated with ∼2 μg of either GST-NTD, GST-CTD, or CTD-G3 GST fusion protein overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk on a rotating wheel. The blots were washed 4 times for 10 min each in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20, and binding was detected by anti-GST mAb 8C7 (17Rath U. Wang D. Ding Y. Xu Y.-Z. Qi H. Blacketer M.J. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Histone Extraction from Drosophila S2 Cells—10 ml of S2 cell culture containing ∼107 cells/ml was pelleted by slow spinning and washed once with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS. The re-pelleted cells were resuspended with 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The nuclei were collected by spinning at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.4 ml 0.4 N H2SO4, and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 30 min to overnight. After incubation, the supernatant was collected by spinning at 13,200 rpm for 10 min, and histones were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (100%) to a final concentration of 20% and incubating on ice for 30 min. The precipitated histone proteins were harvested by spinning at 13,200 rpm for 10 min, washed twice with cold acetone (-20 °C), air dried, and resuspended in the appropriate amount of H2O. The CTD Domain Is Required for Proper Targeting of JIL-1 to Chromatin—Recently, Ebert et al. (4Ebert A. Schotta G. Lein S. Kubicek S. Krauss V. Jenuwein T. Reuter G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) mapped six JIL-1Su(var)3-1 alleles to a small region in the JIL-1 COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). The mutations in these alleles lead to COOH-terminal-truncated proteins that mislocalize to ectopic chromatin sites and are not enriched on the male X chromosome (4Ebert A. Schotta G. Lein S. Kubicek S. Krauss V. Jenuwein T. Reuter G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Zhang W. Deng H. Bao X. Lerach S. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Development. 2006; 133: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) implying an important function for the CTD domain in proper chromatin localization of JIL-1. To further explore the role of the different JIL-1 domains in chromosome targeting, we expressed three GFP- or CFP-tagged JIL-1 pUAST constructs transgenically in JIL-1 null mutant animals; a full-length construct (GFP-JIL-1), a construct without the COOH-terminal domain (ΔCTD), and a construct containing only the COOH-terminal region (CTD) (Fig. 1A). In these studies a hsp70-GAL4 driver line was used without heat shock. The hsp70 promoter is leaky (13Wallrath L.L. Elgin S.C.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1263-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) and promoted sufficient construct expression at or near wild type levels (Fig. 1B). As previously reported (3Wang Y. Zhang W. Jin Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) expression of a full-length GFP-JIL-1 construct in a JIL-1 null mutant background rescued all aspects of the mutant polytene chromosome phenotype, and like endogenous JIL-1, GFP-JIL-1 was enriched on the male X chromosome (Fig. 1C, Table 1). Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 1C, we found that expression of the CTD domain alone was sufficient for localization to chromatin and for restoration of polytene chromosome morphology to or near that of wild type preparations. That the CTD localized to the same interband chromatin sites normally occupied by full-length JIL-1 was further indicated by double labeling studies with antibody to Chromator, a chromosomal protein that is specific to interband polytene regions in a pattern identical to that of endogenous JIL-1 (17Rath U. Wang D. Ding Y. Xu Y.-Z. Qi H. Blacketer M.J. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Rath U. Ding Y. Deng Y. Qi H. Bao X. Zhang W. Girton J. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows such a double-labeled polytene squash preparation where CTD localization is indicated in green, Chromator localization in red, and where co-localization is indicated by the predominantly yellow regions in the composite image. At some interband locations in the composite image the color is more green or orange than pure yellow as a result of slight differences in the relative staining intensity of the two antibodies, which can vary from preparation to preparation. We also expressed the CTD domain in a wild type background. As illustrated in Fig. 2B, under these conditions detection of endogenous JIL-1 on the polytene chromosomes was significantly reduced, and enrichment was no longer observed on the male X chromosome. However, localization of the MSL complex as detected by MSL-2 antibody labeling was not affected (Fig. 2B, middle panel). These findings suggest that the CTD domain competed with endogenous JIL-1 for the same chromatin binding sites.TABLE 1Properties of JIL-1 constructs expressed in a JIL-1z2/JIL-1z2 null backgroundConstructLocalization to chromatinEnrichment on male X chromosomeH3S10 phosphorylationRescue of autosome morphologyRescue of male X chromosome morphologyGFP-JIL-1YesYesYesYesYesJIL-1-FLYesYesYesYesYesCTDYesNoNoYesYesΔCTDYesaEctopic chromatin localizationNoYesYesPartialKDI/KDIINoNoNoPartialNoNTDYesaEctopic chromatin localizationNoNoNoNoNTD/CTDYesYesNoPartialPartiala Ectopic chromatin localization Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Expression of the CTD construct in JIL-1 null and in wild type larvae. A, double labeling of a female polytene squash preparation from a JIL-1z2/JIL-1z2 third instar larvae expressing the CTD construct. The CTD (in green) was labeled with GFP antibody, and the interband specific protein Chromator (in red) was labeled with mAb 6H11. The composite image (comp) shows the co-localization between the CTD, and Chromator as indicated by the predominantly yellow color. B, expression of the CTD in wild type (wt) larvae dramatically reduced chromosomal levels of endogenous JIL-1 and prevented enrichment on the male X chromosome (X). The upper panel shows the distribution of JIL-1 and the enrichment of JIL-1 on the male X chromosome (X) in a control wild type polytene squash preparation. The labeling of endogenous JIL-1 was with a JIL-1 NH2-terminal domain-specific antibody that does not recognize the CTD domain. The polytene chromosome squash preparations in the upper and middle panels were double-labeled with MSL-2 antibody to show MSL complex localization and with GFP antibody in the lower panel to indicate the distribution of CTD-CFP. The middle and lower panels are from independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For comparison, we next expressed the ΔCTD construct, which is without the CTD domain in JIL-1 null mutant larvae. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, the ΔCTD was also able to fully rescue autosome morphology in polytene squash preparations. However, in most cases the morphology of the male X chromosome was only partially restored with remnants of puffed regions (Fig. 1C). In addition, it should be noted that autosome chromatin morphology in the polytene squash preparations was “better” than normal when the ΔCTD construct was expressed in JIL-1 mutant (Fig. 1C) as well as in wild type (Fig. 3) backgrounds. In such preparations, the chromosomes spread very easily and were wider with a more crisp and well resolved banding pattern as compared with typical wild type preparations. Furthermore, although the antibody labeling demonstrated that the ΔCTD was localized to chromatin (Fig. 1A), its distribution was broader and present at numerous ectopic locations (Fig. 3B) as compared with the CTD. This was especially evident in polytene squash preparations from third instar larvae where the ΔCTD construct was expressed in a wild type background (Fig. 3). In these preparations the distribution of the ΔCTD was determined by labeling with antibody to its GFP tag, and endogenous JIL-1 was determined using JIL-1 antibody (2Jin Y. Wang Y. Johansen J. Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to a COOH-terminal epitope not present in the ΔCTD (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the antibody labeling indicated that the ΔCTD, similar to the CTD, does not show enrichment on the male X chromosome (Figs. 1C and 3A). However, unlike the CTD, ΔCTD did not appear to have any effect on the endogenous JIL-1 chromatin distribution including on the male X chromosome (Fig. 3A). This indicates that the binding sites and/or mechanisms for chromatin association of the CTD and ΔCTD are different. Both NTD and CTD Domain Sequences Are Required for JIL-1 Enrichment on the Male X Chromosome—The findings that neither CTD nor ΔCTD was enriched on the male X chromosome suggested that contributions from more than one JIL-1 domain are needed for this enrichment to occur. To explore this possibility, we generated a series of V5-tagged JIL-1 pUAST constructs and expressed them transgenically in JIL-1 mutant backgrounds. These constructs are diagrammed in Fig. 4A and included a full-length JIL-1 construct (JIL-1-FL), a construct containing the two kinase domains (KDI/KDII), a construct containing only the NH2-terminal domain (NTD), as well as a construct where the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains were fused together (NTD/CTD). The criteria for assessment of chromosome morphology rescue were based on the degree to which autosomes were uncoiled, on the degree to which “puffing” of the male X chromosome was reduced, as well as on the extent of restoration of discrete band/interband regions of the chromosome arms.

https://openalex.org/W1986586004,"In a dynamic environment stimulus task relevancy could be altered through time and it is not always possible to dissociate relevant and irrelevant objects from the very first moment they come to our sight. In such conditions, subjects need to retain maximum possible information in their WM until it is clear which items should be eliminated from WM to free attention and memory resources. Here, we examined the neural basis of irrelevant information filtering from WM by recording human ERP during a visual change detection task in which the stimulus irrelevancy was revealed in a later stage of the task forcing the subjects to keep all of the information in WM until test object set was presented. Assessing subjects' behaviour we found that subjects' RT was highly correlated with the number of irrelevant objects and not the relevant one, pointing to the notion that filtering, and not selection, process was used to handle the distracting effect of irrelevant objects. In addition we found that frontal N150 and parietal N200 peak latencies increased systematically as the amount of irrelevancy load increased. Interestingly, the peak latency of parietal N200, and not frontal N150, better correlated with subjects' RT. The difference between frontal N150 and parietal N200 peak latencies varied with the amount of irrelevancy load suggesting that functional connectivity between modules underlying fronto-parietal potentials vary concomitant with the irrelevancy load. These findings suggest the existence of two neural modules, responsible for irrelevant objects elimination, whose activity latency and functional connectivity depend on the number of irrelevant object."
https://openalex.org/W2017065644,"Despite the emerging experimental techniques for perturbing multiple genes and measuring their quantitative phenotypic effects, genetic interactions have remained extremely difficult to predict on a large scale. Using a recent high-resolution screen of genetic interactions in yeast as a case study, we investigated whether the extraction of pertinent information encoded in the quantitative phenotypic measurements could be improved by computational means. By taking advantage of the observation that most gene pairs in the genetic interaction screens have no significant interactions with each other, we developed a sequential approximation procedure which ranks the mutation pairs in order of evidence for a genetic interaction. The sequential approximations can efficiently remove background variation in the double-mutation screens and give increasingly accurate estimates of the single-mutant fitness measurements. Interestingly, these estimates not only provide predictions for genetic interactions which are consistent with those obtained using the measured fitness, but they can even significantly improve the accuracy with which one can distinguish functionally-related gene pairs from the non-interacting pairs. The computational approach, in general, enables an efficient exploration and classification of genetic interactions in other studies and systems as well."
https://openalex.org/W1981389853,"With the rapidly increasing number of health care professionals seeking international research experience, comes an urgent need for enhanced capacity of host country institutional review boards (IRB) to review research proposals and ensure research activities are both ethical and relevant to the host country customs and needs. A successful combination of distance learning, interactive courses and expert course instructors has been applied in Peru since 2004 through collaborations between the U.S. Naval Medical Research Center Detachment, the University of Washington and the Department of Clinical Bioethics of the National Institutes of Health to provide training in ethical conduct of research to IRB members and researchers from Peru and other Latin American countries. All training activities were conducted under the auspices of the Peruvian National Institute of Health (INS), Ministry of Health. To date, 927 people from 12 different Latin American countries have participated in several of these training activities. In this article we describe our training model."
