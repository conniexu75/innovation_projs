https://openalex.org/W4294161571,"Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly integrated into human diet and presumed to be inert; however, animal studies suggest that they may impact the microbiome and downstream glycemic responses. We causally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encompassing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiome and plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic responses. Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom responders of each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely reflecting those noted in respective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exemplified by sucralose. Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4292240463,"Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a persistent human foe, transmitting arboviruses including dengue when they feed on human blood. Mosquitoes are intensely attracted to body odor and carbon dioxide, which they detect using ionotropic chemosensory receptors encoded by three large multi-gene families. Genetic mutations that disrupt the olfactory system have modest effects on human attraction, suggesting redundancy in odor coding. The canonical view is that olfactory sensory neurons each express a single chemosensory receptor that defines its ligand selectivity. We discovered that Ae. aegypti uses a different organizational principle, with many neurons co-expressing multiple chemosensory receptor genes. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrates that the broad ligand-sensitivity of mosquito olfactory neurons depends on this non-canonical co-expression. The redundancy afforded by an olfactory system in which neurons co-express multiple chemosensory receptors may increase the robustness of the mosquito olfactory system and explain our long-standing inability to disrupt the detection of humans by mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W4292240021,"Bacteria encode sophisticated anti-phage systems that are diverse and versatile and display high genetic mobility. How this variability and mobility occurs remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a widespread family of pathogenicity islands, the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs), carry an impressive arsenal of defense mechanisms, which can be disseminated intra- and inter-generically by helper phages. These defense systems provide broad immunity, blocking not only phage reproduction, but also plasmid and non-cognate PICI transfer. Our results demonstrate that phages can mobilize PICI-encoded immunity systems to use them against other mobile genetic elements, which compete with the phages for the same bacterial hosts. Therefore, despite the cost, mobilization of PICIs may be beneficial for phages, PICIs, and bacteria in nature. Our results suggest that PICIs are important players controlling horizontal gene transfer and that PICIs and phages establish mutualistic interactions that drive bacterial ecology and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4292238158,"The T cell receptor (TCR) expressed by T lymphocytes initiates protective immune responses to pathogens and tumors. To explore the structural basis of how TCR signaling is initiated when the receptor binds to peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of a tumor-reactive TCRαβ/CD3δγε2ζ2 complex bound to a melanoma-specific human class I pMHC at 3.08 Å resolution. The antigen-bound complex comprises 11 subunits stabilized by multivalent interactions across three structural layers, with clustered membrane-proximal cystines stabilizing the CD3-εδ and CD3-εγ heterodimers. Extra density sandwiched between transmembrane helices reveals the involvement of sterol lipids in TCR assembly. The geometry of the pMHC/TCR complex suggests that efficient TCR scanning of pMHC requires accurate pre-positioning of T cell and antigen-presenting cell membranes. Comparisons of the ligand-bound and unliganded receptors, along with molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that TCRs can be triggered in the absence of spontaneous structural rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W4293658735,"Genetically encoded voltage indicators are emerging tools for monitoring voltage dynamics with cell-type specificity. However, current indicators enable a narrow range of applications due to poor performance under two-photon microscopy, a method of choice for deep-tissue recording. To improve indicators, we developed a multiparameter high-throughput platform to optimize voltage indicators for two-photon microscopy. Using this system, we identified JEDI-2P, an indicator that is faster, brighter, and more sensitive and photostable than its predecessors. We demonstrate that JEDI-2P can report light-evoked responses in axonal termini of Drosophila interneurons and the dendrites and somata of amacrine cells of isolated mouse retina. JEDI-2P can also optically record the voltage dynamics of individual cortical neurons in awake behaving mice for more than 30 min using both resonant-scanning and ULoVE random-access microscopy. Finally, ULoVE recording of JEDI-2P can robustly detect spikes at depths exceeding 400 μm and report voltage correlations in pairs of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W4293276493,"The hippocampal CA2 region, an area important for social memory, has been suspected to play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) because of its resistance to degeneration observed in neighboring CA1 and CA3 regions in both humans and rodent models of TLE. However, little is known about whether alterations in CA2 properties promote seizure generation or propagation. Here, we addressed the role of CA2 using the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model of TLE. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices revealed a set of coordinated changes that enhance CA2 PC intrinsic excitability, reduce CA2 inhibitory input, and increase CA2 excitatory output to its major CA1 synaptic target. Moreover, selective chemogenetic silencing of CA2 pyramidal cells caused a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous seizures measured in vivo. These findings provide the first evidence that CA2 actively contributes to TLE seizure activity and may thus be a promising therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W4292385361,"The destruction of the earth's ecosystems is the most pressing issue globally. Carbon emissions account for nearly half of global air pollution. Methane is the primary source of ground-level ozone and a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), with greater warming potential than carbon dioxide emissions. The study examines the impact of the different methane emissions (released by agriculture, energy, and industrial sectors), urbanization, natural resource depletion, and livestock production on carbon emissions in the panel of selected Asian countries for the period of 1971 to 2020. The results show that energy associated methane emissions, livestock production, natural resource depletion, and urbanization are the main detrimental factors of environmental degradation across countries. The causality estimates show the unidirectional relationship running from livestock production and agriculture methane emissions to carbon emissions, from total methane emissions and carbon emissions to urbanization and from urbanization to energy methane emissions and livestock production. The forecasting estimates suggest that total methane emissions, natural resource depletion, and urbanization will likely increase carbon emissions over the next ten years. The study concludes that the energy sector should adopt renewable energy sources in its production process to minimize carbon emissions. Urbanization and excessive resource exploitation must be curtailed to attain carbon neutrality."

https://openalex.org/W4292316619,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a lethal subset of prostate cancer, is characterized by loss of AR signaling and resulting resistance to AR-targeted therapy during neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, for which the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that neuropilin 2 (NRP2) is upregulated in both de novo and therapy-induced NEPC, which induces neuroendocrine markers, neuroendocrine cell morphology, and NEPC cell aggressive behavior. NRP2 silencing restricted NEPC tumor xenograft growth. Mechanistically, NRP2 engages in reciprocal crosstalk with AR, where NRP2 is transcriptionally inhibited by AR, and in turn suppresses AR signaling by downregulating the AR transcriptional program and confers resistance to enzalutamide. Moreover, NRP2 physically interacts with VEGFR2 through the intracellular SEA domain to activate STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequently SOX2, thus driving NEPC differentiation and growth. Collectively, these results characterize NRP2 as a driver of NEPC and suggest NRP2 as a potential therapeutic target in NEPC."
https://openalex.org/W4292157652,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate and concurrently converts NAD+ into NADH. Dysfunction of IDH3B, the β subunit of IDH3, has been previously correlated with retinal degeneration and male infertility in humans, but tissue-specific effects of IDH3 dysfunction are unclear. Here, we generated Idh3b-KO mice and found that IDH3B is essential for IDH3 activity in multiple tissues. We determined that loss of Idh3b in mice causes substantial accumulation of isocitrate and its precursors in the TCA cycle, particularly in the testes, whereas the levels of the downstream metabolites remain unchanged or slightly increased. However, the Idh3b-KO mice did not fully recapitulate the defects observed in humans. Global deletion of Idh3b only causes male infertility but not retinal degeneration in mice. Our investigation showed that loss of Idh3b causes an energetic deficit and disrupts the biogenesis of acrosome and flagellum, resulting in spermiogenesis arrestment in sperm cells. Together, we demonstrate that IDH3B controls its substrate levels in the TCA cycle, and it is required for sperm mitochondrial metabolism and spermiogenesis, highlighting the importance of the tissue-specific function of the ubiquitous TCA cycle.

The mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a central metabolic pathway for energy production, macromolecule synthesis, cellular redox balance, and cell signaling (1Martinez-Reyes I. Chandel N.S. Mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolites control physiology and disease.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). This cycle consists of a series of biochemical reactions to oxidize nutrients to generate ATP and intermediates for the synthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides. Beyond these classical functions, mitochondrial intermediates, such as citrate, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), and succinate, are also important signaling molecules for post-translational modifications and epigenetic control of gene expression (1Martinez-Reyes I.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), which converts isocitrate into αKG, is a crucial control point for the TCA cycle. In mammalians, IDH exists in three isoforms: IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3. IDH1 and IDH2, localized in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, catalyze the reversible interconversion of isocitrate and αKG using NADP(H)+ as cofactor. Their forward reaction (oxidative decarboxylation) and reverse reaction (reductive carboxylation) play critical roles in lipogenesis, redox homeostasis, and cell proliferation (6Koh H.J. Lee S.M.

IDH3 is the classic TCA cycle enzyme, using NAD+ as its cofactor to catalyze the irreversible conversion of isocitrate into αKG and the reduction of NAD+ into NADH for mitochondrial respiration.

IDH3 is a heterotetramer composed of the αβ and αγ heterodimers. The α subunit is critical for the catalytic activity, but it requires the β and γ subunits for structural assembly and allosteric regulation.

In Drosophila melanogaster, Idh3b-mutant larval salivary gland cells fail to undergo mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in the death of these cells (24Duncan D.M. Kiefel P. Duncan I. Mutants for Drosophila isocitrate dehydrogenase 3b are defective in mitochondrial function and larval cell death.G3 (Bethesda). 2017; 7: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the enzyme structure, regulation, and mutations have been well studied, how mutations or altered expression of IDH3 subunits impact mitochondrial metabolism to cause tissue-specific impairment in vivo remains elusive. In this study, we investigate how the global loss of Idh3b influences mitochondrial metabolism, visual function, retinal viability, and male fertility in mice. We demonstrate that IDH3B is essential for IDH3 activity and TCA cycle intermediate metabolism. Surprisingly, testis mitochondria specifically rely on IDH3 for their mitochondrial metabolism, and the loss of Idh3b leads to severe arrestment of spermiogenesis. However, IDH3B is dispensable for visual function and retinal viability. Our study provides fundamental information on the tissue-specific function and metabolic regulation of IDH3 and sheds new insight on understanding the role of the TCA cycle in retinal health, sperm development, and male infertility. To determine the functions of IDH3B in vivo, we obtained Idh3b global (whole-body) KO mice from the Jackson Laboratory. The Idh3b-KO mice were generated by the injection of four guide RNAs using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, resulting in 343 bp deletion in exons 2 to 4 (Fig. 1A). Before validating the deletion of IDH3B, we evaluated the protein levels of IDH3 subunits in different tissues from the WT mice by Western blot. Among the eight tissues we examined, the heart and brain were the two tissues with the most abundant IDH3B expression (Fig. 1B). To confirm the global deletion of Idh3b in mice, we chose four tissues for analyses: tissues with the most abundant IDH3B protein expression (heart and brain) and tissues with potential functional defects based on the literature (retina and testis). Immunoblot results showed that IDH3B protein level is similar between the heterozygous (HET) and the WT mice in all the four tissues but undetectable in the homozygous (KO) mice, confirming that IDH3B is globally deleted in the KO mice (Fig. 1C). To examine how IDH3 activity is affected when IDH3B is absent, we performed enzyme activity assays for retina, brain, heart, and testis from WT, HET, and KO mice. IDH3 activities in the retina, brain, and testis from the KO mice were almost completely abolished; however, ∼30% of IDH3 activity was preserved in the heart (Fig. 1D). Since the HET mice had similar IDH3B protein level and IDH3 activities to the WT, we adapted the HET mice as the control group for most analyses to save animals and facilitate breeding. Taken together, we validated the global deletion of IDH3B in Idh3b-KO mice and showed that IDH3B is essential for IDH3 activity, especially in the retina, brain, and testis. To investigate whether the loss of Idh3b altered the expression of other IDH3 subunits, we quantified the protein expression of IDH3A and IDH3G in the retina and testis. In the retina, densitometry data showed no significant difference in IDH3A and IDH3B protein levels between HET and KO (Fig. 1, E–G). However, in the testis, IDH3A was reduced by 75% (p < 0.05), whereas IDH3G was increased by 35% (p < 0.05) in the KO mice (Fig. 1, H–J). Overall, our results suggest that IDH3B is required for the proper expression of other IDH3 subunits in the testis but not the retina. The Idh3b-KO mice showed normal appearance, hair color, and body weight (Fig. S1, A and B). There was no difference in the tissues/body weight in major organs, including heart, kidney, and liver between the KO and HET mice, suggesting that Idh3b-KO mice have normal body growth (Fig. S1, C–E). To investigate whether the KO mice have retinal degeneration, we examined the visual function by electroretinogram (ERG) and retinal morphology by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in vivo and H&E staining of eye sections in vitro. ERG responses from postnatal day 115 (P115) to P250 progressively declined with aging at the same rate between the KO and HET mice (Fig. S2, A–D). At P250, there were no significant changes in scotopic and photopic a-wave and b-wave at all light intensities in KO mice, compared with the HET (Fig. 2, A–D). OCT showed no difference in the thickness of each retinal layer between the KO and HET mice at the age of P200 (Fig. S2, E and F). Quantification of the thickness of the photoreceptor layer (outer segment and inner segment) and the number of nuclei in outer nuclei layer from H&E-stained eye sections confirmed that Idh3b-KO mice had normal retinal morphology at P250 (Fig. 2, E–H). Together, these results demonstrate that Idh3b-KO mice have normal vision and retinal morphology without retinal degeneration. IDH3 irreversibly converts isocitrate from citrate and aconitate into αKG in the TCA cycle (Fig. 3A). To examine how Idh3b ablation affects mitochondrial intermediary metabolism, we measured the abundance of TCA cycle metabolites from freshly isolated mouse retinas using GC/MS. As expected, metabolites from upstream reactions of IDH3, including citrate, isocitrate, and aconitate, were accumulated about twofold in retinas from the KO mice (Fig. 3B). However, αKG and its downstream metabolites, including glutamate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and aspartate, remained unchanged (Fig. 3B). These TCA cycle metabolites can be generated from different nutrient sources, such as glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. To trace the changes of metabolites from the same nutrient source, we incubated freshly isolated retinas with 13C glucose and analyzed 13C glucose-labeled metabolites by GC/MS as previously reported (25Du J. Cleghorn W. Contreras L. Linton J.D. Chan G.C. Chertov A.O. et al.Cytosolic reducing power preserves glutamate in retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2014; 111: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the abundance of 13C glucose-labeled glycolytic intermediates including phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, and lactate were similar between the HET and KO retinas. For TCA cycle intermediates, 13C glucose-labeled citrate, isocitrate, and aconitate increased twofold to threefold in the KO retinas, whereas other intermediates remained unchanged (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that IDH3B is critical for the levels of its substrates but not products. To examine whether another two IDH isoenzymes (IDH1 and IDH2) compensated for the loss of IDH3B, we measured their protein expression and enzyme activity from the isolated retinas. There was no significant difference in either IDH1 or IDH2 expression level between HET and KO (Fig. 3, D–F). The retinas from HET and KO showed similar NADP-dependent IDH activity from IDH1 and IDH2 (Fig. 3G). Overall, these results indicate that IDH3B is essential for mitochondrial isocitrate oxidation in the retina and for maintaining the levels of TCA cycle metabolites. During the generation of Idh3b-KO mice, we observed that male KO mice could not generate pups when bred with either HET females or WT females for up to 6 months. However, the breeding of KO females with HET males was normal. We performed a gross examination of isolated testes and found that the size and weight of testes is similar between the HET and KO (Fig. S3, A and B). To ask whether the sperms were normal in Idh3b-KO mice, we dissected the cauda epididymis (where matured sperms are stored), live-imaged, and counted the number of sperm cells under the light microscope. All sperm cells from the HET mice were motile with normal head–tail morphology (Fig. 4A and Video S1). However, the KO mice had nearly no mature spermatozoa and showed a large accumulation of immotile round sperm cells (Fig. 4B and Video S2). By counting the sperm cells, we found that both WT and HET mice had ∼6 million healthy and mature spermatozoa, whereas the KO mice had no mature spermatozoa except ∼0.8 million round sperm cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Histological analysis of the cauda epididymis using H&E staining confirmed that epididymal ducts in the KO mice were filled with immature round sperm cells (Fig. 4, E and F). These immature cells exhibited multiple defects including enlarged and vacuolated cytoplasm, vacuolated nucleus, multinucleation, and fragmentation (Fig. 4,E’ and F’). Overall, we found that Idh3b-KO male mice were infertile without mature spermatozoa, indicating that sperm development is impaired in the Idh3b-KO mice. Sperm development occurs in seminiferous tubules of the testis and consists of three stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. To investigate how Idh3b ablation influenced sperm development, we stained cross-sectioned testis and quantified different cell populations in seminiferous tubules. There was no difference in the number of cells in the early developmental stages, including spermatogonia, pachytene, leptotene/zygotene, and spermatid, between the HET and KO mice (Fig. 5, A–C), suggesting that sperm cells have normal development in mitosis and meiosis in the KO mice. However, the number of mature spermatozoa was reduced approximately fivefold in the KO testis, indicating a spermiogenesis arrestment in Idh3b-KO mice (Fig. 5C). Mouse spermiogenesis can be subdivided into 16 steps based on the morphological changes of the acrosome, a cap-like organelle attached to the nucleus (Fig. S4A). To define the impaired steps in spermiogenesis in the KO mice, we stained the glycoprotein in acrosome by periodic acid-Schiff. We found that spermatids at the same differential step orderly encircled the seminiferous tubules in HET testis but were disorganized in the KO testis (Fig. S4B). Detached or malformed acrosomes were observed in KO but not HET in steps 2 to 7 (Fig. 5, D–I). HET mice developed a normal oval shape nucleus starting from step 8 (Fig. 5, J–L). However, the shapes of the nucleus in the KO testis were irregular with round heads (Fig. 5 K–M). In addition, flagella (the tails), another important feature in mature spermatozoa, were abundant in the HET but scarce in KO mice (Fig. S4B). These results indicate that loss of Idh3b results in spermiogenesis arrestment. The acrosome is formed by organelle-derived (particularly Golgi) proacrosomal vesicles that traffick, fuse, and anchor to the nuclear surface during spermiogenesis. Acrosome biogenesis can be divided into four phases: Golgi (steps 1–3), cap (steps 4–7), acrosome (steps 8–12), and maturation (steps 13–16) phases (Fig. S4A). To visualize acrosome biogenesis, we stained the acrosome, nucleus, and Golgi with peptide nucleic acid, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and GM130. In steps 2 to 3 (Golgi phase), a single and sphere acrosomal granule is attached to the nucleus in the HET testis but detached in the KO with or without misoriented Golgi, indicating a compromised vesicle trafficking and anchoring in the KO mice (Fig. 6, A and B). In steps 4 to 5 (cap phase), proacrosomal granules displayed abnormal shapes and failed to transform into a cap shape in the KO testis (Fig. 6, C–F). In steps 6 to 7 (cap phase), cap-shaped proacrosomal vesicles were orderly oriented toward the nucleus in the HET, but the proacrosomal vesicles were scattered to float around the nucleus in the KO testis, indicating vesicle trafficking and fusion impairments. In the later steps (acrosome and maturation phases), the HET mice developed elongated mature acrosomes, whereas the KO acrosomes were fragmented and disoriented. (Fig. 6, G–J). To confirm these findings, we examined the ultrastructure of acrosome biogenesis using the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Consistently, we found multiple defects in acrosome biogenesis in the KO. These defects included (1) Golgi misorientation and acrosome detachment in Golgi phase, (2) no acrosome or eccentric and dilated acrosome granules in cap phase, (3) no acrosome or immature acrosome with mislocalized acrosomal granule in acrosome phase, and (4) no acrosome or detached acrosome in maturation phase (Fig. 6, I–V). To further evaluate these defects, we measured the expression of key proteins in acrosome biogenesis, including heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 (HSP90B1), Golgi associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif containing (GOPC), and acrosomal vesicle protein 1 (ACRV1) (Fig. 6, W–X). HSP90B1, an endoplasmic reticulum protein required for vesicle formation (27Audouard C. Christians E. Hsp90beta1 knockout targeted to male germline: a mouse model for globozoospermia.Fertil. Steril. 2011; 95https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.12.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was similar between the KO and HET. GOPC, which is required for vesicle fusion, was also maintained with the same amount in the KO (28Yao R. Ito C. Natsume Y. Sugitani Y. Yamanaka H. Kuretake S. et al.Lack of acrosome formation in mice lacking a Golgi protein, GOPC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ACRV1, an acrosomal matrix protein arising during acrosome biogenesis, was significantly decreased in testis from the KO mice (29Tang A. Yan Q. Sun L. Diao R. Yu Z. Zhang Z. et al.Developmental expression of ACRV1 in humans and mice.Andrologia. 2012; 44: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Together, these results strongly support that IDH3B is essential for acrosome biogenesis. Flagellum biogenesis is another hallmark for spermiogenesis. In KO testis, we found much fewer residual bodies and flagella in the lumen of testicular tubules (Fig. 5B’). To investigate how flagellum formation is affected, we stained axoneme, the core structure of flagellum, with the antibody against acetyl-α-tubulin. In testicular tubules containing late-step spermatids, we found that the distal ends of flagella were well oriented toward the lumen in the HET but were misoriented and disorganized in the KO mice (Fig. 7, A–D). The mitochondrial sheath is an important structural component, where mitochondria align with axoneme in the flagellum. Fluorescent staining of mitochondria using MitoTracker showed substantially reduced signals in the KO sections, suggesting that the mitochondrial sheath is disrupted (Fig. 7, E and F). Fibrous sheath and outer dense fibers are crucial for the assembly and integrity of the flagellum. To quantitatively study the structural changes in the flagellum, we performed Western blot with antibodies against acetyl-tubulin (axoneme marker), A-kinase anchoring protein 4 (AKAP82) (fibrous sheath marker), and outer dense fiber 2 (ODF2) (outer dense fiber marker). Our results showed that all these proteins were significantly reduced, especially AKAP82, which was almost undetectable in the KO testis (Fig. 7, G and H). To validate these findings, we examined the ultrastructure of flagellum components using TEM. We found structural defects in all three pieces in the flagellum from the KO testis (Fig. 7, I–R). The mitochondrial sheath disappeared, and multiflagella were formed in the midpiece (Fig. 7, I– K). In the principal piece, there were abnormal axonemes and reduced longitudinal columns (Fig. 7, L–N). In the endpiece, the plasma membrane was irregular and disorganized, which is a notable atypical feature of defected flagellum (Fig. 7, O–Q). Together, our results suggest that IDH3B is critical for maintaining intact flagellar structure, including axoneme, mitochondrial sheath, fibrous sheath, and outer dense fiber. To test how the loss of IDh3b influences testis metabolism, we first measured TCA cycle metabolites as done previously with the retinas using GC/MS. Surprisingly, metabolites upstream of the IDH3 reaction, including citrate, isocitrate, and aconitate, increased 10-fold∼20-fold in testes from the KO, compared with the control (Fig. 8A). However, the metabolites downstream of the IDH3 reaction were either slightly increased or unchanged (Fig. 8A). To ask whether this massive accumulation of precursors was specific to the testes, we analyzed TCA cycle intermediates from hearts where IDH3b protein is most abundant. Similar to the retina, metabolites upstream of the IDH3 reaction in the IDH3B KO hearts increased only twofold to threefold (Fig. 8B). NADP-dependent IDH1 and IDH2 can also oxidize isocitrate. There was no significant difference in protein expression and enzyme activities of IDH1/2 between the HET and KO testes (Fig. S5, A–D). IDH1/2 activities increased with isocitrate and reached the maximal activities at ∼2 mM. These results suggest that the massive accumulation of substrates probably exceeds the maximal rates of IDH1/2 for full compensation. To examine the impact of Idh3b-KO on the metabolome, we performed targeted metabolomics covering 206 metabolites in major metabolic pathways in glucose, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism (Table S3). Multivariant analysis showed that the score plots of metabolites from the KO were well separated from the HET, demonstrating that the loss of Idh3b significantly alters testis metabolome (Fig. 8C). Citrate and isocitrate were not in the targeted metabolomics, but we found that citraconic acid (formed by the heating of citrate) and aconitate were"

https://openalex.org/W4292366109,"LGI1 is a neuronal secreted protein highly expressed in the hippocampus. Epileptic seizures and LGI1 hypo-functions have been found in both ADLTE, a genetic epileptogenic syndrome and LGI1 limbic encephalitis (LE), an autoimmune disease. Studies, based mainly on transgenic mouse models, investigated the function of LGI1 in the CNS and strangely showed that LGI1 loss of function, led to a decreased AMPA-receptors (AMPA-R) expression. Our project intends at better understanding how an altered function of LGI1 leads to epileptic seizures. To reach our goal, we infused mice with LGI1 IgG purified from the serum of patients diagnozed with LGI1 LE. Super resolution imaging revealed that LGI1 IgG reduced AMPA-R expression at the surface of inhibitory and excitatory neurons only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Complementary electrophysiological approaches indicated that despite reduced AMPA-R expression, LGI1 IgG increased the global hyperexcitability in the hippocampal neuronal network. Decreased AMPA-R expression at inhibitory neurons and the lack of LGI1 IgG effect in presence of GABA antagonist on excitability, led us to conclude that LGI1 function might be essential for the proper functioning of the overall network and orchestrate the imbalance between inhibition and excitation. Our work suggests that LGI1 IgG reduced the inhibitory network activity more significantly than the excitatory network shedding lights on the essential role of the inhibitory network to trigger epileptic seizures in patients with LGI1 LE."
https://openalex.org/W4292384737,"Despite ongoing efforts to control malaria infection, progress in lowering the number of deaths and infections appears to have stalled. The continued high incidence of malaria infection and mortality is in part due to emergence of parasites resistant to frontline antimalarials. This highlights the need for continued identification of novel protein drug targets. Mitochondrial functions in Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest species of human malaria parasite, are targets of validated antimalarials including atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone). Thus, there has been great interest in identifying other essential mitochondrial proteins as candidates for novel drug targets. Garnering an increased understanding of the proteomic landscape inside the P. falciparum mitochondrion will also allow us to learn about the basic biology housed within this unique organelle. We employed a proximity biotinylation technique and mass spectrometry to identify novel P. falciparum proteins putatively targeted to the mitochondrion. We fused the leader sequence of a mitochondrially targeted chaperone, Hsp60, to the promiscuous biotin ligase TurboID. Through these experiments, we generated a list of 122 ""putative mitochondrial"" proteins. To verify whether these proteins were indeed mitochondrial, we chose five candidate proteins of interest for localization studies using ectopic expression and tagging of each full-length protein. This allowed us to localize four candidate proteins of unknown function to the mitochondrion, three of which have previously been assessed to be essential. We suggest that phenotypic characterization of these and other proteins from this list of 122 could be fruitful in understanding the basic mitochondrial biology of these parasites and aid antimalarial drug discovery efforts."

However, the mechanism by which Cdx2 influences intestinal disease is not clear. Here, we present evidence supporting a novel Cdx2–TRIM31–NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) signaling pathway, which may represent a mechanistic means by which Cdx2 impacts intestinal inflammation. We found that conditional loss of Cdx function resulted in an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, in the mouse colon. We further show that TRIM31, which encodes a suppressor of NLRP3 (a central component of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex) is a novel Cdx2 target gene and is attenuated in the colon of Cdx conditional mutants. Consistent with this, we found that attenuation of TRIM31 in Cdx mutant intestine occurs concomitant with elevated levels of NLRP3 and an increase in inflammasome products. We demonstrate that specific inhibition of NLRP3 activity significantly reduced IL-1β and IL-6 levels and extended the life span of Cdx conditional mutants, reflecting the therapeutic potential of targeting NLRP3. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were also induced independent of NLRP3, potentially via elevated activity of the proinflammatory NF-κB signaling pathway in Cdx mutants. Finally, in silico analysis of ulcerative colitis patients revealed attenuation of CDX2 and TRIM31 expression coincident with enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We conclude that the novel Cdx2–TRIM31–NLRP3 signaling pathway promotes proinflammatory cytokine expression, and its inhibition may have therapeutic potential in human intestinal diseases.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a noninfectious, chronic, and relapsing intestinal inflammation. IBD includes Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and indeterminate colitis (1Baumgart D.C. Sandborn W.J. Inflammatory bowel disease: clinical aspects and established and evolving therapies.Lancet (London, England). 2007; 369: 1641-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Given the long-term morbidity, rising incidence, and increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer in those with IBD, it is vital to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders. In the absence of such advances, management of IBD is expected to remain suboptimal despite the availability of potential therapeutic options (2Hazel K. O'Connor A. Emerging treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.Ther. Adv. Chronic Dis. 2020; 11https://doi.org/10.1177/2040622319899297Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Although the etiology of IBD is not fully understood, it is generally believed to result from a dysbiosis, where an inappropriate immune response is evoked in reaction to environmental cues, such as commensal microbes (3Baumgart D.C. Carding S.R. Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology.Lancet (London, England). 2007; 369: 1627-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). IBD has also been linked to a variety of genetic polymorphisms (4Watts D.A. Satsangi J. The genetic jigsaw of inflammatory bowel disease.Gut. 2002; 50: iii31Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and genome-wide association studies and candidate gene analyses have provided compelling evidence that IBD represents a class of polygenic disorders, with over 240 susceptibility loci reported to date (5Graham D.B.

Kalyanasundaram R. Therapeutic implications of inflammasome in inflammatory bowel disease.FASEB J. 2021; 35e21439Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome is a regulator of innate immunity (8Zaki M.H. Lamkanfi M. Kanneganti T.D.

Inflammasomes: mechanism of action, role in disease, and therapeutics.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Upon activation, the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers proteolytic maturation of the cysteine protease caspase-1, which subsequently cleaves and activates the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 (10Swanson K.V.

While activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome needs to be tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis in the intestine (15Schroder K. Tschopp J.

Cdx members elicit their effects by direct binding to target loci at Cdx response elements (CDREs) to increase or decrease target gene transcription, at least in part, by alterations in chromatin architecture (20Nguyen T.T.

These findings underscore the prospective involvement of CDX2 in the pathogenesis of IBD, although the mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this regard, although Cdx2 null mice are early lethal, Cdx2 heterozygous offspring are sensitized to dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis (30Calon A. Gross I. Lhermitte B. Martin E. Beck F. Duclos B. et al.Different effects of the Cdx1 and Cdx2 homeobox genes in a murine model of intestinal inflammation.Gut. 2007; 56: 1688-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), consistent with a protective role for Cdx in IBD. The clinical relevance of this relationship is further evidenced by the attenuation of expression of CDX2 in UC patients and its re-expression following leukocytapheresis in responsive individuals (31Tsuchiya K. Hayashi R. Fukushima K. Hibiya S. Horita N. Negi M. et al.Caudal type homeobox 2 expression induced by leukocytapheresis might be associated with mucosal healing in ulcerative colitis.J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2017; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a cytokine central to the proinflammatory events in IBD, correlate with attenuated CDX2 expression in UC patients, and TNF-α can likewise suppress CDX2 expression in model systems (23Coskun M. Olsen A.K. Bzorek M. Holck S. Engel U.H.

These observations contribute to a growing body of evidence supporting a role for CDX2 in IBD.Cdx1 and Cdx2 are coexpressed in the murine intestinal epithelium, where they functionally overlap (19Savory J.G.

To circumvent this functional overlap and early lethality, we created a Cdx2 “floxed” conditional allele and crossed this into a Cdx1 null mutant background. We then assessed the impact of the loss of all Cdx functions in the intestine, using a tamoxifen-regulated Villin-CreERT transgene to delete Cdx2. Using this approach, we previously demonstrated that Cdx2, and to a lesser extent Cdx1, is required for intestinal homeostasis and that Cdx members function as tumor suppressors in an adenomatous polyposis coli model of colorectal cancer (21Verzi M.P.

We further found that TRIM31, which encodes a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (41Ra E.A. Lee T.A. Won Kim S. Park A. Choi H.J.

Commun. 2016; 713727Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar), is directly regulated by Cdx2, offering a mechanistic basis for these observations. The physiological relevance of this relationship is underscored by the finding that chemical inhibition of NLRP3 activity decreased levels of IL-1β and IL-6 induced by Cdx loss and lengthened the life span of Cdx conditional mutants. We also observed increased expression of NF-κb2 and Rela, suggesting a basis for the elevated levels of TNF-α in Cdx mutants. Finally, in silico analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between CDX2, TRIM31, and the levels of proinflammatory markers, including products of the NLRP3 inflammasome, in UC patients, underscoring the potential clinical relevance of these findings.ResultsCdx deletion leads to intestinal inflammationWe generated Cdx1−/−–Cdx2fl/fl-Villin-Cre ERT conditional mutant mice and treated them with tamoxifen to induce Cdx2 deletion, yielding mice lacking Cdx1 and Cdx2 throughout the intestinal epithelium (termed Cdx-DKO hereafter; DKO [double KO]) as previously described (Fig. S1A) (35Hryniuk A. Grainger S. Savory J.G. Lohnes D. Cdx function is required for maintenance of intestinal identity in the adult.Dev. Biol. 2012; 363: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three days post-treatment, mice developed diarrhea, lethargy, rapid weight loss, and other indices of intestinal insufficiency and necessitating endpointing at 6-day post-treatment. Histological analysis revealed pathological alterations in intestinal epithelium as previously reported (35Hryniuk A. Grainger S. Savory J.G. Lohnes D.

Biol. 2012; 363: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1B).Colon epithelial cells were isolated from WT and Cdx-DKO mice 6 days following treatment with tamoxifen and used for transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq. This analysis revealed 6442 genes that were differentially expressed at a padj/false discovery rate of 0.05, with approximately equal numbers of genes upregulated (3231) and downregulated (3211) in the Cdx-DKO colon compared with controls (Fig. 1A). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis revealed a marked upregulation of genes involved in cytokine signaling, particularly the TNF-α pathway (Fig. 1B).Additional bioinformatics analysis was performed for the top 500 differentially expressed genes. For each replicate, normalized counts were plotted, and data bars were added to the side to show the mean level of expression and log2FoldChange for each gene. A list of all genes downloaded from Ensembl was annotated with the Gene Ontology (GO) term “Inflammatory response” (GO: 0006954) comprising a total of 759 genes. Any gene in the heatmap that is annotated with this term was flagged with a red bar. In colon epithelium from Cdx-DKO mice, 19 proinflammatory genes were upregulated, whereas 13 genes were downregulated (Fig. 1C).Cdx deficiency promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokinesGenes encoding a number of cytokines and chemokines were induced in the Cdx DKO intestine, including TNF-α, IL-1β, CXCL1, and CCL2, as determined by RNA-Seq analyses and confirmed by RT–quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figs. 2, A–E and S2, A–D). We were also able to detect upregulation of IL-6, which is a downstream target of IL-1β (43McGeough M.D. Pena C.A. Mueller J.L. Pociask D.A. Broderick L.

Approximately 5100 sites were identified using MACS2 peak calling annotated to genes that have Cdx2 bound in the region from −20 kb to +5kb relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS). Genomic distribution analysis revealed that these peaks were primarily localized in intergenic (35.1%) and intronic (37.7%) regions, followed by proximal promoter (≤1 kb from the TSS; 13%) and upstream promoter (1–3 kb; 8.8%) regions (Fig. S3A).

https://openalex.org/W4292385379,"Introduction In observational studies, venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been associated with Cushing’s syndrome and with persistent mental stress, two conditions associated with higher cortisol levels. However, it remains unknown whether high cortisol levels within the usual range are causally associated with VTE risk. We aimed to assess the association between plasma cortisol levels and VTE risk using Mendelian randomization. Methods Three genetic variants in the SERPINA1 / SERPINA6 locus (rs12589136, rs11621961 and rs2749527) were used to proxy plasma cortisol. The associations of the cortisol-associated genetic variants with VTE were acquired from the INVENT (28 907 cases and 157 243 non-cases) and FinnGen (6913 cases and 169 986 non-cases) consortia. Corresponding data for VTE subtypes were available from the FinnGen consortium and UK Biobank. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses (inverse-variance weighted method) were performed. Results Genetic predisposition to higher plasma cortisol levels was associated with a reduced risk of VTE (odds ratio [OR] per one standard deviation increment 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.87, p&lt;0.001). The association was stronger for deep vein thrombosis (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55–0.88, p = 0.003) than for pulmonary embolism which did not achieve statistical significance (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63–1.09, p = 0.184). Adjusting for genetically predicted systolic blood pressure inverted the direction of the point estimate for VTE, although the resulting CI was wide (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.70–1.61, p = 0.780). Conclusions This study provides evidence that genetically predicted plasma cortisol levels in the high end of the normal range are associated with a decreased risk of VTE and that this association may be mediated by blood pressure. This study has implications for the planning of observational studies of cortisol and VTE, suggesting that blood pressure traits should be measured and accounted for."
https://openalex.org/W4298188021,"A major pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, is a significant reduction in the white matter connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the correlated activity between anatomically corresponding bilateral brain areas. However, the underlying circuit mechanisms and the cognitive relevance of cross-hemispheric (CH) communication remain poorly understood. Here, we show that novelty discrimination behavior activates CH neurons and enhances homotopic synchronized neural oscillations in the visual cortex. CH neurons provide excitatory drive required for synchronous neural oscillations between hemispheres, and unilateral inhibition of the CH circuit is sufficient to impair synchronous oscillations and novelty discrimination behavior. In the 5XFAD and Tau P301S mouse models, CH communication is altered, and novelty discrimination is impaired. These data reveal a hitherto uncharacterized CH circuit in the visual cortex, establishing a causal link between this circuit and novelty discrimination behavior and highlighting its impairment in mouse models of neurodegeneration."

As risk communication activities are complex and costly usually, evaluation assessment are the best approach to advance risk communication interventions. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of risk communication and the quality of health communication materials developed during the 2019 cholera outbreak at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.A community-based parallel mixed design was conducted from May to June 2020 at Addis Ababa. A total of 605 adults were selected randomly from Addis Ketema sub-city and ten purposely selected adults were interviewed for qualitative data. In addition eight health communication materials on cholera were randomly selected for evaluation. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. After audio recorded interviews transcribed verbatim and translated into English the qualitative data were entered into open code version 4.02 for analysis. And then the data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Respondents exposed for cholera related messages and outbreak information were 71.8% and 52.7% respectively. Respondents have moderate knowledge for cholera with (M = 14.72 and SD ±4.02) with (0-34) scale range. Both Television and radio spots were found as simple and easy to understand and printed health communication materials score low quality. Poor documentation, lack of data management system and less attention for risk communication activities were identified as a gaps in risk communication in the study settings.this study revealed the positive effects of risk communication messages in increasing individuals' knowledge. Even though the risk communication spots were found to be simple and easy to understand, the quality of printed materials was low and less attention was given for the risk-communication activities. Thus, strengthening the quality of risk communication and materials development process is very important to bring desired effects in disease prevention strategies and for effective emergency responses in the future."

Positive associations have also been reported between purpose in life and concurrent and subsequent health and well-being. Evidence on antecedents of purpose in life is, however, limited. This study examines whether the adherence to moral standards and ethical behaviors (AMSEB) is associated with subsequent purpose in life. Data from the Health and Retirement Study obtained from a sample of 8,788 middle-aged and older adults in the US (mean age = 64.9 years, age range 50-96 years) were used. The prospective associations between AMSEB and purpose in life were examined using generalized linear models. A rich set of covariates and prior outcomes were used as controls to reduce the risk of reverse causation. The robustness analyses included computation of sensitivity measures, E-values, and running a set of secondary analyses conducted on subsamples of respondents and using a limited set of covariates. It was found that middle-aged and older adults who demonstrated higher AMSEB reported a higher sense of purpose in life after the 4-year follow-up period. This association was found to be monotonic, moderately robust to potential unmeasured confounding and independent of demographics, prior socioeconomic status, prior health conditions, and health behaviors as well as prior psychological predispositions such as dispositional optimism and life satisfaction. It was also robust to missing data patterns. Policymakers and health practitioners may consider a predisposition to adherence to moral standards and ethical behaviors as a potential intervention target, as its improvement and/or maintenance has the potential to improve longevity and to help promote healthy and purposeful aging."

https://openalex.org/W4292385239,"In the context of China’s commitment to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, as well as its strategy to build a strong transportation country, it is of foremost importance to study the carbon emission reduction effect of the opening of high-speed rail (HSR). This paper innovatively introduces the frequency of HSR stops as an indicator of HSR operation, and uses a time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) model, a mediating effect model and a spatial DID model to assess the direct and indirect impact, transmission mechanism, and spatial spillover effects of the opening and operation of HSR on carbon emission reduction based on a panel of 279 prefecture-level cities from 2003 to 2017. We found that the opening and operation of HSR significantly reduced urban carbon emissions. The direct transmission mechanism analysis shows that the opening of HSR can reduce carbon emissions by replacing highway passenger traffic. Indirect mechanism analysis shows that the opening of HSR can reduce carbon emissions through technological effect, structural effect and opening effect. The test of spatial spillover effect shows that the opening of HSR can promote carbon emission reduction not only in node cities, but also in neighboring cities."
https://openalex.org/W4292385359,"Rational use of medicine (RUM) for all medical conditions is crucial in attaining quality of healthcare and medical care for patients and the community as a whole. However, the actual medicine use pattern is not consistent with that of the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and is often irrational in many healthcare setting, particularly in developing countries. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate rational medicine use based on WHO/International Network of Rational Use of Drugs (INRUD) core drug use indicators in Eritrean National and Regional Referral hospitals. A descriptive and cross-sectional approach was used to conduct the study. A sample of 4800 (600 from each hospital) outpatient prescriptions from all disciplines were systematically reviewed to assess the prescribing indicators. A total of 1600 (200 from each hospital) randomly selected patients were observed for patient indicators and all pharmacy personnel were interviewed to obtain the required information for facility-specific indicators. Data were collected using retrospective and prospective structured observational checklist between September and January, 2018. Descriptive statistics, Welch's robust test of means and Duncan's post hoc test were performed using IBM SPSS (version 22). The average number of medicines per prescription was 1.78 (SD = 0.79). Prescriptions that contained antibiotic and injectable were 54.50% and 6.60%, respectively. Besides, the percentage of medicines prescribed by generic name and from an essential medicine list (EML) was 98.86% and 94.73%, respectively. The overall average consultation and dispensing time were 5.46 minutes (SD = 3.86) and 36.49 seconds (SD = 46.83), respectively. Moreover, 87.32% of the prescribed medicines were actually dispensed. Only 68.24% of prescriptions were adequately labelled and 78.85% patients knew about the dosage of the medicine(s) in their prescriptions. More than half (66.7%) of the key medicines were available in stock. All the hospitals used the national medicine list but none of them had their own medicine list or guideline. In conclusion, majority of WHO stated core drug use indicators were not fulfilled by the eight hospitals. The results of this study suggest that a mix of policies needs to be implemented to make medicines more accessible and used in a more rational way."
https://openalex.org/W4292385410,"Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) occurs worldwide and is a major source of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Researchers have developed many methods for predicting NEC diagnosis and prognosis. However, most people use statistical methods to select features, which may ignore the correlation between features. In addition, because they consider a small dimension of characteristics, they neglect some laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, and mean platelet volume, which could be potentially influential factors affecting the diagnosis and prognosis of NEC. To address these issues, we include more perinatal, clinical, and laboratory information, including anemia—red blood cell transfusion and feeding strategies, and propose a ridge regression and Q-learning strategy based bee swarm optimization (RQBSO) metaheuristic algorithm for predicting NEC diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, a linear support vector machine (linear SVM), which specializes in classifying high-dimensional features, is used as a classifier. In the NEC diagnostic prediction experiment, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of dataset 1 (feeding intolerance + NEC) reaches 94.23%. In the NEC prognostic prediction experiment, the AUROC of dataset 2 (medical NEC + surgical NEC) reaches 91.88%. Additionally, the classification accuracy of the RQBSO algorithm on the NEC dataset is higher than the other feature selection algorithms. Thus, the proposed approach has the potential to identify predictors that contribute to the diagnosis of NEC and stratification of disease severity in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W4292366133,"Fetal phonocardiography is a non-invasive, completely passive and low-cost method based on sensing acoustic signals from the maternal abdomen. However, different types of interference are sensed along with the desired fetal phonocardiography. This study focuses on the comparison of fetal phonocardiography filtering using eight algorithms: Savitzky-Golay filter, finite impulse response filter, adaptive wavelet transform, maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform, variational mode decomposition, empirical mode decomposition, ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise. The effectiveness of those methods was tested on four types of interference (maternal sounds, movement artifacts, Gaussian noise, and ambient noise) and eleven combinations of these disturbances. The dataset was created using two synthetic records r01 and r02, where the record r02 was loaded with higher levels of interference than the record r01. The evaluation was performed using the objective parameters such as accuracy of the detection of S1 and S2 sounds, signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and mean error of heart interval measurement. According to all parameters, the best results were achieved using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method with average values of accuracy = 91.53% in the detection of S1 and accuracy = 68.89% in the detection of S2. The average value of signal-to-noise ratio improvement achieved by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise method was 9.75 dB and the average value of the mean error of heart interval measurement was 3.27 ms."

Studies have shown that patients with a more diverse gut microbiome respond better to immunotherapy than those with a homogeneous microbiome. This systematic review aims to identify and assess the available evidence on the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and the effect of their microbiota on their treatment outcomes. The researchers will study the literature regarding CRC and immunotherapy outcomes to survey the different approaches employed to assess the treatment outcomes. A systematic search will be performed in five biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in June-July, 2022. Also, open-access registers of clinical trials will be trawled. The search will be conducted without geographical or publication date restrictions; however, only papers published in the English language will be sought. Details regarding patients’ diets, lifestyles, and characteristics will be assessed. We will define the primary outcome to compare CRC patients’ immunotherapy responses with their gut microbiota composition. The systematic review methodology does not require ethics approval due to the nature of the study design. The systematic review results will be published in an open-access peer-reviewed journal.

https://openalex.org/W4292379234,"WRINKLED1 (WRI1) is a transcription factor which is key to the regulation of seed oil biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. In the study, we identified two WRI1 genes in rice, named OsWRI1a and OsWRI1b, which share over 98% nucleotide similarity and are expressed only at very low levels in leaves and endosperms. The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that OsWRI1a encoded a nuclear localized protein. Overexpression of OsWRI1a under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice. Expressing the OsWRI1a gene under the control of the P1 promoter of Brittle2 (highly expressed in endosperm but low in leaves and roots) increased the oil content of both leaves and endosperms and upregulated the expression of several genes related to late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. However, the growth and development of the transgenic plants were also affected, with phenotypes including smaller plant size, later heading time, and fewer and lighter grains. The laminae (especially those of flag leaves) did not turn green and could not unroll normally. Thus, ectopic expression of OsWRI1a in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development."

Therefore, we assessed the impact of patient and technologist variations on off-centering patients undergoing body CT. With institutional review board approval, our retrospective study included 1000 consecutive adult patients (age ranged 22-96 years; 756 males: 244 females) who underwent chest or abdomen CT examinations. We recorded patient (age, gender, nationality, body weight, height,), technologist gender, and scan-related (scanner vendor, body region imaged, scan length, CT dose index volume, dose length product) information. Lateral and anteroposterior (AP) diameters were recorded to calculate effective diameter and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE). Off-centering represented the distance between the anterior-posterior centers of the scan field of view and the patient at the level of carina (for chest CT) and iliac crest (for abdomen CT). About 76% of the patients (760/1000) were off-centered with greater off-centering for chest (22 mm) than for abdomen (15 mm). Although ethnicity or patient gender was not a significant determinant of off-centering, technologist-patient gender mismatch was associated with a significantly greater frequency of off-centering (p<0.001). Off-centering below the gantry isocenter was twice as common as off-centering above the gantry isocenter (p<0.001). The latter occurred more frequently in larger patients and was associated with higher radiation doses than those centered below the isocenter (p<0.001). Technologists' years of experience and patient factors profoundly affect the presence and extent of off-centering for both chest and abdomen CTs. Larger patients are more often off-centered than smaller patients."

Using SPSS Ver. 23 (IBM, Chicago, IL), frequency distribution tables summarized demographic data and categories of male partners' involvement in antenatal care. Focus group discussions included male partners of age from 24 to 55 years at their first to fifth experience of pregnancy and childbirth. Interviews were audio-recorded, and then transcribed and coded. Thematic analysis was applied.The prevalence of male involvement in antenatal care was 69%. More than two-thirds of nursing mothers received physical, psychological and financial support from partners (76%) and attended four or more antenatal visits (85%). Five themes of male perspective of their involvement in antenatal care were generated, including: a) cultural norms and gender roles, b) ignorance of reproductive health service, c) factors outside their control, d) couple interaction and conflicts, and e) institutional obstacles.The prevalence of male partners' involvement in antenatal care was relatively high. Men's involvement in antenatal care depended on access to antenatal care education, standards of structure and process of antenatal service and how well their role was defined in the maternal health care system. Interactions and practice in society, employment sector and government health system should complement strategies to promote men's involvement in maternal health."

Preconception care optimizes women's health and improves pregnancy outcomes. It is a cost-effective first-line preventive strategy for birth defects. However, preconception care utilization in Ethiopia was very low. Studies on these issues are limited in Ethiopia in general and in Mizan-Aman town in particular.To assess preconception care utilization and associated factors among reproductive age women in Mizan-Aman town, Bench-Sheko Zone, Southwest Ethiopia.A community based cross-sectional study design was employed from April 16 to May 26, 2020 in Mizan-Aman town. The total study participants were 624 reproductive age women. Data were collected by using pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaires and entered into Epi-data version 3.1 then exported to STATA version 14 and analyzed accordingly. Univeriate and Bivariable analysis was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent t-test. Multivariable statistical analysis using generalized linear regression model (GLM) approach was used to classify factors of preconception care utilization. Since our response variable is measured in terms of count variable, we used a Poisson regression model with a log link function. Finally, Statistical significance between dependent and independent variables were assessed by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Overall, 28.6% of the women receipt atleast one item of preconception care while only 1.5% were taken the whole recommended components of preconception care services. The most common item received in the study area was taking micronutrient supplementation (18.5%). Age of women, educational status, husbands educational status, husbands occupation, wealth status, distance from the health facility, waiting time to get services, planning to pregnancy, age at first pregnancy, previous ANC use, Previous PNC use, adverse pregnancy experience, women's knowledge of preconception care, and attitude on preconception care were determinants of preconception service utilization.Preconception care component utilization was lower as compare with recommended service with different disparities. Multipurpose tailored strategies which incorporate a woman with no formal education, poor knwledge on preconception care,never take maternal services previously and distant from health facility could improve preconception care service utilization. Advocative strategies on preconception care component and planning pregnancy may elicite more women to use the services of preconception care."

Data from March 1, 2020 to February 5, 2022 were incorporated into panel model. The states were clustered by the k-means method. In addition to discussing the whole time period, we also took multiple events nodes into account and analyzed the data in different time periods respectively by panel linear regression method. In addition, influence of cluster grouping and different incubation periods were been discussed. Non-segmented analysis showed the rate of people staying at home and the vaccination dose per capita were significantly negatively correlated with the daily incidence rate, while the number of long-distance trips was positively correlated. Weather indicators also had a negative effect to a certain extent. Most segmental results support the above view. The vaccination dose per capita was unsurprisingly proved to be the most significant factor especially for epidemic dominated by Omicron strains. 7-day was a more robust incubation period with the best model fit while weather had different effects on the epidemic spread in different time period. The implementation of prevention behaviors and the promotion of vaccination may have a successful control effect on COVID-19, including variants' epidemic such as Omicron. The spread of COVID-19 also might be associated with weather, albeit to a lesser extent."

Competing in an ultramarathon event is physiologically taxing on the human body, and it should not be surprising that not all individuals who enroll for an event ultimately finish. While many factors can contribute to this phenomenon, it is likely that nutritional and hydration strategies play a large role between finishing and not finishing an ultramarathon. No published paper has systematically reviewed the effects of nutritional and hydration strategies during ultramarathon events between finishers and non-finishers. This paper details our intended protocol with the following steps that create the flow of the systematic review: 1) Determine the review question and Participant, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Study Design (PICOS) criteria; 2) Create inclusion and exclusion criteria; 3) Create and follow a search strategy; 4) Document sources that are included and excluded according to the pre-determined eligibility criteria; 5) Assess final sources for risk of bias; 6) Extract pertinent data from final full-text articles and synthesize the information; and 7) Disseminate findings of the systematic review."

https://openalex.org/W4292385795,"Economic growth becomes a critical component in the development of every country since it enhances living standards and other related concerns while eliminating poverty. As a developing country, Sri Lanka must place more emphasis to achieve sustainable economic growth. In addition, various factors have positive and negative impacts on economy’s growth. As such, the specific goals of any economy are to sustain long-term economic growth and low inflation. As a result, generally, high inflation is destructive for an economy and low inflation is beneficial. Therefore, it is worth investigating the impact of inflation on economic growth concerning a stable inflation level. This study examines the impact of inflation on economic growth in Sri Lanka by employing the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag model as the estimation technique. Furthermore, the findings illustrate a negative relationship between inflation and economic growth in the short run; when inflation increases by 1%, economic growth decreases by United States Dollar (USD) 3,427.94 million and long run economic growth declines by 107,263.8 million USD. Subsequently, with the current economic reality of Sri Lanka, the macroeconomic policies should be adaptable to maintain the stability of the inflation rate for a sustainable economy."
https://openalex.org/W4292385796,"Background With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown approach that was adopted all over the world, conducting assessments while maintaining integrity became a big challenge. This article aims at sharing the experience of conducting an online assessment with the academic community and to assess its effectiveness from both examiners’ and students’ perspectives. Methods An online assessment was carried out for the final year medical students of Hawler Medical University/Iraq during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic, June 2020. Then, an online questionnaire was sent to a sample of 61 examiners and 108 students who have been involved in evaluating the mentioned assessment process. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the mean ranks of the overall satisfaction scores between categories of the students and examiners. Categorical data were summarized and presented as frequencies and percentages. Results The response rates among examiners and students were 69.4% and 88.5% respectively. The majority of the examiners were generally satisfied with the online examination process compared to only around a third of the students. However, both examiners and students agreed that online examination was not suitable for assessing the physical examination skills. Conclusion The online assessment can be considered a good alternative and acceptable method for medical students’ assessment in unpredicted emergencies, yet it was not applicable in testing physical examination skills."

The purpose of this study is to establish the magnitude of anemia and to determine anemia preventive practices carried out by mothers with children under five years of age in the Kadjebi District of the Volta region of Ghana. Methods This purposive sampling study involved women of reproductive age with children less than five years of age from Saint Mary Theresa Hospital and nurses practicing in the pediatric ward of the hospital. A questionnaire and interview guide were administered respectively, and the data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21. Results A total of 150 participants were studied; among which analysis of anemia was carried out on 129 women whose children had their hemoglobin levels checked and recorded in the laboratory. Hemoglobin levels recorded for these children showed that 85.3% were anemic, even though 93.8% of the mothers had been given iron supplements during their pregnancy. Furthermore, anemia prevention practices comprised whether the child had been given any anti-malaria prophylaxis (98.4% denied), if the child had been dewormed in the last three months (89.9% denied), whether the child was given iron supplements in the last three months (59.7% denied), if the child had been given vitamin supplements in the last three months (24.0% denied). Conclusion Most of the children in the study were anemic.

https://openalex.org/W4292385863,"Objectives Sri Lanka is a developing country where the majority of households still rely on firewood for cooking. Furthermore, the prevalence of anemia among reproductive-aged women is of moderate public health importance, according the classification of World Health Organization. Despite the researchers’ ongoing efforts to investigate a link between solid fuel smoke exposure and anemia, the veracity of their findings remains uncertain. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between biomass fuel smoke exposure and anemia in non-pregnant reproductive-aged women in Sri Lanka. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 382 non-pregnant reproductive-aged (15 to 49 years) women in Central Province, Sri Lanka. Data was collected using a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire, and exposure was assessed using a breath carbon monoxide monitor. Drabkin’s cynomethhemoglobin technique was used to determine blood hemoglobin concentration. Results The overall prevalence of anemia was 36.1%. The logistic regression model revealed no effect of cooking fuel type on anemic or non-anemic status after adjusting for potential confounding factors (p &gt; 0.05). The multivariate regression analysis also discovered that cooking fuel type had no effect on women’s blood hemoglobin concentration. Conclusions The study results suggest no impact of solid fuel smoke exposure on anemia among non-pregnant, reproductive-aged women. Larger scale prospective cohort studies are recommended. The reasons behind the high prevalence of anemia among reproductive-aged women should be further investigated, and corrective measures should be implemented urgently."
https://openalex.org/W4292385996,"Background Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is an important public health issue in at least 83 countries, including Iran. Individuals’ behavior modification is believed to be one of the best ways for CL prevention. However, no comprehensive questionnaires have been psychoanalyzed for identification of CL prevention behaviors and its numerous associated factors, as well as the impact of educational messages. Thus, the present study was conducted to develop and psychometrically assess CL prevention behaviors questionnaire in female students. Methods The present study was performed from October 2020 to May 2021 by developing a preliminary questionnaire based on integration of Cultural Model and Extended Parallel Process Model. The questionnaire was completed online by 460 adolescent female students living in endemic areas of Isfahan, Iran. Exploratory factor analysis was performed using SPSS 24 to ensure the construct validity. Internal reliability was assessed via Cronbach’s alpha and external reliability was determined using the test-retest method based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) index. Results The first version of the questionnaire contains 110 items, out of which 82 remained according to content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI) criteria. Afterwards, 11 items were removed due to low factor load in the construct validity process using the factor analysis technique. Ultimately, a 71-items questionnaire was developed and 12 factors were extracted from it. According to Cronbach’s alpha index, the internal reliability for the questionnaire was 0.877 and the ICC index calculated the external reliability as 0.833. Conclusions Integration of a Cultural Model with individual model was used for the first time to measure the factors related to CL prevention behaviors in this questionnaire; owing to the strength of the factor structure and appropriate psychometric properties, the questionnaire is applicable in the evaluation process of educational interventions concerning CL prevention, especially in female students."

While the ATP hydrolysis mechanism of Dengue and Zika viruses NS3H has been extensively studied, little is known in the case of the tick-borne encephalitis virus NS3H. We demonstrate that ssRNA binds with nanomolar affinity to NS3H and strongly stimulates the ATP hydrolysis cycle, whereas ssDNA binds only weakly and inhibits ATPase activity in a noncompetitive manner. Thus, NS3H is an RNA-specific helicase, whereas DNA might act as an allosteric inhibitor. Using modeling, we explored plausible allosteric mechanisms by which ssDNA inhibits the ATPase via nonspecific binding in the vicinity of the active site and ATP repositioning. We captured several structural snapshots of key ATP hydrolysis stages using X-ray crystallography. One intermediate, in which the inorganic phosphate and ADP remained trapped inside the ATPase site after hydrolysis, suggests that inorganic phosphate release is the rate-limiting step. Using structure-guided modeling and molecular dynamics simulation, we identified putative RNA-binding residues and observed that the opening and closing of the ATP-binding site modulates RNA affinity. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved RNA-binding residues revealed that the allosteric activation of ATPase activity is primarily communicated via an arginine residue in domain 1. In summary, we characterized conformational changes associated with modulating RNA affinity and mapped allosteric communication between RNA-binding groove and ATPase site of tick-borne encephalitis virus helicase.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus from the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. The virus is neurotropic and causes tick-borne encephalitis, which affects primarily adult population within European and North-Eastern Asian countries (1Beauté J. Spiteri G. Warns-Petit E. Zeller H. Tick-borne encephalitis in Europe, 2012 to 2016.Euro. Surveill. 2018; 23: 1800201Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). While TBEV vaccines are available, because of the lack of targeted campaigns, the actual vaccination coverage is low even in high-risk areas. There is currently no specific treatment available (2Füzik T. Formanová P. Růžek D. Yoshii K. Niedrig M. Plevka P.

Res. 2019; 164: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, to develop antivirals against TBEV, it is essential to understand the structure and function of the key viral enzymes that are involved in the replication.TBEV encodes three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins. Among the NS proteins, NS3 is a multifunctional protein that comprises two functional domains: a protease and a helicase. The chymotrypsin-like serine protease is located with the N-terminal region (172 amino acids) and is responsible for viral polyprotein processing. This domain is connected by a short flexible linker to the C-terminal helicase domain (NS3H, 434 amino acids), which exhibits several activities: NTPase, RNA helicase, and RNA 5′-triphosphatase. The RNA helicase activity uses energy from NTP hydrolysis for unwinding of dsRNA replication intermediates, whereas RNA 5′-triphosphatase removes the terminal γ-phosphate from the 5′-triphosphate end of the positive-sense ssRNA before mRNA capping by the methyl transferase domain of NS5 protein (4Brand C.

Acta Proteins Proteom. 2020; 1868140441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) provided further insight into conformational changes associated with RNA binding and stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis, which was considered the rate-limiting step. In contrast, inorganic phosphate (Pi) release has been established as the rate-limiting step for hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase that is considered a mechanistic model system for viral SF2 (19Wang Q. Arnold J.J. Uchida A. Raney K.D. Cameron C.E. Phosphate release contributes to the rate-limiting step for unwinding by an RNA helicase.Nucl. Acids Res. 2010; 38: 1312-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, it remains to be seen whether Pi release or the hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step and whether the coupling and the associated allosteric changes are conserved among all SF2 helicases and between helicases from different flaviviruses.Here, we biochemically characterized NS3H from TBEV and obtained structures of key intermediates along the ATPase cycle (nucleotide-free, apo; ADP-; adenylyl-imidodiphosphate, AMPPNP-; and hydrolysis product, ADP–Pi-bound NS3H). While the overall structure of the TBEV NS3H is closely related to that of DENV and ZIKV, structural variation is observed in different nucleotide states. Trapping of ATP hydrolysis products within the crystal and the negligible basal activity (i.e., in the absence of RNA) suggest that the ATPase rate-limiting step is phosphate release, which is allosterically stimulated by RNA. Indeed, ssRNA binds to NS3H with nanomolar affinity and stimulates its ATPase activity, whereas ssDNA inhibits the ATPase activity without directly competing with RNA. We explored ssRNA binding by modeling and MD simulations and identified conserved RNA-binding residues. We examined the allosteric roles of these residues by site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays. These results and simulations suggest that RNA binding is relayed to the ATPase active site via a conserved residue within domain 1, whereas RNA affinity is modulated by conformational changes associated with opening and closing of the ATP-binding cleft.Results and discussionRNA-stimulated NTPase activity of recombinant NS3H is inhibited by DNAThe recombinant NS3H protein fused with N-terminal 10X-histidine tag was purified to homogeneity (Fig. S1). To assess the ATPase activity of NS3H, a phosphate release assay was performed in the absence and presence of nucleic acids, ssRNA or ssDNA. ATPase activity of NS3H was strongly dependent on the presence of RNA substrate, poly(A), whereas the basal ATPase activity was negligible at the same protein concentration (Fig. 1A). NS3H hydrolyzed all four NTP substrates with comparable turnover (Fig. 1B). This demonstrated that NS3H exhibits little specificity for different NTP substrates, as shown previously for DENV helicase (20Benarroch D. Selisko B. Locatelli G.A. Maga G. Romette J.L. Canard B. The RNA helicase, nucleotide 5'-triphosphatase, and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activities of Dengue virus protein NS3 are Mg2+-dependent and require a functional Walker B motif in the helicase catalytic core.Virology. 2004; 328: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Basic steady-state kinetic parameters for ATP were determined in the presence of poly(A) (Fig. 1C). The Michaelis–Menten constant Km = 125 ± 15 μM and turnover kcat = 8.8 ± 0.2 s−1 of NS3H are similar to those of DENV helicase in the presence of short 5′-UTR RNA fragment (15Swarbrick C.M.D. Basavannacharya C. Chan K.W.K. Chan S.A. Singh D. Wei N. et al.NS3 helicase from dengue virus specifically recognizes viral RNA sequence to ensure optimal replication.Nucl. Acids Res. 2017; 45: 12904-12920Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).While ssDNA fails to stimulate ATPase activity significantly (Fig. 1A), it can partially inhibit it in a dose-dependent manner at micromolar concentrations (Fig. 1D). However, these micromolar concentrations are much higher than the affinity for ssRNA (apparent KD = 49.7 ± 9.3 nM), which was determined by fluorescence anisotropy–based binding assay (Fig. 1E). Using the same approach, we observed that ssDNA partially competes with RNA binding at ∼20-fold molar excess of apparent KD for ssRNA substrate. Longer ssDNAs inhibited RNA binding more effectively (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the longer DNA might bind to several weak nonspecific binding sites. Altogether, these results indicate that the binding of the helicase to RNA substrate stimulates ATP hydrolysis, and DNA may act as a noncompetitive inhibitor via nonspecific binding. This specificity of NS3H toward RNA substrate is different from HCV helicase (21Gwack Y. Kim D.W. Han J.H. Choe J. DNA helicase activity of the hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 3.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and DENV helicase (22Wang C.C. Huang Z.S. Chiang P.L. Chen C.T. Wu H.N.

The refined model of apoNS3H (residues 173–621) is complete except for an N-terminal 10X-histidine tag region derived from the pET-19b vector together with a short flexible linker region between protease and helicase domains of NS3 (residues E173–Q181) and two nonconserved disordered loop regions (residues P251–G259 and T502–P506). Nonprotein positive 2Fo–Fc electron density was attributed to water molecules. The resulting 3D protein structure shows overall similarity with already published helicase structures of other flaviviruses (10Fang J. Jing X. Lu G. Xu Y. Gong P.

Based on these structures, NS3H seems to follow a common mechanism of ATP hydrolysis cycle in flaviviruses (11Luo D. Xu T. Watson R.P. Scherer-Becker D. Sampath A.

Mu Z. Zhang T. et al.Mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by the Zika virus helicase.FASEB J. 2018; 32: 5250-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Here, the hydrolysis cycle is represented by four states: (i) a prehydrolysis, AMPPNP–Mn2+-bound state representing the binding of ATP molecule to the helicase; (ii) a post-hydrolysis intermediate, ADP–Pi–Mn2+-bound state; (iii) a product dissociation intermediate with Pi released and ADP–Mn2+ are still bound to the protein; and (iv) nucleotide-free (apo) product release state, which is ready to bind ATP.The AMPPNP–Mn2+- and ADP–Mn2+-bound NS3H structures were obtained via cocrystallization of apoNS3H with corresponding nucleotides, whereas the ADP–Pi–Mn2+ complex was obtained as a result of ATP hydrolysis during crystallization, that is, Pi remained trapped within the structure. The nucleotide complexes crystallize in P41212 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit similar to the apoNS3H (Table 1). Hence, structural changes seen in the ternary complexes are not likely because of differences in crystal contacts. Several localized conformational changes within individual domains were observed (Fig. 3A) when the nucleotide complexes were compared with apoNS3H. Upon nucleotide and divalent ion (Mn2+) binding, the P-loop swings toward the bound nucleotide (Fig. 3B) with an inward orientation of K205 side chain to coordinate the phosphate group (Fig. 4). In AMPPNP–Mn2+ and ADP–Pi–Mn2+ complexes, the tip of α7 helix moves away from the relative position in apoNS3H (Fig. 3B) to accommodate γ-phosphate. This motion is absent in the ADP–Mn2+ structure.Figure 3Nucleotide-bound complexes. A, superposition of apo and ternary NS3H structures showing global protein conformation.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains a major cause of end stage renal disease. Multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including alteration of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play a significant role mediating the cellular transcriptional activities. We have previously shown that lncRNA ANRIL may mediate diabetes associated molecular, functional and structural abnormalities in DN. Here we explored downstream mechanisms of ANRIL alteration in DN.We used renal cortical tissues from ANRIL knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice, with or without streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetes for RNA sequencing. The differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR and DESeq2 computational methods. KEGG and Reactome pathway analyses and network analyses using STRING and IPA were subsequently performed.Diabetic animals showed hyperglycemia, reduced body weight gain, polyuria and increased urinary albumin. Both albuminuria and polyuria were corrected in the KO diabetic mice. RNA analyses showed Diabetes induced alterations of a large number of transcripts in the wild type (WT) animals. ANRIL knockout (KO) prevented a large number of such alterations. The altered transcripts include metabolic pathways, apoptosis, extracellular matrix protein synthesis and degradation, NFKB related pathways, AGE-RAGE interaction pathways etc. ANRIL KO prevented majority of these pathways.These findings suggest that as ANRIL regulates a large number of molecules of pathogenetic significance, it may potentially be a drug target for DN and other chronic diabetic complications."
https://openalex.org/W4292366165,"This study aimed to reveal the impact of the severe drying-wetting process on the safety and stability of high-altitude dumps. Numerical calculations were conducted for the open mining dump of limestone mines for cement in high-altitude mining areas. The distribution law equation of the matric suction and the shear strength equation were imported for unsaturated soil based on the unsaturated-saturated seepage theory. Therefore, the evolution characteristics of the unsaturated-saturated seepage field and the stability of the dump were studied under severe drying-wetting. The results indicated the following rules: As the intensity of the wetting-drying alternation increased, the surface soil on the dump changed from an unsaturated to a saturated state, the matric suction continued to decrease until it reached zero, the shear strength decreased, and the unsaturated area shrank. The dump slipped under the influence of the drying-wetting alternation, the sliding area was the dump itself, and developed to the deep layer as the intensity of the drying-wetting alternation strengthened. The cumulative settlement value of the dump increased with time and eventually stabilized, and the maximum accumulative settlement value calculated by simulation was in good agreement with the actual monitoring value. The safety factor decreased as the intensity of the drying-wetting alternation increased."

Therefore, we performed this population-based study to determine whether, in adults, COPD is a risk factor for epiglottitis.In this retrospective matched-cohort study, data obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were analyzed. We identified all patients newly diagnosed as having COPD in 2000-2011 and performed frequency matching and propensity-score matching for every patient with COPD individually to another patient without a COPD diagnosis. We used epiglottitis occurrence as the study endpoint, and we investigated the hazard ratio of epiglottitis by using the Cox proportional hazards model after adjustment for potential confounders.In the frequency matching, the cumulative epiglottitis incidence was significantly higher (p = 0.005) in the COPD cohort. According to the adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, COPD exhibited a significant association with elevated epiglottitis incidence (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-2.70, p = 0.009). Similar trend was observed in the propensity-score matching analysis (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.99-2.29, p = 0.057). Our subgroup analysis revealed COPD to be an epiglottitis risk factor in male patients and those aged 40-64 years.This is the first nationwide matched-cohort research to examine the association of COPD with epiglottitis. Our results revealed that COPD may be a potential risk factor for epiglottitis; thus, clinicians should be mindful of the potential increased risk of epiglottitis following COPD."

https://openalex.org/W4292385253,"Climate warming accelerates the hydrological cycle, especially in high-latitude and high-altitude areas. The increase in temperature will increase the amount of snow and glacier melting and change the runoff, which will affect the operations of cascade reservoirs significantly. Therefore, taking the upper reaches of the Yellow River with an alpine climate as an example, we propose an improved SIMHYD-SNOW, which considers the snowmelt runoff process. The impacts of climate changes on the runoff process were revealed based on the SIMHYD-SNOW model using the precipitation and temperature data predicted by the SDSM model. A model for the maximum power generation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was constructed to explore the impacts of climate changes on the inter-annual and intra-annual hydropower generation of the cascade reservoirs at different periods in the future. The results show that climate change has changed the spatial and temporal allocation of water resources in this area. The future runoff will decrease during the flood period (July to September) but increase significantly during the non-flood period. The inter-annual and intra-annual hydropower generation under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario is significantly lower than the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 climate change scenarios, and as the CO 2 emission concentration increases, this gap increases significantly. This study can provide technical references for the precise formulation of water resources management under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4292385650,"Background Upfront docetaxel or novel hormonal agents (NHA) such as abiraterone and enzalutamide have become the standard of care for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). We evaluated real-world management of patients treated with these agents at a single center. Patients and methods Patients with de novo mHSPC treated with upfront docetaxel or an NHA between January 2014 and April 2019 at Mount Sinai Health System were included. We evaluated time to next treatment (TTNT), PSA progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after initial treatment with these drugs. Kaplan Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis. We additionally assessed the prognostic value of post-treatment PSA. Results We identified 94 de novo mHSPC patients; 52 and 42 treated with upfront docetaxel and NHAs, respectively. NHAs were associated with a median TTNT of 20.7 months compared to 10.1 months with docetaxel (log-rank p = 0.023). We also observed median PSA PFS of 19 months for NHAs and 13.2 months for docetaxel (p = 0.069). However, OS between the two treatment groups was unchanged. Among docetaxel treated patients, TTNT was shorter among those with high metastasis burden (9.63 vs 25.5 months, p = 0.026) which was not observed among NHA treated patients (25.1 vs 20.7 months, p = 0.79). Regardless of treatment, lower post-treatment PSA levels were associated with improved TTNT (58.95 vs. 11.57 vs. 9.4 months for PSA ≤0.2, 0.2–0.4, &gt;0.4ng/ml, respectively; p&lt;0.001) Conclusion Real world data demonstrated a shorter duration of treatment with docetaxel than NHAs, reflecting the time-limited nature of docetaxel regimens compared to the treat-till-progression approach of NHAs. While TTNT was generally longer for NHAs than docetaxel, some docetaxel-treated patients achieved significant periods of time off treatment. In addition, the depth of PSA response following combination treatment may hold prognostic value for mHSPC outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4292385651,"Research on the occurrence and the final size of wildland fires typically models these two events as two separate processes. In this work, we develop and apply a compound process framework for jointly modelling the frequency and the severity of wildland fires. Separate modelling structures for the frequency and the size of fires are linked through a shared random effect. This allows us to fit an appropriate model for frequency and an appropriate model for size of fires while still having a method to estimate the direction and strength of the relationship (e.g., whether days with more fires are associated with days with large fires). The joint estimation of this random effect shares information between the models without assuming a causal structure. We explore spatial and temporal autocorrelation of the random effects to identify additional variation not explained by the inclusion of weather related covariates. The dependence between frequency and size of lightning-caused fires is found to be negative, indicating that an increase in the number of expected fires is associated with a decrease in the expected size of those fires, possibly due to the rainy conditions necessary for an increase in lightning. Person-caused fires were found to be positively dependent, possibly due to dry weather increasing human activity as well as the amount of dry few. For a test for independence, we perform a power study and find that simply checking whether zero is in the credible interval of the posterior of the linking parameter is as powerful as more complicated tests."

However screening for fusions in routinely processed tissue samples is constrained due to degradation of nucleic acid as a result of formalin fixation., To investigate the clinical utility of semiconductor sequencing optimised for detection of actionable fusion transcripts in formalin fixed samples, we have undertaken an analysis of test trending data generated by a clinically validated next generation sequencing platform designed to capture 867 of the most clinically relevant druggable driver-partner oncogenic fusions. Here we show across a real-life cohort of 1112 patients with solid tumours that actionable fusions occur at high frequency (7.4%) with linkage to a wide range of targeted therapy protocols including seven fusion-drug matches with FDA/EMA approval and/or NCCN/ESMO recommendations and 80 clinical trials. The more prevalent actionable fusions identified were independent of tumour type in keeping with signalling via evolutionary conserved RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, PLCy/PKC and JAK/STAT pathways. Taken together our data indicates that semiconductor sequencing for detection of actionable fusions can be integrated into routine diagnostic pathology workflows enabling the identification of personalised treatment options that have potential to improve clinical cancer management across many tumour types."
https://openalex.org/W4292386014,"Objective To describe a study protocol for investigating the in vivo dose-response relationship between ambulatory load magnitude and mechanosensitive blood markers of articular cartilage, the influence of age, cartilage tissue health and presence of inflammation on this relationship, and its ability to predict changes in articular cartilage quality and morphology within 2 years. Design Prospective experimental multimodal (clinical, biomechanical, biological) data collection under walking stress and three different load conditions varied in a randomized crossover design. Experimental protocol At baseline, equal numbers of healthy and anterior cruciate ligament injured participants aged 20–30 or 40–60 years will be assessed clinically and complete questionnaires regarding their knee health. Biomechanical parameters (joint kinetics, joint kinematics, and surface electromyography) will be recorded while performing different tasks including overground and treadmill walking, single leg balance and hopping tasks. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of both of knees will be obtained. On separate stress test days, participants will perform a 30-minute walking stress with either reduced (80% body weight (BW)), normal (100%BW) or increased (120%BW) load. Serum blood samples will be taken immediately before, immediately after, 30, 120 and 210 minutes after the walking stress. Concentration of articular cartilage blood biomarkers will be assessed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. At 24-month follow-up, participants will be again assessed clinically, undergo an MRI, complete questionnaires, and have a blood sample taken. Conclusion The study design provides a standardized set up that allows to better understand the influence of ambulatory load on articular cartilage biomarkers and thereby extend current knowledge on in vivo cartilage metabolism and mechanosensitivity. Further, this study will help to elucidate the prognostic value of the load-induced cartilage biomarker response for early articular cartilage degeneration. Trial registration The protocol was approved by the regional ethics committee and has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04128566 )."
https://openalex.org/W4292386109,"Animals may select habitat to maximize the benefits of foraging on growth and reproduction, while balancing competing factors like the risk of predation or mortality from other sources. Variation in the distribution of food resources may lead animals to forage at times or in places that carry greater predation risk, with individuals in poor quality habitats expected to take greater risks while foraging. We studied Mojave desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) in habitats with variable forage availability to determine if risk aversion in their selection of habitat relative was related to abundance of forage. As a measure of risk, we examined tortoise surface activity and mortality. We also compared tortoise body size and body condition between habitats with ample forage plants and those with less forage plants. Tortoises from low forage habitats selected areas where more annual plants were nutritious herbaceous flowering plants but did not favor areas of greater perennial shrub cover that could shelter them or their burrows. In contrast, tortoises occupying high forage habitats showed no preference for forage characteristics, but used burrows associated with more abundant and larger perennial shrubs. Tortoises in high forage habitats were larger and active above ground more often but did not have better body condition. Mortality was four times higher for females occupying low forage habitat than those in high forage habitat. Our results are consistent with the idea that tortoises may minimize mortality risk where food resources are high, but may accept some tradeoff of greater mortality risk in order to forage optimally when food resources are limiting."

Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the C634R mutation causes ligand-independent dimerization of the RET ECD, revealing an unusual tail-to-tail conformation that is distinct from the ligand-induced signaling dimer of WT RET. Additionally, we show that the RETC634R ECD dimer can form complexes with at least two of the canonical RET ligands and that these complexes form very different structures than WT RET ECD upon ligand binding. In conclusion, this structural analysis of cysteine-mutant RET ECD suggests a potential key mechanism of cancer induction in MEN2A, both in the absence and presence of its native ligands, and may offer new targets for therapeutic intervention."
