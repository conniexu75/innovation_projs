https://openalex.org/W2064763329,"During olfactory learning in fruit flies, dopaminergic neurons assign value to odor representations in the mushroom body Kenyon cells. Here we identify a class of downstream glutamatergic mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) called M4/6, or MBON-β2β'2a, MBON-β'2mp, and MBON-γ5β'2a, whose dendritic fields overlap with dopaminergic neuron projections in the tips of the β, β', and γ lobes. This anatomy and their odor tuning suggests that M4/6 neurons pool odor-driven Kenyon cell synaptic outputs. Like that of mushroom body neurons, M4/6 output is required for expression of appetitive and aversive memory performance. Moreover, appetitive and aversive olfactory conditioning bidirectionally alters the relative odor-drive of M4β' neurons (MBON-β'2mp). Direct block of M4/6 neurons in naive flies mimics appetitive conditioning, being sufficient to convert odor-driven avoidance into approach, while optogenetically activating these neurons induces avoidance behavior. We therefore propose that drive to the M4/6 neurons reflects odor-directed behavioral choice."

Thus, before ASD diagnoses and outcome become clinically clear, distinct functional neuroimaging phenotypes are already present that can shed insight on an ASD toddler’s later outcome. There is an absence of neurobiological explanations for why infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can have strikingly different clinical outcomes. One primary reason for this absence is the large degree of heterogeneity manifested in both the early clinical phenotype and in the likely underlying causes for different subtypes of autism (Geschwind and Levitt, 2007Geschwind D.H. Levitt P. Autism spectrum disorders: developmental disconnection syndromes.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Underscoring phenotypic behavioral heterogeneity in early development, there is no better example than variability in early language development (Anderson et al., 2007Anderson D.K. Lord C. Risi S. DiLavore P.S. Shulman C. Thurm A. Welch K. Pickles A. Patterns of growth in verbal abilities among children with autism spectrum disorder.J. Consult. Clin.

Psychiatry. 2014; 55: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Some individuals with ASD are minimally verbal throughout life and display high levels of symptom severity and poor clinical outcome (Tager-Flusberg and Kasari, 2013Tager-Flusberg H. Kasari C. Minimally verbal school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder: the neglected end of the spectrum.Autism Res. 2013; 6: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In contrast, others display delayed or typical early language development and may have relatively more positive clinical outcome (Fein et al., 2013Fein D. Barton M. Eigsti I.M. Kelley E. Naigles L. Schultz R.T. Stevens M. Helt M. Orinstein A. Rosenthal M. et al.Optimal outcome in individuals with a history of autism.J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry. 2013; 54: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The neurodevelopmental bases for this variability in clinical outcomes are unknown. Differences in treatment quantity have not accounted for such variability. For example, in one of the first studies of applied behavioral analysis (ABA) intervention where treatment quantity and type were largely standardized across participants, 50% of individuals achieved typical school placement and IQ scores within the normal range following treatment, while the remainder did not (Lovaas, 1987Lovaas O.I. Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children.J. Consult. Clin. Psychol. 1987; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, variable response to treatment has been reported for all evidence-based approaches available for ASD children (Bacon et al., 2014Bacon E.C. Dufek S. Schreibman L. Stahmer A.C. Pierce K. Courchesne E. Measuring outcome in an early intervention program for toddlers with autism spectrum disorder: use of a curriculum-based assessment.Autism Res. Treat. 2014; 2014: 964704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While pre-treatment language (Perry et al., 2011Perry A. Cummings A. Geier J.D. Freeman N.L. Hughes S. Managhan T. Reitzel J. Williams J. Predictors of outcome for children receiving intensive behavioral intervention in a large, community-based program.Res. Autism Spectr. Disord. 2011; 5: 592-603Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and other nonverbal cognitive abilities (McEachin et al., 1993McEachin J.J. Smith T. Lovaas O.I. Long-term outcome for children with autism who received early intensive behavioral treatment.Am. J. Ment. Retard. 1993; 97 (discussion 373–391): 359-372PubMed Google Scholar) are often predictors of treatment success, this relationship is not always straightforward (Eapen et al., 2013Eapen V. Crnčec R.

Given both the widespread heterogeneity in early language development (Anderson et al., 2007Anderson D.K. Lord C. Risi S. DiLavore P.S. Shulman C. Thurm A. Welch K. Pickles A.

Psychiatry. 1992; 33: 489-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it is important for the field to develop ways in which the ASD population could be stratified into plausible and clinically relevant neurodevelopmental subtypes. Taking this stratification approach would help to accelerate the translational process from discovery of novel biological markers to ways in which better treatments could be developed and individualized to specific phenotypes (Kapur et al., 2012Kapur S. Phillips A.G. Insel T.R. Why has it taken so long for biological psychiatry to develop clinical tests and what to do about it?.Mol. Psychiatry. 2012; 17: 1174-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). No developmental studies of biomarkers for early language heterogeneity in ASD have been designed to address this major issue. Existing natural sleep fMRI studies have found that 2- to 3-year-old ASD toddlers as a whole differ on average from TD toddlers in atypical speech-related lateralization of superior temporal cortex (Eyler et al., 2012Eyler L.T. Pierce K. Courchesne E. A failure of left temporal cortex to specialize for language is an early emerging and fundamental property of autism.Brain. 2012; 135: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Redcay and Courchesne, 2008Redcay E.

Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and reduced inter-hemispheric synchrony (Dinstein et al., 2011Dinstein I. Pierce K. Eyler L. Solso S. Malach R. Behrmann M. Courchesne E. Disrupted neural synchronization in toddlers with autism.Neuron. 2011; 70: 1218-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). While these early studies established the potential power of natural sleep fMRI to pinpoint early speech-related processing differences in superior temporal cortical regions, they fall short in addressing critical questions about heterogeneity within ASD with regard to early language development and outcome. That is, past studies have not employed analyses and designs capable of detecting different neural subtypes within ASD that underlie and help explain differing developmental language trajectories and outcomes. Past studies have also not studied predictive power at the individual level with respect to prognosis and have not systematically studied how such individual level variation in large-scale speech-related neural systems response varies with an individual’s level of change in early developing language ability. Finally, existing work has not yet tested whether any such neurofunctional abnormalities within ASD are specific to an ASD subtype or whether they are shared by a non-ASD clinical comparison group with significant early language or general developmental delays. In the present study, we have gone further to address each of these critical questions. We combined (1) prospective fMRI measurement of neural systems response to speech during our natural sleep fMRI language paradigm (Eyler et al., 2012Eyler L.T. Pierce K. Courchesne E. A failure of left temporal cortex to specialize for language is an early emerging and fundamental property of autism.Brain. 2012; 135: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Redcay and Courchesne, 2008Redcay E.

Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) at the earliest ages at which risk for ASD can be clinically detected in the general pediatric population with (2) contemporaneous and comprehensive longitudinal diagnostic and clinical assessments to evaluate diagnostic outcome and characterize language level by 3–4 years of age. Infants and toddlers were recruited using a combination of the one-year well-baby check-up approach (Pierce et al., 2011Pierce K. Carter C. Weinfeld M. Desmond J. Hazin R. Bjork R. Gallagher N. Detecting, studying, and treating autism early: the one-year well-baby check-up approach.J. Pediatr. 2011; 159 (e1–e6): 458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as well as community referral. The natural sleep fMRI language paradigm employed in this study was identical to that used in our previously published studies (Eyler et al., 2012Eyler L.T. Pierce K. Courchesne E. A failure of left temporal cortex to specialize for language is an early emerging and fundamental property of autism.Brain. 2012; 135: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Redcay and Courchesne, 2008Redcay E.

Psychiatry. 2008; 64: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and used three types of stimuli to reduce habituation (i.e., complex forward speech, simple forward speech, and backward speech) and rest blocks (more information on the procedure for sleep-fMRI scanning as well as data acquisition and analysis details can be found in the Supplemental Information). Cohorts of age- and sex-matched infants and toddlers (aged 12–48 months) with ASD (n = 60), non-ASD language/developmentally delayed individuals (LD/DD; n = 19), and typically developing individuals (TD; n = 24) participated. Early language development was characterized longitudinally approximately every 6 months from clinical intake, and outcome was determined from a follow-up assessment in early childhood, on average 1 year after the original fMRI scanning session. Within the ASD group, we identified individuals with poor language outcome in early childhood (“ASD Poor”; n = 24) who had outcome receptive (RL) and expressive (EL) language T-scores on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning that were below 1 SD of the norm (i.e., T < 40). A second subgroup was identified that had relatively better language outcome in early childhood (“ASD Good”; n = 36) with EL or RL scores at outcomes greater than 1 SD below the norm (i.e., T ≥ 40). See Table S1 and Supplemental Information for more on characterization of the sample. Longitudinal assessments of language, non-verbal, and autism symptom development were made approximately every 6 months from initial clinical intake to an individual’s last outcome assessment. Developmental trajectories were characterized at the group level after taking into account individual-level effects using linear mixed-effect models. Across T-scores for Mullen EL and RL subscales, we observed null or trend-level main effects for Age (EL: F = 0.0803, p = 0.77; RL: F = 3.38, p = 0.06), but found highly significant main effects of Group (EL: F = 39.01, p < 0.0001; RL: F = 26.72, p < 0.0001) and significant or trend-level Group × Age interactions (EL: F = 8.43, p = 0.0042; RL: F = 3.71, p = 0.055). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons showed that the main effects of Group were driven by differentiation on every pairwise comparison, where a gradient across groups was observed of TD with the best language scores, followed by ASD Good, LD/DD, and ASD Poor. An exception to this was similar RL levels for LD/DD and ASD Good. For both EL and RL, the Group × Age interactions were solely driven by ASD Poor’s declining trajectory differing from all other groups, though the statistical significance for RL was at a nominally significant level (e.g., p < 0.02) (Table S2, Figures 1A and 1B ). Because we are using Mullen T-scores, declining trajectories in ASD Poor should be interpreted as individuals falling further and further behind age-appropriate norms, rather than as loss of skills over development. In terms of trajectories of autism symptom severity measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), we found a main effect of Group (F = 11.35, p = 0.0011) but no main effect of Age (F = 0.536, p = 0.46) or Group × Age interaction (F = 1.75, p = 0.18). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons showed that all groups were differentiated from each other, with a gradient of ASD Poor with the most elevated ADOS scores, followed by ASD Good, LD/DD, and TD. Furthermore, the LD/DD group showed a decreasing trajectory over time, and this decreasing slope was significantly different from all other groups, where the trajectories were relatively stable or slightly increasing over time (Table S2, Figure 1D). Similar types of results were also observed on the non-verbal subscales of the Mullen (i.e., visual reception, fine motor) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, a parental clinical interview measure of abilities in everyday settings (Figure 1C, Table S2, Figure S1). This is expected, given past research documenting correlations between early developmental clinical assessment measures for autism such as the Mullen, Vineland, and ADOS (Ellis Weismer et al., 2010Ellis Weismer S. Lord C. Esler A. Early language patterns of toddlers on the autism spectrum compared to toddlers with developmental delay.J. Autism Dev. Disord. 2010; 40: 1259-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study we replicated this correlational structure at intake and outcome time points (Figure S2). Furthermore, with longitudinal data, we additionally found that individual-level trajectories over development were substantially correlated within and, to a lesser degree, across measures such as the Mullen and Vineland. However, ADOS trajectories were largely not associated with trajectories on the Mullen or Vineland (Figure S2). Given the behavioral evidence for early differentiation of ASD Good versus Poor subgroups, we next asked the question of whether the neural systems responsible for early language development would show any differentiation in response to speech stimulation. The canonical neural systems responsible for language in the typically developing brain are well known in adulthood (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007Hickok G. Poeppel D. The cortical organization of speech processing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar) and are also observed in infancy and toddlerhood (Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2002Dehaene-Lambertz G. Dehaene S. Hertz-Pannier L. Functional neuroimaging of speech perception in infants.Science. 2002; 298: 2013-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2006Dehaene-Lambertz G. Hertz-Pannier L. Dubois J. Mériaux S. Roche A. Sigman M. Dehaene S. Functional organization of perisylvian activation during presentation of sentences in preverbal infants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14240-14245Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To illustrate these “canonical” neural systems, we extracted a meta-analysis map from the NeuroSynth database (http://www.neurosynth.org) (Yarkoni et al., 2011Yarkoni T. Poldrack R.A. Nichols T.E. Van Essen D.C. Wager T.D. Large-scale automated synthesis of human functional neuroimaging data.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) of 725 studies associated with the feature “language” (Figure 2E). This map shows involvement primarily within large clusters in bilateral lateral frontal and superior temporal cortex. Visually, the within-group all speech versus rest activation maps from all groups except ASD Poor appear very similar to the NeuroSynth language map, particularly in temporal and parietal cortex. TD, ASD Good, and LD/DD groups showed activation broadly distributed across perisylvian temporo-parietal areas such as planum polare, planum temporale, anterior, middle, and posterior superior temporal sulcus and gyrus, Heschl’s gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal sulcus as well as in angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, and inferior parietal lobule/parietal operculum (Figure 2E). In contrast, the ASD Poor group showed no left hemisphere recruitment and within right hemisphere recruited patches mainly in inferior parietal lobule, planum temporale/Heschl’s gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, and superior and lateral occipital cortex (Figure 2E). At very liberal whole-brain uncorrected thresholds (p < 0.05), the only activation within ASD Poor left hemisphere superior temporal cortex was a small cluster overlapping with primary auditory cortex (Figure S3). In order to test for between-group differences in activation strength within canonical neural systems for language, we first looked specifically at the lateral frontal and temporal cortex regions defined by the NeuroSynth “language” meta-analysis map. ANCOVAs, covarying for mean framewise displacement (Yan et al., 2013Yan C.G. Cheung B. Kelly C. Colcombe S. Craddock R.C. Di Martino A. Li Q. Zuo X.N. Castellanos F.X. Milham M.P. A comprehensive assessment of regional variation in the impact of head micromovements on functional connectomics.Neuroimage. 2013; 76: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and age at scanning, revealed significant group differences only within left hemisphere superior temporal cortex (F(3,97) = 4.88, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.131) (Figure 2A), although the effect size in right hemisphere superior temporal cortex (F(3,97) = 2.43, p = 0.069, partial η2 = 0.07) (Figure 2B) suggests a similar trend. In contrast, no between-group difference was apparent in frontal cortex either in the right (F(3,97) = 1.94, p = 0.12, partial η2 = 0.057) or left hemisphere (F(3,97) = 0.37, p = 0.76, partial η2 = 0.012) (Figures 2C and 2D). Dot plots showing individual data points are presented in Figures S4A–S4D. Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons decomposing the between-group difference in left hemisphere temporal cortex clearly showed hypoactivation in ASD Poor compared to all other groups (TD versus ASD Poor: Cohen’s d = 0.85, p = 0.014; ASD Good versus ASD Poor: Cohen’s d = 0.94, p = 0.016; LD/DD versus ASD Poor: Cohen’s d = 1.04, p = 0.011; all other comparisons: Cohen’s d < 0.14, p = 1). Confirming that these results are specific to language outcome as the critical variable, we re-ran ANCOVAs while also covarying for Mullen VR scores in order to control for general non-verbal cognitive deficits in the ASD Poor group and found similar results (F(3,93) = 3.84, p = 0.012, partial η2 = 0.11; TD versus ASD Poor: p = 0.073; ASD Good versus ASD Poor: p = 0.047; LD/DD versus ASD Poor: p = 0.01). All other regions of interest (ROIs) remained non-significant after including Mullen VR as a covariate (Table S3). These results also remain the same in further motion control analyses where no individual exhibited mean framewise displacement greater than 0.1 mm (Table S3 and Figure S5). Finally, we additionally ran Welch’s ANOVAs to guard against violations of homogeneity of variance, which were present only for RH temporal (Levene’s Test, F(3,99) = 3.19, p = 0.02) and RH frontal cortex (Levene’s Test, F(3,99) = 3.21, p = 0.02). The effect in RH temporal cortex became statistically significant (F(3,44.72) = 3.17, p = 0.03), while the RH frontal cortex showed a trend-level effect (F(3,48.30) = 2.58, p = 0.06). Further confirmation of hypoactivation in the ASD Poor subgroup comes from whole-brain between-group analyses. Bilateral temporal cortex was significantly hypoactive in ASD Poor compared to all other groups (LH cluster: MNI x = −54, y = −33, z = 4, t(97) = 4.52, pFDR = 0.011, k = 645; RH cluster: MNI x = 42, y = −41, z = 8, t(97) = 3.57, pFDR = 0.056, k = 374), and these clusters spanned language-related perisylvian areas such as planum polare, planum temporale, anterior, middle, and posterior superior temporal sulcus and gyrus, Heschl’s gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal sulcus (Figure 2E). The conjunction overlap (Nichols et al., 2005Nichols T. Brett M. Andersson J. Wager T. Poline J.B.

Further whole-brain analyses specifically comparing TD, ASD Good, and LD/DD groups against each other yielded no significant differences. Next, we quantitatively assessed multi-voxel pattern similarity (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008aKriegeskorte N. Mur M. Bandettini P.

First we wanted to assess how similar were each group’s second-level activation maps to each other. These analyses show that TD, ASD Good, and LD/DD activation maps are all markedly similar within voxels defined by the NeuroSynth language map. In contrast, ASD Poor stands alone with markedly less similarity to all other groups (all p < 5.63 × 10−14) (Figure 3A, Table S4). This separation between ASD Poor and all other groups can be better visualized in Figure 3B after multidimensional scaling. Second, because some studies report processing abnormalities in primary auditory pathways in ASD (Dinstein et al., 2012Dinstein I. Heeger D.J. Lorenzi L. Minshew N.J. Malach R. Behrmann M.

Episodic memory enables adaptive behavior by mediating access to past experiences, often in the service of goal-oriented tasks. While the essential role of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures in supporting conscious memories is well documented, there is converging evidence that episodic retrieval also engages the left medial and lateral parietal cortices (MPC and LPC) (Cabeza et al., 2008Cabeza R.

More specifically, functional brain imaging studies consistently report that the retrosplenial (RSC) and posterior cingulate cortices (PCC) in the MPC, and angular gyrus (AG) in the LPC, display similar activation profiles across a variety of episodic retrieval outcomes (Cabeza et al., 2008Cabeza R.

In addition, these parietal subregions are part of a large-scale network of association cortices in the primate brain, known as the default mode network (DMN) (Greicius et al., 2003Greicius M.D. Krasnow B.

Identifying the temporal sequence of activation across different parietal subregions during retrieval is essential to elucidating their unique functional role and further advancing current theoretical accounts. Moreover, the neurophysiological correlates of intrinsic and task-dependent connectivity between parietal subregions have yet to be studied. Existing data suggest that intrinsic connectivity patterns often recapitulate co-activation patterns observed during task conditions (Smith et al., 2009Smith S.M. Fox P.T. Miller K.L. Glahn D.C. Fox P.M. Mackay C.E. Filippini N. Watkins K.E. Toro R. Laird A.R. Beckmann C.F. Correspondence of the brain’s functional architecture during activation and rest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 13040-13045Crossref PubMed Scopus (3651) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting a shared neurophysiological correlate. Therefore, quantifying the similarities of such connectivity patterns, and their physiological correlates, is essential to understanding the neuronal basis and utility of intrinsic functional connectivity in the brain. To specifically address these questions, we obtained simultaneous recordings directly from the left MPC and LPC in three human subjects using electrocorticography (ECoG; Figures 1A and 1B ). Such rare recordings provide a unique opportunity to study neuronal population activity in the human brain with high spatiotemporal precision. We focused on subjects with electrode coverage over the left hemisphere, given the strong neuroimaging evidence supporting lateralization of parietal activations during episodic retrieval (Hutchinson et al., 2009Hutchinson J.B.

As part of a clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery, subdural grid and strip electrode arrays were positioned over large areas of the MPC and LPC in each subject. Electrophysiological data from dual MPC/LPC implantations were recorded during task conditions that probed autobiographical episodic retrieval and also during resting and sleeping states. In addition, resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data were separately acquired from each subject to facilitate a direct quantitative comparison between electrophysiological and imaging measures of intrinsic coupling across parietal subregions. Building upon a wide body of neuroimaging literature, we report novel information about the temporal dynamics of responses across MPC and LPC during episodic retrieval. We observed a zero time lag (delay) in the onset latency of activity between RSC/PCC and AG at the single-trial level during retrieval. Furthermore, we found clear evidence for correlated electrophysiological activity between the same RSC/PCC and AG subregions during resting and sleeping states. Across the parietal lobe, intrinsic connectivity patterns strikingly recapitulated event-related task co-activation patterns and closely matched rsfMRI connectivity in each subject. Collectively, our findings provide new information about the temporal engagement of human parietal subregions during episodic memory retrieval, and more generally, provide clear electrophysiological correlates of functional connectivity during resting and task states in the human cortex.

Different origins of gamma rhythm and high-gamma activity in macaque visual cortex.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1000610Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HFB spectral range provides a rich marker of local electrocortical activity of great translational utility between human and non-human primate research and more specifically between neuroimaging and electrophysiological data. As shown in Figures 1D and 1E, mean HFB amplitude responses across conditions differed between several parietal subregions; however, the response profiles in RSC/PCC and AG were strikingly similar (see also Figure S1). Both RSC/PCC and AG displayed greater HFB responses to the “self-episodic” condition (e.g., “I ate fruit yesterday”), with progressively smaller mean HFB responses to the “self-semantic” (e.g., “I eat fruit often”), “self-judgment” (e.g., “I am an honest person”), and “other-judgment” (e.g., “my neighbor is an honest person”) conditions. In addition, both RSC/PCC and AG showed deactivation of HFB amplitude during a simple arithmetic “math” condition, consistent with our previous observations from the MPC (Foster et al., 2012Foster B.L. Dastjerdi M. Parvizi J. Neural populations in human posteromedial cortex display opposing responses during memory and numerical processing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15514-15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In light of the highly similar HFB response profiles of RSC/PCC and AG across all conditions, we sought to explore the correlation of HFB responses between parietal subregions at the single-trial level. We compared the similarity of parietal subregion task responses by correlating the mean HFB amplitude across all trials for an entire experimental run (see Experimental Procedures). Responses recorded simultaneously from the PCC and AG showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.83, p < 0.001, n = 178, Figure 2), whereas comparing the same PCC seed to dorsal sites in the LPC revealed no significant correlation (Figure S3). These data suggest the presence of neuronal populations in specific locations of the MPC and LPC whose electrophysiological responses are tightly coupled and similarly modulated in magnitude, during both activation and deactivation, across different cognitive conditions. To generalize this observation, we performed the same trial-based correlation of HFB responses across all unique pairs of parietal electrodes in each subject, including both within (e.g., lateral-lateral = AG-SPL) and between (e.g., medial-lateral = PCC-SPL) surface comparisons. Therefore, we constructed a task correlation matrix for each subject based on trial-level mean HFB responses (Figure 3A; see Experimental Procedures). Averaging correlations for each unique subregional pair across subjects revealed a consistent positive correlation between RSC/PCC and AG sites for repeated experimental runs (Figure 3B). A breakdown of RSC/PCC-AG task correlations suggested that these two parietal subregions were comodulated by all task conditions, with the strongest correlations being observed for the self-episodic and self-semantic conditions (Figure 3C). To ensure that overall task correlations were not driven by conditions with larger trial responses (e.g., self-episodic condition), we normalized task responses within condition (Z score) prior to correlation. This normalization procedure suggested a limited influence of response magnitudes, with normalized data and non-normalized data producing highly similar task correlation patterns (normalized versus non-normalized similarity: S1 r = 0.96; S2 r = 0.91; S3 r = 0.78, all p < 0.0001). Given the strong trial-based electrophysiological co-activation patterns between RSC/PCC and AG sites across subjects, we sought to further quantify the coordination of these responses with additional temporal precision. Specifically, we estimated the time of onset of HFB responses in RSC/PCC and AG sites at the single-trial level. Our analyses focused on self-episodic trials given the consistency of maximal HFB responses to this condition and our specific interest in episodic retrieval. Using a robust method for estimating response onset latency (ROL; Figure S4), we obtained the HFB ROL values of each self-episodic trial for all RSC, PCC, and AG sites (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). For each site, the ROL was defined by the median ROL across trials (given the positive skew of ROL data). Interestingly, when comparing RSC/PCC and AG sites, we found no significant difference in the mean HFB ROL (mean, 95% confidence interval [CI]: RSC/PCC = 674 ms, 555:820 ms; AG = 761 ms, 629:897 ms) for the self-episodic condition. The latency of HFB response onset in RSC/PCC and AG is consistent with our previous observations in the MPC in different experimental subjects under similar task conditions (mean MPC latency = 627 ms) (Foster et al., 2012Foster B.L. Dastjerdi M. Parvizi J. Neural populations in human posteromedial cortex display opposing responses during memory and numerical processing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 15514-15519Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This similarity of ROL did not significantly differ for true or false responses in RSC/PCC (mean, 95% CI: true = 734 ms, 568:940 ms; false = 662 ms, 527:800 ms) or AG (mean, 95% CI: true = 764 ms, 624:936 ms; false = 791 ms, 647:1,020 ms). As mean ROL data suggested no significant difference in the response timing between RSC/PCC and AG during retrieval, we next compared differences in ROL at the single-trial level (i.e., non-collapsed trial data) for all possible RSC/PCC-AG electrode pairs. Therefore, electrode sites were included in this analysis based solely on anatomical location to limit data selection bias, which included sites of differing response magnitude. Thus, for each unique RSC/PCC-AG electrode pair (n pairs = 68), we computed an ROL difference value (i.e., onset delay) for each trial by subtracting the ROL of a given RSC/PCC site from the ROL of a given AG site (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This difference value would therefore be negative if AG ROL precedes RSC/PCC and positive if RSC/PCC ROL precedes AG. Also, in taking relative ROL differences for each trial, we account for natural variation in absolute ROL values across different stimuli. Strikingly, the distribution of ROL differences between RSC/PCC and AG across all subjects was strongly peaked around zero, displaying no skew or non-zero peaks, suggesting no dominant lag-lead difference (i.e., delay) in the time of response onsets of neuronal population responses between these regions (Figure 4A; delay median, 99% CI = 0 ms, −16:16 ms, n = 3,288). This distribution of ROL differences between RSC/PCC and AG was consistent across individual subjects (see Figure S5A). In addition, ROL differences were not significantly different for true (delay median, 99% CI = 0 ms, −22:32 ms, n = 1,010) or false (delay median, 99% CI = 2 ms, −16:23 ms, n = 2,278) response trials of the self-episodic condition. As an active control within parietal cortex, we also compared the ROL differences between RSC/PCC sites and SPL sites responsive to the self-episodic condition (n pairs = 82; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In contrast to AG, ROL difference values between RSC/PCC and SPL displayed a rightward-shifted and less peaked distribution, suggesting that SPL is often engaged after RSC/PCC (Figure 4A; delay median, 99% CI = 505 ms, 459:543 ms, n = 3,886). Performing the same analysis for responsive IPS sites (n pairs = 72) provided a similarly right-shifted distribution but centering earlier than the SPL (delay median, 99% CI = 154 ms, 119:181 ms, n = 3,457). Additionally, we performed further active controls using visual and motor sites outside of the parietal lobe in each subject that provided strong expectations for relative ROL timing. As predicted, ROL differences between RSC/PCC sites and visual sites (n pairs = 45) showed a leftward shifted distribution with high kurtosis and positive skew (Figure 4A; delay median, 99% CI = −252 ms, −268:−231 ms, n = 2,319). This distribution indicates that the timing of visual HFB onsets were consistently prior to RSC/PCC sites with limited variation of ROL delay. Conversely, the distribution of HFB ROL differences between RSC/PCC sites and motor sites (n pairs = 67) showed a large rightward shift with less kurtosis (Figure 4A; delay median, 99% CI = 907 ms, 859:959 ms, n = 3,150). This distribution indicates that the timing of motor activity (typically reflecting a contra-lateral button press to respond true or false) was after the time of onset of visual, RSC/PCC, AG, IPS, and SPL activations, and with a greater variation than visual sites (owing to the variation in reaction times for the task). The significance of these differences in ROL distributions across active control sites is clearly seen when comparing the probability density of each distribution (Figure 4B). Given the confidence intervals of distribution medians, each of the active control distributions (SPL, IPS, visual, and motor) was significantly different from the distribution of AG ROL differences (confirmed with Wilcoxon rank test, Bonferroni corrected, all p < 0.001). Importantly, our observations of task correlation and temporal coordination between RSC/PCC and AG were also replicated when applying a more standard cross-correlation analysis to HFB task data (see Figure S6). Together, these findings suggest a tight minimal lag coupling of activation onset in the RSC/PCC and AG that closely follows the activation of early visual cortex and precedes the onset of activity in the dorsal IPS/SPL and motor cortex during episodic autobiographical retrieval (Figure 4C). Given the similarity of response magnitude and timing between RSC/PCC and AG during task conditions, we sought to quantify the degree of intrinsic coupling between these same subregions during the resting state. Based on a large body of evidence from human brain imaging, one would posit that large extents of the RSC/PCC and AG should display intrinsic functional connectivity given their shared membership in the DMN, which functionally dissociates these areas from other parietal subregions (Nelson et al., 2010Nelson S.M. Cohen A.L. Power J.D. Wig G.S. Miezin F.M. Wheeler M.E. Velanova K. Donaldson D.I. Phillips J.S. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E.

To approximate the timescale of BOLD activity observed for rsfMRI analyses, we extracted the slow (<1 Hz) ongoing fluctuations of HFB amplitude from spontaneous resting-state ECoG (rsECoG) data. This composition of frequency bands follows prior work suggesting that this range of activity best correlates with spontaneous BOLD data and yields the most consistent and anatomically specific spatial correlations (Keller et al., 2013Keller C.J.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Figures 5A–5C depict the basic processing steps to obtain the slow time-varying HFB signal. Following classical rsfMRI methods, we performed a seed-based approach of correlating all unique electrode pairs between MPC and LPC for each subject. When a seed in the RSC/PCC was selected, correlations of slow HFB fluctuations were significantly and selectively localized to AG recording sites on the lateral surface (Figure 5D; see Experimental Procedures). Using alternative frequency bands, we observed a similar correlation pattern for the low beta range (13–29 Hz) but no similarity for the delta (0.5–3 Hz), theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), high beta (30–39 Hz), or gamma (40–69 Hz) ranges (all focused on slow, <1 Hz, fluctuations, Figure 5E) for the same seed region. Across subjects, rsECoG analyses consistently showed strong positive correlations between the RSC/PCC and AG during the resting state (Figure 6). Furthermore, when selecting the same RSC/PCC seed regions within subjects and plotting the distribution of correlation values in LPC, we observed a strikingly similar spatial pattern of correlation for event-related task data and spontaneous rest data (Figure 6A). In addition, this pattern, which is dominated by selective AG correlation, also showed a strong resemblance to the distribution of HFB amplitude increases in the LPC during the self-episodic condition (Figure 6B). Therefore, during episodic autobiographical retrieval, the spatial pattern of HFB responses appears highly similar to the spatial patterns of significant MPC-LPC correlations during both task and resting-state conditions. Importantly, we note that task correlation data is derived from trial-based activation changes in HFB amplitude, whereas resting-state correlations are based on slow (<1 Hz) fluctuations of spontaneous HFB amplitude. While the correlation analysis of task and resting state was performed on highly different datasets and timescales, it may be argued that the resting-state data contain diluted levels of spontaneous recall processes of an autobiographical nature, which may explain the similar findings between states. A growing literature in functional neuroimaging has debated this issue (Buckner et al., 2008Buckner R.L. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Schacter D.L.

Information storage in the brain is mediated by changes in synaptic strength that require rapid de novo synthesis of mRNA and protein (Goelet et al., 1986Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Schacher S.

Arc provides an exemplary molecule for studies of how the de novo response contributes to memory. Arc was identified based on its rapid transcriptional upregulation in models of learning (Link et al., 1995Link W. Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Krug M. Schwanke B. Frey U. Kuhl D.

Arc is a postsynaptic protein that associates with endocytic vesicular proteins to modulate the trafficking of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H.

Arc also binds CaMKII in the kinase inactive state, and this interaction targets Arc to synapses in accordance (inverse) with their history of activity, and underlies Arc’s contribution to homeostatic maintenance of distributed synaptic weights (Okuno et al., 2012Okuno H.

Arc contributes importantly to cell-wide homeostatic scaling (non-Hebbian) (Shepherd et al., 2006Shepherd J.D. Rumbaugh G. Wu J. Chowdhury S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F.

Arc has been implicated in diseases of cognition where its action is thought to contribute to reduced synaptic strength. Inhibitory control of Arc translation is disrupted in fragile X mental retardation syndrome and unregulated expression of Arc contributes to enhanced mGluR-LTD (Niere et al., 2012Niere F.

In Angelman syndrome, reduced ubiquitination of Arc may result in an increase of Arc-dependent synaptic downregulation (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z. Maehr R. et al.The Angelman Syndrome protein Ube3A regulates synapse development by ubiquitinating arc.Cell. 2010; 140: 704-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Arc enhances the association of γ-secretase with trafficking endosomes that process amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Aß peptide. This action of Arc creates activity-dependent increases of Aß that contribute to amyloid deposition (Wu et al., 2011Wu J. Petralia R.S. Kurushima H. Patel H. Jung M.Y. Volk L. Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Dehoff M. Li Y. et al.Arc/Arg3.1 regulates an endosomal pathway essential for activity-dependent β-amyloid generation.Cell. 2011; 147: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Mutations of genes whose protein products can physically associate with Arc were identified in studies of sporadic and inherited schizophrenia (Fromer et al., 2014Fromer M. Pocklington A.J. Kavanagh D.H. Williams H.J. Dwyer S. Gormley P. Georgieva L. Rees E. Palta P. Ruderfer D.M. et al.De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks.Nature. 2014; 506: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, Purcell et al., 2014Purcell S.M. Moran J.L.

Kähler A. et al.A polygenic burden of rare disruptive mutations in schizophrenia.Nature. 2014; 506: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Arc’s functions have been challenging to understand in molecular detail because Arc is a single copy gene without identifiable family members or biochemically defined domains. For example, Arc is known to downregulate synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors, but the binding partners and regulatory mechanisms that couple Arc to AMPA receptor trafficking remain unknown. Arc’s association with cognitive diseases suggests that knowledge of physical associations that define its binding properties could provide insight into pathogenesis. To address this challenge, we evaluated known interactions of Arc and assessed whether they could be reconstituted with recombinant proteins. We discovered that both full-length Arc, as well as a specific subdomain of Arc, bound CaMKII. This same subdomain of Arc was found to bind to TARPγ2 (Stargazin), which is known to associate with AMPA receptors and mediate critical aspects of AMPA receptor trafficking (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. Stargazing from a new vantage—TARP modulation of AMPA receptor pharmacology.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 5909-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Co-crystal structures of an Arc subdomain bound to CaMKII and TARPγ2 were defined and reveal the structural basis of these interactions. Physiological studies demonstrate that synaptic AMPA receptor downregulation during homeostatic scaling requires Arc N-lobe binding. Remarkably, the subdomain that mediates Arc binding is structurally similar to the capsid domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A structure of a second subdomain of Arc further substantiates a bi-lobar configuration that is similar to HIV GAG protein and indicates Arc originated from the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon family. Analysis across species reveals the evolutionary origin of its unique binding domain. An Arc N-lobe consensus binding sequence was established that identifies several novel binding partners that include proteins of the “Arc complex” linked to schizophrenia (Fromer et al., 2014Fromer M. Pocklington A.J. Kavanagh D.H. Williams H.J. Dwyer S. Gormley P. Georgieva L. Rees E. Palta P. Ruderfer D.M. et al.De novo mutations in schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks.Nature. 2014; 506: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, Purcell et al., 2014Purcell S.M. Moran J.L.

Kähler A. et al.A polygenic burden of rare disruptive mutations in schizophrenia.Nature. 2014; 506: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Arc N-lobe binding is dependent on buried hydrophobic interactions that are notably distinct from many protein-protein interactions and this prompted us to screen for and identify small molecules that can inhibit Arc N-lobe binding. These observations provide a structural basis for understanding critical functions of Arc in synaptic plasticity and cognitive diseases and support the possibility that Arc functions may pharmacologically targetable. The Arc-CaMKII interaction was previously characterized in co-immunoprecipitation assays (Okuno et al., 2012Okuno H. Akashi K. Ishii Y. Yagishita-Kyo N. Suzuki K. Nonaka M. Kawashima T. Fujii H. Takemoto-Kimura S. Abe M. et al.Inverse synaptic tagging of inactive synapses via dynamic interaction of Arc/Arg3.1 with CaMKIIβ.Cell. 2012; 149: 886-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We discovered the Arc-TARPγ2 interaction in a survey of synaptic proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with Arc (Figure S1A). TARPγ2 associates with AMPA receptors and modulates AMPA receptor trafficking and localization to the synapse (Jackson and Nicoll, 2011Jackson A.C. Nicoll R.A. Stargazing from a new vantage—TARP modulation of AMPA receptor pharmacology.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 5909-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rat Arc (Rn Arc) bound TARPγ2 peptide (see Figure 2) and CaMKIIα peptide (Figure S1B) in vitro. Full-length RnArc did not crystallize, but RnArc (207–278) crystallized in complex with TARPγ2 and CaMKII peptides (Table S1). Crystal structures revealed RnArc (207–278) forms a four helical bundle (Figure 1A) that is structurally similar to capsid domains of retroviral gag proteins in the PDB database, including HIV and Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) (Figures 1A and 1C and Figures S2A and S2B). No other structures were significantly similar. HIV capsid is typical of retroviruses and includes two globular domains termed NTD and CTD (Pornillos et al., 2009Pornillos O. Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Kelly B.N. Hua Y. Whitby F.G. Stout C.D. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Yeager M.

Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Yeager M. Atomic-level modelling of the HIV capsid.Nature. 2011; 469: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). While sequence identity is only 11%, RnArc (207–278) superposes on the HIV CTD with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.6 Å for 61 Cαs. RnArc (207–278) includes an additional β1-strand at its N terminus that contacts the α1-helix and surrounds the bound TARPγ2 peptide (Figure 1A). Similarity between Arc and HIV capsid protein was further borne out with the structure of RnArc (278–370) apoprotein (Table S1), which is also superimposable with HIV capsid protein CTD. RnArc (278–370) possesses a more extensive α1’ helix at the N terminus of the major homology region (MHR) than retroviruses (Figures 1B and 1C). We term RnArc (207–278) Arc N-lobe, and RnArc (278-370) Arc C-lobe; together they form the Arc Gag domain. Sequence analysis reveals bi-lobar Arc domains in all metazoans (Figures 1C and 1D). Arc is highly conserved in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The bi-lobar Arc domain in the fish Danio (Dr) appears in three genes that are members of the Ty3/Gypsy family of retrotransposons. Ty3/Gypsy are ancient forms of RNA-based self-replicating elements that are present in animal, plant, and fungal kingdoms and are considered ancestral to modern retroviruses, including HIV (Llorens et al., 2008Llorens C. Fares M.A. Moya A. Relationships of gag-pol diversity between Ty3/Gypsy and Retroviridae LTR retroelements and the three kings hypothesis.BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), as well as certain cellular genes (Campillos et al., 2006Campillos M. Doerks T. Shah P.K. Bork P. Computational characterization of multiple Gag-like human proteins.Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 585-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, Volff, 2009Volff J.N. Cellular genes derived from Gypsy/Ty3 retrotransposons in mammalian genomes.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1178: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fish Danio Arc genes Dr1 and Dr3 encode domains typical of Retrotansposons including zinc knuckles, which bind RNA during virion assembly, as well as reverse transcriptase (RT) (Figure 1D). These observations confirm computational predictions of Arc’s retrotransposon origin (Campillos et al., 2006Campillos M. Doerks T. Shah P.K. Bork P. Computational characterization of multiple Gag-like human proteins.Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 585-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Danio gene Dr2 is different from Dr1 and Dr3 in that it possesses an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, which is typical of all higher vertebrate Arc genes, and lacks the zinc knuckle domain. This suggests that vertebrate Arc arose through the “domestication” (repurposing of retrotransposon genes in eukaryotic cells; see Campillos et al., 2006Campillos M. Doerks T. Shah P.K. Bork P. Computational characterization of multiple Gag-like human proteins.Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 585-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) of Ty3/Gypsy in stages that include acquiring the N-terminal coil-coil and loss of the zinc knuckle and RT. The Arc bi-lobar domain is also present in insects. Arc in beetle Tribolium castaneum (Tca) includes zinc knuckles and reverse transcriptase, while Drosophila Arc1 protein includes zinc knuckles but lacks reverse transcriptase (Figure 1D). Insect Arc lacks the N-terminal CC domain typical of vertebrate Arc. This suggests that Arc domestication in insects followed a different functional path and is consistent with studies of Dme Arc that define a role in stress-induced behavior but not learning and memory (Mattaliano et al., 2007Mattaliano M.D. Montana E.S. Parisky K.M. Littleton J.T. Griffith L.C. The Drosophila ARC homolog regulates behavioral responses to starvation.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 36: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A retrotransposon is present in plant Fragaria vesca that possesses ∼14% identity to RnArc within the GAG domain. However, this plant gene appears to be a different family of retrotransposon based on sequence of the nucleotide binding domain encoding CHHC zinc knuckle motif, not CCHC motif (Figure 1E). We examined determinants of Arc binding to TARPγ2. TARPγ2 passes through the hydrophobic core of the Arc N-lobe four helix bundle (Figures 2A and 2B ). The small A250 side chain together with P217 creates space for interactions with TARPγ2 Y229 aromatic ring. RnArc (207–370) mutations P217F and P217V that fill the pocket and mimic Dme Arc or retroviral Gag (Figure 1C) abolish binding to TARPγ2 peptide (Figure 2C). Thus, TARPγ2 Y229 appears to replace an aromatic stack that assembles the four helices of retroviral/HIV Gag proteins. Arc strand β1, loop T3, and the N terminus of helix α3 create a groove that surrounds the peptide (Figures 2A and 2B). This groove also appears important for binding since RnArc (207–370) F214S, which mimics Xenopus Arc and encodes an aromatic pocket but not the aromatic pair F214-H223 required to anchor β1 strand to helix α1, fails to bind (Figure 2C). As predicted, Xenopus Arc does not bind TARPγ2 (Figure S3A). The evolutionary origin and progression suggest Arc N-lobe binding is unique to the vertebrate genome. To further assess determinants of peptide binding, we developed a binding assay that monitors the polarization of light emitted from a 5-Carboxyfluorescein-tagged TARPγ2 peptide (fluorescence polarization assay [FP]) (Moerke, 2009Moerke N.J. Fluorescence Polarization (FP) Assays for Monitoring Peptide-Protein or Nucleic Acid-Protein Binding.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2009; 1: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar, Roehrl et al., 2004Roehrl M.H. Wang J.Y. Wagner G. A general framework for development and data analysis of competitive high-throughput screens for small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions by fluorescence polarization.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16056-16066Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and performed binding assays with labeled peptide. TARPγ2 peptide (RIPSYR) binding affinity is ∼60 μM (Figure 2D). Competition binding assays demonstrated similar binding to the entire C terminus of TARPγ2 (aa 202–23). This affinity is similar to that of the PDZ domain of PSD95 binding with several of its ligands (Møller et al., 2013Møller T.C. Wirth V.F. Roberts N.I. Bender J. Bach A. Jacky B.P. Strømgaard K. Deussing J.M. Schwartz T.W. Martinez K.L. PDZ domain-mediated interactions of G protein-coupled receptors with postsynaptic density protein 95: quantitative characterization of interactions.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e63352Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and is consistent with a role for Arc N-lobe binding in protein-protein interactions at the synapse. RnArc (207–370) mutations F214S and P217F abolish binding to TARPγ2 peptide (Figures 2C and 2D). These observations confirm that Arc binding requires both the β’ tunnel and the aromatic pocket. We assessed the physiological role of Arc N-lobe binding by expressing full-length WT Arc or ArcP217F in DIV14 neuronal cultures by Sindbis virus. Transgene expression was monitored by western blot and confirmed similar expression of WT Arc or ArcP217F (Figure 3A). Transgene expression was also monitored by co-expression of GFP, which was typically detected in ∼80% of neurons (data not shown). Neurons were treated with TTX to suppress synaptic activity, and thereby reduce expression of native Arc (Shepherd et al., 2006Shepherd J.D. Rumbaugh G. Wu J. Chowdhury S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Arc/Arg3.1 mediates homeostatic synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2006; 52: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), during viral gene expression (12–16 hr). Consistent with previous studies, WT Arc transgene reduced expression of AMPA receptor GluA1 on the membrane surface as assayed by biotinylation of surface proteins (Figures 3A and 3B). TARPγ2 was also prominently downregulated by WT Arc, consistent with its role as a binding partner of GluA1 and regulator of trafficking. By contrast, ArcP217F did not downregulate surface GluA1 or TARPγ2. Since Arc does not bind GluA1 directly (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H. Lyford G. Petralia R.S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Arc/Arg3.1 interacts with the endocytic machinery to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.Neuron. 2006; 52: 445-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), this supports the hypothesis that Arc binding to TARPγ2 mediates GluA1 downregulation. Recordings from viral-transfected neurons confirmed that the mEPSC amplitude and frequency were reduced in neurons expressing WT Arc compared to ArcP217F (Figure 3C). These data establish that Arc-N lobe binding is essential for Arc-dependent downregulation of synaptic strength. It should be noted that the larger amplitude of mEPSCs in ArcP217F increases detection and leaves open the question of whether there are truly more synapses or just more detected. An electron density map of the bound TARPγ2 peptide reveals features of the ligand that are important for binding (Figure 4A). Hydrogen bonds are present to both main chain and side chain positions (Figure 4B). TARPγ2 is a member of type I TARPs, which include TARPγ3, TARPγ4, and TARPγ8 (Tomita et al., 2003Tomita S. Chen L. Kawasaki Y. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Arc binding motif is conserved in TARPγ4 and TARPγ8, but TARPγ3 encodes proline rather than serine at position 228 in higher vertebrates (Figure S3B). This substitution interferes with β strand formation. RnArc (207–370) bound GST-TARPγ2 but not GST-TARPγ3 (Figure 4C), consistent with a requirement for β strand. The non-binding form of TARPγ3 appears to be an evolutionary adaptation in higher vertebrates since Xenopus and Danio TARPγ3 encode S228 (Figure S3B). Another regulatory mechanism is suggested by the observation that TARPγ2 is dynamically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in association with synaptic potentiation or depression, respectively (Opazo et al., 2010Opazo P. Labrecque S. Tigaret C.M. Frouin A. Wiseman P.W. De Koninck P. Choquet D.

One of these phosphorylation sites TARPγ2(S228) (Figure S3B) is predicted to disrupt hydrogen bonds made by the side chain hydroxyl and introduce steric clashes with I213 and N247 (Figure 4B). RnArc (207–370) bound GST-TARPγ2 but not a TARPγ2 peptide with phosphomimetic substitutions (Sumioka et al., 2010Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Figure 4D and Figure S3B). We used the FP competition binding assay to assess determinants of binding affinity. We began by examining effects of mutations of the TARPγ2 peptide on Arc binding. Phosphorylation of TARPγ2(S228) or TARPγ2(Y229) reduced binding affinity at least 20-fold (Figure 4E). A minimal tripeptide corresponding to the central PSY sequence failed to bind, suggesting that a basic and long β strand conformation is important for interaction. CamKII peptide (ATRNFS) is notably distinct from TARPγ2 in that R substitutes for P. While this peptide occupies the same position in the co-crystal (Figure S3C), the affinity of binding is ∼760 μM (Figures S3C and S3D), consistent with TARPγ2(P227R) (Figure 4E). These observations predict a consensus sequence P[STVILMKR][FYH] in the basic context of a β strand secondary structure. The consensus is similar but distinct from binding sites for phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) (Zhou et al., 1996Zhou M.M. Huang B. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Shuker S.B. Miyazaki M. Trüb T.

Thermal imaging provides a fast and non-destructive way of scanning plants for diseased regions and has been used by various researchers to study the effect of disease on the thermal profile of a plant. However, thermal image of a plant affected by disease has been known to be affected by environmental conditions which include leaf angles and depth of the canopy areas accessible to the thermal imaging camera. In this paper, we combine thermal and visible light image data with depth information and develop a machine learning system to remotely detect plants infected with the tomato powdery mildew fungus Oidium neolycopersici. We extract a novel feature set from the image data using local and global statistics and show that by combining these with the depth information, we can considerably improve the accuracy of detection of the diseased plants. In addition, we show that our novel feature set is capable of identifying plants which were not originally inoculated with the fungus at the start of the experiment but which subsequently developed disease through natural transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2010646521,"Inhibition of carcinogenesis may be a consequence of attenuation of oxidative stress via activation of antioxidant defence system, restoration and stabilization of tumour suppressor proteins along with modulation of inflammatory mediators. Previously we have delineated significant role of curcumin during its long term effect in regulation of glycolytic pathway and angiogenesis, which in turn results in prevention of cancer via modulation of stress activated genes. Present study was designed to investigate long term effect of curcumin in regulation of Nrf2 mediated phase-II antioxidant enzymes, tumour suppressor p53 and inflammation under oxidative tumour microenvironment in liver of T-cell lymphoma bearing mice. Inhibition of Nrf2 signalling observed during lymphoma progression, resulted in down regulation of phase II antioxidant enzymes, p53 as well as activation of inflammatory signals. Curcumin potentiated significant increase in Nrf2 activation. It restored activity of phase-II antioxidant enzymes like GST, GR, NQO1, and tumour suppressor p53 level. In addition, curcumin modulated inflammation via upregulation of TGF-β and reciprocal regulation of iNOS and COX2. The study suggests that during long term effect, curcumin leads to prevention of cancer by inducing phase-II antioxidant enzymes via activation of Nrf2 signalling, restoration of tumour suppressor p53 and modulation of inflammatory mediators like iNOS and COX2 in liver of lymphoma bearing mice."
https://openalex.org/W2082848552,"The classical view of somatosensory processing holds that proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs are conveyed to cortex through segregated channels, initially synapsing in modality-specific areas 3a (proprioception) and 3b (cutaneous) of primary somatosensory cortex (SI). These areas relay their signals to areas 1 and 2 where multimodal convergence first emerges. However, proprioceptive and cutaneous maps have traditionally been characterized using unreliable stimulation tools. Here, we employed a mechanical stimulator that reliably positioned animals' hands in different postures and presented tactile stimuli with superb precision. Single-unit recordings in SI revealed that most neurons responded to cutaneous and proprioceptive stimuli, including cells in areas 3a and 3b. Multimodal responses were characterized by linear and nonlinear effects that emerged during early (∼20 ms) and latter (> 100 ms) stages of stimulus processing, respectively. These data are incompatible with the modality specificity model in SI, and provide evidence for distinct mechanisms of multimodal processing in the somatosensory system."
https://openalex.org/W1519841129,"DNA damage-induced NF-κB activation plays a critical role in regulating cellular response to genotoxic stress. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the magnitude and duration of this genotoxic NF-κB signaling cascade are poorly understood. We recently demonstrated that genotoxic NF-κB activation is regulated by reversible ubiquitination of several essential mediators involved in this signaling pathway. Here we show that TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) negatively regulates NF-κB activation by DNA damage via inhibiting ubiquitination of TRAF6. Despite the lack of a deubiquitination enzyme domain, TANK has been shown to negatively regulate the ubiquitination of TRAF proteins. We found TANK formed a complex with MCPIP1 (also known as ZC3H12A) and a deubiquitinase, USP10, which was essential for the USP10-dependent deubiquitination of TRAF6 and the resolution of genotoxic NF-κB activation upon DNA damage. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated deletion of TANK in human cells significantly enhanced NF-κB activation by genotoxic treatment, resulting in enhanced cell survival and increased inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, we found that the TANK-MCPIP1-USP10 complex also decreased TRAF6 ubiquitination in cells treated with IL-1β or LPS. In accordance, depletion of USP10 enhanced NF-κB activation induced by IL-1β or LPS.

Conclusion: The deubiquitinating activity of TANK is achieved by its association with USP10. Significance: Modulating TANK may enhance cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. DNA-damaging agents such as genotoxic chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation are widely used as the mainstay of cancer therapy to treat various types of human malignancies such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. However, acquired therapeutic resistance to the genotoxic agents significantly limits the efficacy of cancer treatments, resulting in cancer relapse and metastasis. DNA damage-induced activation of transcription factor NF-κB plays a critical role in mediating therapeutic resistance in cancer cells (1Baldwin A.S.

Genotoxic treatment-activated NF-κB has been shown to modulate the transcription of antiapoptotic genes, proinflammatory cytokines, and oncogenic microRNAs, which collaboratively attenuate DNA damage-induced cancer cell apoptosis and promote cancer cell invasion (3Wang C.Y.

Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation and resolution of NF-κB activation by genotoxic anticancer agents may provide pivotal insights into developing novel therapeutic approaches to counteract acquired drug resistance and improve therapeutic efficacy. The mechanisms involved in regulating NF-κB signaling cascades following activation of membrane-bound receptors have been well established (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

Nevertheless, how genotoxic agents, which initiate a DNA damage response in the nucleus, activate the cytoplasmic NF-κB signaling cascade is still not completely understood (2McCool K.W. Miyamoto S.

Then SUMOylated NEMO could further interact with the DNA damage response apical kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), which directly phosphorylates and facilitates cIAP1/2-mediated monoubiquitination of NEMO (13Jin H.-S.

Moreover, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of ELKS, RIP1, and TRAF6 as well as the M1-linked linear ubiquitination of NEMO have been shown to modulate TAK1/IKK kinase complex activation in the cytoplasm upon genotoxic stimulation (15Hinz M.

The extent and duration of NF-κB activation is controlled by a dynamic balance between activation signaling and negative regulatory mechanisms, leading to the resolution of NF-κB activation (19Ruland J. Return to homeostasis: downregulation of NF-κB responses.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Compared with signaling events mediating NF-κB activation upon DNA damage, even less was known about how this signaling cascade is resolved. Lee et al. (20Lee M.H. Mabb A.M. Gill G.B. Yeh E.T.

We showed recently that NF-κB-dependent MCPIP1 (also known as ZC3H12A) induction negatively regulated the genotoxic NF-κB signaling cascade by promoting USP10-mediated deubiquitination of NEMO, resulting in decreased NF-κB activation upon DNA damage (21Niu J. Shi Y. Xue J. Miao R. Huang S. Wang T. Wu J. Fu M. Wu Z.H. USP10 inhibits genotoxic NF-κB activation by MCPIP1-facilitated deubiquitination of NEMO.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 3206-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, genetic deletion of either SENP2 or MCPIP1 in MEF cells was not sufficient to completely block the resolution of genotoxic NF-κB activation, suggesting that additional negative regulatory mechanisms controlling genotoxic NF-κB signaling remain to be elucidated. TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK, also known as I-TRAF) could interact with the TRAF family members TRAF2 and TRAF3, thereby regulating TRAF-mediated signaling pathways (22Pomerantz J.L.

In the antiviral immune response following retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 activation, TANK may serve as an adaptor bridging TRAF3 with TBK1 and IKKϵ, which promotes phosphorylation and activation of IRF3/IRF7 as well as induction of NF-κB activation, leading to effective type I IFN production (25Sharma S. tenOever B.R.

Nevertheless, TANK has also been shown to negatively regulate NF-κB activation (28Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S.

It has been found that NF-κB activation upon TLR or BCR (B cell receptor) stimulation was augmented in macrophages and B cells isolated from Tank−/− mice compared with their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, TANK deficiency increased TRAF6 ubiquitination in response to TLR activation in macrophages, which may contribute to enhanced NF-κB activation. However, the mechanism by which TANK inhibits TRAF6 ubiquitination remains enigmatic because TANK lacks the deubiquitination enzyme (DUB) domain and TANK does not interact with A20 and CYLD (cylindromatosis), two common DUBs that have been shown to inhibit NF-κB signaling (28Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S. TANK is a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling and is critical for the prevention of autoimmune nephritis.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that TANK inhibits genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation, which may be dependent on inhibition of TRAF6 ubiquitination. The TRAF2/3-interacting domain of TANK and the TRAF-C domain of TRAF6 are essential for TANK association with TRAF6. Mechanistically, TANK forms a complex with MCPIP1 and USP10, which promotes USP10-dependent deubiquitination of TRAF6 in cells treated with genotoxic stimuli. TANK is indispensable for TRAF6 deubiquitination by USP10 because deletion of TANK disrupts the association between USP10 and TRAF6, thereby stabilizing TRAF6 ubiquitination upon DNA damage. Moreover, the TANK-MCPIP1-USP10 complex is also responsible for inhibition of TRAF6 ubiquitination in cells treated with LPS or IL-1β. Collectively, our data suggest that TANK may serve as the adaptor for recruiting the USP10-MCPIP1 complex to polyubiquitinated TRAF6, which, in turn, disassembles the polyubiquitin chains anchored on TRAF6, resulting in the termination of NF-κB activation in response to genotoxic stress and IL-1R/TLR activation. HEK293T cells, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (wild-type and MCPIP1−/−), and human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were maintained in the presence of penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The HA-TANK plasmid was generated by cloning the human TANK coding sequence into the pcDNA3 vector. The TANK siRNA sequence used was UCACUUCAACAGACUAUUAUU, as reported previously (30Guo B. Cheng G.

Two siRNAs targeting USP10 were used. One was synthesized with the sequence CCC UGA UGG UAU CAC UAA AGA UU, and the other was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog no. 7747). TANK or USP10 knockout cells were generated with the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The pX330-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9 vector was purchased from Addgene (catalog no. 42230). TANK-targeting constructs were generated as described previously (31Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat.

The small guide RNA sequences targeting TANK were AGCGTATGAAGCCTTCCGGCAGG (protospacer adjacent motif, PAM) and ATCCATGCATGCCTGCCGGAAGG. The sgRNA (single-guide RNA) sequence targeting USP10 was GACTCCTCGATCTTCAGTTGAGG (PAM).

The Oct-1 oligonucleotide used for control EMSA reactions was obtained from Promega. Gels were quantified with a Cyclone PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the pGL4.0 Luciferase reporter containing the NF-κB target sequence and Tk-Rluc reporter (Promega). After 48 h, cells were treated and lysed, and the activity of firefly/Renilla luciferase in the lysates was measured with the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega). Briefly, in co-IP experiments, cells were lysed in 10% PBS and 90% IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride). Then, 1 μg of primary antibody (or control IgG) and protein G-Sepharose were mixed into the lysates and incubated together at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-Sepharose-enriched complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The protein signals were visualized by ECL exposure. To detect protein ubiquitination, cells were lysed with 1% SDS in IP lysis buffer at 95 °C for 30 min. The cell lysates were then diluted with IP lysis buffer to reduce SDS to 0.1% and mixed with primary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose for incubation at 4 °C overnight. The ubiquitin modification of precipitated proteins was examined by immunoblotting. GST and GST fusion proteins with TANK or TANK mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. All fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). In the GST pulldown assay, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-MCPIP1/TRAF6 or respective mutants. After 24 h, the cell lysates were prepared. Equal amounts of immobilized GST or GST fusion proteins were mixed and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the cell lysates in GST binding buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, 50 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Glutathione beads were washed three times in the same GST binding buffer. Then the beads were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the supernatants were collected. Immunoblotting was conducted under standard conditions. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and retrotranscribed with a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific). Real-time PCR analyses were performed in triplicate as described previously (33Tan G. Niu J. Shi Y. Ouyang H. Wu Z.-H.

The sequences of gene-specific primers used for quantitative PCR were as follows: GAPDH, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-3′ (reverse); cIAP1, 5′-GTTTCAGGTCTGTCACTGGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGCATACTACCAGATGACCA-3′ (reverse); cIAP2, 5′-TCCTGGATAGTCTACTAACTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′- GCTTCTTGCAGAGAGTTTCTGAA-3′ (reverse); BCL-XL, 5′-GGTCGCATTGTGGCCTTTTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′- TGCTGCATTGTTCCCATAGAG-3′ (reverse); IL-6, 5′-AGCGCCTTCGGTCCAGTTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGGCTGTCTGTGTGGGGCG-3′ (reverse); and IL-8, 5′-TTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTTTA GCACTCCT GGCAAAAC-3′ (reverse). Cells were transfected with plasmids and treated as indicated. Then cells were stained with trypan blue, and live cells were counted with a TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad). Data from three independent experiments were collected and plotted. The results are presented as mean ± S.D. Student’s t test was applied to analyze the significance. p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. TANK has been shown to inhibit TLR-induced NF-κB activation by attenuating TRAF6 polyubiquitination (28Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S. TANK is a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling and is critical for the prevention of autoimmune nephritis.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRAF6 ubiquitination has been reported to mediate genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB activation (15Hinz M. Stilmann M. Arslan S.Ç. Khanna K.K. Dittmar G. Scheidereit C. A cytoplasmic ATM-TRAF6-cIAP1 module links nuclear DNA damage signaling to ubiquitin-mediated NF-κB activation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We reasoned that TANK may also negatively regulate genotoxic NF-κB activation. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed TANK in HEK293T cells and measured NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α and genotoxic agents such as etoposide (VP16), camptothecin (CPT), and doxorubicin. As expected, TANK overexpression significantly decreased genotoxic agent-induced NF-κB activation, as measured by EMSA (Fig. 1A) and luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1B). Consistently, VP16 or CPT-induced IKK activation, IκBα degradation, and RelA/p65 phosphorylation were abrogated in cells overexpressing TANK (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that increased TANK expression diminishes the NF-κB signaling cascade activated by genotoxic stimulation. To further validate the role of TANK in modulating the genotoxic NF-κB signaling pathway in human cells, we took advantage of the recently developed CRISPR-Cas9 gene-targeting tools (34Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W. Marraffini L.A. Zhang F. Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems.Science. 2013; 339: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (10051) Google Scholar) and generated two TANK-targeting CRISPR constructs harboring distinct sgRNAs as reported previously (31Ran F.A. Hsu P.D. Wright J. Agarwala V. Scott D.A. Zhang F. Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 2281-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (6455) Google Scholar). We found both TANK-targeting CRISPR constructs effectively disrupted TANK gene expression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1E, lanes 4–6 and 10–12), to which we hereafter refer as TANK KO cells. Accordingly, TANK deletion significantly enhanced NF-κB activation by VP16 or CPT, which can be attenuated by reconstitution of TANK in TANK KO cells (Fig. 1E). In addition to chemotherapeutic drugs, ionizing radiation-induced NF-κB activation was also attenuated or escalated in cells overexpressing TANK or with TANK deletion, respectively (Fig. 1F). To further confirm the results from TANK KO cells, we used siRNA to knock down TANK in HEK293T cells. Consistently, suppression of TANK expression by siRNA also substantially enhanced NF-κB activation by genotoxic drugs (Fig. 1G). Moreover, NF-κB-dependent transcription upon DNA damage was further enhanced in TANK KO cells, which could be attenuated by overexpressing TANK (Fig. 1H). Taken together, our data indicate that TANK is a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling cascade in cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Previous studies have indicated that TANK-associated TBK1 could inhibit NF-κB signaling by phosphorylating the canonical IKK complex (35Clark K. Peggie M. Plater L. Sorcek R.J. Young E.R. Madwed J.B.

We found that pharmacological inhibition of TBK1 with amlexanox did not affect TANK-dependent inhibition of genotoxic NF-κB activation (data not shown), suggesting that additional TANK-associated partners may be involved in TANK-mediated NF-κB inhibition. The association between TANK and NEMO has been reported previously (37Chariot A. Leonardi A. Muller J. Bonif M. Brown K. Siebenlist U.

Moreover, TANK has also been identified as a MCPIP1-associated protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (38Rual J.F. Venkatesan K. Hao T. Hirozane-Kishikawa T. Dricot A. Li N. Berriz G.F. Gibbons F.D.

https://openalex.org/W2056463155,"WISP1/CCN4 (hereafter referred to as WISP1), a member of the CCN family, is found in mineralized tissues and is produced by osteoblasts and their precursors. In this study, Wisp1-deficient (Wisp1(-/-)) mice were generated. Using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, we showed that by 3 months, the total bone mineral density of Wisp1(-/-) mice was significantly lower than that of WT mice. Further investigation by micro-computed tomography showed that female Wisp1(-/-) mice had decreased trabecular bone volume/total volume and that both male and female Wisp1(-/-) mice had decreased cortical bone thickness accompanied by diminished biomechanical strength. The molecular basis for decreased bone mass in Wisp1(-/-) mice arises from reduced bone formation likely caused by osteogenic progenitors that differentiate poorly compared with WT cells. Osteoclast precursors from Wisp1(-/-) mice developed more tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells in vitro and in transplants, suggesting that WISP1 is also a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation. When bone turnover (formation and resorption) was induced by ovariectomy, Wisp1(-/-) mice had lower bone mineral density compared WT mice, confirming the potential for multiple roles for WISP1 in controlling bone homeostasis. Wisp1(-/-) bone marrow stromal cells had reduced expression of β-catenin and its target genes, potentially caused by WISP1 inhibition of SOST binding to LRP6. Taken together, our data suggest that the decreased bone mass found in Wisp1(-/-) mice could potentially be caused by an insufficiency in the osteodifferentiation capacity of bone marrow stromal cells arising from diminished Wnt signaling, ultimately leading to altered bone turnover and weaker biomechanically compromised bones."

Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans evaluates variability in its food environment and modifies its future behavior accordingly. We derive a behavioral model that reveals a critical period over which information about the food environment is acquired and predicts future search behavior. We also identify a pair of high-threshold sensory neurons that encode variability in food concentration and the downstream dopamine-dependent circuit that generates appropriate search behavior upon removal from food. Further, we show that CREB is required in a subset of interneurons and determines the timescale over which the variability is integrated. Interestingly, the variability circuit is a subset of a larger circuit driving search behavior, showing that learning directly modifies the very same neurons driving behavior. Our study reveals how a neural circuit decodes environmental variability to generate contextually appropriate decisions."

Based on previous studies showing that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus was neurotropic, induced CNS inflammation and a transient parkinsonism, we examined the neurotropic and inflammatory potential of the CA/09 H1N1 virus in mice. Following intranasal inoculation, we found no evidence for CA/09 H1N1 virus neurotropism in the enteric, peripheral or central nervous systems. We did, however, observe a robust increase in microglial activity in the brain characterized by an increase in the number of activated Iba-1-positive microglia in the substantia nigra (SN) and the hippocampus, despite the absence of virus in the brain. qPCR analysis in SN tissue showed that the induction of microgliosis was preceded by reduced gene expression of the neurotrophic factors bdnf, and gdnf and increases in the immune modulatory chemokine chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (ccl4). We also noted changes in the expression of transforming growth factor-1 (tgfβ1) in the SN starting at 7 days post-infection (dpi) that was sustained through 21 dpi, coupled with increases in arginase-1 (arg1) and csf1, M2 markers for microglia. Given that neuroinflammation contributes to generation and progression of a number of neurodegenerative disorders, these findings have significant implications as they highlight the possibility that influenza and perhaps other non-neurotropic viruses can initiate inflammatory signals via microglia activation in the brain and contribute to, but not necessarily be the primary cause of, neurodegenerative disorders."

Parkin was shown to bind, ubiquitinate, and target depolarized mitochondria for destruction by autophagy.

Two prominent pathological features are associated with the neurological lesions: the appearance of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, Lewy bodies, and defective mitochondria. Lewy bodies are mainly composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (PARK1), whose mutations and duplication/triplication have been linked to familial forms of PD (1.Abou-Sleiman P.M. Muqit M.M. Wood N.W. Expanding insights of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Although Lewy bodies have been a focus of PD pathogenesis for decades, the physiological function of α-synuclein and the underlying cause for its prevalent involvement in PD remain poorly understood. On the other hand, the characterization of genes responsible for other familial forms of PD, including PARKIN (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), and DJ1 (PARK7), have yielded compelling evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key contributing factors to parkinsonism (2.Greene J.C.

As a RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin subsequently catalyzes mitochondrial protein ubiquitination, which results in the recognition and eventual elimination of depolarized mitochondria by autophagy (13.Chan N.C.

Despite the rapid acceptance of the mitophagy model, whether parkin and PINK1 maintain mitochondrial QC solely through this irreversible process remains uncertain. The mitophagy hypothesis also does not provide an effective mechanism to explain the prevalence of α-synuclein aggregation and Lewy bodies in sporadic PD. The identification of a common biological process regulated by these key PARK genes could provide a framework to more accurately understand the molecular events that lead to PD pathogenesis. In this report, we present evidence that in response to moderate mitochondrial stress induced by mitochondrial toxins, parkin does not bind or target mitochondria for destruction; instead it promotes mitochondrial fusion. This morphological remodeling requires parkin ubiquitin E3-ligase activity as well as PINK1 (PARK6). The stress-induced mitochondrial connectivity depends on lysine 63 (K63)-linked, ubiquitination mediated by the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. We identified α-synuclein (PARK1) as a regulatory target of parkin in the mitochondrial stress response. We found that mitochondrial toxin treatments stimulate parkin-α-synuclein interaction and ubiquitination, which recruits synphilin 1, a protein that promotes α-synuclein sequestration to inclusion bodies and suppresses α-synuclein toxicity. Indeed, inactivation of α-synuclein phenocopies parkin expression and suppresses mitochondrial fission induced by mitochondrial stresses. The convergence of parkin, PINK1, and α-synuclein on mitochondrial dynamics not only uncovers a common function of these key PARK genes in the mitochondrial stress response independent of mitophagy but also provides a physiological context for the prevalence of α-synuclein pathology in PD. WT, Mfn1 KO, Mfn2 KO, and Ubc13 KO MEFs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The YFP-Parkin permanent HeLa cells and the Flp-In parental HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and a selection of antibiotics, hygromycin, and Zeocin (Invitrogen), respectively. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Neuron-enriched cultures were generated from cortex of male and female E16.5 CD1 mouse embryos (Charles River Laboratories). Briefly, the cortex was dissected, cells were dissociated with papain (Worthington Biochemicals), and the cell suspension was plated on poly-d-lysine/laminin-coated glass coverslips in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen) and penicillin/streptomycin. Cultures were co-transfected with Parkin-shRNA plasmid and pcDNA3-EGFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) on day in vitro 3. At day in vitro 6, the cells were treated with rotenone, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), or DMSO control for 18 h prior to immunostaining. Primary antibodies used in immunofluorescence were as follows: myc (9E10, mouse monoclonal), cytochrome c (mouse monoclonal; BD Biosciences), Tom20 (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (HA.11, Covance), and FLAG (M2, Sigma). Secondary antibodies used were as follows: Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), goat anti-rabbit Cy5 (Molecular Probes), and Pacific Blue goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Primary antibodies used in immunoblotting were: GFP (Roche), ubiquitin (total; P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ubiquitin (K63-specific; Apu3, Millipore), α-synuclein (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 2462, Cell Signaling), Tim23 (BD Bioscience), GAPDH (Cell Signaling), and parkin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for immunoblotting (Promega). The following plasmids were used: GFP-parkin and mutants, as previously described (14.Lee J.Y. Nagano Y. Taylor J.P.

As each cell type responds differently to CCCP, we tested a range of doses in each cell line used to determine which dose was appropriate for use in this study. We expressed GFP-parkin (or in the case of the M17 cells, we compared control and PARKIN KD and stained for mitochondria using cytochrome c antibodies. We analyzed the mitochondria in control versus parkin-expressing cells to see at which concentration(s) there was a difference in morphology. We also checked for parkin translocation or mitochondrial aggregation/clearance, to confirm “mitophagy inducing” concentrations of CCCP for each cell line. Mitochondrial morphology was quantified, as previously described (17.Karbowski M. Norris K.L. Cleland M.M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Role of Bax and Bak in mitochondrial morphogenesis.Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were divided into three categories: “hyperfused,” where the majority of mitochondria were so interconnected that individual mitochondria were rarely distinguishable, “intermediate,” where mitochondria were interconnected and tubular, but individual mitochondrial units were often distinguishable, and “fragmented,” where mitochondria were mostly short tubules or small, rounded units. 50 cells per condition were quantified in each sample of independent experiments. The average percentage of cells with each type of mitochondrial morphology was plotted ± S.D. or ± S.E. as indicated, and p values were determined using Student's t test. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed, as previously described (17.Karbowski M. Norris K.L. Cleland M.M. Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Role of Bax and Bak in mitochondrial morphogenesis.Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with YFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (mito-YFP) and either control vector or parkin (FLAG-tagged) with or without treatment. The data from each experiment can be shown in two forms: recovery, as plotted in line graph form, or mobile fraction. In the recovery curves, greater increases in normalized fluorescence intensity (y axis) over time in seconds (x axis) represent more interconnected mitochondria. The mobile fraction of the mito-YFP was plotted in bar graphs, with larger mobile fractions representing more interconnected mitochondria. We utilized the mobile fraction graphing method for all of the FRAP experiments, and only showed the line graph in the first instance, Fig. 1C. In each FRAP experiment, 15–20 cells were analyzed per condition per cell type. The average was plotted ± S.E. FRAP experiments were performed in duplicate. In addition to FRAP, we performed quantitative analysis of the mitochondrial network using image analysis in Metamorph. Images were acquired using standardized settings on the confocal microscope, with the laser intensity and brightness (gain) maintained at the same level for all images. Mitochondria were immunostained using cytochrome c antibody. Images were acquired at ×63, and 15–20 cells were analyzed per condition. To obtain the network score, Metamorph software was used to measure the mitochondrial area as well as identify the number of resolvable structures (or individual mitochondrial units). The area was divided by the number of resolvable structures, which gave us a network score (or a quantitative measure of how interconnected the mitochondria were). A higher score represented a more fused mitochondrial network. The average network score was plotted for each cell type under the conditions, as listed, ± S.D. For the α-SYNUCLEIN knockdown, HeLa cells were transfected with a non-targeting, negative siRNA control (Invitrogen) or siRNA targeting human α-SYNUCLEIN (Hs SCNA 1; Qiagen) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). After 96 h, the cells were treated with 1 μm CCCP for an additional 18 h. Then, the coverslips of control and α-SYNUCLEIN KD cells were fixed and immunostained with cytochrome c. The whole cell lysates were also collected for analysis of KD efficiency by immunoblotting. To knockdown PARKIN in primary neuronal cells, cortical neurons were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Parkin-shRNA and pcDNA-EGFP (to detect transfected cells). After 48 h, the cells were treated as indicated. PINK1 KD in YFP-parkin cells was performed by co-transfecting the cells with plasmids encoding a validated human PINK1-shRNA and pcDNA-EGFP for 72 h prior to further treatment. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged parkin (wild type or A240R mutant). 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with CCCP for 18 h. DMSO was used as negative control. Cells were lysed in denaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Following a brief centrifugation, the lysates were diluted 10-fold in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA) supplied with the deubiquitinase inhibitor, N-ethylmaleimide, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). The diluted lysates were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation using the α-synuclein antibody (C20, Santa Cruz). After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips (VWR) in 6-well dishes for 1 day prior to transfection. Treatment with DMSO control, CCCP, or rotenone was performed the following day. Cells were fixed after treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After one wash in ×1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized for 15 min (room temperature) in 0.15% Triton X-100 (diluted in 1× PBS). Next, cells were blocked in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted in 10% BSA. Following primary antibody incubation, cells were washed three times in 1× PBS, then incubated in secondary antibody solution, which was also made with 10% BSA. The incubation in secondary antibody solution was followed by three washes in 1× PBS. Finally, the samples were mounted onto glass slides (VWR) using Fluoromount-G mounting solution (Southern Biotech) for imaging. All images were acquired on a spinning-disk confocal microscope (Leica) using a ×100/1.4–0.70NA oil (Leica Plan Apochromat) objective. Images of fixed cells were acquired at room temperature and processed using the Leica LAS AF program software. FRAP analysis was performed at 37 °C. Image contrast and brightness were adjusted in Photoshop (Adobe). Quantitative recovery data from the FRAP analysis was analyzed in Excel (Microsoft). Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's test was conducted for statistical analysis of all quantitative data. Standard deviation or standard error was used, as labeled. In parkin-expressing cells, treatment with high concentrations of the chemical uncoupler, CCCP (10–25 μm), causes parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria, which are subsequently removed by mitophagy (9.Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F. Youle R.J. Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy.J.

Proteasome and p97 mediate mitophagy and degradation of mitofusins induced by Parkin.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1367-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). As expected, when lower concentrations of CCCP were applied (100 nm-1 μm, see “Experimental Procedures”), no apparent translocation of parkin to mitochondria or mitophagy was observed (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, however, mitochondria in MEFs transiently expressing GFP-Parkin underwent marked elongation and networking, resulting in a hyperfused phenotype (Fig. 1A, arrows; Fig. 1B). This is in stark contrast to mitochondria in parkin-negative MEFs, which underwent fission and displayed a fragmented mitochondrial phenotype upon CCCP treatment (Fig. 1, A, arrowheads, and B), as it was previously reported (19.Legros F. Lombès A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mitochondrial fusion in human cells is efficient, requires the inner membrane potential, and is mediated by mitofusins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). To confirm the morphological phenotype, we devised a mitochondrial “network score,” which was calculated as the mitochondrial area divided by the number of individual mitochondria (Fig. 1C). Indeed, the network score was decreased in parkin-negative MEFs but increased in parkin-positive MEFs upon treatment with low dose CCCP (Fig. 1C). To further quantify the connectivity of the mitochondrial network, we measured FRAP of a mitochondria-targeted YFP (mito-YFP), where connected mitochondria recover fluorescence more rapidly than isolated and fragmented ones. As shown in Fig. 1, E and F, in cells lacking parkin, CCCP treatment caused a significant decrease in fluorescence recovery of mito-YFP (lower mobile fraction) compared with untreated cells, indicative of more fragmented mitochondria. In contrast, CCCP treatment accelerated the fluorescence recovery and significantly increased the mobile fraction in cells expressing parkin (Fig. 1D, purple line, and E). We next asked if parkin-dependent mitochondrial fusion could be activated by mitochondrial toxins and oxidative stresses that are linked to PD. As shown in Fig. 1, F–H, treatment with a low concentration of complex I inhibitor, rotenone (50 nm), also induced mitochondrial fusion in parkin-expressing cells but triggered mitochondrial fragmentation in parkin-negative HeLa cells. Similarly, hydrogen peroxide treatment, which produces reactive oxygen species, induced parkin-dependent mitochondrial fusion as well (Fig. 1I). Altogether, these results show that ectopically expressed parkin promotes mitochondrial connectivity in response to moderate mitochondrial stress. We next investigated whether endogenous parkin could induce mitochondrial fusion in response to mitochondrial and oxidative stressors in primary cortical neurons. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, treatment with low-dose CCCP (20 nm) and rotenone (2 nm) also resulted in mitochondrial elongation in primary neurons. In contrast, the same treatment led to fragmented mitochondria when parkin was knocked down (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar parkin-dependent mitochondrial fusion was observed in a neuronal M17 cell line treated with CCCP, rotenone, and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2E). Taken together with the data in Fig. 1, these findings show that both ectopic and endogenous parkin promote mitochondrial connectivity in response to moderate mitochondrial stress. Mitochondrial fusion is positively regulated by the mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2 (20.Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C.

Mitochondrial fusion in yeast requires the transmembrane GTPase Fzo1p.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To determine whether the parkin-induced hyperfused mitochondrial network requires the mitochondrial fusion machinery, we examined the effect of parkin on mitochondrial connectivity in Mfn2 knock-out (KO) MEFs, which show a fusion deficiency under basal conditions but can undergo fusion when challenged by nutrient starvation (23.Rambold A.S. Kostelecky B. Elia N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Tubular network formation protects mitochondria from autophagosomal degradation during nutrient starvation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2011; 108: 10190-10195Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, expression of GFP-Parkin in Mfn2 KO MEFs did not induce a hyperfused mitochondrial phenotype upon CCCP treatment, a conclusion confirmed by the FRAP-based mitochondrial connectivity assay (Fig. 3C). Similar data were found in Mfn1 KO cells (data not shown). Thus, the mitochondrial fusion machinery is required for the formation of the hyperconnected mitochondrial network induced by parkin and mitochondrial stress. Genetic evidence has indicated that PINK1 and parkin work in the same pathway to maintain mitochondrial integrity (4.Clark I.E. Dodson M.W. Jiang C. Cao J.H. Huh J.R. Seol J.H. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. Guo M. Drosophila pink1 is required for mitochondrial function and interacts genetically with parkin.Nature. 2006; 441: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 5.Park M.

Ehlers M.D. Plasticity-induced growth of dendritic spines by exocytic trafficking from recycling endosomes.Neuron. 2006; 52: 817-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To determine whether PINK1 is also involved in parkin-mediated mitochondrial morphological remodeling, we inactivated PINK1 by a specific siRNA and assessed CCCP-induced mitochondrial fusion in HeLa cells stably expressing YFP-tagged parkin. As shown in Fig. 4, PINK1 knockdown effectively suppressed parkin-dependent mitochondrial fusion upon treatment with low doses of CCCP. These data indicate that the PINK1-parkin mitochondrial quality control axis also operates to stimulate mitochondrial fusion in response to mitochondrial stress. PARKIN encodes for an ubiquitin E3-ligase. To investigate whether stress-induced mitochondrial fusion requires parkin-mediated ubiquitination, we assessed the PD-associated parkin mutants that are deficient in E3-ligase activity, A240R and T415N. We found that these mutants cannot promote a hyperfused mitochondrial phenotype upon rotenone (Fig. 5, A and B) or CCCP treatment (data"

Here, we applied a computational framework to behavioral and fMRI data from human participants performing a consensus decision-making task with up to five other participants. We found that participants reached consensus decisions through integrating their own preferences with information about the majority group members' prior choices, as well as inferences about how much each option was stuck to by the other people. These distinct decision variables were separately encoded in distinct brain areas-the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction, and intraparietal sulcus-and were integrated in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings provide support for a theoretical account in which collective decisions are made through integrating multiple types of inference about oneself, others, and environments, processed in distinct brain modules."
https://openalex.org/W1997005713,"The human MPV17-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is an inherited autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the inner mitochondrial membrane protein MPV17. Although more than 30 MPV17 gene mutations were shown to be associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, the function of MPV17 is still unknown. Mice deficient in Mpv17 show signs of premature aging. In the present study, we used electrophysiological measurements with recombinant MPV17 to reveal that this protein forms a non-selective channel with a pore diameter of 1.8 nm and located the channel's selectivity filter. The channel was weakly cation-selective and showed several subconductance states. Voltage-dependent gating of the channel was regulated by redox conditions and pH and was affected also in mutants mimicking a phosphorylated state. Likewise, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and the cellular production of reactive oxygen species were higher in embryonic fibroblasts from Mpv17−/− mice. However, despite the elevated Δψm, the Mpv17-deficient mitochondria showed signs of accelerated fission. Together, these observations uncover the role of MPV17 as a Δψm-modulating channel that apparently contributes to mitochondrial homeostasis under different conditions. Background: MPV17 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein with unknown function. Results: Recombinant human MPV17 shows highly regulated channel-forming activity; the mitochondrial membrane potential and the reactive oxygen species formation were elevated in embryonic fibroblasts from Mpv17−/− mice. Conclusion: MPV17 functions as a non-selective channel modulating the membrane potential to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis. Significance: Our data are important for understanding the role of MPV17 protein under physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2064540468,"Bmp6 is the main activator of hepcidin, the liver hormone that negatively regulates plasma iron influx by degrading the sole iron exporter ferroportin in enterocytes and macrophages. Bmp6 expression is modulated by iron but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Although hepcidin is expressed almost exclusively by hepatocytes (HCs), Bmp6 is produced also by non-parenchymal cells (NPCs), mainly sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). To investigate the regulation of Bmp6 in HCs and NPCs, liver cells were isolated from adult wild type mice whose diet was modified in iron content in acute or chronic manner and in disease models of iron deficiency (Tmprss6 KO mouse) and overload (Hjv KO mouse). With manipulation of dietary iron in wild-type mice, Bmp6 and Tfr1 expression in both HCs and NPCs was inversely related, as expected. When hepcidin expression is abnormal in murine models of iron overload (Hjv KO mice) and deficiency (Tmprss6 KO mice), Bmp6 expression in NPCs was not related to Tfr1. Despite the low Bmp6 in NPCs from Tmprss6 KO mice, Tfr1 mRNA was also low. Conversely, despite body iron overload and high expression of Bmp6 in NPCs from Hjv KO mice, Tfr1 mRNA and protein were increased. However, in the same cells ferritin L was only slightly increased, but the iron content was not, suggesting that Bmp6 in these cells reflects the high intracellular iron import and export. We propose that NPCs, sensing the iron flux, not only increase hepcidin through Bmp6 with a paracrine mechanism to control systemic iron homeostasis but, controlling hepcidin, they regulate their own ferroportin, inducing iron retention or release and further modulating Bmp6 production in an autocrine manner. This mechanism, that contributes to protect HC from iron loading or deficiency, is lost in disease models of hepcidin production."
https://openalex.org/W2071802844,"Pollution, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), may contribute to increased prevalence of asthma. PAH can bind to the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), a transcription factor involved in Th17/Th22 type polarization. These cells produce IL17A and IL-22, which allow neutrophil recruitment, airway smooth muscle proliferation and tissue repair and remodeling. Increased IL-17 and IL-22 productions have been associated with asthma. We hypothesized that PAH might affect, through their effects on AhR, IL-17 and IL-22 production in allergic asthmatics. Activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 16 nonallergic nonasthmatic (NA) and 16 intermittent allergic asthmatic (AA) subjects were incubated with PAH, and IL-17 and IL-22 productions were assessed. At baseline, activated PBMCs from AA exhibited an increased IL-17/IL-22 profile compared with NA subjects. Diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-PAH and Benzo[a]Pyrene (B[a]P) stimulation further increased IL-22 but decreased IL-17A production in both groups. The PAH-induced IL-22 levels in asthmatic patients were significantly higher than in healthy subjects. Among PBMCs, PAH-induced IL-22 expression originated principally from single IL-22- but not from IL-17- expressing CD4 T cells. The Th17 transcription factors RORA and RORC were down regulated, whereas AhR target gene CYP1A1 was upregulated. IL-22 induction by DEP-PAH was mainly dependent upon AhR whereas IL-22 induction by B[a]P was dependent upon activation of PI3K and JNK. Altogether, these data suggest that DEP-PAH and B[a]P may contribute to increased IL22 production in both healthy and asthmatic subjects through mechanisms involving both AhR -dependent and -independent pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2035795167,"CRD-BP/IGF2BP1 has been characterized as an oncofetal RNA binding protein typically highly expressed in embryonic tissues, suppressed in normal adult tissues, but induced in many tumor types. In this study, we show that adult breast tissues express ubiquitous but low levels of CRD-BP protein and mRNA. Although CRD-BP mRNA expression is induced in breast tumor cells, levels remain ∼1000-fold lower than in embryonic tissues. Despite low expression levels, CRD-BP is required for clonogenic growth of breast cancer cells. We reveal that because the most common protein isoform in normal adult breast and breast tumors has an N-terminal deletion (lacking two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains) and is therefore missing antibody epitopes, CRD-BP expression has been under-reported by previous studies. We show that a CRD-BP mutant mouse strain retains expression of the shorter transcript (ΔN-CRD-BP), which originates in intron 2, suggesting that the impact of complete ablation of this gene in mice is not yet known. Either the full-length CRD-BP or the N-terminally truncated version can rescue the clonogenicity of CRD-BP knockdown breast cancer cells, suggesting that clonogenic function is served by either CRD-BP isoform. In summary, although CRD-BP expression levels are low in breast cancer cells, this protein is necessary for clonogenic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2060892505,"Fabrication of vascular networks is essential for engineering three-dimensional thick tissues and organs in the emerging fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, we describe the fabrication of perfusable vascular-like structures by transferring endothelial cells using an electrochemical reaction as well as acceleration of subsequent endothelial sprouting by two stimuli: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and fluidic shear stress. The electrochemical transfer of cells was achieved using an oligopeptide that formed a dense molecular layer on a gold surface and was then electrochemically desorbed from the surface. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), adhered to gold-coated needles (ϕ600 μm) via the oligopeptide, were transferred to collagen gel along with electrochemical desorption of the molecular layer, resulting in the formation of endothelial cell-lined vascular-like structures. In the following culture, the endothelial cells migrated into the collagen gel and formed branched luminal structures. However, this branching process was strikingly slow (>14 d) and the cell layers on the internal surfaces became disrupted in some regions. To address these issues, we examined the effects of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, PMA, and shear stress generated by medium flow. Addition of PMA at an optimum concentration significantly accelerated migration, vascular network formation, and its stabilization. Exposure to shear stress reoriented the cells in the direction of the medium flow and further accelerated vascular network formation. Because of the synergistic effects, HUVECs began to sprout as early as 3 d of perfusion culture and neighboring vascular-like structures were bridged within 5 d. Although further investigations of vascular functions need to be performed, this approach may be an effective strategy for rapid fabrication of perfusable microvascular networks when engineering three-dimensional fully vascularized tissues and organs."

It is hoped that this purification procedure will potentiate functional studies of the complex as well as crystallographic studies of drug binding and provide structural insight into a third class of the bc complex superfamily. Background: Mycobacteria have no soluble cytochrome c; the electron transfer chain involves a Complex III-IV “supercomplex.” Results: Expression of the M. tuberculosis Complex III in M. smegmatis lacking native complex yields a functional hybrid supercomplex. Conclusion: This supercomplex is a dimer of protomers containing two each of hemes A, B, and C. Significance: This is the first purification of respiratory Complex III or IV from Mycobacterium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the etiological agent of tuberculosis, an airborne disease responsible for 1.4 million deaths in 2013. Elimination of tuberculosis is complicated by the ability of the pathogen to survive for extended periods of time in a non-replicating state in granulomas and by the acquisition of mechanisms of resistance to all of the first and second line drugs used thus far. Development of new drugs targeting different pathways and effective against the latent form of the disease is thus a high priority (1.Lechartier B. Rybniker J. Zumla A. Cole S.T.

A new drug that has recently been approved for clinical treatment, bedaquiline, targets the pathogen's ATP synthase enzyme. Although bedaquiline holds great promise for the treatment of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, safety concerns still restrict the use of the drug to cases where other treatments have failed (6.Kakkar A.K.

When the M. tuberculosis QcrB gene product sequence is aligned with bc1 and b6f sequences, all of the resistance-conferring mutations are near the Qp quinone-binding site, leading to the assumption that the IP drugs work by binding in the Qp site, thereby excluding the substrate (9.Pethe K.

This residue aligns with Ala-277 in human cytochrome b; thus, humans (and other vertebrates) have the resistance mutation in the normal state. Other factors are also required for sensitivity, because closely related actinobacteria, such as Mycobacterium smegmatis, have Thr in this position and yet are resistant. Thus, it is not surprising that preclinical studies of lead IP drug candidates have shown low toxicity in vertebrates (8.Abrahams K.A. Cox J.A. Spivey V.L. Loman N.J. Pallen M.J. Constantinidou C.

Both mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 (Complex III) and mycobacterial cytochrome bcc belong to an evolutionarily related superfamily of “cytochrome bc” complexes catalyzing electron transfer from a hydrophobic quinol to a proteinaceous acceptor (13.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Structure and function of cytochrome bc complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The members have three redox cofactor-bearing proteins: cytochrome b, a c-type cytochrome, and an iron-sulfur protein of the Rieske type. The cytochrome b and iron-sulfur protein sequences are evolutionarily related, whereas the c-type cytochromes appear to be unrelated. The superfamily has four major subdivisions differentiated (among other things) by whether the cytochrome b sequences are present on one polypeptide or split into two and the type of c cytochrome (Fig. 1). The most familiar examples are the mitochondrial or proteobacterial cytochrome bc1 complexes and chloroplast or cyanobacterial b6f complexes. For the bc1 complexes, the minimal unit consists of cytochrome b with eight transmembrane helices (TMHs), cytochrome c1 with a single C-terminal TMH, and a Rieske-type high potential Fe2S2 iron-sulfur complex with a single N-terminal TMH. The b6f complexes have cytochrome b sequences split over two subunits. Cytochrome b6 has sequences homologous to the first four TMHs of cyt b, which form a four-helix bundle enclosing the two hemes (green in Fig. 1). Subunit 4 (SUIV) has sequences corresponding to TMHs 5–7 of cyt b (blue-green), including the highly conserved PEWY sequence that lines one side of the quinol-oxidizing Qp site. They have an unrelated c cytochrome (cytochrome f) and a Rieske protein. The b6c1 complexes of firmicutes (Gram-positive organisms with low GC content) typified by Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly Bacillus stearothermophilus) have a short cyt b subunit like b6 (14.Sone N. Tsuchiya N. Inoue M. Noguchi S. Bacillus stearothermophilus qcr operon encoding Rieske FeS protein, cytochrome b6, and a novel-type cytochrome c1 of quinol-cytochrome c reductase.J. Biol.

The three transmembrane helices homologous to SUIV are fused to a cytochrome c, which is not closely related to either mitochondrial cyt c1 or cytochrome f. The cytochrome bcc complexes of GC-rich Gram-positive bacteria (actinobacteria) such as Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, and Rhodococcus have a long cyt b, containing sequences aligning with b6 and SUIV, and a C-terminal extension of about 115 residues (11.Sone N.

The Rieske protein is similar in sequence to the recently solved Rieske protein from Thermus thermophilus but has a long N-terminal extension with apparently three transmembrane helices. There is a diheme c-type cytochrome (cyt cc), with a C-terminal TMH (11.Sone N. Nagata K. Kojima H. Tajima J. Kodera Y. Kanamaru T. Noguchi S. Sakamoto J.

It has been suggested that one cytochrome c domain is the donor for cytochrome oxidase, and the other one is the acceptor from the Rieske protein (11.Sone N. Nagata K. Kojima H. Tajima J. Kodera Y.

Bactericidal activity of an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine using a mouse M. tuberculosis infection model.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e87483Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, disruption of the bcc-aa3 pathway is possible in M. smegmatis but leads to a profound growth impairment (20.Matsoso L.G. Kana B.D. Crellin P.K. Lea-Smith D.J. Pelosi A. Powell D. Dawes S.S. Rubin H. Coppel R.L. Mizrahi V. Function of the cytochrome bc1-aa3 branch of the respiratory network in mycobacteria and network adaptation occurring in response to its disruption.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6300-6308Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The essentiality of the cytochrome bcc in M. tuberculosis, together with the large differences between this menaquinol-oxidizing enzyme of the pathogen and the ubiquinol-oxidizing human mitochondrial bc1 complex, make it a good target for therapeutic intervention to control or eliminate tuberculosis. The genes for the three cytochrome bcc subunits qcrC (cyt cc), qcrA (iron-sulfur protein), and qcrB (cyt b) are organized into the qcr (quinol cytochrome c reductase) operon. The cyt aa3 cytochrome oxidase subunits are encoded by the genes ctaC (Cox2), ctaD (Cox1), and ctaE (Cox3). We report here the purification and initial characterization of a stable supercomplex consisting of the cytochrome bcc of M. tuberculosis and cytochrome aa3 of M. smegmatis, using untagged proteins and methods suitable for purification on a scale large enough to support crystallographic studies. We believe that this is the first reported isolation an untagged Complex III or IV from actinobacteria and the first tagless isolation of a stable Complex III-IV supercomplex from any organism. M. smegmatis ΔqcrCAB (20.Matsoso L.G. Kana B.D. Crellin P.K. Lea-Smith D.J. Pelosi A. Powell D. Dawes S.S. Rubin H. Coppel R.L. Mizrahi V.

The 3775-bp fragment encoding the complete qcrCAB was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from M. tuberculosis genomic DNA using the oligonucleotides with the following sequences: 5′-TCGAAGCTTATCGATATGACGAAACTGGGGTTCACCC-3′ and 5′-CGTACGCTAGTTAACCTAGTGCTCGCCGTCTGGCG-3′ that contain a ClaI and an HpaI restriction site (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was digested with ClaI and HpaI and then inserted into the ClaI and HpaI sites of the Escherichia coli-mycobacteria shuttle expression vector pMV262 to yield pMV262-qcrCAB. The pMV262-qcrCAB was finally transformed by electroporation into M. smegmatis ΔqcrCAB::hyg. The recombinant strain was maintained on kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Antibiotics were omitted from cultures intended for protein purification. Cells were grown in Bacto brand soy tryptic broth supplemented with Tween 80 (0.5 ml/liter), at 30 °C with shaking to maintain oxygenation. Cells were grown from frozen stock in three stages (3 ml, 100 ml, and 6 1L). After the A600 reached ∼1.5, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm KPi, 0.5 mm EDTA, and PMSF and lysed either by two passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i. or by treatment with lysozyme and sonication. After a low speed centrifugation (1000 rpm for 5 min in the JA14 rotor (150 × g at rmax) to remove intact cells, the light yellow membranes were pelleted by centrifuging at 50,000 rpm for 4 h using a Ti70 rotor (257,000 × g). The membranes were resuspended to a concentration of 35 g/liter protein in 50 mm KPi, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm freshly added PMSF and frozen at −80 °C until use. Columns were monitored during the run by absorbance at 280 nm. Elution profiles of cytochromes were determined by scanning spectra from 340 to 470 (in the fraction collector tubes) and either fitting the spectra with a standard Soret peak spectrum or measuring the absorbance difference, 415 − 371 nm. To identify the cytochromes present, portions of selected fractions were diluted and analyzed by recording spectra from 250 to 650 nm before and after reducing with dithionite. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis, scanning the gels for fluorescent cofactors with a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare) as described (21.Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O.

https://openalex.org/W1996096518,"Background The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is an oncogenic multidisciplinary trans-membranous receptor, which is overexpressed in multiple human cancers. Recently, it has been shown that RAGE is also involved in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion. In this study, we investigated the expression levels and prognostic value of RAGE in primary gastric cancers (GC). Methods We investigated RAGE expression in primary GC and paired normal gastric tissue by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (n = 30) and Western blotting analysis (n = 30). Additionally, we performed immunohistochemistry on 180 paraffin-embedded GC specimens, 69 matched normal specimens. Results RAGE was overexpressed in GC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (P＜0.001), and higher RAGE expression significantly correlated with the histological grade (P = 0.002), nodal status(P = 0.025), metastasis status(P = 0.002), and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (P = 0.020). Furthermore, upregulation of RAGE expression is an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model (P = 0.001). Conclusions RAGE Overexpression may be a useful marker to predict GC progression and poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2113617651,"The association between the disease-free interval (DFI) and survival after a locoregional recurrence (LRR) or second primary (SP) breast cancer remains uncertain. The objective of this study is to clarify this association to obtain more information on expected prognosis. Women first diagnosed with early breast cancer between 2003–2006 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. LRRs and SP tumours within five years of first diagnosis were examined. The five-year period was subsequently divided into three equal intervals. Prognostic significance of the DFI on survival after a LRR or SP tumour was determined using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Follow-up was complete until January 1, 2014. A total of 37,278 women was included in the analysis. LRRs or SP tumours were diagnosed in 890 (2,4%) and 897 (2,4%) respectively. Longer DFI was strongly and independently related to an improved survival after a LRR (long versus short: HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48–0.88; medium versus short HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.01). Other factors related to improved survival after LRR were younger age (<70 years) and surgical removal of the recurrence. No significant association was found between DFI and survival after SP tumours. This is the first study to explore the association between the DFI and survival after recurrence in a nationwide population-based cancer registry. The DFI before a LRR is an independent prognostic factor for survival, with a longer DFI predicting better prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2018549507,"Gata3 acts as a master regulator for T helper 2 (Th2) cell differentiation by inducing chromatin remodeling of the Th2 cytokine loci, accelerating Th2 cell proliferation, and repressing Th1 cell differentiation. Gata3 also directly transactivates the interleukin-5 (Il5) gene via additional mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. We herein identified a mechanism whereby the methylation of Gata3 at Arg-261 regulates the transcriptional activation of the Il5 gene in Th2 cells. Although the methylation-mimicking Gata3 mutant retained the ability to induce IL-4 and repress IFNγ production, the IL-5 production was selectively impaired. We also demonstrated that heat shock protein (Hsp) 60 strongly associates with the methylation-mimicking Gata3 mutant and negatively regulates elongation of the Il5 transcript by RNA polymerase II. Thus, arginine methylation appears to play a pivotal role in the organization of Gata3 complexes and the target gene specificity of Gata3."

This study evaluates the predictive value of pre- and posttreatment SCC-Ag levels in patients with cervical cancer who were treated with NACT followed by radical surgery.A total of 286 patients with Stage IB1-IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix who were treated with NACT followed by radical hysterectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The relationship between SCC-Ag levels, the clinicopathologic parameters, the response to NACT and the three-year survival rate was investigated.The levels of SCC-Ag were elevated (>3.5 ng/mL) in 43.8% of patients before NACT, and 13.0% of patients after NACT. Pre- and posttreatment levels of SCC-Ag correlated with the response to NACT (P = 0.010, and P<0.001), deep stromal infiltration (P = 0.041, and P = 0.006), and lymph node status (P<0.001, and P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, the elevated pretreatment level of SCC-Ag was demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for Lymph node metastases (P<0.001). Patients with both pre- and posttreatment SCC-Ag levels ≤3.5 ng/mL showed the best 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 3-year overall survival (OS) compared with patients with either pre- or posttreatment levels >3.5 ng/mL (P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). A multivariate analysis showed that posttreatment SCC-Ag levels were a strong independent predictor of OS (P = 0.001) and DFS (P = 0.012).Elevated pretreatment levels of SCC-Ag (>3.5 ng/mL) indicated a poor response to NACT and a higher risk of lymph node metastases. Elevated posttreatment levels of SCC-Ag were correlated with poor DFS and OS."
https://openalex.org/W2055115047,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer for men in the developed world. Androgen receptor signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate cancer progression. Recent studies show that microRNA miR-124 exerts a tumor suppressive function in prostate cancer. However, the relationship between AR and miR-124 is unclear. In the present study, we found a negative feedback loop between AR and miR-124 expression. On one hand, miR-124 was a positively regulated target gene of the AR, on the other hand, overexpression of miR-124 inhibited the expression of AR. In addition, we found that miR-124-2 and miR-124-3 promoters were hypermethylated in AR-negative PCa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-124 inhibited proliferation rates and invasiveness capacity of PCa cells in vitro, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results support a negative feedback loop between AR and miR-124 expression. Methylation of miR-124-2 and miR-124-3 may serve as a biomarker for AR-negative PCa cells, and overexpression of miR-124 might be of potential therapeutic value for the treatment of PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2064633437,"Salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic acid are two main water-soluble active ingredients from Salvia miltiorrhiza with important pharmacological activities and clinical applications. The interactions between salvianolic acid B (or rosmarinic acid) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence and absence of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) with three different sizes were investigated by using biophysical methods for the first time. Experimental results proved that two components quenched the fluorescence of BSA mainly through a static mechanism irrespective of the absence or presence of Au NPs. The presence of Au NPs decreased the binding constants of salvianolic acid B with BSA from 27.82% to 10.08%, while Au NPs increased the affinities of rosmarinic acid for BSA from 0.4% to 14.32%. The conformational change of BSA in the presence of Au NPs (caused by a noncompetitive binding between Au NPs and drugs at different albumin sites) induced changeable affinity and binding distance between drugs and BSA compared with no Au NPs. The competitive experiments revealed that the site I (subdomain IIA) of BSA was the primary binding site for salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic acid. Additionally, two compounds may induce conformational and micro-environmental changes of BSA. The results would provide valuable binding information between salvianolic acid B (or rosmarinic acid) and BSA, and also indicated that the Au NPs could alter the interaction mechanism and binding capability of drugs to BSA, which might be beneficial to understanding the pharmacokinetics and biological activities of the two drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2031934366,"Background Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) polymorphisms are positively correlated with tumor progression in numerous malignant tumors. However, the association between FGFR4 genetic variants and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been determined. In this study, we investigated the potential associations of FGFR4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with HCC susceptibility and its clinicopathological characteristics. Methodology/Principal Findings Four SNPs in FGFR4 (rs1966265, rs351855, rs2011077, and rs7708357) were analyzed among 884 participants, including 595 controls and 289 patients with HCC. The samples were further analyzed to clarify the associations between these gene polymorphisms and the risk of HCC, and the impact of these SNPs on the susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC. After adjusting for other covariants, HCC patients who carrying at least one A genotype (GA and AA) at rs351855 were observed to have a higher risk of liver cirrhosis compared with those carrying the wild-type genotype (GG) (OR: 2.113, 95% CI: 1.188–3.831). Moreover, the patients with at least one A genotype were particularly showed a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Conclusions Our findings suggest that genetic polymorphism in FGFR4 rs351855 may be associated with the risk of HCC coupled with liver cirrhosis and may markedly increase the AFP level in Taiwanese patients with HCC. In addition, this is the first study that evaluated the risk factors associated with FGFR4 polymorphism variants in Taiwanese patients with HCC."

Because of the many factors involved in signing, it is possible to study the signature from many points of view: graphologists, forensic experts, neurologists and computer vision experts have all examined them. Researchers study written signatures for psychiatric, penal, health and automatic verification purposes. As a potentially useful, multi-purpose study, this paper is focused on the lexical morphology of handwritten signatures. This we understand to mean the identification, analysis, and description of the signature structures of a given signer. In this work we analyze different public datasets involving 1533 signers from different Western geographical areas. Some relevant characteristics of signature lexical morphology have been selected, examined in terms of their probability distribution functions and modeled through a General Extreme Value distribution. This study suggests some useful models for multi-disciplinary sciences which depend on handwriting signatures."
https://openalex.org/W2004710839,"Inhibitor of growth (ING) proteins have multiple functions in the control of cell proliferation, mainly by regulating processes associated with chromatin regulation and gene expression. ING5 has been described to regulate aspects of gene transcription and replication. Moreover deregulation of ING5 is observed in different tumors, potentially functioning as a tumor suppressor. Gene transcription in late G1 and in S phase and replication is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in complex with cyclin E or cyclin A. CDK2 complexes phosphorylate and regulate several substrate proteins relevant for overcoming the restriction point and promoting S phase. We have identified ING5 as a novel CDK2 substrate. ING5 is phosphorylated at a single site, threonine 152, by cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDK2 in vitro. This site is also phosphorylated in cells in a cell cycle dependent manner, consistent with it being a CDK2 substrate. Furthermore overexpression of cyclin E/CDK2 stimulates while the CDK2 inhibitor p27KIP1 represses phosphorylation at threonine 152. This site is located in a bipartite nuclear localization sequence but its phosphorylation was not sufficient to deregulate the subcellular localization of ING5. Although ING5 interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, we could not establish p53-dependent regulation of cell proliferation by ING5 and by phospho-site mutants. Instead we observed that the knockdown of ING5 resulted in a strong reduction of proliferation in different tumor cell lines, irrespective of the p53 status. This inhibition of proliferation was at least in part due to the induction of apoptosis. In summary we identified a phosphorylation site at threonine 152 of ING5 that is cell cycle regulated and we observed that ING5 is necessary for tumor cell proliferation, without any apparent dependency on the tumor suppressor p53."
https://openalex.org/W2014325455,"In the exchange of metabolites and ions between the mitochondrion and the cytosol, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a key element, as it forms the major transport pathway for these compounds through the mitochondrial outer membrane. Numerous experimental studies have promoted the idea that VDAC acts as a regulator of essential mitochondrial functions. In this study, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, free-energy calculations, and electrophysiological measurements, we investigated the transport of ions through VDAC, with a focus on phosphate ions and metabolites. We showed that selectivity of VDAC towards small anions including monovalent phosphates arises from short-lived interactions with positively charged residues scattered throughout the pore. In dramatic contrast, permeation of divalent phosphate ions and phosphate metabolites (AMP and ATP) involves binding sites along a specific translocation pathway. This permeation mechanism offers an explanation for the decrease in VDAC conductance measured in the presence of ATP or AMP at physiological salt concentration. The binding sites occur at similar locations for the divalent phosphate ions, AMP and ATP, and contain identical basic residues. ATP features a marked affinity for a central region of the pore lined by two lysines and one arginine of the N-terminal helix. This cluster of residues together with a few other basic amino acids forms a “charged brush” which facilitates the passage of the anionic metabolites through the pore. All of this reveals that VDAC controls the transport of the inorganic phosphates and phosphate metabolites studied here through two different mechanisms."

Because alternative promoter usage appends unique N-terminal peptides to the KalSec14 domain, we used biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to examine the two major products, bKalSec14 and cKalSec14. Promoter B encodes a charged, unstructured peptide, whereas promoter C encodes an amphipathic helix (Kal-C-helix). Both bKalSec14 and cKalSec14 interacted with lipids in PIP strip and liposome flotation assays, with significantly greater binding by cKalSec14 in both assays. Disruption of the hydrophobic face of the Kal-C-helix in cKalSec14KKED eliminated its increased liposome binding.

In this study, we established human normal bronchial epithelial cells (HNBEC) using a defined primary epithelial cell culture medium without transduction of exogenous genes. This system may involve decreased IL-1 signaling and enhanced Wnt signaling in cells. Our data demonstrated that HNBEC exhibited a normal diploid karyotype. They formed well-defined spheres in matrigel 3D culture while cancer cells (HeLa) formed disorganized aggregates. HNBEC cells possessed a normal cellular response to DNA damage and did not induce tumor formation in vivo by xenograft assays. Importantly, we assessed the potential of these cells in toxicity evaluation of the common occupational toxicants that may affect human respiratory system. Our results demonstrated that HNBEC cells are more sensitive to exposure of 10~20 nm-sized SiO2, Cr(VI) and B(a)P compared to 16HBE cells (a SV40-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells).

However, little is known at the genetic level about how sapogenins are biosynthesized in this plant. Using Illumina deep sequencing, 62,341 unigenes were obtained by assembling its transcriptome, and 27,720 unigenes were annotated. Of these, 8,022 unigenes were mapped to 243 specific pathways, and 531 unigenes were identified to be involved in 24 secondary metabolic pathways. 35 enzymes, which were encoded by 79 unigenes, were related to the biosynthesis of steroidal sapogenins in this transcriptome database, covering almost all the nodes in the steroidal pathway. The results of real-time PCR experiments on ten related transcripts (HMGR, MK, SQLE, FPPS, DXS, CAS, HMED, CYP51, DHCR7, and DHCR24) indicated that sapogenins were mainly biosynthesized by the mevalonate pathway. The expression of these ten transcripts in the tuber and leaves was found to be much higher than in the stem. Also, expression in the shoots was low. The nucleotide and protein sequences and conserved domains of four related genes (HMGR, CAS, SQS, and SMT1) were highly conserved between D. composita and D. zingiberensis; but expression of these four genes is greater in D. composita. However, there is no expression of these key enzymes in potato and no steroidal sapogenins are synthesized."

However, the AcpAs of Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecalis were inactive. Both failed to support growth of an E. coli acpP mutant strain. This defect seemed likely because of the helix II sequences of the two AcpAs, which differed markedly from those of the proteins that supported growth. To test this premise, chimeric ACPs were constructed in which L. lactis helix II replaced helix II of E. coli AcpP and vice versa.

https://openalex.org/W1963791889,"Objective To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and prostate cancer (PCa) risk at biopsy in Chinese men. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1,807 consecutive men who underwent initial multicore (≥10) prostate biopsy under transrectal ultrasound guidance between Dec 2004 and Feb 2014. BMI was categorised based on the Asian classification of obesity as follows: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5–22.9 (normal weight), 23–24.9 (overweight), 25–29.9 (moderately obese), and ≥30 kg/m2 (severely obese). The odds ratios (OR) of each BMI category for risk of PCa and high-grade prostate cancer (HGPCa, Gleason score ≥4+3) detection were estimated in crude, age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted models. Prevalence ratios and accuracies of PSA predicted PCa were also estimated across BMI groups. Results In total, PCa was detected by biopsy in 750 (45.4%) men, and HGPCa was detected in 419 (25.4%) men. Compared with men of normal weight, underweight men and obese men were older and had higher prostate specific antigen levels. The risk of overall PCa detection via biopsy presented an obvious U-shaped relationship with BMI in crude analysis. Overall, 50.0%, 37.4%, 45.6% 54.4% and 74.1% of the men in the underweight, normal weight, overweight, moderately obese and severely obese groups, respectively, were diagnosed with PCa via biopsy. In multivariate analysis, obesity was significantly correlated with a higher risk of PCa detection (OR = 1.17, 95%CI 1.10–1.25, P<0.001). However, higher BMI was not correlated with HGPCa detection (OR = 1.03, 95%CI 0.97–1.09, P = 0.29). There were no significant differences in the accuracy of using PSA to predict PCa or HGPCa detection across different BMI categories. Conclusion Obesity was associated with higher risk of PCa detection in the present Chinese biopsy population. No significant association was detected between obesity and HGPCa."
https://openalex.org/W1980153090,"Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial commonly used to disinfect the skin of patients to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections. Because chlorhexidine is not sporicidal, it is not anticipated that it would have an impact on skin contamination with Clostridium difficile, the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea. However, although chlorhexidine is not sporicidal as it is used in healthcare settings, it has been reported to kill spores of Bacillus species under altered physical and chemical conditions that disrupt the spore's protective barriers (e.g., heat, ultrasonication, alcohol, or elevated pH). Here, we tested the hypothesis that similarly altered physical and chemical conditions result in enhanced sporicidal activity of chlorhexidine against C. difficile spores.C. difficile spores became susceptible to heat killing at 80 °C within 15 minutes in the presence of chlorhexidine, as opposed to spores suspended in water which remained viable. The extent to which the spores were reduced was directly proportional to the concentration of chlorhexidine in solution, with no viable spores recovered after 15 minutes of incubation in 0.04%-0.0004% w/v chlorhexidine solutions at 80 °C. Reduction of spores exposed to 4% w/v chlorhexidine solutions at moderate temperatures (37 °C and 55 °C) was enhanced by the presence of 70% ethanol. However, complete elimination of spores was not achieved until 3 hours of incubation at 55 °C. Elevating the pH to ≥9.5 significantly enhanced the killing of spores in either aqueous or alcoholic chlorhexidine solutions.Physical and chemical conditions that alter the protective barriers of C. difficile spores convey sporicidal activity to chlorhexidine. Further studies are necessary to identify additional agents that may allow chlorhexidine to reach its target within the spore."

This phenomenon is likely due to progressive loss of one of the key enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for dopamine in the basal ganglia: aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). We have developed a gene therapy based on an adeno-associated virus encoding human AADC (AAV2-hAADC) infused into the Parkinsonian striatum. Although no adverse clinical effects of the AAV2-hAADC gene therapy have been observed so far, the ability to more precisely regulate transgene expression or transgene product activity could be an important long-term safety feature. The present study was designed to define pharmacological regulation of the functional activity of AAV2-hAADC transgene product by manipulating L-DOPA and carbidopa (AADC inhibitor) administration in hemi-parkinsonian rats. Thirty days after unilateral striatal infusion of AAV2-hAADC, animals displayed circling behavior and acceleration of dopamine metabolism in the lesioned striatum after administration of a low dose of L-DOPA (5 mg/kg) co-administered with 1.25 mg/kg of carbidopa. This phenomenon was not observed in control AAV2-GFP-treated rats. Withdrawal of carbidopa from a daily L-DOPA regimen decreased the peripheral L-DOPA pool, resulting in almost total loss of L-DOPA-induced behavioral response in AAV2-hAADC rats and a significant decline in striatal dopamine turnover. The serum L-DOPA level correlated with the magnitude of circling behavior in AAV2-hAADC rats. Additionally, AADC activity in homogenates of lesioned striata transduced by AAV2-AADC was 10-fold higher when compared with AAV2-GFP-treated control striata, confirming functional transduction. Our data suggests that the pharmacological regulation of circulating L-DOPA might be effective in the controlling of function of AAV2-hAADC transgene product in PD gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1980974986,"Polycystin-2 (PC2), encoded by the PKD2 gene, is mutated in ~15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Filamins are actin-binding proteins implicated in scaffolding and membrane stabilization. Here we studied the effects of filamin on PC2 stability using filamin-deficient human melanoma M2, filamin-A (FLNA)-replete A7, HEK293 and IMCD cells together with FLNA siRNA/shRNA knockdown (KD). We found that the presence of FLNA is associated with higher total and plasma membrane PC2 protein expression. Western blotting analysis in combination with FLNA KD showed that FLNA in A7 cells represses PC2 degradation, prolonging the half-life from 2.3 to 4.4 hours. By co-immunoprecipitation and Far Western blotting we found that the FLNA C-terminus (FLNAC) reduces the FLNA-PC2 binding and PC2 expression, presumably through competing with FLNA for binding PC2. We further found that FLNA mediates PC2 binding with actin through forming complex PC2-FLNA-actin. FLNAC acted as a blocking peptide and disrupted the link of PC2 with actin through disrupting the PC2-FLNA-actin complex. Finally, we demonstrated that the physical interaction of PC2-FLNA is Ca-dependent. Taken together, our current study indicates that FLNA anchors PC2 to the actin cytoskeleton through complex PC2-FLNA-actin to reduce degradation and increase stability, and possibly regulate PC2 function in a Ca-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2004147341,"The objective of this study was to clarify the effects of disease on neurally mediated syncope (NMS) during an acute stress reaction. We analyzed the mechanism of the molecular interaction and the polymorphisms of the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor (α2B-AR) gene as the potential psychiatric cause of incentive stress. We focused on the following three genotypes of the repeat polymorphism site at Glu 301–303 in the α2B-AR gene: Glu12/12, Glu12/9, and Glu9/9. On the basis of our clinical research, NMS is likely to occur in people with the Glu12/9 heterotype. To verify this, we assessed this relationship with the interaction of Gi protein and adenylate cyclase by in silico analysis of the Glu12/9 heterotype. By measuring the difference in the dissociation time of the Gi-α subunit twice, we found that the Glu12/9 heterotype suppressed the action of adenylate cyclase longer than the Glu homotypes. As this difference in the Glu repeat number effect is thought to be one of the causes of NMS, we investigated the evolutionary significance of the Glu repeat number. Glu8 was originally repeated in simians, while the Glu12 repeats occurred over time during the evolution of bipedalism in humans. Taken with the Glu12 numbers, NMS would likely become a defensive measure to prevent significant blood flow to the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2013054954,"To study private costs and other determinants of access to healthcare for childhood fevers in rural Tanzania.A case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to establish factors that determine access to a health facility in acute febrile illnesses in children less than 5 years of age. Carers of eligible children were interviewed in the community; cases were represented by patients who went to a facility and controls by those who did not. A Household Wealth Index was estimated using principal components analysis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to understand the factors which influenced attendance of healthcare facility including severity of the illness and household wealth/socio-demographic indicators. To complement the data on costs from community interviews, a hospital-based study obtained details of private expenditures for hospitalised children under the age of 5.Severe febrile illness is strongly associated with health facility attendance (OR: 35.76, 95%CI: 3.68-347.43, p = 0.002 compared with less severe febrile illness). Overall, the private costs of an illness for patients who went to a hospital were six times larger than private costs of controls ($5.68 vs. $0.90, p<0.0001). Household wealth was not significantly correlated with total costs incurred. The separate hospital based cost study indicated that private costs were three times greater for admissions at the mission versus public hospital: $13.68 mission vs. $4.47 public hospital (difference $ 9.21 (95% CI: 7.89 -10.52), p<0.0001). In both locations, approximately 50% of the cost was determined by the duration of admission, with each day in hospital increasing private costs by about 12% (95% CI: 5% - 21%).The more severely ill a child, the higher the probability of attending hospital. We did not find association between household wealth and attending a health facility; nor was there an association between household wealth and private cost."
https://openalex.org/W2331501398,"The path that humans take while walking to a goal is the result of a cognitive process modulated by the perception of the environment and physiological constraints. The path shape and timing implicitly embeds aspects of the architecture behind this process. Here, locomotion paths were investigated during a simple task of walking to and from a goal, by looking at the evolution of the position of the human on a horizontal (x,y) plane. We found that the path while walking to a goal was not the same as that while returning from it. Forward-return paths were systematically separated by 0.5-1.9m, or about 5% of the goal distance. We show that this path separation occurs as a consequence of anticipating the desired body orientation at the goal while keeping the target in view. The magnitude of this separation was strongly influenced by the bearing angle (difference between body orientation and angle to goal) and the final orientation imposed at the goal. This phenomenon highlights the impact of a trade-off between a directional perceptual apparatus—eyes in the head on the shoulders—and and physiological limitations, in the formation of human locomotion paths. Our results give an insight into the influence of environmental and perceptual variables on human locomotion and provide a basis for further mathematical study of these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2007286427,"We examined the relationship between training regimen and fluid intelligence in the learning of a complex video game. Fifty non-game-playing young adults were trained on a game called Space Fortress for 30 hours with one of two training regimens: 1) Hybrid Variable-Priority Training (HVT), with part-task training and a focus on improving specific skills and managing task priorities, and 2) Full Emphasis Training (FET) in which participants practiced the whole game to obtain the highest overall score. Fluid intelligence was measured with the Raven’s Progressive Matrix task before training. With FET, fluid intelligence was positively associated with learning, suggesting that intellectual ability played a substantial role in determining individual differences in training success. In contrast, with HVT, fluid intelligence was not associated with learning, suggesting that individual differences in fluid intelligence do not factor into training success in a regimen that emphasizes component tasks and flexible task coordination. By analyzing training effects in terms of individual differences and training regimens, the current study offers a training approach that minimizes the potentially limiting effect of individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W2051196598,"The purpose of this study was to understand the acoustic properties of human vertebral cancellous bone and to study the feasibility of ultrasound-based navigation for posterior pedicle screw fixation in spinal fusion surgery. Fourteen human vertebral specimens were disarticulated from seven un-embalmed cadavers (four males, three females, 73.14 ± 9.87 years, two specimens from each cadaver). Seven specimens were used to measure the transmission, including tests of attenuation and phase velocity, while the other seven specimens were used for backscattered measurements to inspect the depth of penetration and A-Mode signals. Five pairs of unfocused broadband ultrasonic transducers were used for the detection, with center frequencies of 0.5 MHz, 1 MHz, 1.5 MHz, 2.25 MHz, and 3.5 MHz. As a result, good and stable results were documented. With increased frequency, the attenuation increased (P<0.05), stability of the speed of sound improved (P<0.05), and penetration distance decreased (P>0.05). At about 0.6 cm away from the cortical bone, warning signals were easily observed from the backscattered measurements. In conclusion, the ultrasonic system proved to be an effective, moveable, and real-time imaging navigation system. However, how ultrasonic navigation will benefit pedicle screw insertion in spinal surgery needs to be determined. Therefore, ultrasound-guided pedicle screw implantation is theoretically effective and promising."
https://openalex.org/W2067175745,"Ezrin, a member of the ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) protein family, is an Actin-plasma membrane linker protein mediating cellular integrity and function. In-vivo study of such interactions is a complex task due to the presence of a large number of endogenous binding partners for both Ezrin and Actin. Further, C-terminal actin binding capacity of the full length Ezrin is naturally shielded by its N-terminal, and only rendered active in the presence of Phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) or phosphorylation at the C-terminal threonine. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for the design, expression and purification of constructs, combining the Ezrin C-terminal actin binding domain, with functional elements such as fusion tags and fluorescence tags to facilitate purification and fluorescence microscopy based studies. For the first time, internal His tag was employed for purification of Ezrin actin binding domain based on in-silico modeling. The functionality (Ezrin-actin interaction) of these constructs was successfully demonstrated by using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy. This design can be extended to other members of the ERM family as well."
https://openalex.org/W2077460541,"Nowadays, although automatic speech recognition has become quite proficient in recognizing or transcribing well-prepared fluent speech, the transcription of speech that contains many disfluencies remains problematic, such as spontaneous conversational and lecture speech. Filled pauses (FPs) are the most frequently occurring disfluencies in this type of speech. Most recent studies have shown that FPs are widely believed to increase the error rates for state-of-the-art speech transcription, primarily because most FPs are not well annotated or provided in training data transcriptions and because of the similarities in acoustic characteristics between FPs and some common non-content words. To enhance the speech transcription system, we propose a new automatic refinement approach to detect FPs in British English lecture speech transcription. This approach combines the pronunciation probabilities for each word in the dictionary and acoustic language model scores for FP refinement through a modified speech recognition forced-alignment framework. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Reith Lectures speech transcription task, in which only imperfect training transcriptions are available. Successful results are achieved for both the development and evaluation datasets. Acoustic models trained on different styles of speech genres have been investigated with respect to FP refinement. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, speech transcription performance has also been examined using systems built on training data transcriptions with and without FP refinement."
https://openalex.org/W2009948244,"Bronchial asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory condition with high morbidity, and effective treatments for asthma are limited. Allergen-specific immunotherapy can only induce peripheral immune tolerance and is not sustainable. Exploring new therapeutic strategies is of great clinical importance. Recombinant adenovirus (rAdV) was used as a vector to make cells expressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-immunoglobulin (CTLA4Ig) a soluble CTLA4 immunoglobulin fusion protein. Dendritic cells (DCs) were modified using the rAdVs together with allergens. Then these modified DCs were transplanted to mice before allergen sensitization. The persistence and specificity of immune tolerance were evaluated in mice challenged with asthma allergens at 3 and 7 months. DCs modified by CTLA4Ig showed increased IL-10 secretion, decreased IL-12 secretion, and T cell stimulation in vitro. Mice treated with these DCs in the early neonatal period developed tolerance against the allergens that were used to induce asthma in the adult stage. Asthma symptoms, lung damage, airway reactivity, and inflammatory response all improved. Humoral immunity indices showed that this therapeutic strategy strongly suppressed mice immune responses and was maintained for as long as 7 months. Furthermore, allergen cross-sensitization and challenge experiments demonstrated that this immune tolerance was allergen-specific. Treatment with CTLA4Ig modified DCs in the early neonatal period, inducing persistent and allergen-specific immune tolerance to asthma in adult mice. Our results suggest that it may be possible to develop a vaccine for asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2026141474,"Although lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) play an important role in cellular signaling in addition to lipid biosynthesis, little is thus far known about parasite LPPs. In this study, we characterized three Eimeria tenella cDNA clones encoding LPP named EtLPP1, EtLPP2 and EtLPP3. Key structural features previously described in LPPs, including the three conserved domains proposed as catalytic sites, a single conserved N-glycosylation site, and putative transmembrane domains were discovered in the three resulting EtLPP amino acid sequences. Expression of His6-tagged EtLPP1, -2, and -3 in HEK293 cells produced immunoreactive proteins with variable molecular sizes, suggesting the presence of multiple forms of each of the three EtLPPs. The two faster-migrating protein bands below each of the three EtLPP proteins were found to be very similar to the porcine 35-kDa LPP enzyme in their molecular size and the extent of their N-glycosylation, suggesting that the three EtLPPs are partially N-glycosylated. Kinetic analyses of the activity of the three enzymes against PA, LPA, C1P and S1P showed that Km values for each of the substrates were (in μM) 284, 46, 28, and 22 for EtLPP1; 369, 179, 237, and 52 for EtLPP2; and 355, 83, and 260 for EtLPP3. However, EtLPP3 showed negligible activity on S1P. These results confirmed that the three EtLPPs have broad substrate specificity. The results also indicated that despite structural similarities, the three EtLPPs may play distinct functions through their different models of substrate preference. Furthermore, particularly high expression levels of the three EtLPP genes were detected in the sporozoite stage of the E. tenella life cycle (p<0.001), suggesting that their encoded proteins might play an important biological function in the sporozoite stage."
